Billy Vunipola left the field just before half-time in evident pain, unable to put any pressure on his right knee. With England due to gather in Oxford on Sunday for a three-day camp in advance of the November internationals, the timing is particularly unfortunate, for player, club and country. And all this after a return last week from the injury that had cost him his place on the Lions tour. Early indications, too, were that he was back in fine fettle. Vunipola went down just before the break, his knee caught in an awkward position as he helped his team-mates defend a maul on their tryline. Saracens saw off the threat without too much trouble, gradually forcing Sale back with each collision until Juan Figallo won a relieving penalty, but then the true extent of the damage became apparent, Vunipola clearly in much distress and helped off the field after a few minutes’ treatment. “We don’t know how bad it is yet,” said Mark McCall, Saracens’ director of rugby, of this latest setback. “He’s off getting a scan now. We pray and hope it’s not as bad as it looks. It’s cruel luck, and we obviously feel for him terribly.” Otherwise this was a pain-free assignment for Saracens, returning from their Stateside jaunt without missing so much as a beat. They burst into the game, then bade their time before burying Sale in the second half. The Sharks’ problems started even before the game had. Their fly-half, AJ MacGinty, the one player they did not have a like-for-like replacement for, fell ill, so Faf de Klerk moved out a step to 10, with Will Cliff brought in to play scrum-half. Not that Saracens were unaffected by disruption themselves. Even before Vunipola’s withdrawal, their back row had suffered. Mike Rhodes’s shoulder, on which he had an operation this summer, continues to cause him strife and Saracens do not expect to see him back for 12 weeks. With him unavailable Maro Itoje moved to the blindside and the rising youngster Nick Isiekwe, capped in Argentina, stepped into the engine room. It was fairly obvious, even before the exhibition to follow, that Saracens’ resources were better able to handle their disruption than Sale’s theirs. Sale were on the back foot from the off. The Vunipola boys were looking in good nick, Billy loosening up with some hefty early carries, and the pianists behind were in tune, Alex Goode releasing Liam Williams for a run down the left before Ben Spencer dummied and waltzed clean through the fringes of a ruck for the game’s first try – in the fourth minute. Before we had entered the 10th Saracens had another, this time Williams finishing, for his first try in Saracens colours, when Spencer went blind from an attacking lineout. And so we settled down for the anticipated rout. But that was it as far as first-half tries went. The theory that precocious, cocky scrum-halfs (is there any other kind?) make excellent fly-halfs was given weight as De Klerk popped up in all manner of awkward positions, probing here with pace, here with a kick, until one such intervention coaxed Marcelo Bosch into a high tackle. De Klerk dusted himself off to land the penalty, just before the half-hour, but Owen Farrell landed one of his own in reply a few minutes later as Saracens resumed their siege, which Sale’s defence were starting to handle with greater authority than they had at the start. Saracens did not let up in the second half. A Farrell penalty extended the lead, before an imperious break from the same man between two dumbstruck front-five forwards set up Spencer for his second try, any lingering doubt about the result comprehensively crushed with a little under half an hour still to run. Then followed the bonus-point try, barely 10 minutes later. Josh Charnley had spilled the ball in the tackle of Sean Maitland, after a scything incursion from the blindside, to cost Sale their first obvious chance of a try, but Saracens resumed normal service, wave after wave of muscular runners from every angle, until Schalk Brits’s inside ball put Vincent Koch over for their fourth. Sale, though, are nothing if not pacy. Charnley may have missed the one clear chance of the first hour, but two tries for Byron McGuigan in the final quarter gave them something at least, both taken with some aplomb in the corner. In between them, though, Nathan Earle finished Saracens’ fifth, worked into the corner with rather more margin for error. There was nothing tight about the game, either – but it may yet take its toll all the same."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/23/more-than-600000-londoners-sign-petition-to-save-uber","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T23:05:29Z","webTitle":"More than 600,000 Londoners sign petition to save Uber","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/23/more-than-600000-londoners-sign-petition-to-save-uber","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/sep/23/more-than-600000-londoners-sign-petition-to-save-uber","fields":{"headline":"More than 600,000 Londoners sign petition to save Uber","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"More than 600,000 people have signed a petition calling for Transport for London to reverse its decision to strip Uber of its licence in the capital, which the company’s chief executive suggested could delay the rollout of electric vehicles and wheelchair-accessible transport. The Observer also understands that 20,000 Uber drivers have emailed the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, who defended TfL’s decision on Saturday amid a growing backlash. “I know that Uber has become a popular service for many Londoners – but it would be wrong for TfL to license Uber if there was any way this could pose a threat to Londoners’ safety,” Khan said. “As mayor of London I welcome innovative new companies that help Londoners by providing a better and more affordable service – but providing an innovative service is not an excuse for not following the rules. All companies in London must play by the rules and adhere to the high standards we expect – particularly when it comes to safety.” Unions and Labour MPs have welcomed the decision. Wes Streeting, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on taxis, described it as a “courageous” move. He said: “It finally draws a line in the sand to make it clear that no company, however big and powerful, will be allowed to flout our laws and regulations or jeopardise Londoners’ safety without facing serious consequences.” But an increasing number of customers have expressed dismay at the news. Saturday night the Save Your Uber in London campaign on the Change.org website had gained nearly 600,000 signatures. “That is the fastest-growing petition we’ve seen in the UK this year,” Kajal Odedra, UK director at Change.org, said. TfL took the decision not to renew Uber’s licence for security and safety reasons. But the company, which intends to appeal, is puzzled as to why these issues were not raised during the renewal process. Uber passed its annual compliance audit in April but a series of pre-scheduled meetings with TfL were cancelled. Requests to meet Khan were also rejected. Khan said: “I have every sympathy with Uber drivers and customers, affected by this decision but their anger really should be directed at Uber. They have let down their drivers and customers by failing, in the view of TfL, to act as a fit and proper operator.” The mayor did, though, hint that a compromise could still be on the cards. “I suspect it will take some time before this situation with Uber fully plays out,” Khan said. “In the meantime, I will continue to help support innovative businesses in London and to create a vibrant and safe taxi and private hire market.” The former transport minister Lord Adonis tweeted that there was a need to find a way forward short of banning Uber. “On Uber, right course is for TfL to set out precisely &amp; reasonably what Uber needs to do &amp; give them chance to do it. Then happy Londoners,” he wrote. Uber’s new chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, used a global email to staff to warn that TfL’s decision could “have profound negative consequences for the 40,000 drivers who depend on Uber for work and the 3.5 million Londoners who rely on Uber to get around”. “It’s particularly discouraging that this is happening in the UK, where the team has led the way on partnerships to increase the number of wheelchair-accessible and electric vehicles on the road,” Khosrowshahi said. He acknowledged that globalised businesses could not ignore what happened at the local level: “It really matters what people think of us, especially in a global business like ours, where actions in one part of the world can have serious consequences in another.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/23/trump-attacks-mccain-republicans-healthcare","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T16:51:29Z","webTitle":"Trump attacks McCain and other Republicans over healthcare failure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/23/trump-attacks-mccain-republicans-healthcare","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/23/trump-attacks-mccain-republicans-healthcare","fields":{"headline":"Trump attacks McCain and other Republicans over healthcare failure","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump went on the attack on Twitter on Saturday morning over the latest failure of the Republican-controlled Senate to pass healthcare reform. In a series of tweets starting at 6.42am, the president attacked Senator John McCain, whom he said had “let Arizona down”; goaded wavering Republicans in an attempt to persuade them to come on board; and praised Graham-Cassidy, the current and controversial plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA). On Friday, McCain seemed to quash Republican hopes to push Graham-Cassidy through the Senate before a 30 September deadline, after which it would require a 60-vote super-majority to pass, on the way to making good on a seven-year promise to undo Barack Obama’s signature domestic reform. In a surprise statement, McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, said: “I cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal. I believe we could do better working together, Republicans and Democrats, and have not yet really tried.” McCain joined the Kentucky conservative Rand Paul in stating his intention to vote against the bill. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, moderates who joined McCain in voting down the last attempt at Senate reform, have not confirmed their position, although Collins said on Friday she was “leaning against” it. Republican Senate leadership can only afford to lose two votes to pass Graham-Cassidy before 30 September. At a Friday night rally on behalf of Alabama senator Luther Strange, who is facing a close primary runoff on Tuesday, Trump said McCain’s opposition to the new bill was “totally unexpected” and “terrible”. “It was sad,” the president said. “We had a couple of other senators, but at least we knew where they stood. That was really a horrible thing, honestly. That was a horrible thing that happened to the Republican party.” He amplified his criticism on Saturday, first tweeting: “John McCain never had any intention of voting for this bill, which his Governor [Doug Ducey] loves. He campaigned on Repeal &amp; Replace. Let Arizona down!.” Trump continued: “Arizona had a 116% increase in ObamaCare premiums last year, with deductibles very high. [Senate minority leader] Chuck Schumer sold John McCain a bill of goods. Sad.” Referring to Graham-Cassidy’s proposed transfer of healthcare administration away from the federal government, he added: “Large Block Grants to States is a good thing to do. Better control &amp; management. Great for Arizona. McCain let his best friend LG down!” “LG” was a reference to the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, a close friend of McCain and a co-sponsor of the new bill with Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. The proposal would eliminate the expansion of Medicaid, the federal program that provides access to healthcare for low-income Americans under the ACA. It would also enable states to circumvent ACA requirements for coverage of pre-existing conditions. Trump targeted two other Republicans. “I know Rand Paul and I think he may find a way to get there for the good of the party!” he wrote. The Kentucky senator opposes Graham-Cassidy from the right, believing it leaves too much of the ACA in place. He also tried to win Murkowski round. “Alaska had a 200% plus increase in premiums under ObamaCare, worst in the country. Deductibles high, people angry! Lisa M comes through,” Trump wrote. Murkowski has been viewed as the GOP skeptic most likely to change her vote. Republican leaders reportedly promised huge concessions for Alaska. Despite Trump’s tweets, efforts to pass Graham-Cassidy by the end of the month have stalled. On Friday Senator Joni Ernst, of Iowa, admitted: “I’ll be honest, it seems unlikely that we’ll be voting on this.” The result is that any healthcare legislation in the near future is likely to be far more modest in scope and will require bipartisan support to reach the 60-vote supermajority needed to avoid a filibuster. There are currently 52 Republican senators and 48 Democrats and allied independents."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/23/uber-transport-for-london-tfl-drivers-hardship-sadiq-khan-supports-ban","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T23:05:29Z","webTitle":"Why Uber’s fate could herald backlash against ‘digital disruptors’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/23/uber-transport-for-london-tfl-drivers-hardship-sadiq-khan-supports-ban","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/sep/23/uber-transport-for-london-tfl-drivers-hardship-sadiq-khan-supports-ban","fields":{"headline":"Why Uber’s fate could herald backlash against ‘digital disruptors’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Giuliana Ingegneri is worried about her father, Adriano. Since December he has combined his job as an Uber driver with stints at the family business. But on Friday, Transport for London’s bombshell announcement that the technology giant’s licence will not be renewed in the capital sent shockwaves through the Ingegneris’ Tooting home. “My dad helps out with the family carpet cleaning business so the flexible hours work well for him,” said Giuliana, 16. “He also has diabetes so it’s important he can work when he wants so he can attend his medical appointments. Sometimes he will work 20 hours a day and earn around £300 and on others he will only make £8 a day.” Like many of the drivers’ families who now face financial hardship as a result of the decision, Giuliana worries about their future. “We also rely on his Uber work to buy supplies to provide our carpet cleaning service so if that goes I don’t know what we’ll do. This will put a massive strain on the economy and Transport for London as well as families of Uber drivers. Now it’s a chasing game to find a job for the thousands of drivers who will be out of work.” A backlash against the decision and the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, who has endorsed it, is growing. Yesterday evening more than 500,000 people had signed a petition calling for it to be overturned. “I’ve supported Sadiq Khan fully since the beginning but he has totally misjudged the mood, and needs, of Londoners on this one,” explained one Guardian website user, Rhianne from south-east London. “Combined with overpriced, unreliable, non air-conditioned, chronically overcrowded public transport and London fast becoming a gated community, this feels like another kick in the teeth for normal people. And I am sure it really does for 40,000 Uber drivers trying to make a decent living in one of the most expensive cities in the world.” The trade minister, Greg Hands, and several rightwing thinktanks have come out fighting for the controversial company that is seen as the ultimate disrupter – the noun given to the new wave of technology firms that threaten to dismantle established industries. In the mind of many Uber supporters, the Transport for London (TfL) decision – coming a few days before Khan’s appearance at the Labour party conference – revealed an organisation in thrall to established labour interests. Sources told the Observer that the decision was communicated to Uber only two minutes before it was announced and that there had been only one meeting in the last year between the company and the senior team at TfL who insisted that the licence renewal could not be discussed. “TfL has once again caved into pressure from unions who never miss an opportunity to rip off passengers,” said Alex Wild, research director at the rightwing pressure group Taxpayers’ Alliance. The pushback against the laissez-faire philosophy of the US west coast’s tech community is being waged on both sides of the Atlantic. In the US, calls to regulate technology companies have made strange bedfellows of Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren and ex-White House aide and Breitbart chief Steve Bannon. Last week the former chief strategist to Donald Trump reiterated his view that firms such as Facebook and Google should be regulated like “public utilities”. Meanwhile progressives such as Warren warn of the monopolistic behaviour of Google, Amazon, and Apple while pushing for a renewed debate over antitrust laws. “Silicon Valley is going from being heroes to villains,” said Vivek Wadhwa, a distinguished fellow and adjunct professor at Carnegie Mellon University. “It’s been brewing for quite a while, but there’s a big shift happening.” But, still, the speed of this shift has surprised many. “In our wildest dreams we didn’t think TfL would refuse the licence,” said Maria Ludkin, legal director at the GMB union. “We thought they’d attach conditions to make sure Uber would improve passenger and driver safety.” To its critics, Uber’s failure to address these issues is emblematic of a ruthless, unyielding corporate culture that flowed from the top and never seemed to learn from its mistakes. In July, its chief executive, Travis Kalanick, resigned following a series of scandals and criticism of his management style. A month before, a number of staff were sacked after a company investigation into sexual harassment and bullying. In the UK there were concerns that the company had failed to report assault allegations against its drivers to police. In the year to February 2017, there were 48 sexual offences where Uber was referenced in a crime report for a taxi and private hire journey in London – a 50% rise on reports in the previous year. But these figures tell only part of the story. Many customers say they choose Uber because they trust it with their personal safety. “A lot of passengers praise Uber because they feel safe and you know the driver that is taking you,” said Abdul, a driver from Shepherd’s Bush who worries that he won’t be able to pay his student loan or his rent if TfL does not reverse its decision. Ironically, while many drivers like Abdul have leapt to Uber’s defence, it was the company’s treatment of them that drew attention to the aggressive corporate culture which brought about its downfall in the capital. Last October, following a case brought by the GMB that has wide-ranging implications for all companies in the gig economy, an employment tribunal ruled that Uber’s UK drivers should be classed as workers rather than as self-employed. “We’d had an epidemic of companies saying their people are self-employed when in fact, when you examine their rights and responsibilities, the way they’re acting each day, it’s pretty clear they’re either fully employed or are workers entitled to sickness pay, etc,” Ludkin said. “We brought the Uber case because we had so many drivers coming to us. We looked at their contracts and thought it was a ludicrous idea that 30,000 of them were self-employed, which was Uber’s position.” Uber responded with a ferocity that it is now likely to employ in the courts fighting TfL’s decision, bringing an appeal that will be heard this week. During the tribunal, further examples of Uber’s aggressive corporate culture surfaced. “The last thing they want is their drivers checking out and going home during rush hour,” Ludkin said. “So they introduced incentives to their apps – just as the drivers were logging off they’d be offered runs they knew those drivers really wanted, like airport runs. At the same time we were hearing rumblings from the Met police about a massive increase in accidents involving Uber drivers and lots of them had been driving excessive hours.” Ludkin believes Uber’s intention was to swamp the market to put black cabs out of business, a claim rejected by Uber. “Uber is a genius company in terms of technology, there’s no question about that,” Ludkin said. “But when you step back and think about what’s the over-riding business model for Uber, it’s not a company that’s making any money. Rather, it’s a company that’s got a huge amount of money invested in it, like Amazon. For years Amazon didn’t make any money; what they did was eventually overwhelm the marketplace. They destroyed all competition and then made shedloads of money, exactly the tactics going on at Uber.” It was the Met’s concerns about Uber that are thought to have heavily influenced TfL’s decision. In citing the company’s failure to “demonstrate a lack of corporate responsibility in relation to a number of issues which have potential public safety and security implications”, TfL also expressed reservations about the use of software called Greyball which it claimed was used to block regulators from gaining full access to the Uber app, something that prevented officials from adequately carrying out their law enforcement duties. Uber’s belief that it could shrug off the threat from regulators was partly born out of a confidence in its formidable network of political contacts. The Daily Mail alleged that under David Cameron, Downing Street lobbied Boris Johnson, then London mayor, to protect the company from onerous regulation. Amid concerns about the relationship between Number 10 and Uber, Rachel Whetstone, the company’s head of policy and communications and a friend of Cameron, resigned. Uber now has 19 days to appeal against TfL’s decision and history suggests that it will find a way back. The company ceased operations in Austin, Texas last year after losing a referendum requiring background checks on its drivers, only to return. Earlier this year, it was banned in Italy after a court upheld a complaint by taxi unions. That ban has since been annulled. Transport sources claim TfL has been surprised by the extent of the backlash against its decision and is making conciliatory noises, suggesting a compromise will be found eventually. Uber, meanwhile, is donning the hairshirt. In a global email to staff late on Friday night, Uber’s new chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, said “the truth is that there is a high cost to a bad reputation” and called for a period of “self reflection”. Kalanick would never have been so penitent. Maybe Uber is growing up. Or maybe it’s had enough of disruption for a while."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/23/shadows-dancing-on-walls-at-labours-brighton-celebration","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T23:05:29Z","webTitle":"The shadows dancing on the walls at Labour’s Brighton celebration | Andrew Rawnsley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/23/shadows-dancing-on-walls-at-labours-brighton-celebration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/23/shadows-dancing-on-walls-at-labours-brighton-celebration","fields":{"headline":"The shadows dancing on the walls at Labour’s Brighton celebration","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Nothing can seem so long ago as the very recent past. It is just two years since Jeremy Corbyn made his debut appearance as leader at his party’s conference. After a career spent on the margins, he was thrust centre stage. Where once his personal conference highlight would be addressing a fringe meeting of the Cuba Solidarity Campaign, he was enthroned in the leader’s seat and still looking a bit bewildered to find himself there. When his friend John McDonnell made his first conference speech as shadow chancellor, also his first as a platform speaker, Mr Corbyn did something I found rather endearing. He took out his phone and started taking photos, as if he would later need evidence that the pair of them hadn’t been dreaming. Many were the predictions then that it couldn’t possibly last, some of those forecasts coming from people who called themselves Mr Corbyn’s friends. Either Labour MPs would get rid of him or he would come to his own conclusion that he wasn’t up to the job. A few of us thought the latter unlikely, but that feeling of contingency persisted. He came to last year’s conference as a leader who had defied a no-confidence motion by his parliamentary party and crushed a leadership challenge and still he did not feel like a man in command of his party. All the chatter at that Liverpool gathering was how soon a general election would come and how atrocious the result would have to be to compel him to quit. Sceptics were sufficiently well represented among the delegates for Tom Watson, the non-Corbynite deputy leader, to be received warmly when he gave a speech extolling Labour to be proud of the achievements of Blair and Brown. There was also applause for a serrated speech by Sadiq Khan about the merits of winning power – a word he used 38 times – “walking the walk as well as talking the talk”. That this has neither been forgotten nor forgiven is illustrated by the shenanigans over whether or not the mayor of London would be allowed a speaking slot from the platform this year. Labour returns to Brighton two years on from Mr Corbyn’s debut as leader with the picture transformed. A figure once widely regarded as a transient curiosity now looks like the most permanent fixture on the British political scene. This will be a conference owned by him and his supporters. As one of the leader’s inner circle put it to me recently, for the first time they expect to have a Labour conference with a Corbynite “orientation”. There will be a record number of delegates in Brighton, a reflection of the ballooning Labour membership, the energy and optimism generated by the election campaign and a belief, whether well founded or not, that they could be on the brink of government. There will also be a huge number of conference first-timers among the delegates. This makes the character of the gathering more unpredictable, but it is a fair assumption that there will be many Corbyn enthusiasts among them and the ideological balance of the conference will be shifted further to the left. Many Labour activists are still basking in the warm glow of the expectations-beating election performance. They also have the satisfaction of seeing elements of the programme that the party pushed during the campaign, notably its stance against tuition fees and austerity, being pressed on to the agenda of a frightened minority Tory government. Labour people can tell themselves that they are winning the battle of ideas, a vital precursor to victory next time around. The Corbyn sceptics in the parliamentary Labour party are still substantial in number, but most have gone mute since June. Roles were reversed by the election result. It is now Theresa May who looks like the contingent leader presiding over a horribly divided party. So much so that Mr Corbyn even feels able to offer her guidance on how to manage the cabinet. A few shadows will dance on the walls of the Brighton conference centre. That unity is a superficial veneer on some divisions that remain profound. The thought that another election could come soon ought to be a deterrent against outbreaks of sectarian score-settling and ideological feuding. Mr Corbyn’s team don’t want this gathering to be defined by blood-letting and have made some compromises to try to prevent splits becoming too manifest during the week. They would like the conference to project Labour as a party ready to govern and the leader as “a prime minister in waiting”. That is a hard look to pull off if the party is indulging in a bout of eye-gouging. Some of his supporters do not appear to have received the “unity” memo. Momentum is planning a protest demanding the resignation of Iain McNicol, the party’s general secretary and a target of the left since he clashed with them over the 2016 leadership contest. The biggest taboo subject in Brighton will be the future of the leader. The senior ranks of the Labour party are holding two ideas in their heads. One thought, the thought that is freely and universally expressed, is that Jeremy Corbyn will remain as leader for as long as he wants to be leader and will take the party into the next election. The other thought, the furtive thought of all those with ambitions to replace him, is that he is 68 and he would be 73 at the next election if the Tories string out this parliament to 2022. Five years is an awfully long time in politics. One Labour figure remarks: “Minds will turn to that if the government doesn’t collapse in the next year. It will be an increasing part of the conversation.” This is the context of the push to change the rules that govern the way Labour elects its leader. A candidate currently requires nominations from 15% of Labour MPs. The conference will be asked to approve a reduction in that hurdle to 10%. This rule change is irrelevant to Mr Corbyn himself. It only matters for when a contest to succeed him takes place and that will, at least officially, not be until he has had many years successfully ruling the nation from Downing Street. The rule change is obviously designed with the thought that things may not work out like that so it needs to be made harder for Labour MPs, who are still largely non-Corbynite, to impede a leftwing succession. The conference will also be asked to sign off on giving three additional seats on the national executive committee to representatives of members. For sure, the left expects to gain factional advantage from this, because most of the membership is currently sympathetic to Corbynism. But it is hard to see how this can be opposed on grounds of principle and Labour moderates would be smart to embrace it. The party’s membership has expanded enormously. At around 570,000 strong, Labour is now one of the largest parties in Europe and there is a compelling case for giving members more of a voice on the party’s ruling body. Mr Corbyn can be legitimately proud to have presided over such an expansion in an age when the mass membership party appeared to have been dying. He derives his power – indeed he owes his survival – to the supporters who first elected him against the wishes of MPs and then re-elected him against the wishes of MPs. He has been a career-long advocate of “empowerment” of members. What he can’t anticipate is all the consequences. One is becoming evident already in the illumination of the big gap between his own Euroscepticism and the passionate pro-European sentiment of many of Labour’s new recruits. Witness the flurry of motions submitted by local Labour parties demanding that the leadership take a tougher position in opposition to Brexit. The largest question hanging over the conference is about the election result and what that truly said about the party’s prospects. Was June really a brilliant performance by Labour? Or was the party the lucky beneficiary of freak circumstances that won’t necessarily be repeated at the next contest. Centrist voices will be heard arguing that it would be wisest to assume that the Tories will learn from their mistakes and Labour should anticipate a much fiercer scrutiny of its offer. From the other end of the spectrum, there are those who contend that Labour’s platform, while further to the left than the party has offered for some decades, wasn’t left wing enough. At last week’s meeting of the NEC, Pete Willsman, one of the most uncompromising Corbynites, voiced the opinion that “it was far too much an SDP manifesto”. Public sector unions will agitate for the conference to go further than the manifesto by committing the party not just to the scrapping of the pay cap, but to inflation plus wage rises for all public sector workers. Whisper it if you dare on the Sussex coast, Labour lost the June election. Some spectacular gains were accompanied by some bad hits in traditional heartlands and the party came in more than 60 seats behind the Tories. That inconvenient truth will be forgotten when Jeremy Corbyn receives the sort of adulatory reception you’d normally expect for a leader who has just swept his party into power with a landslide.

The warning came from Travis Tygart, Usada’s chief executive, who told the Observer that he was disturbed that the International Olympic Committee and the World Anti-Doping Agency appeared to be paving the way for Russia’s inclusion, even though its government was found to have corrupted the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi. The issue will be high on Wada’s list of priorities when its executive committee meets in Paris on Sunday. However, the organisation’s president, Sir Craig Reedie, has already made it clear that calls for a blanket ban on Russia from 28 national anti-doping agencies, including UK Anti-Doping, are “unhelpful”. Tygart believes that Wada needs to resist political pressure from the IOC president, Thomas Bach, and Russia by taking a far tougher stand. “Wada should do exactly what they did before Rio and recommend Russia be banned from the Winter Olympic Games for its institutionalised doping and allow neutral athletes from Russia to compete if they show they are clean,” he said. “Anything less is really a get out of jail free card and sends a terrible message that to win you must cheat your way to the top and that it’s OK, even when you get caught red-handed, as long as you are politically powerful.” Tygart also registered his alarm that Wada did not get in contact with Grigory Rodchenkov, the former head of Russian Anti-Doping who blew the whistle on how the urine samples of Russian medal winners in Sochi were switched, before agreeing to clear 95 of the first 96 cases of suspected doping by Russian athletes. He was also surprised that one of the two IOC investigations into Russia has bothered speaking to Rodchenkov and only in the past two weeks. “Clean athletes deserve justice and reform, not excuses for failing to even contact the star witness or for closing cases prematurely,” said Tygart, who was instrumental in exposing Lance Armstrong’s doping. “The IOC president said this was ‘an unprecedented level of criminality’ but yet over a year in, many of those investigating it have not even interviewed the star witness? Come on, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see where this appears to be headed and it ain’t good for clean athletes.” Tygart was speaking a day after a New York Times column by Rodchenkov, who is in the US witness protection programme, in which he revealed that he had fled Russia after being told by a friend in the government that his “suicide” was being planned. In the piece Rodchenkov also urged Wada not to drop its requirements that Russia accept responsibility for its state-sponsored doping programme and hand over all its evidence when it meets in Paris. This, he said, would be an “ominous turn in the battle for clean sports competition”. He concluded: “I hope the IOC and Wada ... refuse to sweep Russia’s transgressions under the rug. The world – and many thousands of clean athletes – are watching.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/23/relief-british-apple-growers-tesco-relaxes-blemish-free-rules-frost-ring","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T15:54:48Z","webTitle":"Relief for British apple growers as Tesco relaxes its 'blemish-free' rules","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/23/relief-british-apple-growers-tesco-relaxes-blemish-free-rules-frost-ring","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/23/relief-british-apple-growers-tesco-relaxes-blemish-free-rules-frost-ring","fields":{"headline":"Relief for British apple growers as Tesco relaxes its 'blemish-free' rules","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"British growers will be spared from being forced to dump hundreds of tons of apples after a supermarket relaxed its rules on “blemish-free” fruit. Growers faced the prospect of having to throw away apples from this autumn’s crop after an unseasonal frost caused unsightly blemishes on otherwise perfectly good fruit. The Bramley cooking apple crop has been particularly badly hit. When temperatures dropped to -4C in April it caused a blemish known as “frost ring”, which leaves a mark around the circumference or large marks on the skin of the apples. Under rules set by supermarkets about the look and quality of fruit and vegetables provided by suppliers, growers feared retailers would reject this year’s crop. Now Tesco has said it will relax the normally tight specifications on how fruit looks to ensure the crop goes on sale. Growers said the move will mean that a variety of apples, including an estimated 300 tonnes of Bramleys, could now be sold by supermarkets. Under the existing rules, apples affected by frost ring would normally be excluded and growers forced to remove those with the defect. John Worth, Tesco’s apple spokesman, said: “We’re working with our apple growers to use as much of the crop and prevent perfectly good fruit from going to waste. We work with our growers wherever we can and although some apples might be smaller or blemished, they will have the same great taste our customers expect.” He said the slightly blemished apples would be sold as part of Tesco’s standard range, while more blemished fruit will be sold under its Perfectly Imperfect “wonky” fruit and vegetable branding. Supermarkets have faced criticism for being too exacting in their rules about how fruit and vegetables look before being accepted for sale. Retailers argue the rules reflect customer tastes for blemish-free produce and claim there is little point in putting imperfect goods on sale only to throw them away unsold later. Apple growers welcomed the move, saying the frost ring damage was largely superficial with a minimal effect on the flesh. A spokesman for the British Fruit Growers’ Association said retailers’ rules had a big impact on grower’s profits and praised Tesco’s stance. Tesco recently said it would start publishing details of the amount of food waste it produced."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/23/fa-dan-ashworth-mark-sampson","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T18:59:24Z","webTitle":"FA’s Dan Ashworth must answer questions and not vanish from Mark Sampson saga","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/23/fa-dan-ashworth-mark-sampson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/23/fa-dan-ashworth-mark-sampson","fields":{"headline":"FA’s Dan Ashworth must answer questions and not vanish from Mark Sampson saga","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Nobody can say we weren’t warned. Football at its highest level has always been run differently from your average major business and this is hardly the first time that the people who profess to run the sport have turned on a spit of public ridicule. “Beware of the clever, sharp men who are creeping into the game,” William McGregor, founder of the Football League, put it in League Football and the Men Who Made it. And that was in 1909. It has certainly felt that way watching the Football Association stagger through the various stages of the Mark Sampson debacle and the considerable feat of Martin Glenn’s inadequate regime to add several new layers to a story that already featured racism allegations, hush-money payments and the unmistakable stench of a cover-up going all the way to the top of the organisation. The new elements that eventually did for Sampson have left the FA in an even greater state of disrepute and, for that, the accident-prone chief executive might just have to understand if the people he humbly described as “the grown-ups in the organisation” – namely himself, the chairman, Greg Clarke, and the technical director, Dan Ashworth – are being chased by headlines asking why they are still in office. Ashworth, in particular, seems to have his fingerprints everywhere in this story, bearing in mind this was the man who appointed Sampson, who championed him, who exonerated him from Eni Aluko’s complaints and who let it slide, with that stunning lack of curiosity, when the FA’s safeguarding department ruled the now-deposed England Women manager needed to go on an educational course because of his relationship with players at Bristol Academy (now Bristol City Women), the club where he had previously coached. Even before we get to that part of the fiasco, it seems almost implausible that Ashworth, with his close relationship to Sampson, should be one of the two people to oversee the internal inquiry into Aluko’s allegations. Ashworth’s investigation had cleared Sampson of any wrongdoing and delivered its findings to Aluko before speaking to at least one of the key witnesses. And there are other details that, until now, I have kept back when it comes to the reasons, to put it bluntly, why the Professional Footballers’ Association has complained to the FA that the process involving Ashworth is “not a genuine search for the truth” and “designed to close down the complaint and absolve Mark Sampson”. Other people can decide if Ashworth should stay or go but the picture it creates is unedifying, to say the least, and it leaves a stain that will be difficult to wash out. It certainly feels typical of this story to discover that Ashworth and the FA’s human resources director, Rachel Brace, admitted they had cleared Sampson of making a racial comment towards Drew Spence at the China Cup in 2015 without actually watching the video recording of the relevant meeting. That admission is described as “nothing short of incredible” within the PFA, whose firm belief is that Aluko has been the victim of an almighty stitch-up, and leaves a burning question about why Ashworth and Brace were so quick to absolve their colleague without more serious investigations. But there is more. For starters, Ashworth’s response when Aluko emailed him in June last year to set out her concerns about her own treatment and the incident involving Spence. Two months later, Aluko sent a follow-up to ask why he had not replied and Ashworth claimed he had never received the email. The PFA’s view is that Ashworth’s explanation “lacks credibility and is not accepted as being genuine”. Nobody else on the email chain lost it to cyberspace. Ashworth was the man who wanted Aluko, as an “iconic England player”, to take part in the FA’s culture review and promised it was an entirely confidential process. It was Ashworth who told her it was a mere coincidence when, within two weeks, her 11-year, 102-cap England career was in effect ended for what Sampson called “unLioness behaviour”. Ashworth was at the meeting with Aluko when coincidence struck again and the follow-up emails the next day – and it really is some coincidence, this – included notification that her work as a sports lawyer was to be the subject of a separate FA investigation. Ashworth was one of the people the PFA was referring to when it complained of “a sham which was not designed to establish the truth but intended to protect Mark Sampson”. Ashworth is, in short, up to his neck in this story. He certainly has a lot of explaining to do because, in a normal business, these are the kind of allegations that might warrant an investigation of their own. And, of course, the Aluko element is now only part of the story. Ashworth was one of the executives who never made it his business to find out more when Sampson was sent on an educational course after a safeguarding investigation lasting almost a year. Ashworth was, however, responsible for the decision to renew Sampson’s contract eight months later. He was also on the selection panel in 2013 that apparently changed the job specification to line up with Sampson’s CV (removing the stipulation that candidates must have a professional licence and international experience) and has been there, virtually every step of the way, until the press conference to announce his colleague’s sacking. At that stage, Ashworth was nowhere to be seen, handily avoiding questions about what he knew and what he had done about it. Glenn and Clarke might have made a pig’s ear of it, too, but at least they were willing to front up. The surprising part, three days on, is that the details of whatever Sampson did at Bristol, involving what has been described as inappropriate relationships with more than one player, have not yet hit the news stands. Yet I also suspect I’m not alone in struggling to shake this feeling that it all feels a bit convenient to lose Sampson this way now it is two players, rather than just one, alleging racial comments, with a number of potential witnesses identified and the possibility in the long run that the new evidence might have toppled him anyway. Sampson’s back was pressed against a cold, unforgiving wall even before all the new elements to this scandal. He had always denied making the Ebola comment about Aluko’s Nigerian relatives or asking Spence, a mixed‑race player, how many times she had been arrested. Yet the case against him is mounting and the bottom line here is that if the verdict had gone against him he would, almost certainly, have been sacked. For an organisation with the FA’s vanity and pomposity, it would have been just about the most excruciating way possible to lose a manager. As it is, the people at the top of the chain have found a way to pin it on something from Sampson’s previous employment while shaking their heads about what a terrible business it is and congratulating themselves on their apparent belief that the FA has higher moral standards. And yes, I know it may sound cynical, but there has been too much spin and deflection and political manoeuvring to know whether we should take it at face value. Even now, the FA is struggling to get its story straight, judging by Glenn’s admission that the barrister Katharine Newton had been chosen to oversee the second investigation because the organisation wanted a black woman and the spluttering fury from the FA’s own lawyers, Farrer &amp; Co, when I dared point out they had written to me on 25 August to say that was a horrendous mistruth. Julian Pike, representing the FA, is “quite outstanding .... clever, thoughtful, charming”, according to Chambers UK. Sadly, I must have got him on a bad day when I tried to double-check. “I suggest you reconsider your approach,” was one of the politer lines. “You need to have regard to the facts and not simply seek to give a platform for ill-informed and maliciously motivated theories.” His tone rather changed when he found out the source of this information was the FA’s chief executive. And there, in a nutshell, is your insight into the FA bubble and a blurry, fuddled world where they seem intent on pushing all the doors marked “pull”. As for Newton, the most relevant question concerns her ability to get it right now she has reopened her inquiry and finally appeared to realise – hallelujah – that it might be worthwhile to speak to Spence and the potential witnesses. There is, however, a reason why so many journalists keep mistakenly referring to her as a QC when she is, in fact, a junior barrister. A colleague who had made the error explained it rather neatly: “Because it bloody well should have been a QC.” What troubles me more is the implication from Glenn that it was Spence’s fault the various investigations had, until Friday, never asked her to corroborate what Aluko had told the FA about the China Cup. “If someone has had something said to them, the thing you would expect them to do is raise a complaint,” Glenn volunteered. “The specifics of that complaint could then be dealt with. If you worked your whole life on hearsay, you’d never be able to run a classroom let alone the Football Association.” In an ideal world, yes. Yet it is still fairly demoralising to realise the FA claims to support whistleblowers until, that is, someone actually takes up the option to report alleged racism – at which point the man at the top of the organisation describes it as hearsay and the relevant checks are ignored. Spence was 22 when she was called up to the China Cup. It was her first England camp and the start, she hoped, of a long international career. In those circumstances, she chose not to make a complaint because, as she saw it, it would probably be her last involvement and she was afraid of the repercussions (very wise, you might think, given what has happened to Aluko). Is that really so hard to understand? Glenn has invited derision in the past by admitting he was “not a football expert” but, in this instance, he doesn’t have to be. It is more a case of understanding humans. Glenn now says he will offer a personal apology to Aluko and Spence if the latest investigation – the third time the case has been opened – rules that it was actually Sampson who was not telling the truth, rather than sticking to the apparent belief that two England players must have conjured the stories out of thin air. It wasn’t the kind of promise a man in his position would ordinarily make if it was in his mind to resign and, though there is still a long way for this story to run, nobody should be too surprised if he and his colleagues try to see it out. But can you trust them again? In many ways it is all part of an enduring story. But it is still fairly dispiriting, once again, to realise that the Football Association is an age away from being the organisation we want it to be."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/23/universal-credit-wait-beyond-reasonable-justification","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T23:05:29Z","webTitle":"Ministers told to cut wait for new benefit amid evidence it is causing debt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/23/universal-credit-wait-beyond-reasonable-justification","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/23/universal-credit-wait-beyond-reasonable-justification","fields":{"headline":"Ministers told to cut wait for new benefit amid evidence it is causing debt","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Ministers are facing growing calls to slash the time welfare claimants are forced to wait before being entitled to the government’s flagship new benefit, having been warned some time ago by their own advisers that the delay is “beyond reasonable justification”. David Gauke, the work and pensions secretary, has been under pressure to slow down the roll-out of universal credit, which combines several benefits into one payment, after mounting evidence that it is pushing new claimants into debt and rent arrears. There are also calls for the government to end the seven-day waiting period after a new claim is made. The delay saves the government £250m a year. Councils and housing associations have raised concerns about the waiting period because it means claimants are then paid a month in arrears, meaning they may wait up to six weeks for their first payment. There have been reports of claimants waiting even longer. The government had been urged not to proceed with the seven-day wait by the Social Security Advisory Committee (SSAC), which advises it on welfare issues, as long ago as 2015. Its report to ministers then raised “very serious concerns” about the measure. It said it should not go ahead, based on “persuasive and compelling evidence”. “The committee considers that the impact of having to serve waiting days for a benefit that includes other costs, in particular housing, puts it beyond reasonable justification,” it said. “Universal credit was introduced on a platform of being a simple benefit and we consider that simplicity requires there to be no waiting days.” There have also been huge cuts to the overall budget for the project: the Resolution Foundation thinktank has calculated that some families will lose out on up to £2,600 a year. David Finch, its senior policy analyst, said: “As universal credit is rolled out across the country, the problems that are already starting to emerge are likely to build. The government should urgently rethink the design and operation of universal credit before too many more families are affected.” Carl Emmerson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a member of the SSAC, said: “Delays in administering universal credit claims – combined with the fact that there is a seven-day waiting period before a claim can be made and that successful claims are usually paid a month in arrears – means that increasing numbers will have to cover their living costs for a considerable period before their award starts to be paid. “This is for a benefit that includes support for housing costs. As SSAC has recommended, rather than a pause in roll-out, a more direct way to alleviate the concerns this causes would be to scrap the seven-day waiting period. This would cost the government around £250m a year.” Chris Goulden of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, another member of the SSAC, said: “The government needs to look at its own evidence about the experiences of those who are claiming universal credit. People in the poorest fifth of households, 70% or so, have no savings at all and others only have a small amount to fall back on.” The Department for Work and Pensions said: “Waiting days have been a longstanding part of the welfare system, and mostly apply to people who claim universal credit after leaving a job. Budgeting advice and benefit advances are available for anyone who needs extra help. A number of groups are exempt from waiting days, including care leavers, those with a serious illness, prison leavers, and victims of domestic violence.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/23/nurses-language-tests-immigration-nhs","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T23:05:29Z","webTitle":"Nurses who failed English test aimed at curbing immigration set for a reprieve","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/23/nurses-language-tests-immigration-nhs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/23/nurses-language-tests-immigration-nhs","fields":{"headline":"Nurses who failed English test aimed at curbing immigration set for a reprieve","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Language rules introduced to curb immigration are set to be relaxed after they prevented native English-speaking nurses from working in the NHS. The NHS has a shortage of 40,000 nurses and recruiters and NHS employers have been lobbying for looser language requirements so that thousands of nurses from countries such as Australia, India and the Philippines can work in Britain. In June, the Observer uncovered evidence that Australians and other native English-speaking nurses were being turned down because they could not pass the International English Language Testing System test. Now the Nursing and Midwifery Council will consider a measure on Wednesday to allow other measures such as the Occupational English Test. Nurses with a recent qualification that was taught in English and nurses who have worked for two years in a country where English is the native language would also qualify. If patient organisations and NHS bodies also agree to the proposals, the changes could be introduced next month. In 2016 the government forced all public sector bodies to introduce strict tests for new employees. Matthew Hancock, then the Cabinet Office minister, said tests were necessary to control immigration “for the benefit of all hard-working people”. As a result the NMC brought in the IELTS test, but it led to a dramatic drop in foreign nurses registering in the UK, from 1,304 EU nurses in July 2016 to just 46 in April this year. Recruitment firms such as HCL said that many English-speaking nurses struggled with the written part of IELTS – an essay-based exam. Candidates need to score at least seven out of nine in each of four sections. The NMC is still looking at whether or not it should reduce the required minimum score. Teresa Wilson, HCL’s international operations manager, said research showed the two main reasons for failing IELTS were “incorrect tenses and essay structure”. “These are hardly issues that should preclude a skilled nurse from fulfilling a nursing role effectively,” she said. “The current system is suffocating the vital supply of highly skilled foreign nurses who want to work in our NHS.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27317","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T23:00:15Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,317","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27317","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27317","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,317","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/23/london-uber-ban-message-to-reckless-tech-ethos","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T23:05:29Z","webTitle":"London’s Uber ban is a message to a reckless tech ethos | Arun Sundararajan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/23/london-uber-ban-message-to-reckless-tech-ethos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/23/london-uber-ban-message-to-reckless-tech-ethos","fields":{"headline":"London’s Uber ban is a message to a reckless tech ethos","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It was an extraordinary decision for Transport for London (TfL) to announce on Friday that it would not be renewing Uber’s private hire operator licence, effectively banning the service after 30 September. But the ruling was an indictment of Uber the company rather than the broader ride-hailing concept or labour model, and judges the embattled platform on a tumultuous past rather than its promise of new beginnings. It is a decision that hurts Londoners more than it protects them. However, convincing London that Uber is deserving of the public trust – in its appeal against the ruling – will be a critical test of whether its new leadership can navigate the company beyond the stormy waters weathered over the past few months. No stranger to regulatory strife, Uber’s approach to dealing with government has matured considerably since its early days of rampant permissionless innovation, but the backlash continues, especially in Europe. Uber was banned entirely in Denmark in April and some or all of its services have been suspended in Bulgaria, Hungary, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. The London ban has greater potential for long-term damage. Regulators in other countries have generally opposed Uber because the transportation service it enables violates local (typically taxi licensing) laws. TfL’s objections are to the company itself. So, other companies may receive licences to offer Uber-like services in London, but Uber has been found “not fit and proper” to hold such a licence, a stunning indictment of the ride-hailing pioneer. And there’s the rub. The discussion is not about a misfit between innovative business models and antiquated regulations. It has little connection to other familiar points of gig economy contention, such as whether Uber’s drivers are independent contractors or employees. Rather, like many cities around the world, London has already expanded its regulatory structure to accommodate ride-hailing services, adopting a now-familiar approach that delegates some responsibilities – setting fares, conducting criminal background checks, collecting data about drivers and rides and managing certain safety affairs – to the platform. TfL contends that Uber is not paying adequate attention to these responsibilities. As well as other shortcomings, the regulator calls out Uber’s controversial Greyball technology, a system designed to identify and thwart regulatory “sting operations”, although Uber denies that this has been used in London. The decision comes at a moment of particular weakness for Uber. The company is recovering from a wrenching management transition following numerous internal governance challenges and scandals, the departure of its founder, Travis Kalanick, and other senior executives, a trade secrets lawsuit from Google’s Waymo and a boardroom battle between Kalanick and influential investor Benchmark. Although London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, has signalled unequivocal support for TfL’s ruling, Uber has many allies as it assembles an appeal, ranging from the trade minister, Greg Hands, to union boss James Farrar, a leader of the efforts by its drivers to be classified as employees. As of Friday night, 400,000 people had signed a change.org petition supporting a reversal of the impending ban. It remains to be seen whether the consumer support that Uber has historically relied on in its regulatory battles will persist in light of the recent damage to its image and brand. Nevertheless, there is little doubt that Uber provides tremendous benefit to its estimated 3.5m users in London. More than 40,000 drivers in the city depend on it for all or part of their income. Although Uber has cultivated the image of a pugilist in its past dealings with government, and this approach has no doubt ruffled many a regulatory feather, the conciliatory tone adopted by its new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, who appealed to TfL via Twitter to “please work with us to make things right”, reflects a significant departure. Rather than shutting the service down completely, TfL must give the new executive team a chance to demonstrate that they can perform the regulatory tasks delegated to them with greater responsibility and care. A one-year probationary period could be a good starting point. Uber’s London experience holds an important lesson for Silicon Valley startups that take pride in asking for forgiveness rather than permission. As digital technologies continue to permeate our physical world lives, platforms such as Uber, Airbnb and Facebook will increasingly be called upon to take on regulatory roles that government used to perform. The future of regulation is delegation. Nurturing a corporate reputation worthy of this public trust will be far more valuable to tomorrow’s tech pioneers than the short-term glory and financial gains that come from casting oneself as a rule-breaking disrupter.

And I think I speak for a lot of people who were in the room that morning. I’ve never heard of a US president standing at the assembly’s podium saying “If you threaten us, we will totally destroy your nation” which is what Trump said about North Korea. It’s provocative, it’s ugly, it’s not how to find a way out of this crisis. But the good news is that roughly two-thirds of Americans are not in Trump’s camp. And I think most Americans are shocked, like most of the world, by the crudeness, by the threats, by the tweets and by the substance of what he’s pushing domestically,such as his healthcare proposals which would have taken more than 20 million people off the healthcare rolls even when his own voters were saying “No we don’t want that”. The Republicans are going to try again next week. But the really bad news is that he is commander-in-chief. I don’t know whether, if he gave a crazy order, it would be stopped or countermanded. When it comes to domestic policies he is not having much success but, when it comes to war, he really probably could make war. The US mindset is that the US – and it’s true in both parties, and it’s true in our deep security state – is what Madeleine Albright, the US ambassador to the UN and then secretary of state under Bill Clinton, called “the indispensable country”. We have the concept of US exceptionalism. Barack Obama bought into US exceptionalism. If you travel around the world it’s a little boring to hear all this bravado all the time from the US. The US is very powerful, but it’s not all-dominating. It’s got a military which is phenomenally powerful but we don’t win wars because wars don’t solve political problems – look at Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya – they’ve all been disasters. Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos – all disasters. So you can have this huge military but what does it really get you in the end? The US mindset is exceptionalism – the city on the hill. A lot of Trump’s speech was couched in an exceptionally crude, simplistic manner. It is shocking to see and hear this kind of bravado. It is the arrogance of a country that has been“in charge” for a long time. But it’s not really in charge any longer; if you travel in the rest of the world, you actually can go more than just a few minutes without hearing the US mentioned. Trump has an exceptionally simple-minded approach – and Washington has it but in a slightly more sophisticated way – and it is this notion of the indispensable country. And it’s a bad and dangerous concept. It’s a concept of arrogance. It’s a concept that has led the United States into one mess after another. We don’t have to be the indispensable country – we should just be a responsible country, participating and cooperating with other countries. But what Trump was talking about is a very degraded version of something that is more generally in the water, in the air of Washington DC. But the good news is that progress is being made across the world and what is happening in the United States won’t stop that. In terms of the Sustainable Development Goals which were discussed at the UN last week, there is enormous progress. There are wonderful initiatives in China. One very big, clear, visible programme – it’s not proven yet – is China’s “One Belt, One Road” policy. China – the world’s largest country – said that they want to connect more with Europe and with the rest of Eurasia, indeed with East Africa. And so they will help to finance and support and co-design infrastructure, whether it’s fast rail, whether it’s maritime linkages and port facilities, whether it’s fibre and connectivity, whether it’s deployment of energy, to really connect and integrate the Eurasian landmass and even East Africa into that picture. There is progress in India, with the deployment of information technologies; in Ghana where a recent announcement promised that upper secondary education would be free now, making a path for kids to really get the kind of basic primary and secondary education that they need. This is a real breakthrough. I’m speaking with a lot of African leaders urging that this become an Africa-wide initiative because that’s really what Sustainable Development Goals calls for – universal secondary education completion. I’m watching great breakthroughs in health that are absolutely wonderful, deploying community health workers with smartphones that can fight malaria, that can help mothers with the antenatal visits and safe pregnancy and safe childbirth. They can get malaria under control and Aids under control, working with the UNon a pathway to end the Aids epidemic in a very realistic science-based way. There have been some criticisms of China’s role in Africa but on the whole I think what they are doing is for the good. They build real, practical things, so you go to a lot of places that had blackouts or no electricity at all and you turn on the light and say “Oh that’s good. That wasn’t here last year” and they say “Yeah but the hydro dam is now in place” and China’s putting in a lot of hydroelectric power. You go on a fresh Tarmac road in a lot of countries in West Africa indeed, and they say, “Yeah, China came in and has paved the highway system”. This is very practical. They don’t ask a lot of questions of the government. They sometimes ask no questions at all. It’s true that the counterpart of this is usually some kind of long-term arrangements on resources but it’s negotiated and to my mind of course it should be transparent, but China’s building real things. A big problem with the aid that the traditional western donors give is that it’s turned on, turned off, turned on, turned off, turned on, turned off. I always have said development aid should be for development. You can’t really run another country by turning the dial on and off. It’s a kind of hubris and kind of arrogance that doesn’t work. I’ve been many times with a head of state in Africa, where some western institution has been in the room giving this order and that order, and then the door shuts and the leader has turned to me, said “Who do they think they are? Who do they think runs this country?” This is an edited version of an interview with Observer editor, and currently acting Guardian US editor, John Mulholland at the Guardian Live Maintaining Momentum for the SDGs event in New York."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/23/colin-firth-brexit-italian-citizenship","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T15:42:02Z","webTitle":"Brexit critic Colin Firth opts for Italian passport for ‘family reasons’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/23/colin-firth-brexit-italian-citizenship","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/23/colin-firth-brexit-italian-citizenship","fields":{"headline":"Brexit critic Colin Firth opts for Italian passport for ‘family reasons’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Many of the threats and promises exchanged during the row over Brexit have yet to be tested by time, but this weekend at least one has come to pass. The Oscar-winning film actor and producer Colin Firth, unmoved by Theresa May’s pronouncements in Florence, has accepted Italian citizenship, according to the Italian interior ministry in Rome. It was reported in May that the actor had made a formal application for Italian citizenship in response to the vote to leave the European Union, while last year Firth’s apparent opposition to the referendum result was noted in an Austrian newspaper. He was said to have described Brexit as “a disaster of unexpected proportions”. The actor’s agent said that the decision to apply for a new passport at the Italian embassy in London had been a family decision. He would not confirm that it had anything to do with Brexit. “Colin applied for dual citizenship [British and Italian] in order to have the same passports as his wife and children,” the agent said. The 56-year-old star came to fame as Jane Austen’s aloof Mr Darcy, the epitome of the reticent English aristocrat, in an acclaimed 1995 BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. But from now on Firth is officially as Italian as spaghetti carbonara. “The very famous actor, who won an Oscar for the film The King’s Speech, is married to a citizen from our country and has often declared his love for our land,” the Italian interior ministry said. Firth, who grew up and went to school in Hampshire, has been married to the Italian environmental campaigner, fashion entrepreneur and film producer Livia Giuggioli since 1997. The couple live in Chiswick, London, with their two sons Luca, 16, and Matteo, 13. Since Italy is one of the few European countries that allows dual nationality, Firth is expected to keep his British passport as well as a home in this country. Firth and Giuggioli, 47, also have a house near the town of Città della Pieve in Umbria and the actor speaks good Italian. His 2008 film Genova, directed by Michael Winterbottom, told of a widower who falls in love first with Italy and then with an Italian woman. The actor, who has also appeared in the hit films The English Patient, Bridget Jones’s Diary, Love, Actually and Shakespeare in Love, is currently promoting his new film Kingsman: The Golden Circle, a sequel to the ironic, action-packed 2015 hit. Since the Brexit decision, a growing number of Britons have applied for citizenship in EU countries, with Irish applications exceeding all others. Any Briton born in the Irish Republic or Northern Ireland, or with an Irish parent or grandparent, is entitled to an Irish passport and it is thought six million could be eligible. May went out of her way in Florence to pledge that hundreds of thousands of Italians living in the UK would retain their full rights. Yesterday, Colin Firth said in a statement: “A connection with Italy has existed in my family for more than two decades now. I was married there and had two children born in Rome. My wife and I are both extremely proud of our own countries. We feel that we’ve made a gift of that to each other.” “Our children have been dual citizens since the beginning. We never really thought much about our different passports. But now, with some of the uncertainty around, we thought it sensible that we should all get the same. Livia is applying for a British passport.” “I will always be extremely British (you only have to look at or listen to me). Britain is our home and we love it here. Despite the enticements of my profession to relocate to more remunerative climes I’ve always chosen to base my career out of the UK and pay my taxes here. That hasn’t changed.” “I married into Italy (and anyone will tell you when you marry an Italian you don’t just marry one person; you marry a family and perhaps an entire country…). Like almost everybody I have a passionate love of Italy and joining my kids in being dual citizens will be a huge privilege.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/23/only-a-quarter-of-older-people-would-consider-voting-labour-poll-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T17:00:21Z","webTitle":"Only a quarter of older people would consider voting Labour, poll shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/23/only-a-quarter-of-older-people-would-consider-voting-labour-poll-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/23/only-a-quarter-of-older-people-would-consider-voting-labour-poll-shows","fields":{"headline":"Only a quarter of older people would consider voting Labour, poll shows","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Only a quarter of older people would consider voting Labour at another election, according to a new survey that highlights the challenge faced by Jeremy Corbyn in winning over the “grey vote”. Just 26% of voters aged 65 to 74 say Labour would be an option for them if another election was called. Crucially, this includes the 25% who voted for Corbyn’s party at the June general election, suggesting Labour has only a tiny number of potential new recruits among this age group. As Labour activists gather in buoyant mood for their annual conference in Brighton this weekend, the polling by Opinium for the Social Market Foundation shows the party’s current popularity is heavily concentrated among younger age groups who continue to be attracted by its messages. However, support shows little sign of expanding among pensioners. Among 18- to 24-year-olds, 63% said they would consider voting Labour – substantially more than the 53% who chose the party in the snap June election, suggesting it continues to build appeal among young people. Among 25- to 34-year-olds the same proportion (63%) said they would think about Labour, compared with the 49% who chose them at the last election. The party’s lack of appeal among older voters – who turn out in larger numbers at the ballot box than younger ones – is worrying party strategists. They realise that unless Corbyn and his team can appeal more to older sections of the electorate the party will struggle to supplant the Tories, even if Theresa May’s government implodes. Concern about Labour’s lack of economic credibility as well as worries about its attitude to defence are often cited by older voters as reasons for not backing the Labour. In June, the Tories won more seats than Labour at the general election because they outpolled Corbyn’s party by more than two to one among older voters. Opinium found that only 30% of people aged over 65 said they believed Labour was on the side of “people like me”. By contrast, 54% said they regarded Labour as the party of young people. This is despite the fact that Labour went out of its way to try to lure older voters in its last election campaign with pledges to maintain pensioner benefits such as winter fuel payments and the “triple lock” on pensions. The data, to be revealed by Social Market Foundation at a fringe event at the conference on Monday, suggests the best way for Labour to widen its appeal would be to offer credible tax, spending and other economic policies. Almost half of older voters said they would consider supporting the party if they believed it could be trusted to manage the public finances. Adam Drummond of Opinium said: “Their best chance of making any gains with older voters lies in making the party a safe choice for those who would like to kick out the incumbent government but are more worried about the opposition.” An eve of conference poll by Opinium for the Observer puts the Tories two points ahead of Labour. The Conservatives are on 42%, Labour on 40%, the Lib Dems on 6% and Ukip and the SNP both on 4%. Corbyn is still just ahead of May in the net personal ratings (when the number of those who disapprove of his leadership are subtracted from those who approve). But his rating has slipped from –5 to –10% over the last month. May is now on minus 11% but has improved her rating by six points since last month when she was on minus 17%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/2017/sep/23/radio-stations-1-2-3-4-50-years-old-bbc-broadcasting","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T23:03:29Z","webTitle":"Fifty years after the radio revolution, are the BBC’s stations now irrelevant?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2017/sep/23/radio-stations-1-2-3-4-50-years-old-bbc-broadcasting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2017/sep/23/radio-stations-1-2-3-4-50-years-old-bbc-broadcasting","fields":{"headline":"Fifty years after the radio revolution, are the BBC’s stations now irrelevant?","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Next Saturday, 30 September, BBC Radio 1, 2, 3 and 4 will all be 50 years old. There will be celebrations. Let’s imagine what they could be like. Radio 1, with its cooler best friend 1Xtra, has been excited about its birthday for weeks and its party would take up the whole weekend, moving from cocktails at a celebrity do to raving on stage with a festival headliner, followed by seven hours’ clubbing madness and a fully Insta-ed comedown. Radio 2 has decided to have a few chums over for dinner and a chat about house prices, before pushing the chairs back for a kitchen disco. Radio 3 is attending an interesting panel discussion on ancient history, a classical concert and spending Sunday on its PhD. And Radio 4 has read all the broadsheets before 6am and is prodding you awake to tell you exactly what it thinks. We know the personalities of these anonymously numbered radio stations as though they were our friends. We get annoyed when they behave out of character; they have been woven through our national story for half a century. But in a swipe-left-multi-format-binge-watch world, can these old pals continue as they are? The four stations began as a reaction, a late response to a changing world. In the mid-1960s, pirate stations such as Radio Caroline and Radio London began to broadcast pop music 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and millions tuned in. The BBC’s existing radio stations – the World Service, Home Service, Light Programme, Music Programme and Third Programme – were either not designed to play pop or not so much of it and had no proper response to the pirates. So the BBC went to the government and, in 1967, the Marine, etc, Broadcasting (Offences) Act was passed, which effectively banned pirate radio stations. (Supposedly, prime minister Harold Wilson only agreed to this as part of a bargain: he wanted to establish the Open University and the BBC agreed, in return for scuppering the pirates.) The act came into effect on 14 August 1967, and six weeks later, on 30 September, the Home Service became Radio 4, the Third Programme became Radio 3, the Light and Music Programmes merged to become Radio 2, and Radio 1 was created. Not from thin air; the new pop station snaffled several Radio Caroline DJs and a few from the Big L (Radio London), including John Peel, whose late-night show, The Perfumed Garden, had been a surprise success. It even nicked the Wonderful Radio London jingle, just substituting the word one for London. In truth, the BBC was forced to create Radio 1, and with that, Radio 2, 3 and 4, and its longest-standing DJ, Annie Nightingale (she started in 1970), recalls an underlying feeling that many people didn’t want the station to exist. “It was manned by technical people who came out of the RAF, who knew nothing about music,” she says. “A memo said: ‘We are never going to have this American-style radio here, with disc jockeys.’” And it was not an instant success, sharing airtime with Radio 2 in the afternoons and playing fewer songs than the pirates had done because of weird needle time laws that restricted the amount of recorded music that the BBC could broadcast in any 24-hour period. But by the mid-70s, Radio 1 was the most popular radio station in the country, and continued in that spot until the 2000s, when Radio 2 took the top place. Today, Radio 2 is still the UK’s most popular station (it has more than 15 million listeners), with Radio 4 coming in second (around 11 million). And the family of four has expanded, with Asian Network starting in 1988, 5 Live (originally Radio 5, in 1990) established in 1994, and the digital stations 1Xtra, 4 Extra and 6 Music all beginning in 2002. None, despite various threats of closure, most notably Asian Network and 6 Music, look anything other than well established. They, too, are part of how our country sees itself. Fifty years on, Radio 1 is still doing well; by far the most digitally savvy of the original BBC stations, it has established itself as a YouTube player, with a witty social media presence that drives up listenership. It is very much supported by 1Xtra, its urban sister, which has provided most of Radio 1’s UK stars. Radio 2 is a purring Rolls- Royce, expensive but worth it. It knows its audience inside out. Its specialist shows are excellent – blues, folk, jazz, country, on selected evenings at 7pm – and its weekend offering is a great blend of charismatic personalities (Graham Norton, Liza Tarbuck, Paul O’Grady) and music. But Radio 2’s weekday daytime DJs are still very white and very male (no women or BAME presenters between 6.30am and 8pm) with the impression given by management that this will not change until one of them actually drops dead on air. Radio 3 gets the least attention, except during the Proms, but as classical music’s popularity wanes among the young, that’s hardly a surprise. One wag described it as Radio Dignitas. It’s better when more experimental – as on Late Junction and Hear and Now – and The Essay is always worth a listen. And Radio 4? Ah, Radio 4. We could be here for ever arguing about Radio 4. There is still a strong sense that the station represents the UK; or should do. It is the broadcaster to which – by law – we will turn in a national emergency. The station has high status, but this hampers development. There are many shows on Radio 4 that began before 1967: The Archers, Any Questions?, From Our Own Correspondent, Today, Book at Bedtime, Desert Island Discs, Woman’s Hour. They sit weightily in their slots, formats created decades ago, presenters glued to their headphones. Who would dare to change them? Not the commissioners, who are “aware” of concerns about the BBC’s representation of minorities but don’t seem to clock that they’re the ones who could make changes. Not the producers, who, even since the Brand-Ross-palavers, still have far less status than the presenters. Not the audiences, who hate change and age alongside the shows, but seem unable to outlive them. We will all be worm fodder long before anyone dares to cancel Just a Minute, let alone Today’s utterly redundant Thought for the Day. There are programmes that demonstrate that modernisation is possible. PM, the late-afternoon news analysis show, started in 1970, but is right up to date, engaging its audience through social media and switching with aplomb between humour, humanity and hard journalism as needed. The Today programme is not so nimble. The station’s flagship breakfast show has broadened its remit under new editor Sarah Sands, with outside broadcasts from London fashion week and Silicon Valley, and the very odd Puzzle of the Day. But this new approach exposes gaping holes in its presenters’ abilities. John Humphrys, in particular, seems baffled by much of what he is being asked to cover, and has an unforgivable tendency to adopt a sneering tone about arts and culture. His default setting is argument, when inquiry would be a better approach. Humphrys’ longstanding adversarial approach is inbuilt in Today, which leads to ridiculous situations, such as comedy writers being pitted against each other or, more seriously, climate change being given maybe-it-exists-maybe-it-doesn’t presentation (it exists). There is no need to interrogate people who might be better explaining what they do. There is a great need to take lying politicians to task. Speaking to those who work with and for Radio 4, the station’s commissioning process is the source of much angst among independent operators. Most Radio 4 commissioners are now part-time so find it easier to keep commissions inhouse or hand them to larger operators. And the station – along with Radio 2 – has a too-white-too-male problem. Insiders describe situations when lists of potential BAME presenters have been provided, which commissioning editors ignore, while plumping for yet another straight white man. The station, still monitored by government, finds it hard to move into the modern world. Its comedy is going through a safe, Cambridge Footlights moment (again). Its documentaries are excellent, but suffer from over-explanation when they begin: they could learn from the “big reveal moment” podcasts offer. Radio 4 doesn’t seem able to get its head around podcasts. Its drama is light years behind that of its podcast rivals. Perhaps the trickiest aspect to the station is the station itself. I’ve found that as soon as you sit down in a Radio 4 studio, you start talking like a Radio 4 person. Everyone within Radio 4 operates within its own distinct atmosphere. A solution is outside reporting. And outside presenters: the most charismatic on the station have a working life outside the BBC. Today, the biggest rivals to the 1967 four – and to all the other BBC stations – are digital. Music streaming, podcasts, YouTube. Increasingly, those of us who would have switched on Radio 4 turn to podcasts. Fifty years ago, Radios 1, 2, 3 and 4 were forced into existence as a reaction to a changing world. The world is changing even faster now. Their reactions need to be quicker.

Liverpool just about to deserved to edge a raucous, richly entertaining match between two likeable, flawed teams. Jurgen Klopp grits his teeth in celebration; that’s a big result for him after four games without a win. Thanks for your company, night! 90+2 min Vardy is booked for a foul on Moreno. He has had a storming game; it’s a shame his missed penalty will probably cost Leicester a point. 90 min There will be five additional minutes of high blood pressure in the away end. 88 min Liverpool look relatively comfortable just now but, with the way this match has gone, you’d expect Leicester to get one last chance. 87 min “Liverpool fan here,” says Scott Chesters. “I have no arguments about Mane´s red card but about the penalty; Mignolet challenged for the ball, got the ball, no matter how softly, then the two collided. Can´t see how it is a penalty myself.” I see what you mean, and it was a slightly confusing incident. Isn’t the argument for a penalty that, after Mignolet miskicked, Vardy would have had an open goal had he not been sent flying? 86 min “Fascinated by Matt Dony’s marriage (70 min),” sniffs Pete Salmon. “So he has to watch Strictly, but can also check the min-by-min? On laptop, full exposure? Or loo every five mins with his mobile? If the latter, I’m as tense for him as I am about the game.” 85 min Wijnaldum misses a decent chance, slicing just wide from Oxlade-Chamberlain’s cut-back. 84 min Slimani plants a header just wide from a great cross from Vardy. It wouldn’t have counted because either Slimani or Morgan had been penalised for fouling Matip. 83 min Thias has been a monstrously entertaining game. 82 min Sturridge, with almost no backlift, whips an excellent long-range shot that is palmed around spectacularly by Schmeichel. Sturridge has looked close to his best since coming off the bench. 80 min And now Leicester make their last change: Albrighton off, Islam Slimani on. 79 min Liverpool make their final substitution, with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain replacing the pretty wonderful Philippe Coutinho. 76 min Here’s Mac Millings. “Do assure the 70th minute’s Matt Dony that, after a number of full and frank discussions with Mrs. Millings, ‘we’ have not watched any football at all for quite some time, so he has that to look forward to.” Love is in the air/when Mac Millings is around, doo doo doo doo doo. 75 min Sturridge slips classily past Maguire, comes back on his left foot and shapes a beautiful curler just over the bar from 20 yards. He looks really sharp tonight. By the way, Can was pretty lucky not to concede another penalty for handball moments after Vardy’s kick was saved by Mignolet. There was so much going on that I forget to mention it. So sue me! 74 min Both sides make a change: Milner for Can, Iheanacho for Okazaki. This is pulsating stuff. Vardy smashed it as hard as he could, and Mignolet moved to his right to push it away. He has an outstanding record of saving penalties, and it’s even better now. That said, it was a poor penalty from Vardy - nowhere near the corner, and not straight down the middle. Mignolet is booked. He’s had a shocker here. He was so flustered by the presence of Vardy that he miskicked the ball completely, and his momentum was such that he then sent Vardy flying. I didn’t think it was a penalty at first but replays show it was a definite penalty. Mignolet is penalised for a foul on Vardy, and Liverpool are furious again. 70 min “The first 47 minutes or so were very entertaining,” says Matt Dony. “But at half time, I had a full and frank discussion with my wife and, long story short, ‘we’ decided that the Tv would be showing Strictly rather than the second half of the game. So I’m entirely in your hands. Please keep the good news rolling” It’s not over yet! Albrighton does brilliantly to beat Gomez down the left and crosses beyond the far post to Gray, who chests the ball up and swishes a spectacular shot towards goal. Mignolet leaps to his right to make an excellent save but Vardy heads the rebound into the empty net. Vardy may have been offside when Gray hit the original shot, I haven’t seen a replay yet. Liverpool finish Leicester off with a clinical counter-attack. Maguire sauntered forward from the back, but when he lost the ball Leicester were in trouble. Coutinho and Sturridge combined to find Henderson, who came back inside the recovering Maguire and reversed the ball smartly past Schmeichel. 67 min Coutinho and Salah have shots blocked in quick succession, and then Matip makes a vital block from Vardy, who might have gone down in the area after a challenge from behind. 66 min “Liverpool’s great coup in the transfer window was keeping their best player, who - and I still can’t over this fact - they somehow signed for £8.5 million in the first place,” says Phil Podolsky. Coutinho’s agent must be some California businessman not too conversant with this soccerball nonsense, because it’s always been clear he’s a stunning player.” Fair point. He looked really good as a teenager when Internazionale beat Gareth Bale 4-3 all those years ago. 65 min Daniel Sturridge replaces Firmino for Liverpool. 64 min Morgan is penalised for shovng Wijnaldum, who then handles the ball in his own area as he goes over. It was a soft foul, but probably the right decision. 62 min A change for Leicester: Mahrez off, Demarai Gray on. 61 min Coutinho’s fierce long-range shot is well blocked by Morgan, and then Firmino - who has been unusually poor today - drives high over the bar. 58 min Leicester have some excellent attacking options on the bench: Slimani, Gray, Iheanacho. 57 min A decent chance for Can, who heads Henderson’s dipping cross over the bar from the corner of the six-yard box. He was under pressure from Simpson, who did enough to ensure Can struggled to get on top of the ball. 56 min Coutinho’s superb dipping corner lands on the head of the off-balance Lovren, who can’t steer it on target. He wants a penalty, having been manhandled by Maguire. Anthony Taylor says no and then books Lovren for dissent. Maguire was certainly holding him, though Lovren was giving plenty back. 54 min Leicester are having a decent period of pressure, with Mahrez starting to look sharp. 53 min It’s been a manic start to the second half, with both teams lacking composure in possession. 52 min “Am I the only person who thinks Klopp is right in not buying bang average defenders,” says Mel Lynam. “Liverpool have enough of those over the years. Dortmund were built on Hummel and Subotic, and a decent holding midfielder. Klopp system demands ball-playing defenders, Keita is the holding midfielder. So for all the Kloppo-out eejits, be patient, I went to BVB v Hertha on a cold Friday night when I thought they were the two worst teams I ever seen, one got relegated (which I support) the other won the next two German titles.” 51 min There have been plenty of emails, only some of them abusive, about the foul by Matip on Vardy that ultimately led to Leicester’s goal. The consensus is: a) it was a clear block from Matip, and anyone who says otherwise just doesn’t understand football. b) it was a clear dive from Vardy, and anyone who says otherwise just doesn’t understand football. 48 min “Hey Rob,” says JR in Illinois. “I went to the farmer’s market at halftime of the West Ham-Spurs game. I bought some potatoes, red peppers, sweetcorn, and a loaf of bread (whole wheat sourdough). Let’s see if you publish this.” I’m not too proud to acknowledge another man’s superior eye for edible produce. 47 min Henderson’s cross is headed up in the air by Can and drops to Coutinho, who sidefoots a wobbling volley straight at Schmeichel from the left edge of the box. His technique was beautiful but the shot was too close to the keeper. 47 min “Is some of the Klopp backlash maybe just the media and the public getting tired of their shiny new toy?” says Shaun Wilkinson. “I have always liked him, but his behaviour on the touchline can be obnoxious. Also, he does need to stop speaking as if he has just inherited this team when questioned about its flaws - he has been here two years now. We saw a similar trend with Mourinho, where everyone was gushing when he was arrived but that soon faded. Is it just that the novelty of Klopp in England has begun to wear off at a time when the team is coincidentally having a sticky patch?” Yeah, I’m sure that’s a factor. It’s all very infantile. 46 min Peep peep! Leicester begin the second half. Okazaki’s disallowed goal “Have a look again Rob,” says Ricky Gill. “Maguire was offside when the freekick was taken. It doesn’t matter if Okazaki was onside or offside because Maguire was offside in the previous phase of play. Let’s see if you publish this.” Why wouldn’t I publish it? It’s not a custodial offence to admit being wrong. (And you’re right; I’ve since seen a replay and it was the correct decision.) That goal should enliven the second half. Okazaki didn’t do that much to Mignolet but it was a foul. Jordan Henderson was still chuntering to the referee as he left the pitch. See you in 10 minutes for the second half! Mignolet produced an excellent save to deny Vardy, only to make a mistake from the corner and let Leicester back in the game. Or so it seemed. Mignolet waved haplessly at the corner and got nowhere near it, with the ball rebounding towards goal for Okazaki to stab in from two yards. So far, so familiar - except replays showed that Okazaki was slyly holding Mignolet’s arm when he first tried to come for the corner. You can see why Liverpool are so aggrieved. Liverpool are furious about this. 45+2 min Matip is booked for cynically blocking Vardy, who was trying to close down Mignolet just outside the area. 44 min “As a Liverpool fan I’m firmly in the ‘Klopp In’ camp,” says Matt Dony. “Yes, it is frustrating that he didn’t buy a centre half over the summer, BUT he had identified Van Dijk as his ideal target, and initially tried very hard to sign him. Van Dijk wanted to move, and he clearly has a set of qualities that Klopp wants. Yes, there are other defenders around, but Klopp (like all top-level managers) knew exactly what he wanted, and refused to settle. Bearing in mind how the Neymar transfer skewed fees across the continent, any defender who would have been a clear upgrade on Lovren would have probably been in the £35-40m area, and really, does anyone want to see a club they support spend that kind of money on a ‘back-up plan’? Matip is a fine defender, I have hopes for Klavan, things could improve. I’m not saying they definitely will, but it’s not outside the realms of possibility. And then go back for Van Dijk next year.” I’d love to support a Jurgen Klopp team. I admire his willingness to play the long game with Van Dijk and Keita, though it’s a risky tactic in modern football. 43 min Firmino misses an excellent chance to make it 3-0. Liverpool broke decisively through Coutinho and then Can, who played a simple reverse pass to put Firmino clear on the left side of the box. He went for the first-time shot with his left foot and drove it a few yards wide of the far post. 40 min Okazaki has a goal wrongly disallowed for offside. A free-kick was lumped towards the edge of the area, at which point Okazaki was deliberately in an offside position. By the time it was headed into the area by Maguire, Okazaki was being played onside by Henderson and finished smartly past Mignolet. That counts as a different phase of play and so the goal should have counted. 35 min With a two-goal lead, Liverpool are content to play Leicester at their own counter-attacking game. Leicester are having more of the ball as a consequence, and Chilwell’s dangerous low cross is well claimed by Mignolet. 33 min “Any chance Moreno getting a bang to the head in the foul leading to the goal might knock some sense into him?” says Keith Tucker. “And now he might be able to defend?” That sounds like a great idea for a David Lynch football film: Twin Peake, in which Coventry defensive stalwart Trevor Peake suffers a blow to the head and starts playing like Jesper Olsen. 32 min Moreno’s long-range shot is blocked by a player in blue, possibly Simpson. 30 min “On Klopp, whilst football is of course ridiculous with its continual crisis mentality, doesn’t he deserve quite a bit of criticism?” says Andrew Hurley. “His football looks great when they are up against those who can’t defend and non-triers (Arsenal), but his failure to either play a striker (to win games they should) or buy a central defender (who can do that thing they’re supposed to, defend) is very strange indeed. His stubbornness doesn’t make much sense.” Oh definitely. Every manager deserves criticism, even Conte and Pochettino. It’s the tone and extent of the criticism that is so lamentable. 28 min Leicester make a mess of the free-kick. Shakespeare out! 27 min Mahrez slithers through a group of Liverpool defenders and is fouled by Moreno, 30 yards from goal. 24 min Klopp out! Oh yes, yes, yes. Coutinho puts Liverpool 2-0 up, curling a magnificent free-kick over the wall and into the corner. That was nigh-on perfect, an absolutely brilliant goal to go with his excellent cross for Salah’s first. 22 min After a good break from Liverpool, Ndidi is booked for a foul on Moreno 25 yards from goal. The free-kick is in a great position for Coutinho. 18 min This is a very entertaining game. Mignolet, dithering over a backpass, is closed down superbly by Vardy and screws the ball straight to Okazaki 35 yards from goal. He shoots first time and Mignolet, by now outside his area, stretches his left leg to divert the ball behind for a corner. 17 min Albrighton is booked for a foul on Salah. It was made by Coutinho, who curled a beautiful inswinging cross beyond the far post from just outside the area. Schmeichel was slow to get across his line, perhaps thinking the ball was going out of play, and Salah sneaked behind Chilwell to squeeze a header into the net at the near post. That’s an extremely good header, because the angle was so tight. The cross from Coutinho was a gem. Mohamed Salah redeems his miss with an excellent goal! 13 min Salah misses a great chance for Liverpool! Emre Can drove an excellent low shot from 25 yards that hit the inside of the far post and rebounded straight to Salah, who clipped it wide from 10 yards. That was a bad miss, because Schmeichel was still on all fours after trying to save Can’s shot. The one mitigating factor is the speed with which it rebounded to Salah. He should have scored though. 12 min “What the hell is Lovren doing?” says Cian McMahon. “Seriously? What is he doing? Terrible passing. Out of position on Vardy’s attack... he will be the bane of us today... mark my words.” It’s odd as he looked so good at Southampton. See also: Schneiderlin, Morgan; Shaw, Luke; and Chambers, Callum. 11 min Liverpool have had 78 per cent of possession, yet it feels like Leicester have been more threatening. 9 min Leicester look sharp on the counter-attack. Every defence knows what’s coming, but there’s not a lot they can do about it. It all revolves around Vardy, possibly the fastest England forward I’ve ever seen. 6 min The first chance goes to Leicester. Okazaki played a good pass down the left wing to Vardy, who was played onside by Lovren on the other side of the pitch. Matip couldn’t catch him and Vardy made an angled run into the box before curling a shot that was beaten away by Mignolet. The ball bounced up for Mahrez, who came on the blind side of Lovren and clipped the bouncing ball over the bar. That was a deceptively good chance for Mahrez, less so for Vardy because of the tight angle. 4 min These days, erery self-respecting attack needs an acronym these days. Today, Liverpool have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. 3 min A quiet start to the game. Liverpool are eight points behind the Manchesters, though a win would take up them to fifth. 1 min Peep peep! Liverpool kick off, from right to left if you like to paint televised pictures in your noggin. There’s an excellent atmosphere. Another email! Here’s Andrew Hurley. “Wenger (rightly) got criticised for the mess that was Arsenal’s transfers this summer (no midfielder, waiting for last minute to bid properly for Lemar, Sanchez staying/going/staying) but he did very very well, even in this market, to get nearly £40m for Oxlade-Chamberlain, a player given countless chances and who is, despite huge natural talent, frustrating, position-less, often lazy and very little end-product.” I’m loath to judge that transfer for a couple of years - his current performance level is not worth £40m, I agree, but his potential is worth more. If Klopp can’t get the best out of him, nobody will. An email! “Is it possible for the Premier League Crisis Baton to pass between players as well as clubs?” says Matt Loten. “If so, I would wager that Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain must be warrant a spell in possession - jumping ship from Arsenal, only to find he can’t even make a Liverpool lineup shorn of Mane, Lallana and, until today, Coutinho. Given that we live in an era when managers can be sacked four games into the season, surely we can call time on Chamberlain’s Liverpool career before the end of September?” I’m not sure what took you so long, Matt. You need to stop sitting on the fence. This is the age of Sav, not the 1990s. Leicester (4-4-1-1) Schmeichel; Simpson, Morgan, Maguire, Chilwell; Mahrez, Ndidi, King, Albrighton; Okazaki; Vardy. Substitutes: Hamer, Fuchs, Amartey, Iborra, Gray, Slimani, Iheanacho. Liverpool (4-3-3) Mignolet; Gomez, Matip, Lovren, Moreno; Can, Henderson, Wijnaldum; Salah, Firmino, Coutinho. Substitutes: Karius, Klavan, Alexander-Arnold, Milner, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Sturridge, Solanke. Referee Anthony Taylor. Welcome to 27 Days Later, a divisive tale of expectation, premature denunciation and Dejan Lovren. It’s four weeks tomorrow since Liverpool dismantled Arsenal with an exhilarating performance, yet in that short time the mood around Anfield has changed considerably. Liverpool are on a despicable run of FOUR games without a win, and Klopp has become the topic du jour for many an entitled blowhard. You don’t know what you’ve got until you’ve got rid of it. In years to come, Liverpool fans will go a big, rubbery one as they recall the swaggering football played under Klopp. Yet a fair percentage of those same fans are currently aboard a bandwagon to have him sacked. He isn’t perfect, and it’s hard to understand his blind defensive eye, but the anti-Klopp grandstanding is little more than reactionary nonsense in a sport that has lost all contact details for reality, logic and decency. This evening Liverpool have a tricky match at Leicester, whose ostensibly poor start to the season – four points from five games – should be qualified by the fact they’ve played Arsenal, Manchester United and Chelsea. Should. September is no time to judge any football manager, but we know that whoever loses this match will be going straight in the social-media dock. Kick off is at 5.30pm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27321","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T23:00:36Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,321","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27321","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27321","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,321","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/23/myanmar-images-show-villages-still-being-burned-says-amnesty","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T03:47:04Z","webTitle":"Myanmar: images show Rohingya villages still being burned, says Amnesty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/23/myanmar-images-show-villages-still-being-burned-says-amnesty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/23/myanmar-images-show-villages-still-being-burned-says-amnesty","fields":{"headline":"Myanmar: images show Rohingya villages still being burned, says Amnesty","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Amnesty International has said new satellite images and videos from Myanmar’s strife-torn Rakhine state show smoke rising from Rohingya Muslim villages, contradicting Aung San Suu Kyi’s claims that military operations there have ended. The London-based group said its sources in Rakhine claim the fires – captured in images as recently as Friday afternoon – were started by members of the Myanmar security forces and vigilante mobs. The latest violence in Myanmar has sent an estimated 429,000 Rohingya refugees fleeing to Bangladesh in less than a month. “This damning evidence from the ground and from space flies in the face of Aung Suu Kyi’s assertions to the world,” Tirana Hasan, Amnesty’s director of crisis response, said in a statement late Friday. “Rohingya homes and villages continue to burn, before, during and after their inhabitants take flight in terror. Not satisfied with simply forcing Rohingya from their homes, authorities seem intent on ensuring they have no homes to return to.” The senior US diplomat for south-east Asia said America remained deeply troubled by the ongoing crisis and allegations of human rights abuses in Rakhine. Deputy assistant secretary of state Patrick Murphy, speaking on Friday in a conference call from Bangkok, said while the U.S. condemns August attacks by Muslim Rohingya militants, the response from Myanmar’s security forces has been “disproportionate.” He called on security forces to end the violence in Rakhine, stop vigilantism there, protect civilians and facilitate humanitarian assistance in the area. Murphy also called on the security forces to work with the civilian government to implement the recommendations of a committee headed by former United Nations secretary-general Kofi Annan. Most of those fleeing have ended up in camps in the Bangladeshi district of Cox’s Bazar, which already had hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees who had fled prior rounds of violence in Myanmar. “The situation in the camps is so incredibly fragile, especially with regard to shelter, food and water, and sanitation, that one small event could lead to an outbreak that may be the tipping point between a crisis and a catastrophe,” Robert Onus, emergency coordinator for the medical relief agency Medecins San Frontieres, said on Thursday. “Hundreds of thousands of refugees are living in an extremely precarious situation, and all the preconditions for a public health disaster are there,” Onus said in a statement, calling for a “massive step-up of humanitarian aid.” Another danger was highlighted by the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, a co-winner of the Nobel peace prize in 1997, which condemned Myanmar’s use of anti-personnel mines along its border with Bangladesh. “According to eyewitness accounts, photographic evidence, and multiple reports, antipersonnel mines have been laid between Myanmar’s two major land crossings with Bangladesh, resulting in casualties among Rohingya refugees fleeing government attacks on their homes,” the group said. It demanded that Myanmar immediately cease using such weapons and accede to the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, to which 162 other nations are parties. The latest violence began when a Rohingya insurgent group launched deadly attacks on security posts 25 August, prompting Myanmar’s military to launch “clearance operations” to root out the rebels. Those fleeing have described indiscriminate attacks by security forces and Buddhist mobs. The government has blamed the Rohingya, saying they set fire to their own homes, but the U.N. and others accuse it of ethnic cleansing. Rohingya have faced persecution and discrimination in majority-Buddhist Myanmar for decades and are denied citizenship, even though many families have lived there for generations. The government says there is no such ethnicity as Rohingya and that they are Bengalis who illegally migrated to Myanmar from Bangladesh. Murphy said the US welcomed Aung San Suu Kyi’s decision to speak publicly about the problem this week. He also said the US realised that she had limited control over the security forces due to the nation’s “flawed constitution,” which allowed the military to remain politically powerful and guarantees it control of key ministries including those related to security and defense. Murphy said the US had warned Myanmar about potential repercussions it faces if it doesn’t address the crisis, including greater instability in Rakhine, threats to the stability of its borders, the risk of attracting international terrorists, scaring off investment, and ultimately stunting its transition to democracy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/23/australias-east-coast-sweats-under-unusual-spring-heat-wave","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T06:01:34Z","webTitle":"Australia's east coast sweats under unusual spring heat wave","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/23/australias-east-coast-sweats-under-unusual-spring-heat-wave","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/23/australias-east-coast-sweats-under-unusual-spring-heat-wave","fields":{"headline":"Australia's east coast sweats under unusual spring heat wave","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The east coast of Australia is sweltering through a spring heat wave, with parts of New South Wales reaching 40 degrees and more than 75 bushfires burning across the state and Queensland. The Bureau of Meteorology said Wilcannia in the far west of NSW reached 40.5 degrees about 3pm, a September record for the state. And an out of control grass fire east of Goulburn has forced authorities to close the Hume Highway in both directions. The fire is at “emergency” level, according to the Rural Fire Service, and is moving in an easterly direction towards the town of Hanging Rock. Firefighters and aircraft including the Large Air Tanker are working to slow the spread of the fire. Emergency alert telephone warnings are being issued to residents in the area. The RFS said: “if you are in the area of Hanging Rock Road and your plan is to leave, leave now in a northerly direction towards Sydney if the path is clear”. There are 55 fires currently burning across NSW, including 10 that were out of control by 2pm on Saturday. Total fire bans are in place throughout much of the state, and authorities are warning of severe fire danger in places across NSW throughout the day. There are also extreme fire danger warnings in place in parts of southeastern Queensland. September records were expected to tumble across large parts of NSW, with White Cliffs, Ivanhoe and Bourke all reaching 40 degrees by 3pm. The previous September record in NSW was 39.6 degrees. In Queensland, Birdsville reached 41.6 degrees and Ballera reached 40.7 by 3pm. Dean Sgarbossa, a senior meteorologist at the Bureau of Meteorology’s extreme weather desk, said heat had been building above inland northern Australia over the last week, thanks to a ridge of high pressure. An approaching cold front directed it over NSW and southern Queensland on Saturday. That will bring some relief for southern NSW and Victoria, but it will also bring strong winds. Severe weather warnings are in place for parts of South Australia, Victoria, Queensland and NSW. Below average temperatures in Western Australia While the east coast sweats, the western half of Western Australia is experiencing below average temperatures all the way up to Pilbara. Sgarbossa said parts of the state were experiencing “well and truly below average temperatures” because of a series of cold fronts. “And there is more cold air to come,” he said. “Unlike the east coast the south western half of Western Australia are seeing temperatures four to six degrees below average.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/28/country-diary-the-park-is-busy-with-people-but-the-heron-seems-to-be-in-a-different-reality","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T04:30:29Z","webTitle":"Country diary: London park heron","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/28/country-diary-the-park-is-busy-with-people-but-the-heron-seems-to-be-in-a-different-reality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/28/country-diary-the-park-is-busy-with-people-but-the-heron-seems-to-be-in-a-different-reality","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: the park is busy with people but the heron seems to be in a different reality","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Old Spear-Face crouches in the rushes. The great grey heron has folded itself, all beak and eye, wing and leg, invisibly for such a large bird, into the watery edge of bulrushes in a park busy with people. Perhaps the people pretend not to notice the heron so the heron believes it really is invisible; they may steal a glance at each other from different realities in the same place but their gazes never meet. Old Spear-Face is still, only slightly moving its head to watch the water for an eel or frog, while the surface reflects the finest autumn afternoon, high clouds and rumours of change in the trees. The bird’s eye, with its golden ring, has a determined look, like that of self-conscious cyclists, sellers of socialist papers, wedding photographers, proprietors of food stalls. Its wings cloak its body in plumy tassels of grey, and the scaly stick of its one leg (or so it seems) is jammed into the mud of the New river. Built in 1613 to carry fresh water from the Lea river and the springs along its 20-mile journey from Hertfordshire, the New river (technically a canal) runs into Clissold Park, 22 hectares in north London, before disappearing into a culvert. It once supplied water for all of London, most entertainingly for the aquatic theatre at Sadler’s Wells, which was close to its original endpoint. Once a private estate, Clissold Park, with its 18th-century hall, now belongs to the borough of Hackney and people go there to see fallow deer in a paddock, butterflies in a dome, budgies in an aviary and two goats in an enclosure. Overhead, wonderfully exotic ring-necked parakeets chime from horse chestnut trees. Conkers drop down to be gobbled up by the goats, which look as though they’ve been rescued from some satanic ritual and are definitely not right. .. Old Spear-face, like a Dickensian standard lamp, looks very slowly this way and that, peering into the aquatic theatre of the New river, being very secretive and not there.

The announcement from Beijing came at the end of a week that saw tensions rise between the US and North Korea, with the leaders of both countries trading insults. The Chinese ministry of commerce said in a statement that exports of refined petroleum products would be limited from 1 October and exports of condensates and liquefied natural gas would be stopped immediately to comply with the UN sanctions. Imports of textiles from North Korea would also be banned immediately, but textile trade contracts signed before 11 September would be respected if import formalities were completed before 10 December, the statement said. The moves follow the adoption of a unanimous UN security council agreement on sanctions after North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on 3 September. The resolution imposed a ban on condensates and natural gas liquids, a cap of 2m barrels a year on refined petroleum products and a cap on crude oil exports to North Korea at current levels. Russia urged calm on Friday after the US president, Donald Trump, called his North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong-un, a “madman”. Kim had called Trump a “mentally deranged US dotard” a day earlier after Trump had said Washington would “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatened the US or its allies. Trump announced new US sanctions on Thursday that he said would allow the targeting of companies and institutions which finance and facilitate trade with North Korea. The US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, also said banks doing business in North Korea would not be allowed to operate in the US. China has also urged calm, with the foreign minister, Wang Yi, telling his Japanese counterpart that Tokyo should not abandon dialogue over North Korea. Pyongyang has launched dozens of missiles this year, several of them flying over Japan, as it accelerates a weapons programme aimed at enabling it to target the US with a nuclear-tipped missile. The Australian foreign minister, Julie Bishop, said China’s cutting of oil exports to North Korea was a key move in the attempts to force the country to the negotiating table. “I actually believe oil is the game changer in the sanctions regime,” Bishop said. “China is clearly open to using its undoubted leverage – economic leverage. “I’m not suggesting diplomatic but economic leverage over North Korea, and from my discussions with the US administration I’m confident the US and China are engaged in very serious dialogue about how they are going to bring North Korea to the negotiating table.” The US and South Korea are technically still at war with North Korea because the 1950-53 war ended with a truce, not a peace treaty. Pyongyang accuses the US, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, of planning to invade, and regularly threatens to destroy it and its Asian allies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/23/rail-strikes-commuters-rmt-aslef-chris-grayling","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T15:00:19Z","webTitle":"Transport chaos looms as rail unions widen strikes over driver-only trains","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/23/rail-strikes-commuters-rmt-aslef-chris-grayling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/23/rail-strikes-commuters-rmt-aslef-chris-grayling","fields":{"headline":"Transport chaos looms as rail unions widen strikes over driver-only trains","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Pity British commuters this autumn. In southern England, Merseyside, East Anglia and the east coast main line they will face a wave of disruption after strikes were announced for Tuesday 3 October and Thursday 5 October. London Underground will also face disruption on the later date. Privately, the rail workers’ union, the RMT, and drivers’ union Aslef believe they can win improved pay and conditions for their members and ensure the safety of the travelling public as rail firms attempt to introduce trains without guards. This could all be in place by now, they argue, if the government – and in particular, transport secretary Chris Grayling – had given rail firms a free hand to negotiate. But according to the RMT, the rail workers’ union, the “dead hand” of Grayling has halted progress. RMT and Aslef are used to fighting disputes in the public eye and the walkouts have been meticulously planned for maximum political effect. They will coincide with the Conservative party’s annual conference in Manchester and follow proposed action by public sector unions including the PCS and the POA over the government’s refusal to lift the pay cap. These disputes also underline how difficult it is to modernise industries when technological progress appears to pose a direct threat to jobs. Industrial action is planned at Southern Rail, Merseyrail, Arriva Rail North and Greater Anglia in a row over the introduction of driver-only operated trains. The abolition of conductors is deemed unacceptable by rail unions, who are well aware that driverless trains could be the next development. An RMT spokesman said that after Southern Rail, Merseyrail, Arriva Rail North and Greater Anglia failed to engage properly in talks, he suspected the involvement of the transport secretary: “We believe that the dead hand of Chris Grayling has been at work. This is not normal in terms of industrial relations. Our belief is that it is politically driven by the DfT.” Economically driven might be more apt. The government is tired of pumping billions into Network Rail, the owner of Britain’s tracks and stations, and wants costs to be held down across the industry. It doesn’t take long for that sort of agenda to clash directly with unions. The RMT official added that Abellio, the Dutch government-owned company which has the Anglia franchise, last year reached an agreement with the RMT in Scotland in a similar dispute, but is not sitting down with the union now. “How come Abellio was able to strike a deal over Scotrail, but can’t do it on Anglia? If it was great deal there, why not here? Is it because the government wants train operators to take a stand?” Nonetheless, there are signs that the most divisive dispute – on Southern, Britain’s busiest commuter franchise – is not intractable. The negotiations with Southern, involving both rail unions, took a new turn last Thursday when Aslef claimed it was close to a deal. Details of the talks were withheld, but a joint statement said “significant progress” had been made in discussions between the union and Govia Thameslink. But this will probably come at a cost to intra-union relations. Tensions between Aslef and the RMT have increased over the past year. RMT officials are furious that Aslef negotiators have sought a preferential deal for their members behind the backs of fellow trade unionists. Aslef members have already rejected two offers recommended by the union — both of which offered concessions in exchange for drivers taking responsibility for closing train doors. This leaves RMT in the familiar position of being public enemy number one for the franchise owners. They claim that RMT is on a “national crusade” to gain more money and power for its members. Operators argue that driver-only operation (DOO) was introduced on the Bedford-St Pancras line in 1982 and has spread to about 30% of the UK mainline network, as well as London Underground, and results in a more efficient system. The RMT insists that operating with a guard is superior to DOO on safety grounds. In a dossier prepared last June, the union asked: “With the [DOO] model being nothing new, it is right to ask why, if it is so safe, has it been adopted by less than a third of the network? The answer is that it is unsafe, and unpopular with the public.” Southern said: “We are disappointed by this unnecessary action and the RMT’s continued refusal to engage with us in modernising the railway. Last strike, we ran a normal service on most routes but passengers will inevitably be affected in places and we deeply regret any inconvenience these strikes will cause.” The rail minister, Paul Maynard, accused the RMT of “playing political games” over the Southern dispute. He said: “On Southern, performance has been significantly better this year but this can only improve if industrial action by the trade unions stops. This is not about safety, as the regulator has ruled that driver-controlled trains are safe. No one is losing their job or any pay as a result of the changes being put in place.” The heyday for UK rail industry investment, which came after the Labour government created Network Rail from the ashes of Railtrack, is a distant era. As franchise owners and the government look for ways to save money, British commuters should be braced for more strikes.

The campaign Save Your Uber in London was set up by the ride-sharing firm on the Change.org website after it was announced on Friday that it would not have its licence renewed when it expires on 30 September. The petition had gained more than 500,000 signatures by Saturday afternoon as the company urged users to sign. Kajal Odedra, the UK director at Change.org, said: “That is the fastest growing petition we’ve seen in the UK this year. The speed with which this grew shows how powerful online campaigning can be.” Uber, which has 40,000 drivers in London and claims that 3.5 million people use the service, plans to appeal against the decision by TfL, which said the US-based company’s approach and conduct was “not fit and proper” to hold a private vehicle hire licence. The decision was backed by the capital’s black-cab drivers and the mayor, Sadiq Khan, who said anger from Uber customers and drivers should be directed at the company. “I know that Uber has become a popular service for many Londoners – but it would be wrong for TfL to license Uber if there was any way this could pose a threat to Londoners’ safety or security,” he said in a statement on Saturday. “As mayor of London I welcome innovative new companies that help Londoners by providing a better and more affordable service – but providing an innovative service is not an excuse for not following the rules. “I have every sympathy with Uber drivers and customers affected by this decision but their anger really should be directed at Uber. They have let down their drivers and customers by failing, in the view of TfL, to act as a fit and proper operator.”Fred Jones, Uber’s UK head of cities, said Khan and TfL had “caved to pressure from a small number of individuals and groups that want to protect the status quo and reduce consumer choice and competition”. He said TfL had regularly audited Uber during its five and half years operating in London. “They’ve carried out the largest audit in their history and we passed with flying colours,” he told the BBC. “The last time they audited us to check we were playing by the rules, they found that there were zero errors in our processes.” He said it was the responsibility of TfL to check and license Uber drivers. “When a driver signs up to the app, we make sure they’ve got all the correct paperwork from Transport for London but we don’t do background checks ourselves.” Earlier, Uber’s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, used Twitter to urge Londoners to “work with us” to resolve the issue. Khosrowshahi, who was brought in to lead the company after a string of scandals involving allegations of sexism and bullying, wrote to staff on Friday saying he was disappointed by TfL’s decision, which would have profound consequences for its drivers and users. But he admitted that the loss of its licence was the result of the company’s “bad reputation”. “While the impulse may be to say that this is unfair, one of the lessons I’ve learned over time is that change comes from self-reflection. So it’s worth examining how we got here,” the email to staff said. “The truth is that there is a high cost to a bad reputation. Irrespective of whether we did everything that is being said about us in London today (and to be clear, I don’t think we did), it really matters what people think of us, especially in a global business like ours, where actions in one part of the world can have serious consequences in another. “Going forward, it’s critical that we act with integrity in everything we do, and learn how to be a better partner to every city we operate in. That doesn’t mean abandoning our principles – we will vigorously appeal TfL’s decision – but rather building trust through our actions and our behavior. In doing so, we will show that Uber is not just a really great product, but a really great company that is meaningfully contributing to society, beyond its business and its bottom line.” Greg Hands, the government minister for London, criticised TfL’s decision. “At the flick of a pen Sadiq Khan is threatening to put 40,000 people out of work and leave 3.5 million users of Uber stranded,” he tweeted. He said Uber had to address safety concerns and it was important that there was a level playing field across the private hire sector in the capital, but added: “Blanket ban will cause massive inconvenience to millions of Londoners, showing that the mayor is closed to business &amp; innovation. Once again the actions of Labour leave ordinary working people [to] pay the price for it.” TfL said Uber could operate until the appeals process was exhausted, which could take months. The agency said: “Uber’s approach and conduct demonstrate a lack of corporate responsibility in relation to a number of issues which have potential public safety and security implications.” Specifically, TfL cited Uber’s approach to reporting serious criminal offences, background checks on drivers and software called Greyball that could be used to block regulators from gaining full access to the app. London’s traditional black-cab drivers have accused Uber of undercutting safety rules and threatening their livelihoods. Uber has been criticised by unions and MPs too and been embroiled in legal battles over workers’ rights. The Metropolitan police complained in August that Uber was either not disclosing, or taking too long to report, serious crimes, including sexual assaults, and this put the public at risk. Of the 154 allegations of rape or sexual assault made to police in London between February 2015 and February 2016 in which the suspect was a taxi driver, 32 concerned Uber, according to the capital’s police force. However, many people used social media to protest about the decision."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/23/kim-jong-un-the-nfl-and-screaming-at-senators-donald-trumps-strange-night-in-alabama","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T09:21:12Z","webTitle":"Kim Jong-un, the NFL and 'screaming at senators': Trump's Strange night in Alabama","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/23/kim-jong-un-the-nfl-and-screaming-at-senators-donald-trumps-strange-night-in-alabama","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/23/kim-jong-un-the-nfl-and-screaming-at-senators-donald-trumps-strange-night-in-alabama","fields":{"headline":"Kim Jong-un, the NFL and 'screaming at senators': Trump's Strange night in Alabama","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump gave one of his signature stream of consciousness speeches in Hunstville on Friday night as he tried to get out the vote for embattled Alabama Republican senator Luther Strange. During an address inside the Wernher Von Braun Center that lasted an hour and 20 minutes, the president called North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un “Little Rocket Man”, said NFL owners should cut players who kneel for the national anthem and returned to familiar targets like John McCain and Hillary Clinton. Strange is facing a runoff election on Tuesday for the GOP nomination to hold the seat he was appointed to in February. The former state attorney general was handed the seat after former senator Jeff Sessions was appointed attorney general by Trump. Strange is currently trailing in the polls against Roy Moore, an ardent social conservative who has twice been removed as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. The race has become a top priority for Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and a superPAC affiliated with him will spend over $9m on Strange’s behalf. The Alabama senator is seen as reliable vote for Republican priorities while Moore has mused about making “homosexual conduct” illegal and suggested that the terrorist attacks of 11 September may have been divine retribution for the United States turning away from God. The campaign has largely focused on McConnell. Moore has attacked the Senate majority leader as a creature of the “swamp” that Trump wishes to drain while Strange has tried to distance himself from the Kentucky Republican. Strange went as far as to assert in his brief introductory remarks on Friday night that Trump was backing him so that he could have the votes in the Senate to “stand up to Mitch McConnell.” The President later asserted that Strange “didn’t know” the Senate majority leader. Trump repeatedly praised Strange and often calling the 6’9ft senator “Big Luther.” However, he did note that Moore, who has been backed by a number of prominent conservatives including former Trump aide Steve Bannon, was “a good man” and that he would campaign for him if the former chief justice won on Tuesday. Instead of direct criticism, Trump simply claimed Moore would a face a difficult general election in deep red Alabama. He said Moore “has a very good chance of not winning a general election.” Trump also dwelled on the political risk he was taking backing Strange, insisting that the media would attack him if the Alabama Republican lost. In between his praise of Strange, Trump touched on a smorgasbord of topics. He renewed his criticism of Kim Jong-un, whom he called both “Rocket Man” and “Little Rocket Man” and warning of the risk posed by North Korea’s nuclear program and its recent threats to test a hydrogen bomb. “Now he’s talking about a massive weapon exploding over the Pacific Ocean, which causes calamity. Where the plume goes, so goes cancer, so goes tremendous problems.” However, Trump confidently said “I’m going to handle it”. Hours after John McCain torpedoed Republican hopes to repeal and replace Obamacare, Trump expressed his disappointment. He said McCain’s opposition was “totally unexpected and terrible”. He also chided the Arizona Republican for what he saw as hypocrisy. “Repeal and replace, John McCain if you look at his last campaign it’s all about repeal and replace and that’s fine, we still have a good chance [of repealing and replacing Obamacare.” He described his attempts to court senators on health care, saying “I’m on the phone screaming at people all day long for weeks”. Trump also returned to some of his favourite topics. He talked at length about the wall he hopes to build on the Mexican border, insisting it needed to be see-through. Trump said this was because drug dealers are currently using catapults to send 100 pound bags of drugs over the existing concrete wall and they are landing on people’s heads in the United States. He also responded the familiar cheers of “lock her up” directed at Hillary Clinton by telling the crowd “you gotta speak to Jeff Sessions about that”. The president also dwelled on NFL players who take a knee during the National Anthem in peaceful protest. He asked the crowd, “Wouldn’t you love one of the NFL owners when someone disrespects our flag, ‘get that son of a bitch off the field right now.’” He told attendees, “If you see it, leave the stadium, I guarantee things will stop.” Since 2016, a number of African American NFL players have taken a knee during the National Anthem. It was spurred by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick who was the first to do so in protest what he saw as oppression of people of color. Several other players have since followed suit and it has sparked national controversy. Trump’s visit to Alabama comes just four days before the primary runoff and only hours after Ben Carson, a member of Trump’s cabinet, issued a quasi-endorsement of Moore. In a statement issued by Moore’s campaign, Trump’s secretary of housing and urban development said “Judge Moore is a fine man of proven character and integrity, who I have come to respect over the years”. Carson did not explicitly endorse Moore though. Vice president Mike Pence, who will hold a rally for Strange in Birmingham, will follow Trump in Alabama on Monday. Moore is scheduled to hold an election eve rally with Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/22/ferguson-michael-brown-shooting-prosecutor-email","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T00:48:21Z","webTitle":"Lawyer urged prosecutor after Ferguson shooting: 'Do the right thing' for police","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/22/ferguson-michael-brown-shooting-prosecutor-email","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/22/ferguson-michael-brown-shooting-prosecutor-email","fields":{"headline":"Lawyer urged prosecutor after Ferguson shooting: 'Do the right thing' for police","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"An attorney whose firm represented the policeman who killed Michael Brown in Ferguson urged the local prosecutor a day after the 2014 shooting to “do the right thing” and said officers were depending on him, newly released records reveal. Jerome Simon emailed the message to the St Louis County prosecutor, Bob McCulloch, amid intense protests set off by Darren Wilson’s fatal shooting of Brown. McCulloch went on to preside over the controversial decision to not bring criminal charges against Wilson. “Dude, WTF? Do the right thing,” Simon wrote. “All of St Louis County is counting on your seasoned judgment and innate sense of essential justice for all – especially County Brown police officers.” St Louis County police officers are nicknamed for their brown uniforms. Simon’s firm, Pitzer Snodgrass, went on to defend Wilson and Ferguson in a civil lawsuit brought by Brown’s parents, which was settled by the city for $1.5m. Simon was apparently not directly involved in the case. He did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. The email from Simon to McCulloch on 10 Aug 2014 was one of the first few dozen released by McCulloch’s office in response to a public records lawsuit filed against it by the Guardian in St Louis County circuit court more than two years ago. Another released email showed that while Wilson’s case was being considered, one of McCulloch’s senior investigators sent McCulloch a link to an article from a rightwing website that described Brown as a “thug” and said: “All the evidence backs Officer Darren Wilson’s side of the story.” The investigator, Jim Maier, did not respond to a request for comment. It was not clear from the records released whether McCulloch replied to the messages. Since first being asked in a December 2014 records request for all his emails relating to the Ferguson case, McCulloch’s office has firmly resisted the publication of the records and tried to charge the Guardian tens of thousands of dollars to turn them over. Judge Barbara Wallace ordered McCulloch’s office in January this year to release the emails that were not protected by confidentiality or legal privilege. Wallace fined McCulloch’s office for violating Missouri’s public records laws with its response to the Guardian’s original request. Wilson’s deadly shooting of Brown in Ferguson, a previously obscure suburb of St Louis, was the major flashpoint behind a wave of demonstrations across the US in the subsequent years over the use of deadly force by police against African Americans. McCulloch was sharply criticised by activists and protesters for his handling of Wilson’s case. He put the case through an unusually extensive grand jury process without providing a recommendation as to whether Wilson should be charged, leading to suggestions from some analysts that the process had been more like a criminal trial managed behind closed doors. He defended his handling of the case. After McCulloch announced that Wilson would not be charged, in a November 2014 speech in which McCulloch also tore into protesters and the media, Ferguson erupted into fresh protests and rioting that left sections of the city burned to the ground. The son of a police officer who had aspired to follow his father’s career path before losing a leg to cancer, McCulloch was accused of having a record that displayed bias toward law enforcement. His dependence on the cooperation of local police officers for prosecuting other crimes led critics to claim he had a conflict of interest and to urge him to step aside and appoint a special prosecutor. He denied the claims."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/24/new-zealand-election-positive-jacinda-ardern-vows-to-fight-on","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T03:34:55Z","webTitle":"New Zealand election: 'positive' Jacinda Ardern vows to fight on","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/24/new-zealand-election-positive-jacinda-ardern-vows-to-fight-on","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/24/new-zealand-election-positive-jacinda-ardern-vows-to-fight-on","fields":{"headline":"New Zealand election: 'positive' Jacinda Ardern vows to fight on","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Jacinda Ardern has vowed to fight on for change in New Zealand government as coalition talks begin between the two major parties and kingmaker New Zealand First’s Winston Peters. Speaking outside her Auckland home on Sunday, Ardern said she was feeling positive and rested after Saturday’s election stalemate, which saw the ruling National party win 58 seats and Labour 45 – both short of the 61 needed to form a government in the 120-seat parliament. Peters, an unpredictable populist, was left as the kingmaker after winning nine seats. Dressed in her now trademark red Ardern looked optimistic as she addressed reporters, telling them she would make her first approach to Peters as soon as she could and would speak on Sunday to James Shaw whose Green party won seven seats. The Greens support was expected to lie with Labour though Ardern said this wasn’t guaranteed. She had not received any assurances from Shaw that he would not back National – though the two parties’ ideological clashes would make it a highly unusual and fraught partnership. Ardern was flanked by the most senior members of her team, including finance spokesperson Grant Robertson and deputy Kelvin Davis, who may play a crucial role in talks with Peters. Both come from Northland in the North Island and have a relationship that goes back decades. Ardern smiled as she explained the next phase of her “let’s do this” campaign, and seemed far from defeated despite the prospect of weeks of an unresolved government ahead of her. It seems Ardern is following the advice of those who know the veteran Peters well, and giving him the space and respect he needs to consider his options. “There are conversations to be had over the coming days and I intend to have them. It seems clear to me though, this morning, that Mr Peters in particular wants to take a bit of time. That’s something that I completely understand,” said Ardern. “The special votes will be incredibly interesting ... I don’t want to make too many predictions about what they will produce but I am hopefuly we’ll see a bit of a lift out of them.” Shortly after Ardern’s press conference Bill English also adressed the media, saying a two-party coalition would be more stable for New Zelanders. Former National prime minister John Key said Saturday’s result was “fantastic”. “My staff are in touch with Mr Peters staff to arrange a phone call which we expect will happen in the next few days and negotiations will begin from that point,” said English. “I think it is pretty clear-cut a two-party coalition would be more stable. It would have a narrower range of issues to resolve and you could practically operate government with sensible communication. We will be proceeding with negotiations with NZ First to make sure that would be the case ... and our position is almost 1 in 2 New Zealanders have supported National.” Ardern dodged questions from reporters about “what went wrong” with her campaign, after early optimism failed to translate into more gains. “The majority of people have voted against the stats quo, it is up to us then to see if we can produce government from that,” said Ardern, refusing to be cowed by lower-than expected votes for Labour after their huge surge in popularity shortly after she took over the leadership on 1 August. Ardern also said the “flavour” of NZ First’s campaign was “against the status quo”, hinting that Peters and his supporters may also be ready for a change in government after three terms of National. Up to 15% of the vote has yet to be counted as the special votes roll in from around the country and overseas. Past elections have shown overseas voters in particular tend to favour Labour and the Greens, which could mean a crucial extra one or two seats for Labour, which may help them in their negotiations with the minor parties. The special votes will be counted in the coming weeks, and it is likely discussion could drag on till 7 October. Ardern said she and Peters needed all the information collated before getting down to the nitty-gritty. “There are a number of factors that will be in play in these negotiations, including what shared views and common ground we have to work from,” said Ardern, who said Labour and NZ First had similar values regarding education, forestry and a desire to get on top of the housing crisis. Shaw did not rule out throwing the Greens’ seats behind National, but said it would be “very difficult” as his party had campaigned for a vote for change – meaning Labour at the helm. Australian Labor leader Bill Shorten sent his congratulations to Ardern on recovering so many votes from the public in such a short space of time. “I think the dust is still yet to settle and the counting is still yet to be concluded,” he said on Sunday morning. “But it certainly shows that people should never underestimate Labor, and I think New Zealand Labour came from behind to give it a pretty good shake.” Australian Labor managed a similar feat during the 2016 election, coming within a hair’s breathe of victory after being dismissed by pundits leading into the polls. Ardern said she had not had a chance to speak to Shorten but expected that she would have a conversation “as soon as we are both able”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/24/bill-shorten-visits-south-korea-to-address-nuclear-tensions","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T00:07:50Z","webTitle":"Bill Shorten visits South Korea to address nuclear tensions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/24/bill-shorten-visits-south-korea-to-address-nuclear-tensions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/24/bill-shorten-visits-south-korea-to-address-nuclear-tensions","fields":{"headline":"Bill Shorten visits South Korea to address nuclear tensions","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australia’s opposition leader, Bill Shorten, will meet with South Korea’s prime minister as part of a bid to reassure the region that Australia’s position on North Korea will not change, even if there is a change in government. Shorten and his foreign affairs spokeswoman, Penny Wong, have left for a four-day trip to South Korea and Japan, with meetings scheduled with Lee Nak-yeon, the former UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon, the commander of the US Forces in Korea, Gen Vincent Brooks, and Japan’s foreign minister, Taro Kono. The trip comes just days after the Australian foreign minister, Julie Bishop, used her address to the United Nations general assembly to condemn North Korea’s ongoing nuclear and missile provocations, and to call on the rogue nation’s allies China and Russia to continue applying pressure. On his way to the political hotspot, Shorten said North Korea was one area where Labor and the Coalition were in lockstep. “South Korea and Japan are critical to the economic and national security of our region,” he said. “And it is therefore important at a critical time, that both sides of Australian politics have the best possible understanding so we can make the best possible decisions. “And to be very clear, that this escalating tension in the Korean peninsula is a matter which goes towards the security of the region, but the broader world. “That’s why it is very important that all nations, including China and Russia, support the increased United Nations security council resolutions to put all possible pressure on the North Korean regime.” China has agreed to the latest sanctions, which include restricting its fuel exports to North Korea and putting a ban on Pyongyang’s second-biggest export, textiles. The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has pushed for China to do more, including cutting off the oil pipeline which provides North Korea with much of its fuel. Donald Trump used his first speech to the general assembly to warn the United States would “totally destroy” North Korea if it continued its weapons programs. North Korea responded by threatening to detonate a hydrogen bomb in the Pacific Ocean. The speech, and Trump’s Twitter feed, where he refers to Kim Jong-un as “Rocket Man” has resulted in an escalating war of words between the two leaders. A series of small earthquakes in North Korea this weekend sparked fears of another nuclear test, but experts believe the tremors to be natural."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/24/said-and-done-football-diary-fa-martin-glenn-uefa-fifa","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T08:30:40Z","webTitle":"Said & Done: ‘That consistency, that trust people have in us, is core to any FA’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/24/said-and-done-football-diary-fa-martin-glenn-uefa-fifa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/24/said-and-done-football-diary-fa-martin-glenn-uefa-fifa","fields":{"headline":"Said & Done: ‘That consistency, that trust people have in us, is core to any FA’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Man of the week Martin Glenn – saving face for “the grown-ups in the FA”.

Brooks – who is now replaced by John Lundstram to rapturous applause and “Brooks will tear you apart again” from the away faithful – will have caught several more eyes today. 83 min: Hooper has a drive deflected wide by O’Connell and Wednesday are still trying here. But again the corner is inadequate. 83 min: Jacob Butterfield is on for Wednesday but his first meaningful contribution is to send a weak corner towards the near post. 82 min: You wonder, too, whether losing this – if they do – will put some pressure on Carvalhal. Wednesday are 10th as things stand and after nine games that’s not a huge deal. But so many teams at this level are spending so much huge money, Wednesday included, and at some point you fear there’ll be consequences for the ones for whom it doesn’t pay off. Can Wednesday risk that? Will they? I stick by what I said at the top of the show – they’ve transformed as a club, sure, but should still be doing a little better given their resources. 79 min: Could you have seen this when Wednesday got it back to 2-2? Me neither. This says so much for United’s spirit and ingenuity – and not a lot for a frankly quite lily-livered Wednesday, whose defending has been really bad throughout. United have been very bright but you could argue that they haven’t had to work terribly hard for some of these goals. He’s got another and that is surely that! Clarke lays one back to Brooks, spins and goes for the return over the top. But he’s second favourite, maybe even third favourite. Lees or Van Aken should have this under control but no, it’s awfully feeble defending from the centre-backs and Clarke bundles past both, going face to face with Westwood and slotting home again! 76 min: Basham is booked for a pretty cynical trip on Hooper. Can Wednesday rouse themselves again? The free-kick is about 30 yards out and central. Wallace will go for goal ... but it’s scuffed into the wall. Managers – including the one who signed him, seemingly – aren’t always convinced by what he’s doing, or isn’t doing as the case may be, when he’s not scoring goals. 72 min: Yet more virtuoso play by Brooks brings a run inside from the right, a drilled shot and a crucial parry wide from Westwood. I must admit I’d hardly seen Brooks before today but he has been an absolute class apart. A former Manchester City youngster. This is his seventh Football League appearance and his second league start! 70 min: Bannan fires over from range. There’s no telling what will happen here now. It looked set fair for Wednesday to take this right by the horns after Joao’s goal. 69 min: What a special goal from Mark Duffy, a 31-year-old winger who has spent much of his career in the lower divisions. That is exactly how you silence a home crowd. Wednesday bring on the £10m Rhodes for Fletcher. I don’t believe it! Hillsborough is absolutely bouncing but United take possession after the kick-off and Clarke plays a cute ball around the back to Duffy, the substitute. He gets away down the right, turns a defender inside and out, and lashes across Westwood into the far corner from the tightest of angles! They are back in front! They’re not doing ok anymore! Wednesday work the ball too easily from halfway and Reach, very advanced on the left, centres low. A defender stumbles, leaving Joao to collect. A touch, a left-footed thwack from 10 yards, and Hillsborough goes berserk! The comeback is complete! They’re doing ok at the moment, Allen. 64 min: United have come well into this half now and win another corner, which Hooper clears ahead of his own ‘keeper. 63 min: Clarke misses a chance to seal it! Or probably seal it. The excellent Brooks completely destroys Hunt with a spellbinding turn and nutmeg on the left byline. Clarke is free and screaming for it to his right. Brooks makes the pass ... but overhits it slightly. Still, Clarke controls it as it pops up and is faced only with Westwood, who is advancing. He balloons it over! How costly could that be? United immediately replace Wright with Duffy. 61 min: Another Wednesday corner, slightly fortunately won by Reach after he’d overrun the ball. It comes in from the left ... but United do their job after a prolonged bout of very derby-like head tennis. 59 min: United get lucky there, though, as Wright misjudges a diagonal from Reach and Hooper, should he control the ball, is in. He can’t; it was difficult, to be fair ... 59 min: Free-kick for Wednesday, midway inside enemy territory, after Wright fells Hooper. It’s poor, but Lee salvages it before bursting into the box and losing control. Sheffield United will, increasingly, feel happier with themselves again and are showing more on the ball now too – although Brooks balloons over from a reasonable position 20 yards out as they toddle up the other end. 56 min: Clarke makes a determined run at Lees but, seemingly unwilling to take a shot or cross on his left foot, takes the ball a little too far and the chance goes. Space had opened up there. 55 min: Bannan sends Reach scampering away but the ball’s overcooked. One thing United will be happy with is that Wednesday haven’t fashioned a real chance from this early pressure. They’ll hope - and need – to slow things down. 52 min: Wednesday thread the ball along the edge of the United box and Carter-Vickers makes a vital interception before Wallace’s delivery can reach Hooper and Fletcher. Wednesday are pounding United with crosses at the moment, particularly from that left side. 50 min: Coutts nods that away. But this is an early barrage, one from which there’s a bit of respite as a speculative Reach shot is deflected for Blackman to smother. Very, very different look to Wednesday now. And a different sound to what had been a disgruntled crowd. 49 min: And another corner after Wallace and Hunt link up nicely down the right ... 48 min: It’s the predicted bright start from Wednesday and Fletcher should do better than be dispossessed on the left with team-mates to lay off to. Could be a long half for United at this rate. 47 min: I quite fancy Joao to liven things up for Wednesday in those spaces in front of the back four. Reach wins them an early corner and it’s diverted away from the lurking Fletcher. Wednesday make a change and it’s a fairly attacking one – Lucas Joao on for David Jones. Feels like it will be the classic “big first 15 minutes of the second half” for Sheffield United now. They had this, they really did, but Wednesday will come out punching ... How did Sheffield Wednesday get their name? Here’s a fun video from Alex Bellos and Ben Lyttleton, both good friends of this parish, which sheds some light: That was the last action of a half that United had completely controlled, scoring those two early goals and hardly finding themselves under any threat at all. Wednesday had been so poor, but now they’re right back in it and what a second half we’re in for now ... Game on! And United will be kicking themselves that they couldn’t hold out another 30 seconds, Wallace does brilliantly to hook a looping ball across from the right and Hooper gets across his man to snaffle up the half-chance at the near post. That has changed this game completely! 45 min: That was close to being some undeserved encouragement, though. Hunt drives a vicious effort in from the right corner of the area and it’s certainly on target, but Wright gets his head on the way and it soars over. Wednesday win one corner, then a second, but United survive. 44 min: Reach runs the ball out of play on the left, needlessly. Carvalhal frowns. The Blades fans cry out with laughter. The home fans glower. That’s how this is all going for Wednesday, who have been exceptionally poor. 42 min: O’Connell has a free header at the back stick from that corner, but the delivery was quite deep and he can’t get enough power on it. Still, Wednesday again look loose. 41 min: United win another corner after a slick move involving Stevens and Fleck on the left ... Yes, the pace thing is a real issue. Neither side has much of it but Wednesday look particularly laboured. 39 min: It’s really quiet inside Hillsborough at the moment. Hunt causes the volume to go up a notch after running onto a diagonal ball but the Wednesday right-back’s touch takes it backwards. 36 min: I haven’t mentioned Steven Fletcher yet either, so here’s a mention as he’s just won a free-kick from Carter-Vickers. Some expensive footballers need to be doing better than this for Wednesday. The free-kick comes to nought. 35 min: A right-sided United corner sails beyond everyone, but Brooks retrieves it and ... that’s a chance for Basham. Brooks’ cross flicks off the head of Hooper and, on the stretch, Basham volleys over from 15 yards. Could have been three at the feet of a more clinical finisher. 33 min: A promising-ish Wednesday move ends with a directionless Reach pass that Blackman – there’s a good reason I hadn’t named the United keeper til then, he’d barely been involved – gathers. Play quickly switches upfield and Clarke is sprung away again, Westwood coming out sharply to deny him on the right of the box. 31 min: Baldock volleys across the Wednesday goal but nobody is attacking it. Why take risks now? The Blades have this well under control. Meanwhile, the scene outside is still less than desirable ... 29 min: The Wednesday crowd howl at a backwards pass from midfield. They should be cheering two successfully put together on current form. United just haven’t let them play, but the speed with which the home team have looked a disconsolate and argumentative bunch must be a concern too. 27 min: Wednesday do win a corner though, through Reach, and it’s their first contribution of note since going two down. Lee’s delivery is good, but Wright clears from around the penalty spot and Brooks – the game’s best player so far – is able to counter rapidly before eventually conceding a free-kick. 25 min: United look like one of those promoted sides that, with momentum and organisation – not to mention individual talent, too – just keep striding on, making light of the level higher. Clarke shoots wide now and they are totally dominant. Adam Griffiths requests: “Could I get a Guardian MBM shout-out for my mate Rich Stokes, an Owls fan exiled in Melbourne; he’s stayed awake for this despite it being midnight-ish where he is and having to fly to Perth for work in a few hours. The things we do for football.” Worth it for you at the moment, Rich? 22 min: Wednesday could do with something perhaps a little quicker than they’d expected. At least some sort of comfort between now and half-time. They’d started to threaten properly just before the second goal. But there are pointing fingers and withering glances out there now. It’s not happening for them. 20 min: That ends up coming to nothing but United look so sharp here. Even so, could anybody have predicted a first 15 minutes like that? 19 min: Leon Clarke spent three and a half seasons at Wednesday but only scored 18 times and wasn’t exactly a popular figure. He’ll be far less popular now. Blades win another corner kick, in the meantime ... These guys will have mixed feelings ... Well I never! Westwood punches the corner away and, eventually, Wednesday clear beyond halfway. But it’s knocked straight back over the defence, a good 60 yards, and Clarke finds himself beyond the back line for the second time in a minute! This time he keeps his cool and slides home coolly. United are in dreamland! 14 min: Oooh, should Clarke do better there? He escapes beyond the home back line and then, with Van Aken belatedly for company, shrugs the centre-back off sufficiently to get a shot away. It’s tame and straight at Westwood. Then a lovely United move wins a corner ... 12 min: Bannan is shown the afternoon’s first card after going in late on O’Connell by the left touchline. It was pretty hefty, that, and he can’t have any complaints. Simon Hooper, the ref, will probably have a few more of those to flourish. 11 min: A glimmer for Wednesday left-back Reach, who makes a superb run into the box and takes a Bannan ball over the shoulder first-time. Really difficult one to execute though and he skews it across goal. Brooks then counters for United but is squeezed out when he gets to the box. Wasn’t much support there. 10 min: Jones can’t match Fleck. He tries to dink one but it flicks off the ball and over for a corner. The flag kick is wildly overhit by Wallace and goes out for a throw-in to jeers from the visiting support. 8 min: Now an equally – if not more - dangerously-positioned free-kick for Wednesday, on the edge of the ‘D’, for a foul on Hooper ... 7 min: It’s going to be tough for Wednesday now but they mustn’t panic, there’s time. They show for the first time as Hooper makes ground on the left before overhitting his cross. Eventually the move fizzles out but United will want not to sit too deep too early here. 5 min: That all came from a superb piece of initiative by Brooks to win the free-kick, and from an assertive all-round start by United. But the finish owed totally to Fleck. An exceptional hit and the away fans went berserk! Red smoke and arms everywhere. What a goal! What a way to start the derby! The free-kick takes an age to set up, but eventually United spring into action. It is backheeled to Fleck, rather than laid off to a decoy runner, and he blasts a vicious, swerving 25-yarder past a motionless Westwood and into the corner. Brilliant goal! 2 min: Bright start from United and Lees crudely halts a fine run from Brooks just beyond the ‘D’. Very dangerous, central free-kick for the visitors ... I should have mentioned this – Blades striker Clarke faces his former employers here .... Left to right they go. The noise!! The teams have emerged! And what a din they’ve emerged to! Shaun Wilkinson writes: “It’s a shame Billy Sharp is only on the bench, otherwise for me this would not be the Steel City derby, but the ‘Strikers who came to prominence by scoring loads of goals for Scunthorpe’ derby - Gary Hooper one side, Billy Sharp on the other. As you can probably guess, I am from Scunthorpe. Frivolity aside, great to see this derby back; Sheffield is a great city that deserves a proper derby.” Good point on the strikers, Shaun. Sharp looks a very handy sub for the Blades today. Was it the best, Blades? “I’ve asked this elsewhere and never received a proper explanation. Why is a local contest named after a city?” asks Ravi Raman. I’m not sure anybody knows definitively, Ravi, but the most commonly given explanation is that it originates from the Derby – the famous horse race founded by the Earl of Derby in 1780. It just spread from there to other tightly-fought contests between rivals. Not completely satisfactory, I know, but I think that’s widely held. Anyone know better? The “battle” thing might be worth thinking about. If we are being reductive, this looks as if it could come down to Wednesday’s guile vs United’s grit. Can United stop Wednesday playing? Can Wednesday open United up? Can United set a high tempo and cause problems of their own? Carvalhal on his first derby: “We can’t say that a derby is a normal game, the emotional environment is completely different. In practice for me as a coach it’s a normal game, I must be focus, looking at how the opposition play, their weak points and strong points. my players are ready [for a battle] all the time.” In case you’ve missed it, read this very nice preview of the game by Mr Nick Miller: Heavy weighting towards Scotland there ... Where would this rank in your list of UK derbies? I’d like to hear from you. For me, probably in the top five – certainly potential-wise. There’s something visceral about it. But it’d look better in the top flight. Here is a link to that famous semi-final from 1992/93. Well worth a few minutes of your time. Sheffield United have a few injuries and will particularly miss Clayton Donaldson, who scored twice on his debut earlier in the month after his move from Birmingham. On the bench for Wednesday is Jordan Rhodes, who cost around £10m from Middlesbrough earlier this year. That’s the Championship these days. And it’s partly why I think Wednesday, who lost to Huddersfield in last season’s play-offs, haven’t done quite as well over the last couple of seasons as is sometimes suggested. They’ve put a lot of money towards it and although I’d give them credit for sticking with Carvalhal, who is clearly a decent manager, the time will probably come where they want to be getting some end product. Sheffield Wednesday: Westwood, Hunt, Van Aken, Lees, Reach, Wallace, Jones, Lee, Bannan, Fletcher, Hooper. Subs: Wildsmith, Rhodes, Butterfield, Palmer, Nuhiu, Joao Pudil. Sheffield United: Blackman, Baldock, Carter-Vickers, Wright, Basham, O’Connell, Stevens, Fleck, Coutts, Brooks, Clarke. Subs: Moore, Lundstram, Sharp, Duffy, Lafferty, Evans, Carruthers. A little over 24 years ago, Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday met at Wembley in an FA Cup semi-final. It didn’t really seem too extraordinary back then, although the wonderful free-kick from Chris Waddle that opened the scoring sticks in the mind to this day and there is also the memory of a grizzled Alan Cork rolling in an equaliser for the Blades. Wednesday went on to win and ran Arsenal agonisingly close in the final after a replay; it isn’t an exaggeration to say football in the Steel City has not come remotely close to a peak like that last-four clash since then, not really. Meetings between the clubs – and what a derby this is, at its best – have tended to smell of decline. Until now. This is the first Sheffield derby in five and a half years, and the first to take place as high as the second tier in more than seven. Both teams are in the top 10 of the Championship; one of them, whatever happens, will be in the play-off positions at close of play today. While Sheffield Wednesday have come on very strong over the past two seasons under Carlos Carvalhal – perhaps not strong enough given the huge amount they’ve spent, if one is looking critically – it has been a slower route back for United after their prolonged stint in League One. Yet Chris Wilder’s team are the higher-placed of the two going into this one, lying seventh, and have started the season with real spark. Could we be about to see at least one Sheffield side finally make it back to the top flight? Whether today really helps us answer that question remains to be seen. It’ll be fast, fraught and vigorous, in front of a baying Hillsborough crowd. It will definitely be good fun in an old-fashioned football city that still, when you watch matches there, feels like a bit of a throwback – a welcome reminder of the spirit football still engenders, but perhaps used to give rise to more widely. Strap in, send your emails and tweets over when you get the chance, and let’s enjoy it. Kick-off is at 1.15pm UK time. Nick will be here shortly."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/24/jack-clifford-england-rugby-union-training-camp-autumn-internationals","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T13:33:00Z","webTitle":"Billy Vunipola out for four months and facing fight to make Six Nations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/24/jack-clifford-england-rugby-union-training-camp-autumn-internationals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/24/jack-clifford-england-rugby-union-training-camp-autumn-internationals","fields":{"headline":"Billy Vunipola out for four months and facing fight to make Six Nations","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"England and Saracens have been left with a gaping hole to fill after confirmation that Billy Vunipola will be out for four months following knee surgery. The No8 has had an operation to repair the meniscus on his right knee and now faces a race to be fit for the start of the Six Nations in February. Vunipola was forced to pull out of the British &amp; Irish Lions tour to New Zealand this summer with a shoulder problem. He also missed virtually the whole of last season’s Six Nations after sustaining a similar injury to the same knee. The injury that has already kept Manu Tuilagi out this autumn is not dissimilar and the early-season attrition rate shows little sign of slackening as England gather in Oxford for this week’s training camp. Harlequins’ Jack Clifford has been called up as Vunipola’s replacement, leaving Wasps’ Nathan Hughes in pole position to wear No8 in the November internationals. Saracens, too, will have to readjust with their South African flanker Michael Rhodes also now facing a lengthy lay-off. It is Vunipola’s absence, however, that will inevitably have the most serious impact. “For any team to lose a player of the ability of Billy is a blow and he will be missed through the autumn for both Saracens and England,” said Mark McCall, Saracens’ director of rugby. “It’s desperately disappointing for him, considering how hard he has worked during the off-season to get back to full fitness. But Billy is a resilient character and he’ll have a strong support network around him to get him back on the field in the best possible shape. What’s now important is his recovery and we look forward to his return later this season.” Vunipola, ironically, has been warning in recent days that the rugby authorities need to make more effort to protect players, given the game’s rising intensity. Proposals to extend the domestic season until the end of June have alarmed an increasing number of players with Vunipola, 24, declaring his body “could not handle” the repeated beatings it received. “It’s about the toil we’re put through,” he said, suggesting a strike might yet be the players’ response. “Something is going to give. Something might happen where we follow the NFL or NBA, where they had a lockout. It comes down to how much we play. I might think I’m strong and tough but I’m not. I just got worn down.” Another contender for an England squad place, Exeter’s Sam Simmonds, also left the field on a stretcher after a heavy collision with Hughes at Sandy Park but the Chiefs’ management say he was up and about in the dressing room after the game and are hopeful he will not be a long-term absentee."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/24/corbyn-refuses-to-rule-out-backing-strikes-deemed-illegal-under-trade-union-act","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T10:59:55Z","webTitle":"Corbyn refuses to rule out backing industrial action outside the law","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/24/corbyn-refuses-to-rule-out-backing-strikes-deemed-illegal-under-trade-union-act","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/24/corbyn-refuses-to-rule-out-backing-strikes-deemed-illegal-under-trade-union-act","fields":{"headline":"Corbyn refuses to rule out backing industrial action outside the law","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn has refused to rule out supporting illegal strikes by union-backed workers, but the Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, has said he would not expect Labour politicians to support industrial action outside the law. The Labour leader said he viewed the Conservatives’ 2016 Trade Union Act as “really unfair” and would back workers fighting for a fair pay rise. The change in the law makes strikes illegal unless at least half of eligible union members take part in the ballot, with public services such as fire brigades and teachers barred from striking unless 40% of union members vote in favour. “This law is something that is really unfair,” Corbyn said. “No MP, very few MPs, get more than 50% of their electorate. I think I was one of the very few who does.” Asked on the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday whether he would support workers going on strike regardless of the law, Corbyn refused to rule it out. “The clear answer is this: I support the campaign for a decent pay level in the public sector,” he said. “I will ensure that a Labour government repeal the existing trade union law and bring us in line with the international labour organisational conditions.” Corbyn was asked again whether he would rule out joining striking workers on the picket line if the strike contravened the statute. “I will be with those workers demanding a decent pay rise,” he said. McCluskey called on Theresa May to reach a compromise over strike ballots, saying he would support the 50% turnout threshold if there were secure workplace ballots instead of postal ballots. “I’m not looking to be pushed outside the law and I want to appeal to the prime minister. Don’t push ordinary working people outside the law,” he told ITV’s Peston on Sunday. “No one wants to step outside the law, least of all me.” The union leader said he did not expect Labour or any of its MPs to back illegal strike action as he knew they supported the aims of striking workers. “I am not looking for that support,” he said. Earlier on the show, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said he believed unions could reach the 50% threshold for strikes and take industrial action within the law. “You’ve got a lack of confidence in the working class. I haven’t,” he said. “You watch what will happen this coming winter, these strikes have been provoked by this current government and as a result of really pay being below inflation, wages being cut; you know we’ve got nurses going to food banks because their pay has been cut by 14% since these Tories have been in power. No wonder people are angry – I am.” Tom Watson, the deputy leader, gave a different answer from both Corbyn and McDonnell to the question of whether Labour would back illegal strikes. “We don’t want people to break the law,” he told Sky’s Niall Paterson on Sunday. “We are democrats but we’re going to change the law so that trade unionists can have greater rights because we think our current trade union laws are very unfair, particularly the last Trade Union Act, which we campaigned against in parliament, and the way to deal with this is to campaign against the government to change their own laws and if they don’t change them, elect a Labour government and we’ll change the law to make sure that our trade union laws are fair.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/24/corbyn-european-single-market-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T10:43:22Z","webTitle":"Corbyn says he is wary of committing to stay in European single market","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/24/corbyn-european-single-market-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/24/corbyn-european-single-market-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Corbyn says he is wary of committing to stay in European single market","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn has said he is wary of committing to stay in the European single market because it would restrict the powers of a future Labour government to implement party policies. Speaking from Labour conference in Brighton, the Labour leader said he wanted tariff-free access to the single market with a close relationship to the EU, but said he was wary of committing to full single market membership, akin to the deal Norway has with the EU, despite a recent poll showing 66% of Labour members back a single market deal. “We need to look very carefully at the terms of any trade relationship, because at the moment we are part of the single market, obviously,” he told the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show. “That has within it restrictions on state aid and state spending. “That has pressures on it, through the European Union, to privatise rail, for example, and other services. I think we have to be quite careful about the powers we need as national governments.” Corbyn said there was some dispute about how far governments could stretch state-aid rules, suggesting the government could have acted more decisively to protect the UK steel industry, something the Conservatives had said was constrained by EU rules. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, later did not definitively rule out staying in the single market, if it could be reformed. Speaking to ITV’s Peston on Sunday, he said Labour wanted to continue with the “benefits of single market and overcome some of the dis-benefits” but the structure of the relationship would be a matter for negotiations. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has said Labour’s policy is that Britain should remain in the single market and the customs union for a transitional period of two to four years after Brexit. Corbyn said a transitional period should last as long as necessary but it would not be as long as a decade. “I think it’s impossible for anyone to put an absolute figure on that,” he said. McDonnell told Peston on Sunday Labour’s position was that a transition should be as “short as possible but as long as necessary”, though probably not as long as four years. On Sunday, Corbyn supporters will attempt to block a vote at Labour conference on staying in the single market and maintaining free movement, a vote which if passed could contradict and embarrass the leadership. Corbyn told the BBC on Sunday he wanted members of the party to be able to have more of a binding say over policymaking. “We’re looking at how we can open the party up much more and make conference the final decider of policy,” he said. However, Labour’s pro-Europe membership may vote to take a differing view on Brexit to the Labour leadership, unless the issue is blocked from debate. On Sunday, an open letter from more than 30 MPs, as well as MEPs, Labour peers, trade union leaders and mayors, was published in the Observer, calling for Corbyn to commit to full and permanent membership of the single market, demanding that Labour showed “the courage of its convictions”. Momentum, the grassroots leftwing movement, has told its members to vote against the inclusion of Brexit as a topic to be voted on in Brighton. In an email to supporters, Momentum’s leadership said delegates should pick motions on housing, social care, the NHS and rail for a vote. Local Labour parties and the TSSA trade union have called for a vote on motions to change Labour’s Brexit policy – including maintaining free movement and keeping the UK within Europe’s single market. Brexit is due to be debated on Monday, but unless the topic is chosen to be put to a vote, the debate will have no effect on Labour policy. The director of the centrist pressure group Progress, Richard Angell, said: “It is shameful tactics by the Momentum leadership to try and stop members democratically discussing Brexit let alone committing the party to staying in the single market‬ permanently and debating the important principles of freedom of movement. “Most Momentum activists are desperate to stop a hard Brexit, but the secret Bennite Brexiteers want to keep Labour’s position as vague as possible for as long as possible – also known as a Tory-lite Brexit position. This is clearly Momentum using a ‘stitch and fix’ to avoid Jeremy Corbyn’s blushes.” In their open letter the MPs and senior figures in the Labour movement, including former shadow cabinet members Heidi Alexander and Chuka Umunna, as well as Clive Lewis, one of Corbyn’s closest allies in his early days as leader, say it is “unsustainable to say we are an anti-austerity party” while being in favour of leaving the single market and customs union."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/02/country-diary-kinder-scout-kestrel-charged-stillness-sudden-action","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T04:30:21Z","webTitle":"Country diary: the charged stillness of the kestrel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/02/country-diary-kinder-scout-kestrel-charged-stillness-sudden-action","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/02/country-diary-kinder-scout-kestrel-charged-stillness-sudden-action","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: the charged stillness of the kestrel","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The perfect wild camping place: an obliging flat spot next to a horseshoe-shaped meander where the stream has carved out a tall bank from the soft shale grit, offering water close to hand and shelter from the wind. Best of all, our tents face towards a slope covered in reefs of purple heather that are being prowled by a kestrel. Though dinner consists of a bag of rehydrated dust, the opportunity to eat while watching a wild bird at work without hurry or distraction makes it feel positively luxurious. I never fail to be captivated by kestrel flight; the suspenseful hovering, then the sudden swoop, that combination of charged stillness and sudden action that Gerard Manley Hopkins thrilled to in Windhover: “High there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing… / then off, off forth on swing, / As a skate’s heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend.” Over an hour or so it makes several apparently unsuccessful plunges into the heather before finally reappearing with a vole in its talons. Kestrels are traditionally thought of as commonplace; the ubiquitous “motorway falcon”, with a certain fragility to their often-short lives and a whiff of something disposable and plebeian, symbolised by Kes’s enduring image of one dumped callously in a Barnsley bin. But their numbers are in decline (precipitously so in Scotland), with agricultural intensification the prime suspect, and, with the resurgence of other raptors, their place above highways is just as likely to be occupied by a buzzard or even a red kite. In any case, there seems to be no shortage of them on Kinder Scout, the wild navel of northern England. Earlier in the day, we walked along the western edge of the plateau and saw maybe half a dozen hanging in the updraft or plummeting into peat groughs. Other aerial hunters prize speed or agility, but the kestrel achieves something far more impressive: motionlessness. Any fool can go fast, but it takes a master to stay still, and when I see a kestrel anchored in the air, rebuffing even the rowdiest wind, I see an uplifting symbol of control, craft, patience and endurance.

(See 6.10pm, 6.24pm and 6.37pm.) The topic was one of 13 on a list of potential subjects for contemporary motions, but eight other topics got chosen instead. Unions and Momentum, the pro-Corbyn group now backed by a large proportion on constituency party delegates, both opposed choosing Brexit as a subject for debate. A debate would have highlighted divisions between Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, who are relatively pro-Brexit, and the vocal pro-European faction in the party that wants to keep the UK in the single market. Corbyn revealed his latent Euroscepticism earlier in the day when he told Andrew Marr, in a wide-ranging interview (see 11.01am), that he thought staying in the single market could stop a Labour government implementing its policies. The row over Europe did not stop Corbyn receiving a rapturous welcome in the conference hall. Many speakers strongly praised his performance during the election, including the London mayor Sadiq Khan. Khan famously used his conference speech last year to suggest that Corbyn was not sufficiently focused on gaining power, but today he told a Guardian fringe that Corbyn’s energy and authenticity were the decisive factors in Labour’s better-than-expected election result. (See 4.54pm and 4.56pm.) That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Labour MPs from both sides of the Labour Party last night expressed their dismay at the decision not to debate Brexit. John Mann, the Bassetlaw MP who wants to end the free movement ofnLabour, said: This decision is wrong. We must have a debate in this party and the leadership must listen to the views of those ordinary union members who voted to leave. Alison McGovern, who chairs the centrist Progress grouping, told a rally in Brighton: I am gutted that our debate didn’t get through. I worry this it’s going to mean that our party isn’t going to be able to consider the biggest issue facing us for a generation. Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, has floated the idea of people being enrolled into trade unions when they get a job (unless they opt out, presumably), the Telegraph’s Kate McCann reports. The Daily Mirror’s Kevin Maguire points out that it is a bit rich for the Tories to criticise Labour for not voting on contentious policy issues at conference. (See 6.10pm.) More MPs and MEPs, mainly from the the centrist/Corbyn-sceptic/pro-European wing of the Labour party, have been complaining about the decision not to have a vote on Brexit and the single market. This is from the former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw. This is from Chuka Umunna, the former shadow business secretary. This is from Chris Leslie, the former shadow chancellor (although not for long). These are from Stephen Doughty, MP for Cardiff South and Penarth. From Mary Honeyball MEP From Jude Kirton-Darling MEP The Labour MP and former shadow health secretary Heidi Alexander says not having a vote on Brexit and the single market at the Labour conference will make the party “a laughing stock”, Her tweet has been retweeted by CCHQ. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has said Labour’s decision not to have a specific Brexit/single market debate amounts to “an abdication of responsibility”. She posted this on Twitter. She was responding to this tweet from the Evening Standard’s Pippa Crerar. The eight topics that have been chosen for contemporary motions. The various motions submitted on each topic will be “composited” - cut and pasted into one catch-all motion - and each one will be put to a vote after short debates between now and the end of conference. The eight topics are: Grenfell Tower, public sector pay, workers’ rights, growth and investment, the NHS, housing, social care and rail. The five topics that did not make it were: access to education, ban ‘conversion therapy’, LearnDirect, North Korea and Brexit. Labour has announced the results of the ballot on contemporary motions. Eight topics have been chosen for debate, out of 13 possible options, but Brexit has not made the list. This is a significant win for the Labour leadership, because any debate on a contemporary motion on Brexit would have become a debate about whether or not Labour should commit to keeping the UK in the single market or the customs union permanently. It would have exposed the divisions between the relatively pro-Brexit Jeremy Corbyn and the strongly anti-Brexit faction amongst the membership at large. As my colleague Jessica Elgot reported this morning, Momentum, the pro-Corbyn group, was telling supporters not to vote for an contemporary debate on Brexit. Momentum, the grassroots leftwing movement, has told its members to vote against the inclusion of Brexit as a topic to be voted on in Brighton. In an email to supporters, Momentum’s leadership said delegates should pick motions on housing, social care, the NHS and rail for a vote. Local Labour parties and the TSSA trade union have called for a vote on motions to change Labour’s Brexit policy – including maintaining free movement and keeping the UK within Europe’s single market. Brexit is due to be debated on Monday, but unless the topic is chosen to be put to a vote, the debate will have no effect on Labour policy. The director of the centrist pressure group Progress, Richard Angell, said: “It is shameful tactics by the Momentum leadership to try and stop members democratically discussing Brexit let alone committing the party to staying in the single market‬ permanently and debating the important principles of freedom of movement. “Most Momentum activists are desperate to stop a hard Brexit, but the secret Bennite Brexiteers want to keep Labour’s position as vague as possible for as long as possible – also known as a Tory-lite Brexit position. This is clearly Momentum using a ‘stitch and fix’ to avoid Jeremy Corbyn’s blushes.” There is a general debate on Brexit timetabled for tomorrow morning. But a debate on a contemporary motion would have forced the conference to take a position on longterm single market membership. Back in the conference centre Andrew Gwynne, the shadow communities secretary, has told delegates that Labour would deliver “a renaissance in local government” by giving councils more power, demanding greater transparency and boosting wages. As the Press Association report, Gwynne said the measures amounted to some of the largest reforms to local government in recent times. PA goes on: Under the plans Labour would ensure council services are run in-house as a default, to stop the tide of privatisation in local government. Any service that is outsourced would have to go through public consultation. But Labour would ensure private companies delivering public services would be subject to freedom of information, and demand extra transparency on their finances and performance. The party would also introduce a “fair wage” clause for outsourced services, to stop workers in the private sector having worse pay and conditions than colleagues in the public sector. Khan says he does not sleep much. He is a workaholic. He loves his job and thinks it is the best job in the world.. He has relatives in Pakistan. They think he has better opportunities in London than they have. Viner ends with a quickfire round. Tube or black cab? Tube, says Khan. Jeremy Corbyn or John McDonnell? Khan says he used to be the whip for both. They are both very good. “It is like saying which one of the Beatles” Jacob Rees-Mogg or Boris Johnson? Khan rejects them both. Metrosexual or one of the lads? Metrosexual, says Khan. Except for football. Khan says you can be a metrosexual footballer. Mrs Brown or Citizen Khan? Citizen Khan. Prime minister or England cricket captain? Khan says he thinks England missed out on him. When he was 15, he trialled with Surrey. He was not selected. He thinks he should have been, he says. He is still available. And that’s it. Q: When did you last suffer from self doubt? Khan says it was two days ago, going out with his daughters. He was wearing a red and blue shirt. He was told he was too old for red and blue. Q: Was Ed Miliband’s manifesto too cautious? Khan says that was a different era. And David Cameron was not Theresa May, he says. It is important to remember Labour did not win, he says. But it is going in the right direction. Q: What did you like about the manifesto? Khan says he thought the tuition fee policy was really brave. It showed Corbyn’s team understood what young people thought. He liked what the party was saying about vested interests, and about people working in the gig economy, during two or three jobs. And Corbyn did not triangulate. He was being authentic. And he says this was the first election he can remember where the Tories were not the party of law and order. Q: What do you make of Jeremy Corbyn and the election? Khan says Labour did not win. People who experience government policies know that. But Labour did very well, he says. He says May called the election because she was 20 points ahead in the polls. He says he tells school pupils it was like someone holding the FA cup early because the other team had injured players. Labour lost, but not 6-0. They lost 4-2, or 4-3. Q: Why did Labour do so well? Because of Jeremy Corbyn, his energy and authenticity, he says. He says he adopts that line from the West Wing: Let Jeremy be Jeremy. Q: The Guardian is publishing research showing 97% of top jobs go to whites. Why is that? Khan says that all people cannot be free if they are denied opportunities. He says when his father came to London, there were landlords who would put up signs saying “no blacks, no Irish, no dogs”. It was common to hear the N-word and the P-word, he says. He says his children have grown up in the same part of London. But they have not experienced that kind of discrimination. Q: None at all? Not the same kind of over discrimination, he says. He says minority people need opportunities. We all know great people in jobs who got their first break working for a relative. He says he tells BME people going into politics they don’t have to be as good as Barack Obama. He says confidence is an issue. Some white people feel confident about applying for jobs even if they are not fully qualified. But BME people may not have the same confidence even though they are more qualified, he says. Q: What do you think of Trump coming here on a state visit? Khan says having a state visit would be wrong. Q: Would you be willing to meet him? Khan says he has said that he would invite Trump to meet Muslim. He said he could come and meet his family. His family were not pleased, he says. He says some people only know about Islam from what they’ve seen in the media. He says he proposed inviting Trump to London to meet “pukka Londoners, pukka Muslims”. But that was before Trump said is more recent comments. Q: What do you think Donald Trump’s problem is with you as London’s first Muslim mayor? (Viner is channelling Mrs Merton.) Khan says he objected to the suggestion from Trump that he would ban Muslims, but make an exemption for Khan himself. (Khan responded by saying he did not want Trump to make an exception for him.) He says Trump was playing Islamic State’s game. And what message does that send out to American Muslims? Trump then said he would not forget Khan for what he said. Khan says he is a proud Westerner. But he is also proud to be a Muslim. There are some people trying to divide us. Khan says he will not let them. Q: Zac Goldsmith was engaged in something similar during the mayoral campaign. Khan says he is a big boy. He can cope with this. But he is worried about the impact on others. He says he has spent his life encouraging people from minorities to go into politics. But after the way he was treated by the Tories during the campaign, people came up to him and said they would not like to see their children go into politics. Q: What’s your favourite place outside London? Brighton of course, Khan jokes. Then he says he really loves Manchester. It is really buzzing, he says. Somehow we got onto the subject of football. Khan was playing in the traditional Labour party v the lobby conference football match this morning. After some prompting, Khan admits Labour lost 6 nil. The lobby were fielding ringers, he says. Khan says there are 1m Londoners from the EU. We should be glad they are here. Q: But we are leaving the single market? “Don’t speak too soon,” says Khan. He says Theresa May called an election to try to get a mandate for her form of Brexit. She did not get it. So the goalposts have moved, he says. He says Labour’s job is to make sure Q: So Brexit might not quite mean Brexit. “Let’s wait and see,” says Khan. He says he is not sure what she meant by that. Q: Do you ever feel London is in real trouble? No, says Khan. He says he fears the next generation could be less well off then this one. He says his parents came to the UK from Pakistan and wanted their children to be better off. That happened. But he cannot be sure the same will happen again. Q: There is a phrase “ghost mansions and zombie flats” to describe the empty luxury housing in London. What can be done about that? Khan says we need a sea change in attitudes from central London. Properties are being brought as investments, as “gold bricks”. Half of them are being brought for £200,000 to £500,000. So they are sold at prices some Londoners could afford. And yet they are being sold to foreigners and left empty. He says he is taking steps to ensure that these are offered for sale to Londoners first. That could be a condition of planning permission, he says. He also says central government could allow councils to levy a much higher council tax on these homes. At the moment the penalty for their being empty is minuscule. He says we should have homes for Londoners. But 2020 one out of three Londoners aged 30 will be living at home. He says he loves his two daughters, but he wants them to be able to leave home. Khan says Grenfell Tower was different. When Dany Cotton, the London fire commissioner, rang him in the early hours to tell him about it, she said she has never seen a fire like it. He says the terms of reference for the inquiry are too narrow. Q: Would you call it social murder, as John McDonnell did? Khan says he would not use that phrase. But in his mayoral campaign he talked about how London is now a tale of two cities, rich and poor. The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea is arguable the richest borough in the world. And yet Grenfell Tower was able to happen. That is unacceptable, he says. He says the local council is still “in denial”. Q: There has been an upturin in terrorism attacks in London. What is going on? Khan says the experts say what is happening is not a spike, but a shift. Between March this year and now, seven terror attacks have been thwarted, in addition to the ones that took place. That is about the same number as in the previous four years. So there has been a shift, he says. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, is being interviewed now by the Guardian editor Katharine Viner. We’re in a large room in the Hilton hotel, but the queue to get in stretched through the hotel lobby out of the main door onto the Brighton front. UPDATE: See what I mean ... Khan says he is a supporter of disruptive technology. With Facebook, the issues are different. He says that artificial intelligence (AI) should be used to ensure that extremist videos are taken down. He says the internet companies need to be more proactive. Viner starts by asking about Uber. Khan says he is quite old-fashioned. He thinks people should obey the rules. And in this case the ruled are applied in a quasi-judicial fashion by experts at Transport for London. If people are angry, they should direct their anger towards Uber. He says he is not going to apologise for enforcing rules created by parliament. He says TfL did not give just one reason for Uber losing its licence. It gave four. A woman who famously “had a go at Amber Rudd on Question Time” has attacked the Tories again at Labour conference, the Press Association reports. Michelle Dorrell hit the headlines in October 2015 when she launched an impassioned attack on the home secretary over tax credits. Dorrell told the BBC programme she was a Tory voter. But, addressing the Labour party conference for the first time, she said she had now joined the party “to fight back against the destruction of my children’s future”. She told the main conference hall: Good afternoon comrades, my name’s Michelle Dorrell, I’m from the Folkestone and Hythe CLP, and yes, I am the woman that had a go at Amber Rudd on Question Time. She told delegates how she, her husband and then three-year-old child were left homeless when they were younger, and that the council had housed them in social housing within months. Somewhere we could call home, somewhere free from the fear of homelessness and anxiety, where we could raise our children and, crucially, we could afford the rent. That was 15 years ago, and that safety net will never be available to my children or your children in the future. Not whilst we have a Tory Government hell bent on putting money, corporations and themselves before the people they’re meant to represent. Peston on Sunday this morning presented some new research about the factors explaining this year’s general election results. It was carried out by the National Centre for Social Research (NatCen) and in a blog on the NatCen website the psephologist John Curtice explains how Labour increased its share of the vote amongst the six groups that it says make up modern Britain: the Liberal Elite; Young, disaffected JAMs; Liberal Youth; Traditional Working Class; Socially Left Behind. The biggest increases in support were amongst these three groups. And here are the figures for all six groups, showing the percentage point increase in the proportion voting Labour between 2015 and 2017. Liberal youth: +14 Young, disaffected JAMS: +12 Liberal elite: +10 Socially left behind: +8 Comfortable Britain: +1 Traditional working class: +0 The largest group, by some measure, is Comfortable Britain. According to NatCen, they account for 26% of the electorate. The smallest groups are Socially left behind (11%) and traditional working class (14%). Curtice says the NatCen analysis shows that it was not being leftwing that primarily explained why Labour did so well at the election; what mattered most was being pro-EU. This point aside, what clearly emerges from our analysis is that Labour’s advance in the 2015 election was strongest not in left-wing Britain but rather in socially liberal Britain, a section of the country that is distinguished not so much by class and occupation as by education and, above all, age. Indeed, the age divide in the level of support for Labour is now bigger than the class divide – over half (53%) of the under forties voted Labour compared with just 27% of the over sixties. Labour’s advance in June then does not simply lie in the popularity of the more left-wing stance that the party adopted. Indeed, that may not have been particularly important at all. Rather, in an election in which Brexit and immigration were also central issues, Labour’s advance was strongest amongst those who were keenest on staying in the EU and those who were least concerned about immigration. That suggests that if Brexit does indeed go pear shaped and, as a result, Britain has another election soon, one more heave from Labour might be enough to win power. But if by 2022 Britain has sailed serenely into post-Brexit future, the party should not assume that another dose of Corbynism will pay a sufficient electoral dividend. The complaint about Labour MPs in the balcony not being able to speak at the conference has been acknowledged by the chair. (See 3.15pm.) Paddy Tipping, a former Labour MP who is now the Nottinghamshire police and crime commissioner, has just been called from the balcony to speak. He is criticising police cuts, and calling for more focus on crimes affecting women. He also says for the last two years police in Nottinghamshire have not taken anyone with a mental health problem into custody. This is from the Press Association’s Arj Singh. In an interview with the Guardian, Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary and a committed Jeremy Corbyn supporter, said he expected to see Corbyn’s critics marginalised at this year’s conference. “You will always get one or two irrelevant individuals desperately seeking a headline, but no one takes them seriously,” he said. He was talking about groups like Labour First, a group backing the so-called “centrists” or “moderates” in the party. It held a rally today, and here are some tweets about what was said. The BBC has embraced postmodernism. Not content with interviewing Jeremy Corbyn on the Andrew Marr Show, they also interviewed him about preparing for the interview. It went out on Facebook live, and here’s how it went. The most likely best-attended fringe event today was one on Brexit featuring Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, and various other Labour MPs, queues for which snaked several hundred metres from the door. If the party leadership would rather not talk about the issue, members certainly do. Starmer told the crammed room – a screen at the Odeon cinema adjoining the conference venue - that he wanted a final departure deal “that retains the benefits of the single market and the customs union”, and how this happened could be determined later. He said: That is because the single market and the customs union are hugely important to the future of our country. How we achieve that, in my view, is secondary to the fact that we do achieve it. We can go up hill and down dale about what that means for the single market and the customs unions, go round the houses and have any number of models. For me, what matters is the outcome. Sceptics might, of course, respond that access to these things without allowing continued freedom of movement, something Labour has not committed to, is not going to be accepted by the EU. Starmer was perhaps lucky in that he wasn’t challenged on this by a largely remain-oriented crowd at the event, organised by the Labour Movement for Europe – the crowds meant it started late and he had to dash elsewhere before the questions began. Starmer was, however, still there when the next speaker, Chuka Umunna, a leading light on the soft Brexit end of the party, served notice that this stance would not please everyone. Umunna, who began by admitting he and his fellow ex-remainers “have been a right pain in the arse for Keir”, said that while he was pleased at Labour’s shift over the summer to call for continued membership of the single market and customs union during a transition period, “we need to go further still”. He went on: Access is inferior to membership, and that’s why we need single market membership ... We’re pleased at the big step forwards. We just need to nudge to where we really want to go. Here is Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, on Jeremy Corbyn’s comments about Europe in his Marr interview. Cable said: Jeremy Corbyn has always wanted to leave the EU, leave the single market and leave the customs union. Now he is pulling out his old anti-EU arguments to defend Labour’s endorsement of Brexit. The idealistic, pro-EU, young people who have rallied behind Corbyn will be mortified to discover that he is working hand in glove with the Conservative party to promote a ‘hard’ Brexit. The Labour party conference is too London-centric to give a strong voice to people in the north of England, Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, has said On Sky’s Paterson on Sunday Clive Lewis, one of the Labour MPs saying that Labour should commit to keeping the UK in the single market and the customs union permanently, which would involve accepting freedom of movement, said opposition to freedom of movement was ultimately driven by racism. He told the programme: In Europe we have the freedom of movement and when you are talking about managing migration it ultimately always comes back down to – and you are not going to like to hear this but it always come back down to something the left in this country have much difficulty with - but ultimately it is about racism. That’s what it comes down to, it’s about racism. The Labour MP Caroline Flint, who was also on the programme and who thinks Labour has to respond to voter concerns about immigration, flatly disagreed. “Diane [Abbott] has said that she recognises - and Jeremy [Corbyn] has said, and I am absolutely at one with them on this - that there has to be some recognition that there needs to be some changes to the way that we handle movement from the EU,” she said. Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, told the BBC’s Sunday Politics earlier that he had doubts about the party’s manifesto plan to scrap tuition fees. Labour said the proposal would cost £11.2bn. Burnham said that he would rather see some of that money directed towards technical education. He told the programme: If you take a policy like tuition fees … If I had that money in Greater Manchester – a billion pounds, let’s say (that would be our share of that policy), yes, I would help university students but I wouldn’t spend it all on university students. He said he would look at spending more on apprentices and young people who wanted a technical education. We’ve got to be doing something for them as well. So that would be my message to the party – it’s good to have policies that connect with people but you also have to say, well is this really fair to everybody? Earlier I said that Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, told Peston on Sunday that he was not expecting Jeremy Corbyn and other Labour MPs to explicitly back the idea of unions holding illegal strikes. (See 10.45am.) Here is the full quote. McCluskey said: I don’t expect the leadership of the Labour party or any Labour MP to support a call to be outside of the law. I know that they are opposed to the current law and they will do all they can inside parliament to change this law. So I’m not, I’m not looking for that support. Here is the text of Diane Abbott’s speech to the conference. And here are the main points. Abbott, the shadow home secretary, claimed the Tories have “weaponised immigration”. She said: Tory opportunism on immigration is a disgrace. They continue to talk about bogus immigration targets, which they have not met and will never meet. The Tories have weaponised immigration. Using the language in Labour’s manifesto, Abbott said that Labour’s approach to immigration in government would focus on “fairness and the reasonable management of migration”. But she also strongly stressed the benefits of immigration. She said Labour would reverse the government’s cuts to the counter-terrorism budget. She said she thought the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea should be taken over by commissioners because of its failings over Grenfell Tower. The Tory controlled Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea treated the residents of Grenfell like second class citizens. And when the disaster struck the Royal Borough’s response was shameful. Even now, out of the all the families made homeless only a handful have been offered permanent homes. And this in a borough with over two thousand empty properties. Am I the only person wondering why Commissioners have not been sent into the failing Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea? She said the Grenfell Tower fire was “a direct consequence of deregulation of fire standards and inspection, privatisation and outsourcing”. She said the fire service should be the lead agency for fire inspections and assessing fire risk. She said a Labour government would order inquiries into three separate miscarriage of justice allegations involving the treatment of workers involved in industrial disputes: Orgreave, the Shrewsbury 24 and the 37 Cammell Laird workers. The Tories are determined to attack Jeremy Corbyn for supporting illegal strikes - even though he didn’t (at least, not explicitly.) This is what Conservative HQ has put out in response to the Corbyn interview with Andrew Marr. (See 11.01am.) This is from Patrick McLoughlin, the Conservative party chairman. Jeremy Corbyn seems unable to give a straight answer to a simple question. Today he refused to commit to controlling migration from the EU and he refused to condemn illegal strikes. Jeremy Corbyn is once again showing he is unfit to govern. He would backtrack on Brexit and fail to take the balanced approach on the economy that this country needs - and it would be ordinary working people that pay the price. In the protecting our communities debate Daniel Harris, a delegate from Hove, has just addressed conference. He said he used to be in care, and was homeless until a couple of years ago. He said when he was living in emergency accommodation, he saw people die because they were not getting the support they needed. There was no support to help people considering suicide, he said. The government had to build more housing, he said. One million extra homes was not enough. We need 2m, 3m, 5m homes, he said. Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leadership contender, has relinquished his shares in his family’s cash and carry firm in an effort to head off mounting charges of hypocrisy over its minimum wages and non-unionised workforce. Sarwar announced on Saturday he was putting his 23% shareholding in United Wholesale (Scotland) Ltd, which have a value on paper of about £4.8m, into a blind trust for his three children and had signed deeds relinquishing any benefits from the shares. Sarwar has been dogged by revelations that undermine his claim to be a democratic socialist who supports Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership after it emerged UWS pays many of its 250 staff the basic minimum wage, and has no recognition deal with the shop workers union Usdaw. Sarwar’s move came on the eve of UK Labour’s annual conference in Brighton, where his left-wing rival for the Scottish leadership, Richard Leonard, is likely to receive a warmer reception from delegates. Now emerging as the front-runner, Leonard is a former GMB political officer who trades heavily on his consistent and long-standing support for Corbyn’s agenda. His campaign is now being coordinated by Simon Fletcher, Corbyn’s former campaign director and chief of staff, and an aide to both Ken Livingstone while London mayor and Ed Miliband. The two men go head-to-head at a conference hustings on Tuesday, organised by the Daily Record newspaper. Although Sarwar has since made his peace with Corbyn’s allies at Holyrood after signing an anti-Corbyn letter last year, Leonard is being backed by Corbyn’s supporters in Scotland and several unions, including Unite. Sarwar has repeatedly insisted he has no say over the company’s policies and has never been a director, working only as an NHS dentist, yet he sidestepped questions by the Guardian and BBC Radio Scotland last week on whether he personally benefitted from his shareholding. He was asked whether he received any remuneration from UWS, and said no in both cases, yet failed to disclose he had had up to £20,000 a year in share dividends until he became an MSP in May 2016. He and his wife send their three children to a £10,000 a year fee-paying school in Glasgow. UWS also donated £12,500 to Sarwar’s office while he was an MP, in 2010 and 2011. The firm was set up by his father Mohammed Sarwar, the former Labour MP for Glasgow Central. Anas Sarwar said he backed proposals to ban MSPs from holding second jobs while in office. In a statement on Saturday, Sarwar said: “Scotland has cradled my family, nurtured it and gave it opportunity and success. And it’s the Labour party that allowed them to share that success to help others. I’m in the Labour party because of those values and because I know our party remains the single best vehicle for change in this country.” Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, is addressing the conference now. I will post a summary when I’ve seen a text of her speech. Here are the main points from John McDonnell’s interview on Peston on Sunday. McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said it was “difficult to see” how Labour could support staying in the single market permanently given the way it operates. In this, he was echoing the position set out by Jeremy Corbyn in his Marr interview. (See 11.01am.) But McDonnell also floated the possibility of the single market being reformed in such a way as to make it acceptable to Labour. (See 11.21am.) He said: Our view is that the single market at the moment, in terms of the decision of the referendum - [it] is difficult to see how we can maintain within, with all the four freedoms that need to be guaranteed. However, you know we’re talking to our European colleagues [about] what reforms can take place, how we can achieve a relationship which ... receives the benefits of the single market. So I think we’re moving on in these discussions. He signalled that he was in favour of a Brexit transition lasting longer than two years. On the subject of the transition, he said: We made it very very clear, there had to be a transition deal ... [The Conservatives have] set this two year period, we’ve said as short as possible but as long as necessary. So we’ve got this flexibility … We think there’s an element of flexibility beyond the two years that might be necessary in certain sectors of work. When it was put to him that Chuka Umunna, the Labour MP, was saying Labour backed a transition lasting up to four years, he replied: “Chuka and I, there’s not a cigarette paper between us.” But McDonnell did subsequently admit he was not proposing that the UK should stay in the single market indefinitely, as Umunna is. McDonnell said the next Labour manifesto would address the issue of what to do about student debt. The last manifesto just committed the party to getting rid of tuition fees (ie, helping future students but not past students), but shortly before polling day Jeremy Corbyn gave an interview to NME floating the prospect of Labour writing off some student tuition fee debt. McDonnell said: In the preparation for the next general election our next manifesto, we’re going to look at all the debt itself. He also referred to a recent Institute for Fiscal Studies report on this subject. The IFS said that claims that writing off all student tuition fee debt would cost £100bn were wrong, and that if only the debt incurred by the increase in tuition fees from £3,000 to £9,000 were included, the cost of writing it off would be £10bn by 2050. He described Uber as “a disgrace”. He said he did not think he had ever used an Uber himself, but that he could not be sure because sometimes broadcasters booked taxis for him to use. Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, was more specific than his leader Jeremy Corbyn when asked on Sky this morning the question about whether Labour should back trade unions holding illegal strikes. He replied: I have actually received a letter from Len McCluskey this week where he says he accepts Labour MPs aren’t going to support calls for illegal strike action. We don’t support people breaking the law. We don’t want people to break the law, we are democrats. We are going to change the law so that trade unionists can have greater rights because we think our current framework of laws is very unfair. On Twitter Andy Tarrant, an EU competition law specialist, flags up a report he wrote with Andrea Biondi, a law professor, for the Renewal: A Journal of Social Democracy saying that EU law would not stop Labour implementing its policies. He thinks Jeremy Corbyn was wrong in what he said about this on the Marr show. (See 11.01am.) Here is their conclusion. As it develops its position on the UK’s future relationship with the EU, the Labour party should not be held back by incorrect assumptions about the constraints imposed by single market membership on its economic policies. Neither EU state aid rules, nor other EU rules which are distinct from state aid rules but sometimes considered in the same bracket, provide any obvious barrier to the implementation in the UK of the measures contained in Labour’s 2017 election manifesto. In his Peston on Sunday interview John McDonnell was also asked about the possibility of Labour staying in the EU single market permanently. He said, given the way it operated at the moment, it was “difficult to see” how Labour could agree to stay in it. But he also floated the possibility of it being reformed. Labour was talking to EU allies about this, he said. Those discussions were “moving on”, he said. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, was interviewed on Peston on Sunday. Like Jeremy Corbyn, he was also asked if the unions would be justified going on strike if they failed to meet the thresholds set out in the Trade Union Act. He brushed aside the question, saying he thought it was irrelevant because enough people would vote to strike to ensure the thresholds were met. When Robert Peston asked what would happen if they did not meet the threshold, McDonnell told him that he had “a lack of confidence in the working class” and that he (McDonnell) didn’t. In this clip Peston is asking about the 50% threshold. This applies to the provision in the Trade Union Act saying 50% of workers have to take part in a strike ballot for it to be valid (which means just over 25% of the workforce have to be in favour.) But the act also says that, in some public services, 40% of the workforce have to cast a vote in favour of the strike. McDonnell seemed to be implying he thought this threshold could be met too. At Brighton the conference proceedings have started. Jeremy Corbyn has received a hero’s welcome, Politico’s Jack Blanchard reports. Here are the main points from Jeremy Corbyn’s interview with Andrew Marr. Corbyn suggested he was opposed to the UK staying in the EU single market permanently because that could stop Labour implementing its policies. (See 10.15am.) When asked for an example, he said that the government claimed EU state aide rules stopped it intervening to protect the Redcar steelworks. But Corbyn also admitted that Labour argued otherwise at the time, and that state aid rules were not enforced consistently by EU member states. (See 9.41am.) His stance on the single market is highly significant because he is under pressure from pro-Europeans in the part to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and the customs union permanently. He suggested Labour could back a Brexit transition period lasting longer than two years. Labour has said it wants the UK to stay in the single market and the customs union during the transition. Asked how long that would be, Corbyn said the transition should last “as long as necessary”. When asked if it could last 10 years, he said he did not think so. But he said the two-year timetable for a transition set by Theresa May was abritrary. “I’m not quite sure where this two-year figure came from,” he said. He said he expected “a lot of movement” between the UK and Europe to continue after Brexit. Asked what he felt about Labour members wanting to keep free movement, he said he understood what they were saying. But he said he was opposed to the abuse of free movement by some employers. He went on: But we have to recognise that in the future we are going to need people to work in Europe, and people from Europe are going to need to work here. There’s going to be a lot of movement. He claimed that May was planning trade deals that would lead to workers’ rights being diminished. I’m very concerned about the idea that Theresa May and others have been flying around the world this summer offering all kinds of sweetheart trade deals which could be damaging to our working conditions in this country. May claims that workers’ rights will not be weakened after Brexit under her government. Corbyn refused to explicitly defend Unite’s right to hold an illegal strike in favour of higher pay. Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, has said the union could hold a strike in defiance of the Trade Union Act (which sets a turnout thresholds for strikes). Corbyn expressed strong sympathy for the Unite position, but, despite being pressed on this repeatedly, he would not explicitly say it would be right for them to break the law. McCluskey has defended Corbyn’s approach. See 10.45am. He played down suggestions that an interview in today’s Sunday Mirror meant he was hoping to serve two terms as prime minister. Asked about this, he replied: What I said was that we need at least two terms of a Labour government to start to address issues of poverty and injustice and inequality in Britain and to build the houses we need in this country. He said he did not think he had ever taken an Uber. But he defended the Transport for London proposal to take away its licence. There had to be “proper regulation” of taxis, he said. (Corbyn is getting some mockery on social media for not knowing if he has ever used an Uber, but his uncertainty is understandable; politicians at his level routinely let other people - aides, or TV producers - fix them up with a taxi, and so he was probably answering like that in case he has jumped in one inadvertently.) On Peston on Sunday Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, has just said he does not expect Jeremy Corbyn or other Labour MPs to speak out in favour of Unite holding an illegal strike. He said he was satisfied with Labour’s position because it wanted to repeal the Trade Union Act. This effectively immunises Jeremy Corbyn from any criticism from the left over the fact that he would not explicitly back the idea of Unite breaking the law in his Marr interview - see 9.52am. But it is hard to imagine that anyone on the left was likely to criticise Corbyn anyway, because he did implicitly back Unite and McCluskey’s stance. UPDATE: Here is McCluskey’s quote. I don’t expect the leadership of the Labour party or any Labour MP to support a call to be outside of the law. I know that they are opposed to the current law and they will do all they can inside parliament to change this law. So I’m not, I’m not looking for that support. This is what Jeremy Corbyn said in his interview about how staying in the EU single market could stop him implementing Labour policies. (See 9.41am.) When it was put to him that 66% of Labour members want to stay in the single market, he said he would listen to them. He also said he wanted tariff-free access to the single market. But he want on: I would also say that we need to look very carefully at the terms of any trade relationship, because at the moment we are part of the single market, obviously. That has within it restrictions on state aid and state spending. That has pressures on it, through the European Union, to privatise rail, for example, and other services. I think we have to be quite careful about the powers we need as national governments. Q: Labour’s manifesto proposed spending more money on getting rid of tuition fees, which would help middle class students, than on raising benefits. Why are you prioritising the middle class over the poor? Corbyn says Labour would start by spending £2bn on raising benefits. But that would not be the end of it, he says. Q: You used to be on the fringe at Labour conferences. Now you are in charge. Is this revolution permanent? Corbyn says a lot of people were fed up with the way things were. And that’s it. I’ll post a summary shortly. Q: Churchill’s government in the 1950s had much higher death duties than we have now. Why are you so worried about taxing wealth? Corbyn says he is not worried about taxing wealth. But he wants to tackle tax evasion and tax avoidance first. Q: A lot of people on Twitter are surprised you cannot answer the question about supporting illegal strikes. Corbyn says he will be with workers supporting a decent pay rise. Corbyn says he does not think he has ever taken an Uber. Q: After 10 years of a Labour government, would Britain be like Venezuela. Corbyn says after 10 years of Labour, Britain would be much fairer. Q: Some people may like your ideas, but feel you do not really understand the market economy. Corbyn says Labour would set up a national investment bank. It would invest in infrastructure. Q: Your tax proposals are quite modest. Vince Cable is talking about a wealth tax. Why won’t you? Corbyn says Labour has put forward plans to raise more money from business. We can’t stand still. We need an investment-led economy. Q: Do you agree with Len McCluskey that trade unions should defy the law on strike thresholds? Corbyn says unions represent their members. Instead of blaming them, let’s look at the conditions they face. Q: The new law has put unions in a difficult position? Corbyn says the new law is very unfair. Q: McCluskey says the law must be resisted. He cited Ghandi and Mandela as examples of people who resisted unfair laws. Corbyn says governments that try to interfere with unions get into a mess. Q: So do you agree with McCluskey. Corbyn says we have rights secured because people protested. Q: You are supposed to be a straight talker, yet you won’t answer the question. Corbyn says he is supporting working people, and that Labour will repeal this law. Q: Will you back workers if they go on strike on this? Corbyn says he will do that. Corbyn condemns the government’s Trade Union Act, but refuses to explicitly say that unions would be right to defy it. Q: On pay, do you agree that a public sector pay rise would have to be more than 5%? Corbyn says any pay rise would have to take into account the current level of inflation, almost 3%, Public sector workers should have a reasonable pay rise. Q: Should it be 5%? Corbyn says this has to be negotiated. Q: Do you want to stay inside the customs union permanently. Corbyn says the UK should stay in for as long as necessary. Q: How long will that be? Ten years? Corbyn says he does not think so. But he says he does not know where the idea of the transition lasting two years came from. Corbyn says he wants to protect consumer and workers’ rights after Brexit. He also wants to remain a member of some EU agencies. We have to recognise the economic importance of Europe, he says. He wants to continue a “good relationship with Europe”. He says he is worried May has been going around the world offering sweetheart trade deals that could be damaging to workers’ rights. Q: Some of your members want to keep free movement. Do you agree with them? Corbyn says he understands their point of view. But he is opposed to people coming to the UK from abroad and being exploited. Q: Will Labour members be able to make policy at conference? Corbyn says he has put plans forward to the national executive. He wants conference to take the final decision about policy. Q: Some 66% of members want to stay in the single market. Will you listen to them? Of course, says Corbyn. He says a large amount of UK trade is with Europe. We need to protect that. But he says he wants the government to be able to intervene in the economy in ways that might be blocked by Europe. Q: Can you give an example? Corbyn cites the steel industry, and proposals to save Redcar. Some countries flout state aid rules. Others don’t. Corbyn says EU membership could stop a Labour government intervening to protect the economy. Andrew Marr is now interviewing Jeremy Corbyn. Q: You say today you want to be in power for 10 years. Corbyn says, in his Mirror interview, he says the country needs two terms of a Labour government. Corbyn plays down suggestions he is planning to serve two terms as prime minister. Q: Do you think there will be an election by Christmas? Corbyn says it is not up to him. But the current system is unsustainable. The Tories would not even take part in two recent votes on NHS pay and tuition fees, he says. Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader and former deputy prime minister, is being interviewed by Marr now. He says he thinks it is possible to stop Brexit. He quotes David Davis, who once said that a democracy that cannot change its mind is not a democracy. He says when the final Brexit deal is available, MPs will have to decide whether what is on offer is what people thought they were voting for in the referendum. If the offer is different, then MPs should not accept it, he says. He says he thinks the UK will not be able to revert to the status quo ante. But he says Britain could adopt an “outer orbit of membership” in a reformed EU. Asked about Jean-Claude Juncker’s plans for more EU integration, he says Juncker’s views are not widely shared in Brussels. Brexit may have reached its actuarial highpoint, he says - implying that Brexit voters are dying off. He says Jeremy Corbyn would not be able to stop austerity if Brexit happens. Q: What do you say to a keen Brexit voter who thinks, after May’s speech, we will still be effectively inside the EU nearly five years after the vote. Davis says he does not accept that. We are leaving in March 2019, he says. And that’s it. The interview is over. Q: There are those who say we need to stick near to EU regulation. And others say we need to strike out on our own. Where are you on that spectrum? Bang in the middle, he says. Q: But UK regulation will diverge from EU regulation, won’t it? Yes, says Davis. Q: So trade with the EU can’t be frictionless. Davis says there are many examples of trade deals where countries agree some common boundaries, but leave states free to set their own laws. Q: Is it true that after March 2019 people won’t be able to spot much difference. Davis says the UK wants to register EU citizens coming to the UK. Q: The EU says that is against EU law. Davis says the UK will be outside EU law then. So this will be a matter for negotiation. The Marr show is now showing the interview with David Davis, the Brexit secretary, which was recorded yesterday. Davis says the government has had “the most positive response” to Theresa May’s speech from the EU. He says the government is still in the middle of a negotation. Q: The PM said we would honour our obligations. Davis accepts that, but says what they are has to be negotiated. He says the EU is putting a “maximalist” interpretation on it. He says the £40bn figure, on the front of the Times on Saturday, was just what the EU was saying the UK owed. Q: Boris Johnson says he has changed May’s policy. Davis says he does not think so. He thinks the Brexit policy was settled some weeks ago. Davis rejects suggestions that Boris Johnson was responsible for firming up Theresa May’s pro-Brexit stance ahead of her Florence speech. Q: Amber Rudd said Boris Johnson was “backseat driving”. Davis says it was a good interview. The Observer has splashed on Labour today. But many of the other Sunday papers are focusing on the Tories. According to the BBC’s Eleanor Garnier, Jeremy Corbyn did not feel the need to overdo it on the homework front ahead of today’s interview with Andrew Marr. “We are now the political mainstream,” Jeremy Corbyn writes in the Observer today. Two years ago, when the Labour conference was last in Brighton and Corbyn had come from being a 100-1 outsider on the far left of the party to being elected leader, that would have sounded a preposterous proposition. And Labour’s didn’t actually win the general election (even if some members of the cabinet won’t accept that they lost either). But with Theresa May now accepting Labour’s policy on a Brexit transition within the last 48 hours, the Conservative government ditching austerity rhetoric and abandoning the public sector pay cap, and even some arch Thatcherites accepting the case for higher taxes to fund better public services, Corbyn’s boast is now perfectly plausible. It means that the Labour conference is opening in the most benign climate facing the party for some years. We will be hearing from the man himself shortly. Here’s the Observer’s overnight splash about the conference. Here, in case you missed it yesterday, is my colleague Heather Stewart’s excellent long read about Labour’s election campaign. And here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Jeremy Corbyn is the main guest on the Andrew Marr Show. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, is also interviewed. 10am: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, and Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, are the main guests on Peston on Sunday. The Conservative MP Ken Clarke and Labour’s Chuka Umunna are also appearing. 10am: Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, and Dave Prentis, the Unison general secretary, are the main guests on Sky’s Sunday with Paterson. The Labour MP’s Caroline Flint, Lisa Nandy and Clive Lewis are also appearing. 10.30am: Conference opens. The main debate in the morning is on protecting our communities, with Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, due to speak at about 11am. 11am: Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, is interviewed on Sunday Politics. 2.15pm: Conference resumes, with further debate on protecting communities, followed by the Welsh and Northern Ireland reports. 4pm: Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, is interviewed at a fringe event by the Guardian editor Katharine Viner. 4.30pm: Conference session on general election, with speeches Andrew Gwynne and Ian Lavery, the campaign coordinators, and Iain McNicol, the general secretary. I will be covering all the key Labour conference developments today. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don’t have time. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/24/stevie-wonder-joins-takeaknee-protest-against-trumps-attack-on-nfl-players","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T02:05:16Z","webTitle":"Stevie Wonder joins #takeaknee protest against Trump's attack on NFL players","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/24/stevie-wonder-joins-takeaknee-protest-against-trumps-attack-on-nfl-players","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/24/stevie-wonder-joins-takeaknee-protest-against-trumps-attack-on-nfl-players","fields":{"headline":"Stevie Wonder joins #takeaknee protest against Trump's attack on NFL players","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Stevie Wonder has shown his solidarity with sports stars who were criticised by US president Donald Trump for kneeling on the field during the national anthem. Trump prompted outrage among NFL and NBA players when he said on Friday that players who have knelt, sat or raised fists to protest police brutality against black people, were “sons of bitches” and should be made to stand for the Star Spangled Banner or be fired. Players responded to the insult with rage, labelling the president a “bum” and an “asshole”. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell was also critical, saying in a statement: “Divisive comments like [Trump’s] demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL.” The situation further deteriorated when Stephen Curry, star player of the Golden State Warriors, said he voted “no” to the NBA champions visiting the White House in February and Trump promptly rescinded the invite. The president tweeted: “Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team, Stephen Curry is hesitating, therefore invitation is withdrawn!” In their own statement, the Warriors accepted they would not be going to the White House. But they said they would use their trip to Washington to “celebrate equality, diversity and inclusion”. Cleveland Cavaliers star forward LeBron James released a video on Saturday saying Trump had tried to divide the country. “He’s now using sports as the platform to try to divide us,” James said. “We all know how much sports brings us together ... It’s not something I can be quiet about.” The controversy moved outside the sports industry on Saturday night when Stevie Wonder, performing at the Global Citizens Festival in New York’s Central Park, said he was “taking a knee for America” to cheers from the crowd. With the help of his son Kwame Morris he knelt down on stage before saying a prayer for “our planet, our future, our leaders of our world”. Back on the sports field, the trend spread to baseball, with Oakland’s catcher Bruce Maxwell becoming the first major league baseball player to take a knee during the anthem."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/24/unbelievable-review-katy-tur-donald-trump-news","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T12:15:55Z","webTitle":"Unbelievable review: Katy Tur's Trump tale relives an utterly insane campaign","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/24/unbelievable-review-katy-tur-donald-trump-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/24/unbelievable-review-katy-tur-donald-trump-news","fields":{"headline":"Unbelievable review: Katy Tur's Trump tale relives an utterly insane campaign","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Towards the end of last year’s election, NBC correspondent Katy Tur and her colleagues played a game no other presidential contest had inspired: name a campaign headline too crazy to be real. “No one can do it,” she recalls in her new campaign memoir, Unbelievable. That isn’t really so surprising: on 19 October, this one was published: “Buzzfeed CEO: I Heard Ivanka Trump Talk About ‘Mulatto Cocks’.” Tur’s subtitle is “My Front-Row Seat to the Craziest Campaign in American History”, and there is barely a page in her book that does not confirm that description. Even the briefest summary of Trump’s outrages during his 500 days on the trail is still almost entirely unbelievable: “I’ve heard him insult a war hero, brag about grabbing women by the pussy, denigrate the judicial system, demonize immigrants, fight with the pope, doubt the democratic process, advocate torture and war crimes, tout the size of his junk in a presidential debate, trash the media, and indirectly endanger my life.” Trump’s relentless attacks on the press in general and Tur in particular were among the most revolting aspects of a repellent campaign, and they made Tur a hero to the decent people who were familiar with her fair and thorough work. By the end of the campaign, she needed private security at all of Trump’s rallies. Everyone covering Trump at NBC was under armed protection outside the venues. This is not normal. Nothing like it had ever happened to reporters covering any previous major party candidate for president. The truth is, given Trump’s constant goading of his supporters against the reporters who covered him, it’s something of a miracle that Tur never suffered anything worse than spittle through a lowered van window. After all, this is a candidate who could raise the possibility of killing journalists before saying: “I’d never kill them … But I do hate them. Some of them are such lying, disgusting people.” At that moment Tur felt like she was in the Roman Colosseum. She wondered: “When to they release the lions? What happens if someone in here can’t take a joke?” Even after everything we have learned, some of Tur’s behind-the-scenes details remain startling. At the end of one of her first extended interviews with him, Trump explodes, and demands that she run their half-hour interview in full. “I know what you guys do,” he said. “Deceptive editing.” Even more surprising: afterwards, the Trump campaign emailed a statement to Chuck Todd’s show reiterating “our disappointment with the extremely negative positioning of the questions”, the network accedes to Trump’s request and runs the interview in full. Trump alternates between trying to humiliate Tur by kissing her on the way into Morning Joe – and then bragging about it on air moments later – and attacking her in four tweets in four minutes, calling her, “3rd rate”, “incompetent” and “dishonest”. Sometimes Tur almost inadvertently reveals the built-in shortcomings of American television journalism. One page begins with this declaration: “I need to break some news … I need to be a reporter.” Then she briskly segues to the talent which is even more important to her success: “Getting your TV face ready in the car is a skill that only years of practice can perfect … There’s nothing flattering about a fluorescent overhead and magnet-triggered mirror LEDs.” Tur is correct in saying NBC Nightly News is “still a big deal” because it gets 8-10 million viewers a night. But she’s dreaming when she calls it “a broadcast that carries weight … It is more than that … It’s history.” As any regular viewer of that newscast knows, barely half of its nightly 22 minutes are ever devoted to anything a serious reporter would consider actual news. The rest is consumed by human interest stories and lots and lots of weather – even when there aren’t any hurricanes to report. The razor-sharp observations of Tur’s book – Trump’s “sentences call to mind an aerial shot of a burning, derailed freight train” – are the sort of thing you hear nowadays on The Daily Show or Stephen Colbert’s Late Show and never, ever, on any of the networks’ evening news broadcasts. The glory days of network news with Walter Cronkite and Chet Huntley and David Brinkley are now many decades behind us, along with the reliable seriousness and wit of great television correspondents like Roger Mudd, Morley Safer, Elie Abel and many more. Back then, the news was treated almost as a loss-leader by the networks, a way to maintain prestige while entertainment brought in the bucks. But for many years now, news departments have been profit centers like every other part of the network. Tur only occasionally hints at this. For example, during one of her many feuds with Trump – and a week without any exclusive interviews with him on NBC – she becomes nervous because Trump is neglecting the Today Show and favoring ABC’s Good Morning America. The executive producer of Today assures her he doesn’t care, but it doesn’t sound like Tur believes him. Tur never mentions the main problem with the way television covered Trump, especially at the beginning of his campaign. Producers realized right away that he was good for ratings, which meant he was good for the bottom line. The ultimate outcome may have been the same anyway, but this perception unquestionably translated into vastly more coverage for this obviously unqualified candidate than he ever deserved. In the immortal words of CBS chairman Les Moonves at the beginning of last year, Trump’s candidacy “may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS”. Nine months into Trump’s presidency, it looks like the first half of his observation could turn out to be the understatement of the 21st century."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/23/mexico-city-fresh-panic-aftershock-earthquake","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T23:02:28Z","webTitle":"Mexico City hit by fresh panic as aftershock rocks buildings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/23/mexico-city-fresh-panic-aftershock-earthquake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/23/mexico-city-fresh-panic-aftershock-earthquake","fields":{"headline":"Mexico City hit by fresh panic as aftershock rocks buildings","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"A powerful aftershock has caused panic as buildings again swayed in Mexico City just days after more than 300 were killed by the country’s deadliest earthquake for a generation. Rescue and clean-up efforts were temporarily suspended on Saturday amid fears that unstable structures could collapse, causing further anguish for dozens of families whose relatives are still missing under the rubble. Tens of thousands of people have been left homeless and entire areas rendered uninhabitable by last Tuesday’s devastating 7.1-magnitude tremor. The earthquake wreaked havoc in parts of the capital, which is built on a drained lake bed, as more than 50 buildings – including a school, pharmaceutical lab, and clothes factory – collapsed. As many as 5,000 buildings were damaged. More than half the dead – 160 – perished here in Mexico City, including 27 children. Overall, 105 victims were women and 55 men, according to the city’s mayor Miguel Angel Mancera. At least eight foreigners are among the confirmed dead including four Taiwanese women, a Panamanian woman, and men from South Korea, Spain and Argentina. Dozens of aftershocks registered across several states since Tuesday left the country on edge and jittery. The epicentre of yesterday’s 6.1-magnitude aftershock was in the southern state of Oaxaca, which is still reeling from the 10 September earthquake that left a hundred dead and thousands homeless. Initial reports showed damaged buildings and a collapsed bridge, but no loss of life. In the capital, hopes of finding survivors after five days are minimal and many rescue operations have now been called off – fuelling anger among relatives and volunteer workers, who want to keep searching. In the Colonia Obrera district, civilians have clashed with security forces at the site of the collapsed textiles factory, demanding rescue efforts continue despite official claims that there are no signs of life. There is no up to date list of workers, or building plans for the factory. In the hipster La Roma area, relatives of dozens of office workers trapped under a multistorey building have accused the armed forces of obstructing the rescue operation and failing to provide accurate information. Odeth Zuniga Gonzales, 36, a Red Cross paramedic, said she had treated dozens of volunteers and rescue workers from the collapsed office block for respiratory problems caused by gas leaks and dust and exhaustion. Despite the risks, the disaster has triggered a remarkable response and energy among ordinary Mexicans, which shows no sign of slowing down. Volunteer-run aid centres – where donations of clothes, medicines, toiletries, tools, petrol and toys are dropped off, organised and dispatched to affected communities, shelters and rescue sites – continue to operate in streets, parks, schools and churches across the country. The outpouring of generosity has lifted spirits even as anger mounts at the slow official response in some of the worst affected areas. Victims in Xochimilco, one of the capital’s poorest municipalities where electricity and water supplies have been severely damaged, accuse city and national governments of ignoring their plight - a charge rejected by the authorities. The paramedic Gonzales, like many people, is frustrated by the lack of official help to small poor communities outside the capital. “We should be doing so much more in Morelos, but these communities are forgotten. People could be injured in the rubble but no-one is looking for them, it’s so frustrating, it makes me angry.” At least 20,000 homes suffered damage in Morelos and Puebla, yet some communities are still struggling to obtain basic tools - shovels, buckets, wheelbarrows - to begin excavating the debris. The bishop of Cuernavaca city, the capital of Morelos state, publicly condemned the state governor for diverting aid trucks to government run warehouses away from the directly affected communities. Last week’s earthquake struck 32 years to the day since the country’s deadliest quake, which killed thousands and flattened large parts of the capital. Residents endured years of misery while Mexico City was slowly rebuilt, while many fled to other states out of fear. Ironically, 170 families left homeless in 1985 were finally rehoused this month as part of a programme targeting the so-called forgotten families. Detailed inspections of the buildings damaged this time round will start in earnest on Monday, but reconstruction could again take years.

Their parents all left southern Spain decades ago in search of work and a better life for their children, but one couple found jobs in the capital and the others had more luck further north. No one imagined that the family might one day find themselves facing the possibility of living on different sides of an international border. “Personally, I feel like it is an attempt to cut off an arm, to amputate something. It is a historic relationship, one of cultural links,” said Luque Sillero. “I myself could have been from Madrid, or Catalan, or Basque. I ended up being from Madrid because my parents settled here. I have cousins with the same Andalucían roots, who grew up in Catalonia and speak Catalan and they are Catalan, but we are one family.” A leftwing activist who has spent years fighting government austerity projects, she is now supporting the group Recortes Cero in its campaign against the referendum on Catalan independence. So far, their biggest project has been organising a manifesto signed by 2,500 Spaniards from Catalonia and beyond, condemning the referendum as an “anti-democratic fraud”, and running it as a full-page advertisement in the national press. Catalonia has been plunged into turmoil by the regional government’s controversial decision to call a unilateral referendum on independence for 1 October, and the central government’s heavy-handed efforts to stop it going ahead. The Catalan independence movement has deep roots, and has been fuelled by periods of extreme repression from Madrid, including under the dictator Francisco Franco, who executed the leader of a self-declared Catalan state and tried to suppress its language and culture. Supporters argue that Catalonia has a moral and economic right to self-determination. Polls suggest that opponents of independence – voters who are happy with the status quo or would like to negotiate greater autonomy inside Spain – make up a slim majority in the region, although they have in the past boycotted unofficial polls on breaking free. But as Catalans weigh up how to cast their ballot – or whether to vote at all – millions of Spaniards elsewhere, who will be profoundly affected by its consequences, are watching in anger, frustration and sorrow from beyond the regional borders as the bitter battle plays out. “Quite a lot of people are saying, ‘let them go’, but it will have a brutal cost,” said the Madrid-based film director Fernando Colomo, who began his career in Spanish cinema at a time when Barcelona was a cultural beacon for a country emerging from decades of dictatorship. An enduring affection for the region, dating back to the Movida cultural renaissance, is evident in his latest film, set in the Catalan town of Badalona. He insists that his objections are to the details of October’s poll, not the principle of self-determination. “I am in favour of a referendum but one with guarantees, that it’s properly prepared, with information for the citizens,” said Colomo, who was one of the first people to sign the Recortes Cero manifesto. “What they are doing is signing a blank cheque without knowing where it’s going to lead. It is going to be a disaster that will affect all the country.” Among the complaints on the petition are the lack of a threshold for participation and the pushing through of the referendum in the Catalan parliament in a single day, by a ruling coalition that does not represent a majority of the electorate. For a country in which dictatorship is a painful living memory, accusations that democracy is being undermined – and that parts of Spanish society are complicit – are extremely powerful. Many leftwing Spaniards are frustrated at seeing the stand-off over the October vote painted as a simple showdown between democrats and authoritarians, and point out that the men at the heart of the current stand-off both lead rightwing parties. Mariano Rajoy, Spain’s prime minister, and Carles Puigdemont, leader of the Catalan government, have put personal and party politics ahead of national interest, they argue. They worry that the depth of the crisis and the intensity of the debate have sucked attention away from important issues, including the stumbling economy and the impact of austerity policies. “The idea of this manifesto is to allow us to all express our voice and say, ‘no, I am leftwing, I am progressive, I am not in agreement with Rajoy but I am not in agreement with you [Puigdemont] either’,” said Juan Carlos Torres, also with Recortes Cero. “Puigdemont is dividing the world in two groups, like dictators and autocrats do, saying, ‘if you are not with me, you are against me’, and this is not acceptable.” There is some support for the Catalan government outside its own region. The radical leftwing party Podemos organised a rally in Madrid last week, in defence of the “right to decide”, after a week in which the central government ordered hundreds more police to the region, seized ballot boxes and arrested 14 senior officials, in a controversial attempt to stop the vote going ahead. “We are here because in the last days there has been an authoritarian shift, and we think that in response to that we have to show our solidarity with the Catalan people, and defend their right to decide their future freely,” Isabel Serra, a member of the regional parliament, told El Mundo newspaper. The demonstration drew hundreds of people to the heart of the city, in a rare public reminder of the crisis playing out nearly 400 miles away. Although the referendum is a constant presence in Madrid because of bar talk, TV shows and newspaper front pages, there are few visible signs in the capital of a country in crisis. There are no Catalan flags, no posters for or against the referendum, no appeals to Catalans from their fellow citizens. There is certainly nothing like the unofficial “Let’s Stay Together” campaign launched ahead of Scotland’s independence referendum in 2014. Widely seen as a response to the negative tone of much official campaigning, it drafted celebrities in to “love bomb” Scots, and urged people in Wales, England and Northern Ireland to call family and friends in Scotland and ask them to stay. For some in Madrid, the debate has dragged on too long, and criticism of the nation’s capital and other parts of Spain has been too intense for much warm feeling to survive. Many are angry or frustrated; others are offended by Catalan nationalists who say that their relatively wealthy region is subsidising their fellow citizens. The slogan “Spain is robbing us” has caused particular offence. “It hurts, the situation really hurts,” said Maria Jesus Sanz, a 67 year-old retiree. “They are treating us as if we are (worth) less than them.” Whenever tensions over Catalan independence rise, talk swirls elsewhere in Spain of boycotting Catalonia’s goods or staying away from its beaches or museums, and recent weeks have been no different. “It’s stupid to say, ‘I won’t buy a Catalan product because of this’, but you start to think like that,” said Andres Buendia, a 63-year-old lab technician, who is worried that the vote has unleashed ugly divisions across the country that will be hard to contain. “These things never stop,” he said. “One of the things we fear is that if this gets worse, people will start asking about your family, about your parents’ surnames [to find out where you are from].” There is real reason to fear that Catalan independence could fuel far-right sentiment across Spain, one of the few European countries where anti-immigrant populists have not formed a political party, warned Ignacio Molina, senior analyst at the Elcano Royal Institute. It would also be damaging to the economy – Catalonia accounts for 15% of Spain’s population, and 20% of its income – and to the broader project of rebuilding national identity after the restoration of democracy in the 1980s. “It’s very difficult for the rest of Spain to accept that the Catalans can decide alone about secession, and with good reason,” Molina said. “If we envisage what would happen in Spain if Catalonia becomes independent, it would be a real disaster.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/23/chris-gayle-west-indies-england","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T21:00:26Z","webTitle":"Chris Gayle raring to settle scores against England in ODI showdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/23/chris-gayle-west-indies-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/23/chris-gayle-west-indies-england","fields":{"headline":"Chris Gayle raring to settle scores against England in ODI showdown","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The ODI circus has descended upon Bristol in the hope of reigniting the series against West Indies. The first match at Old Trafford was a cakewalk for England, the second at Nottingham was ruined by rain. The series needs a lift and the man most likely to provide it, Chris Gayle, is expected to be fit to play after tweaking his hamstring in Manchester. “He seems to be raring to go,” said his captain, Jason Holder. It is sometimes hard to tell with Gayle. His presence in this series is to be welcomed. Gayle does look faintly ridiculous wrapped up in his sweaters, shambling the odd single between the sixes when batting and neatly plonking his foot on the ball in the field when he has been removed from his favoured position at first slip. This must have been how WG Grace finished his career at Bristol. Yet Gayle still adds lustre to the event. He is a one-off, who surely clears the boundary more regularly than any other player in history. At the last count in T20 internationals he had hit 103, which averages out at more than two sixes per innings. It is a figure that mushrooms to 772 sixes in all T20 cricket. Stay alert in the stands especially if situated at wide long-on or deep square-leg. Gayle can mesmerise. Moreover, his return to the West Indies team at least hints at the possibility of an end to what has amounted to a civil war between the players and the board. It is essential that progress continues and that the current situation becomes more than a temporary amnesty. Most of those at Bristol on Sunday, no matter who they are supporting, would welcome an hour of Gayle at the crease. He is now 38 and unlikely to grace our fields for much longer. But do not include David Willey among that number – he received some harsh treatment from Gayle at Old Trafford. Willey has the dubious privilege of propelling the new ball when he is on strike. He is forewarned. “We’ve seen what Gayle can do and he’s done it time and time again,” said Willey. “If it’s his day and he gets hold of it, the way he hits the ball [means it] is going to clear the ropes. So you want to get him early. We’ve looked at the footage and we’ve got a rough idea where we want to bowl to him.” But for a bowler of Willey’s pace some movement is essential and for him that usually comes from swing. This can be a fickle asset, as he explains: “A couple of hits on the square or the boundary boards and it just seems to stop swinging. It’s a precious time at the start and if you can get a couple wickets [especially if one of them is Gayle] it can make life a lot easier.” England are firm favourites to prevail and are in good heart after the win at Old Trafford, though those contemplating the more demanding challenges ahead in Australia will be hugely disappointed by the news of Toby Roland-Jones’s stress fracture. He had rapidly become an extremely popular – and effective – member of the Test team. This setback may have prompted Trevor Bayliss and Joe Root to pay special attention to Mark Wood, who bowled in the nets at Bristol on Saturday. Wood has played one match in the past two months as he attempts to recover from a heel injury. It is possible that he may play in Durham’s final Championship match of the season at Worcester on Monday. In which case the scrutiny of his bowling – and his reaction to that process – will be even more intense. England (possible): EJG Morgan (capt), AD Hales, JM Bairstow, JE Root, BA Stokes, JC Buttler (wkt), Moeen Ali, CR Woakes, Adil Rashid, LE PLunkett, DJ Willey. West Indies (possible): J Holder (capt), C Gayle, E Lewis, S Hope (wkt), M Samuels, J Mohamed, A Nurse, R Powell, J Taylor, K Williams, M Cummins. Umpires: S Fry (Aus) and M Gough (Eng)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/23/cycling-world-road-race-lizzie-deignan-chantal-blaak","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T17:06:21Z","webTitle":"Lizzie Deignan fades as Chantal Blaak wins world road race title","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/23/cycling-world-road-race-lizzie-deignan-chantal-blaak","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/23/cycling-world-road-race-lizzie-deignan-chantal-blaak","fields":{"headline":"Lizzie Deignan fades as Chantal Blaak wins world road race title","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Lizzie Deignan’s audacious attempt to regain her world road race title three weeks after appendix surgery came to a predictable end in Norway as the Briton faded on the final lap to finish 41st as the Dutch cyclist Chantal Blaak claimed a surprise victory. At the finish in Bergen, the 27-year-old Blaak burst into tears, although whether they were from shock or joy no one could be sure. Her day job is being a domestique for Deignan in the Boels-Dolmans squad and she was expected to again do the donkey work for her more illustrious team-mates. Instead she got into the breakaway of seven riders on the final lap – before making a decisive attack with 7.6 kilometres of the 182.5km course remaining to win in 4hr 06min 30sec – 28 seconds clear of the Australian Katrin Garfoot, with the Dane Amalie Dideriksen claiming bronze. Deignan was reflective after a tough day. “I was grovelling away,” she said. “It is not a nice position to be in at a world championships. My team-mates kept me going. If I wasn’t in a team as strong as that I would have been tempted to pull out. But I thought: ‘I can’t let these girls down, I have to be there as long as I can’.” She also paid tribute to Blaak, whose victory came despite a heavy crash earlier in the race that left her with a bloodied right shoulder. “I am so pleased for Chantal,” she said. “She had such a hard crash we heard that she was out. And yet there she was! I am really chuffed for her. She’s a great girl and she deserves her stripes.” Blaak, too, thought she might have to retire. But having recovered her bearings she also found her legs. “I can’t believe it,” she said. “When I crashed I was in a lot of pain and I thought my race is over. “It was not really in the plan that I should win the race – I just wanted to do the best possible for the team. But I got into a good break and after that I just followed my heart and I stayed away.” With 10 kilometres remaining it appeared that her Dutch team-mate Anna Van der Breggen, the pre-race favourite, was in the box seat. But while the other riders in the group tracked Van der Breggen, Blaak pounced. “We didn’t really talk to each other but we knew what to do,” she explained. “There were three Dutch cyclists in the group of seven so we knew we should attack and not wait for the sprint. I thought it was a good moment so I went for it.” Hannah Barnes, a 24-year-old from Northampton, was the highest-placed British cyclist in 14th overall. But that scarcely did justice to her excellent efforts, as she pushed hard throughout, was in two breakaways and had medal chances until her body gave out on her during the final kilometre of the race. “I was told to pick one Dutch rider and follow her moves in the breakaway but I picked the wrong one,” she said. “But to be up there with the best means I can’t be too disappointed. At the end I stood up to sprint but my legs had nothing left.” Barnes also said that the rest of the British team would leave Bergen with their heads held high given that Mel Lowther, Elinor Barker and Dani King all launched solo attacks in various stages of the race in an attempt to disrupt the powerful Dutch team. “Leading up to the race the group really bonded,” said Barnes. “We were spending two hours at the dinner table, and we knew coming into this we were going to do everything we could to get a good result. We really raced it and we can be proud of what we did.” Meanwhile, Deignan believes the team’s performance bodes well for the future. “I couldn’t praise them enough,” she said. “Everyone was phenomenal. They really stepped up their game and I think that’s so valuable moving forwards. The Dutch had the numbers, and they won the bike race. But we are catching them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/23/jeremy-corbyn-election-theresa-may","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T20:00:25Z","webTitle":"‘We can provide a politics of hope, a politics for the people’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/23/jeremy-corbyn-election-theresa-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/23/jeremy-corbyn-election-theresa-may","fields":{"headline":"‘We can provide a politics of hope, a politics for the people’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"What a difference six months makes. The political landscape is barely recognisable from the day Theresa May stood in Downing Street to announce a snap general election. The pundits expected a Tory landslide. The election would strengthen the government’s hand in the Brexit negotiations and stabilise the country, they agreed. Labour faced oblivion. The country thought otherwise. May’s claim to be “strong and stable” went from mantra to millstone. The Tories were found wanting on all of the big issues facing our country. Her government was shown to be strong only against the weak, unwilling to stand up to the powerful and the elite. The Tory manifesto was shredded almost overnight, as Conservative activists huddled in empty halls. Labour, meanwhile, relished the battle and seized the chance to campaign for our manifesto to end austerity and transform society. We didn’t succeed in winning a Labour majority and we need to do more to build trust and support. But we achieved the biggest increase in Labour’s vote since 1945, and the Conservatives lost their majority. The election campaign demonstrated the thirst for real change across Britain. We changed the debate and we have set the political agenda. The government has had to drop one damaging policy after another – from ditching free school meals to means-testing winter fuel payments for the elderly. The policies we campaigned for attracted support because they are what most people actually want. We have changed the political centre of gravity. We are now the political mainstream and have the chance to transform our country. To do that we must use our new strength inside and outside parliament to challenge the Conservatives at every step – and prepare to form a government to change Britain when the next election is called. The Tories are weak and divided. They have no mandate for what they are doing. Wherever we can, we will block their attempts to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy by making life worse for millions of people in the name of austerity. We are in a moment of great change – in the economy, politics and across the world. Our challenge is to marshal these forces of change for the real wealth creators – that means all of us. And our mission must be to work with the people of Britain to transfer wealth, power and opportunity to the many from the few. For the first time in a long time, we can provide a politics of hope and a politics for the people. We are now on a permanent campaign footing. Labour membership has almost tripled to 570,000 in the last two years. Contrast that with the Conservatives, who have few members and are backed by hedge funds and billionaires, not millions of working-class people. Since losing their majority, the Conservatives have gone for power grab after power grab to stay in office, propping themselves up with a tawdry £1bn deal with the Democratic Unionist party. The next Labour government will be different. To earn the trust of the people of our country, we must show that we mean it when we say we hand power back to the people. For the first time in years, we are handing our conference back to our members. Politics isn’t some technical specialism for an elite. Politics is about us all coming together to decide our futures. Taking back power for the many should be fun and exhilarating. We aren’t a lobbyists’ playground. This will be a real conference whose decisions matter. Labour is preparing for government and we are already deepening and extending the policies we set out in our election manifesto. It is Labour, not the Tories, who are prepared to tackle the long-term challenges facing our country, including automation, the threat to the environment, health costs and an ageing population. The disarray at the heart of government is painful to see: from the public sector pay cap to tuition fees, Tory ministers are flip-flopping and incoherent. When we brought these issues to the Commons recently, the government was forced to concede it did not have a majority and refused to vote. May is leading a weak government at a critical time for our country’s future. Fifteen months after the EU referendum, the government is still floundering over what to do about Brexit. It was evident in Florence on Friday that the prime minister is still no clearer about what our long-term relationship with the EU will look like. The only advance seems to be that she has listened to Labour and faced up to the reality that Britain needs a transition on the same basic terms to provide security for jobs and the economy, though May and her cabinet are spending more time negotiating with each other than with the EU. The Tories have made abundantly clear they want to use Brexit to deregulate and cut taxes for the wealthy. Labour is making the case instead for a jobs-first Brexit that prioritises access to European markets, uses powers returned from Brussels to invest and upgrade Britain’s economy, and protects and extends workers’ and consumer rights and environmental standards. We will not accept any Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership-style deregulation and investor protection deals with the Trump administration, which is what this Tory government wants to use Brexit for. No wonder it is relying on a power grab through their EU withdrawal bill in an attempt to bypass democracy and steamroller through their race-to-the-bottom approach. The commentators wrote us off in April. But the election and the months that followed have proved people do not have to accept the establishment’s rules of the game, or what they’re told is inevitable. We do not have to accept that millions of people are in work but in poverty. We do not have to accept rising homelessness, food banks and zero-hour contracts. We do not have to accept rip-off energy prices or austerity without end. As I said when I was first elected leader two years ago, things can, and will, change. We remain in opposition, for now. But we are a government in waiting. Politics has changed and Labour has driven that change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2017/sep/25/are-you-ready-for-that-jelly-why-its-time-to-start-eating-jellyfish","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T05:00:05Z","webTitle":"Are you ready for that jelly?

Why it’s time to start eating jellyfish","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The world has a jellyfish problem. In 2014, they invaded a Scottish salmon farm, killing 300,000 fish overnight. They have shut down power stations, incapacitated a US nuclear warship and had a significant socioeconomic impact on tourist areas. At the moment, a group of Australian scientists are researching the possibility that they will eventually utterly destroy all other life in the oceans. The answer? Cooking them, according to one Italian scientist. Stefano Piraino, a zoology professor at the University of Salento, is about to embark on a European commission-funded study to try to demonstrate that the ideal location for jellyfish is on our dinner tables. “We need to adapt, to turn this problem into an opportunity,” says Piraino. “We started to analyse the chemical composition of jellyfish in the Mediterranean and realised that they were similar to the ones eaten in the far east. So we thought: ‘Why don’t we try to eat them?’” If jellyfish were to become a regular option at your local chippy, one of the main advantages would be their hardiness. Even if you remove a jellyfish from the sea, it doesn’t stop new ones being born, as they spawn from polyps attached to the bottom of the ocean. So, unlike most fish, there’s no possibility of permanently damaging stocks. Or as Piraino puts it: “It’s a sustainable food source!” Is it a delicious food source, though? Jellyfish is known for a delicate, slightly salty, flavour that means it’s eaten more as a textural experience. Its slimy, slightly chewy consistency means that Chinese and Japanese gourmands often eat it raw or sliced up as a salad ingredient. “I once had a Michelin-starred chef prepare a jellyfish tasting, and one fish expert said that it was like the best oyster he’d ever tasted,” says Piraino. “In Sardinia and Sicily, they take similar sea animals to the jellyfish, fry them up, and they’re a local delicacy. I think it will only be a matter of time until we’re widely adapted to eating them.” Piraino isn’t alone: a slow food conference in Genoa featured a stall promoting fried jellyfish. The increasing demand for jellyfish from Chinese people living in Italy means that Asian exporters are already struggling to keep up. “The opportunities are there and, ultimately, we need a better plan than to simply stay out of the water,” says Piraino. “We need to train fishermen so we can get some value from this unused biomass.” While some diners may still feel squeamish at the prospect of tucking into the gelatinous sea creatures, it sounds like Italy, at least, is ready for that jelly."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/filmblog/2017/sep/29/rereleased-film-classics-terminator-2-dirty-dancing-silence-of-the-lambs","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T08:00:20Z","webTitle":"They'll be back: are reissues of familiar favourites crowding out hard-to-find classics?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2017/sep/29/rereleased-film-classics-terminator-2-dirty-dancing-silence-of-the-lambs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2017/sep/29/rereleased-film-classics-terminator-2-dirty-dancing-silence-of-the-lambs","fields":{"headline":"They'll be back: are reissues of familiar favourites crowding out hard-to-find classics?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Terminator dies. Baby pulls off a perfect 10 lift. Hannibal Lecter escapes (albeit wearing a giveaway wig that screams psychopath-on-the-lam). No spoiler alerts are necessary for the endings of Terminator 2, Dirty Dancing or The Silence of the Lambs. You’ve either seen them umpteen times already or you know them by osmosis, from the memes and the YouTube clips. I’m sure even Jacob Rees-Mogg can do a fair to middling “Hasta la vista, baby”. So why is this trio of old faves getting cinema comebacks in 2017? Rereleases have always been a fixture on the calendar. They give audiences the chance to see gold-plated masterpieces back on the big screen where they belong. As a teenager, I watched my dad’s VHS tape of The Shining more times than I care to admit – but years later when I saw it in the cinema it swallowed me whole. I felt my blood freeze as Jack Nicholson hunted Shelley Duvall though the Overlook Hotel with an axe. Rereleases can also be about discovery, about shining a light into neglected corners of cinema history, as we saw this summer when the BFI showed one of Beyoncé’s major inspirations for Lemonade, Julie Dash’s striking 1991 movie Daughters of the Dust. But, more and more, we’re also being persuaded to buy into the nostalgia trip of watching a movie we already know and love at the cinema – slipping into the cosy familiarity of yelling its famous one-liners at the screen, or giggling ahead of the scary bits with people who also know what’s coming. The trend may have started with Secret Cinema, the pop-up that makes the audience part of the movie: 70,000 people paid upwards of £49 a ticket to see Moulin Rouge! in an east London warehouse transformed into a corner of 1890s Paris earlier this year. “Event cinema”, as it’s become known, has caught on. All summer, outdoor cinemas show old chestnuts, often in site-specific locations – a south London lido screened Jaws with the audience in the pool on dinghies. The “event” has overtaken the film, and cinemas are getting in on the act. Terminator 2 opened on 27 August, the date in the film that Skynet became self-aware and unleashed a nuclear apocalypse on humanity. For some, there is a growing unease that bona fide critic-sanctioned classics are getting the cold shoulder. A few years ago, I overheard a critic of a certain age sniffily proclaim that young people don’t care about “the canon”. At the time I rolled my eyes, thinking: yeah, right, you dinosaur. But a recent US poll suggests he might have a point. Less than a quarter of millennials surveyed had seen a film made in the 1940s or 1950s. A third admitted to having never watched a black and white movie. (Though 30% confessed to fibbing about it.) Are politically-engaged under-35s being switched off by prehistoric attitudes to gender and race in older films? Or maybe our definition of a “classic film” is shifting – from auteur-directed masterpieces on top 10 lists to shout-at-the-screen faves? Perhaps the rerelease is simply the new DVD. In the heyday of booming DVD sales, studios monetised their back catalogues with anniversary collectors’ editions. Now that DVDs and Blu-rays are going the way of the floppy disc, milestones are increasingly being marked with a cinema comeback. Dirty Dancing’s rerelease in February was timed to coincide with its 30th anniversary. Steven Spielberg’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind celebrated its 40th with a cinema outing this month – and before the year is out we’ll see Hellraiser (30), The Princess Bride (30), Predator (30) and Perfect Blue (20) back on the big screen. One thing’s certain, none of us are getting our golden oldies fix on Netflix. Nearly a quarter British households now subscribe, and Netflix users have watched half a billion hours of Adam Sandler movies. But its range of classics in the UK stretches to one Kubrick, one Scorsese, zero Truffaut and zero Kurosawa. We’re living in the age of VOD, when pretty much any film is available to watch instantly if you have a few quid to pay iTunes or Amazon. But where are you going to discover them? Netflix is throwing money at original film-making with all the care of a toddler hurling mushed avocado from a highchair. I’ve got a suggestion for them.

It is a question seemingly posed in jest, but probably only to mask a genuine suspicion that a spell in clink is the most likely explanation for an odd situation. The new boy stands out because he is a rare Briton reporting for stomach-churning, minimum-wage work at an intensive chicken processing plant in Devon, where his typical colleague is eastern European and speaks almost no English. This reliance on immigrant labour is hardly a unique situation within UK industry, but it is a striking feature of 2 Sisters Food Group, a giant £3bn-revenue food processor that produces industrial quantities of the country’s favourite meat. Every week a sizeable chunk of the company’s 23,000 workers – drawn from 36 different nationalities – churns out 6 million chickens, part of an operation that produces a third of all the poultry products consumed in the UK. Its products are found on the shelves of the major UK supermarket groups. This summer, two undercover reporters for the Guardian and ITV News were among its workforce. One journalist spent 12 days working inside the 2 Sisters portioning and packing plant in West Bromwich, while the other was employed for three days at this slaughtering facility in the village of Willand, about 20 miles north of Exeter. The slaughterhouse At Willand, chickens, still living but seemingly catatonic, arrive packed into green and yellow plastic latticed crates on the back of lorries, where they are routinely comforted by animal rights activists, wishing to say goodbye to “5,000 lost chicken souls”. The doomed animals are then driven into the complex and gassed en masse, before being hung by their legs on metal brackets, to connect them to an elevated mechanical rail. The rail transports these birds, blood dripping from their open beaks, to the next stage in the process, in a half-comical scene that partially resembles a theme park ride. Suddenly, the animals dip out of sight. They are inside a machine. The next you see of the birds, they are still riding the rollercoaster, only now they are completely naked. They had entered an aluminium tunnel of perhaps 30 metres in length where jets of hot water stripped them of their feathers. By the time they emerge, the birds look almost like those you see on a supermarket shelf – only with feet intact, featuring swollen and splayed digits. Some chickens also emerge with heads still just about clinging on for the ride. Some of the work is much more hands-on. As the chickens get plucked, the discarded feathers and heads drop below to a conveyor belt, travelling back in the opposite direction towards a human tasked with spotting unusual mounds in the layers of feathers. If he spies a hump, that means a chicken has fallen from its hooks and is buried under the mass. Using his hands, the worker must burrow through the piles of soaking, stinking plummage and extract the stray dead bird – before clicking on a tally counter to record what he is throwing away. Meanwhile, chicken heads also drop from the sides of the machine to the floor, where another minimum-wager sweeps or sprays them into a waste gulley. This team works in temperatures hovering around the high 20s celsius. It feels even hotter when you are wearing a lab coat, a full-length plastic apron, wellington boots, rubber gloves and a hair net or beard snood – all of which protect you from most of the spraying blood, and lord knows what else. But the smell and the memory of what you witness is more stubborn than the body fluids. For days afterwards, a piece of litter on the pavement looks, just for a split second, as though it is a chicken head. Almost any odour is redolent of the slaughterhouse. All of which might explain why 2 Sisters workers tend to trot out the refrain: “I have stopped eating chicken.” That is fairly standard for those who work in the meat industry. But the disagreeable work does not end at the “killing department”, which is merely a staging post on these birds’ commercial journey. The production line 2 Sisters Food Group has numerous slaughterhouses spanning the country from Coupar Angus in Perth and Kinross, down to Willand, all of which supply the company’s array of production lines preparing chicken for our supermarkets. Crates of slaughtered birds are shipped to the processing facilities for portioning, packing and dispatch. These include production lines at Willand, where more overhead rails whisk freshly slaughtered chickens into chilled factories, where they are then released down aluminium chutes into square receptacles at the start of a series of production lines. The first worker is tasked with grabbing chicken after chicken from the pile and thrusting them – sort of legs akimbo – on to the vertical probes that move steadily down the line. The bird is then transported towards a sequence of workers who include cutters – one hand holding a knife, the other sporting a chainmail glove – who portion off the breast, and skinners – some of whom can whip the skin off a chicken almost as easily as pulling a sock from a foot. The conveyors never seem to stop. The first spot in the production line is, as many colleagues like to remind you, a simple job. But while the task of placing chickens on to moving probes is certainly less skilled than the cutting, it still has its challenges: the birds are slippery to pick up, the work is relentless and you are using muscles rarely called on in any other part of life. These workers – the lowest of the low on the production line – will be handling some 6,000 chickens a day, assuming they do this job for a 10-hour shift. The result, at least for beginners, is intensely sore wrists and hands, coupled with sharp pains shooting up the forearms for days after a shift. It is totally shattering work. There is a strange pressure to the job, too. Put the chicken on the probe in a manner that displeases the first cutter and he will growl and curse at you. Miss a probe with your bird and a supervisor barks at you. Sometimes the novice gets told playfully: “Hey, baby, why you miss so much?” but, more often, it is simply a bawl of: “STOP MISSING!” So you stretch and strain to avoid both the rollickings and the slower, subtler humiliation of an empty probe chugging accusingly all the way down the line. “This is no good job,” says a new starter, who still returns to the factory to do it all again the following day. And he is right, in perhaps more ways than he has yet to figure. West Bromwich The chickens moving down this type of production line have been slaughtered the day before they are portioned – or, at least, that is the theory. At the group’s production line in West Bromwich, our reporter saw evidence of the batch of fresh meat being topped up with older stock, with birds piled up in solid plastic baskets at the start of the line. The footage shows the labels on these crates stating that the contents have been slaughtered five days earlier. A chicken crown on the floor is also seen being retrieved and thrown back onto the production line - despite the abundance of signs around the factory reminding workers of their training saying this is strictly against the company’s policy. But neither of the company warnings, or the old dates, seemed to matter: everything went on to the fresh line. Then there is other chicken, which even some workers might never know is older than it seems. Just off from the production lines is a cool storeroom, which is filled with pallets that are stacked about two metres high with baskets, each of which contains about 25 chicken crowns. We saw evidence of how they stay there for a day or more before being edged out to the production line, by which time the birds’ histories can be rewritten. It is here, out of sight of internal quality assurance inspectors – known as QAs – that the Guardian and ITV filmed an occasion of the seemingly non-negotiable date of the birds’ slaughter being switched. That results in the paperwork saying the product is fresher than it really is. The record of where the birds were slaughtered is also altered, leaving them almost impossible to trace and recall in the event of a food scare. This practice looks wrong to an untrained eye – and to a professional one too. Ask quality assurance experts if it is acceptable and you get a no-nonsense confirmation. “That is totally wrong,” says one. Our reporter saw it at Site D, perhaps as part of a culture where fulfilling a client’s order trumps following the rules. “I previously worked at [another food company],” one worker explains. “There, if there was a QA around, everyone was alert. At 2 Sisters, there is no respect for QAs.” One QA tells of being physically pushed out of the way when trying to prevent chicken being loaded on to a lorry for dispatch, and getting called away by a supervisor after putting crates of chicken on hold and finding the meat had then been packed when they returned. The company says this view does not represent the real picture in the company as a whole. It said of its 33 quality assurance staff in West Bromwich: “2SFG has reviewed its records for Site D from the previous twelve months and there are no complaints from any Quality Assurance staff resembling those cited.” There certainly are diligent QAs who succeed in catching problems. They stop chicken portions from being dispatched when the packaging is damaged or the meat looks to be of poor quality. The supermarkets’ own quality departments, based in their distribution centres, also send packets back to 2 Sisters plants. That does not mean the meat is unfit to eat, so it does not always stay back in the plant for long. “Chicken comes back to the factory and we are asked to open the packets, remove the portions and place them into the large plastic trays that are used to move chicken about the factory,” says one worker. Meanwhile, the sight of chicken already packed for the supermarket being reopened next to the production line and tossed back on to the fresh conveyor belt is unremarkable. It might have been sent back by internal 2 Sisters quality staff, or a supermarket distribution centre, but to a shop floor worker it looks all the same. “Sometimes, if shop no selling, sending back, open again,” explains one operative. 2 Sisters said that it takes “these allegations extremely seriously” and that it had launched an investigation. It said that it had not been given enough information or time to investigate the evidence properly but it said its West Bromwich facility had received nine audits, five of which were unannounced, in the months of July and August alone. It added: “Hygiene and food safety will always be the number one priority within the business, and they remain at its very core”. Other times, chicken already packaged for one supermarket is reopened and mixed with pieces being packed for a rival. The undercover footage shot by the Guardian and ITV captures one such instance, with the drumsticks at the end of the line showing up in packets saying they have come from Tesco’s Willow Farms. Willow Farms is the bucolic invention of Tesco’s promotional department, but if the branding feels contrived, the marketing goes further. Willow Farms chicken is billed as being “reared exclusively for Tesco” on the grocer’s website, which suggest that the supermarket group is unaware. Meanwhile 2 Sisters explains it thus: “The Willow Farms brand is exclusive to Tesco, but the raw material is not. 2SFG meets the raw materials specifications for the Willow Farms brand.” All of which ties in with another common phrase among the 2 Sisters workforce. “It’s all the same chicken,” they say, again and again. “It’s all the same chicken.” Additional reporting by Olivier Acuña"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2017/sep/24/german-elections-2017-angela-merkel-cdu-spd-afd-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T20:09:13Z","webTitle":"German elections 2017: Angela Merkel wins fourth term but AfD makes gains – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2017/sep/24/german-elections-2017-angela-merkel-cdu-spd-afd-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2017/sep/24/german-elections-2017-angela-merkel-cdu-spd-afd-live-updates","fields":{"headline":"German elections 2017: Angela Merkel wins fourth term but AfD makes gains – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Angela Merkel is set for a fourth term as Germany’s chancellor after her centre right CDU/CSU won a projected 33% of the vote in federal elections, making it the largest party in the Bundestag with an estimated 218 seats. The Christian Democrats’ score, sharply down on the 41% of the vote it collected in the previous 2013 elections, was widely seen as disappointing and is likely to leave Merkel diminished on the domestic political stage. Her main rivals (and outgoing coalition partners), Martin Schulz’s Social Democrat SPD, crashed to just over 20% and a projected 138 seats. Within an hour of the first exit poll, Schulz confirmed statements by other senior party figures that the SPD would not renew its “grand coalition” with the CDU but head into opposition. The far-right, anti-immigration AfD made a historic breakthrough, winning 13.5% of the vote and a projected 87 seats and becoming the first overtly nationalist party to sit in the Bundestag in 60 years. The party’s performance marks a major shift in Germany’s postwar politics that is likely to produce a very different tone and dynamic inside the Bundestag. The SPD’s decision to become the official parliamentary opposition leaves the only feasible coalition for Merkel a three-party tie up between the CDU/CSU, the pro-business FDP party who scored 10%, and the Greens, who won 9%: the so-called black-yellow-green Jamaica coalition, which has worked at state level but never been tried in federal government. This could prove tricky to negotiate. Merkel said in her post-election speech that the CDU had hoped for a better result but had faced – referring to the 2015 migrant crisis – an “extraordinary challenge” and had still managed to remain Germany’s largest party. She pledged to listen to AfD voters and win back those she could with “good politics”. The AfD promised “constructive opposition” in parliament but the Greens have already complained that “Nazis have returned to parliament”. During the traditional televised leaders’ debate, Schulz said the EU and the new German government should “not cede anything” to Britain over Brexit, including the two-year transition period Theresa May said she wants, and the FDP’s Christian Lindner dealt a blow to French president Emmanuel Macron’s hopes for eurozone reform, confirming that the party was opposed to fiscal transfers within the zone. This is important for French president Emmanuel Macron’s hopes for eurozone reform, including a eurozone budget, finance minister and transfers: the pro-business FDP party, Merkel’s likely coalition partner along with the Greens, will not play ball. SPD leader Martin Schulz has said the EU Germany’s new government – of which, at present, he does not intend to be a part – “must not cede any more ground to Britain” in the Brexit negotiations and should not allow the two-year transition period Theresa may said she wanted in her Florence speech on Friday. “Theresa May is gambling in these talks in an attempt to strengthen her domestic political position,” the SDP leader said. “We cannot give ground. The EU is a community of law and it has certain rules that must be observed.” Concluding the debate, Merkel, asked whether she thought there would be a coalition by Christmas, said: “I’m always confident.” The traditional post-election party leaders’ debate – the so-called “Elephant Round” – is underway on German television (Deutsche Welle has it with English interpretation here). Some choice quotes: Major Jewish groups have expressed alarm and dismay at the performance of the far-right, anti-immigration AfD. Josef Schuster of Germany’s Central Jewish Council, said the party “tolerates far-right thoughts and agitates against minorities”, adding that he expected Germany’s other parties to “reveal the true face of the AfD and unmask their empty, populist promises.” The head of the World Jewish Congress, Ronald Lauder, called Merkel a “true friend of Israel and the Jewish people” and denounced the AfD as “a disgraceful reactionary movement which recalls the worst of Germany’s past”. One of the AfD’s lead candidates, Alexander Gauland, said last week that no other country has faced up to past crimes the way Germany has and the Nazi years “don’t affect our identity anymore.” German voters have been sharing their reaction to the AfD’s result via The Guardian’s online callout: Raphael, 19, student, Green party voter: I’m certain that a big factor in the support for AfD was the stream of refugees coming to our country. I think that it’s a mix of that, the general protest against the establishment as it is seen everywhere and fears about the future and identity of our country - justified or not. We need to modernise our economy and education system. At the same time we have to address the tensions in our society by fighting inequality. Simon, 23, SPD voter: AfD supporters held their views long before the refugee crisis and maybe we just have to accept that they won’t go away. Surprisingly, the AfD has many supporters in the upper and middle classes and they probably like their hardcore neoliberal programme as much as their inflammatory rhetoric. But the left has certainly failed to convince people that political and economic issues lay at the heart of the problem and not the refugees. Monika, 67, AfD voter: I voted for the AfD because I wanted a real change in policy. The dictatorship of Angela Merkel must come to an end, definitely. The German culture is threatened by the many refugees and migrants who want to stay here. It can’t go on like that, definitely. Magali, 40, SPD voter: I feel deeply ashamed that a rightwing party will now sit in our parliament, 72 years after the Nazis destroyed Europe and killed millions of people. It seems that a lot of Germans are racist and blame everything on foreigners. We’re a rich country and able to help refugees. AfD voters want to turn back the clocks, they’re full of hate against everything that’s different. Here’s how to contribute if you would like to tell us your views: Turnout was up on the previous election, public broadcaster ZDF reports: from 71.5% to 76.5%. And here’s the broadcaster’s latest projection for the number of seats each party will hold in the Bundestag: CDU/CSU: 218 SPD: 138 Left: 60 Greens: 60 FDP: 68 AfD: 87 More evidence that the 2015-2016 migration crisis, and Angela Merkel’s decision to open Germany’s borders to tens of thousands of refugees, played a part in the AfD’s sharply increased vote share. Merkel conceded this in her post election speech to party supporters, saying it was clear security mattered as much to people as prosperity. A number of commentators are warning about the difficulty of negotiating a “Jamaica” coalition, mainly because of the incompatible positions of the Greens and the CDU’s sister party, the Bavarian CSU. Mathieu von Rohr of Der Spiegel reckons that if talks don’t work out, Germany could be heading for new elections ... The AfD has always scored better in former east Germany than in the west, but it seems to have done particularly well in these elections, says Guardian Berlin correspondent Kate Connolly: Former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt makes the same point: The latest updated projections from national broadcaster ARD look like this: The co-leader of the nativist, anti-immigration AfD has said the party will provide “constructive opposition” when it enters the Bundestag for the first time. Alice Weidel told supporters that “millions of voters have entrusted us with the task of constructive opposition work in parliament.” But other parties in parliament have sworn not to work with the AfD. The Greens, potential partners in a new coalition government, have been particularly outspoken, with co-leaders Katrin Göring-Eckardt and Cem Ozdemir telling supporters there were “again Nazis in parliament”. Göring-Eckardt told a cheering crowd at the party’s post-election gathering: “We will not let one single attack on German democracy stand.” Angela Merkel’s favoured coalition would have been with the free-market, pro-business Liberals of the FDP – a return to the “Black-Yellow coalition” that ruled Germany for 16 years under Helmut Kohl. But the CDU’s poor showing means that is now out of the question. The chancellor will now have to resort to a “Jamaica” coalition – named after the black, yellow and green of the Jamaican flag, the colours respectively of the CDU, FDP and Greens. This has worked at municipal and state level, but would demand huge concessions from the Greens nationally. At the LSE’s Europp blog, Julian Göpffarth takes a look at the three parties’ programmes and considers whether they can realistically work together. He concludes that much will depend on the attitude of the Green’s conservative or “Realo” wing: Whether the Greens are ready to look past the core issues of their manifesto and attempt a Jamaica coalition depends on the influence of the ‘Realo’ wing. If these voices within the party take a lead over the negotiations, both a Jamaica or even a CDU-Green coalition could be possible. But even if Merkel is said to be open to a collaboration with the Greens, it is hard to imagine the CSU, the CDU’s right populist sister party from Bavaria, and the ecological Greens working in one government. But who knows? The option of power might be more tempting than four more years in opposition. Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s far right Front National, has tweeted her congratulations to the AfD, now looking on course for between 80 and 90 seats in parliament: This last parliamentary term was the last without the FDP in the federal parliament. The FDP always had and still has a place in the centre of our society. The liberal spirit is the clearest opposite to the far-right. Our comeback is an encouraging message. A new start has proved possible after an earlier failure. Our new chance comes with a big responsibility – which we are ready to face. The CDU would have hoped for better result, but we mustn’t forget – looking back at an extraordinary challenge – that we nevertheless achieved our strategic objectives: we are the strongest party. We have mandate to form the new government and we will form the new government We have had 12 years of governmental responsibility and it was not a foregone conclusion that we would be largest party again. But this was also an election that saw the arrival in parliament of the AfD. We will conduct a very thorough analysis; we want to regain those voters who voted for the AfD, to discover their concerns and worries ... We want to win back the AfD voters above all through good politics. We need to work now for a just and a free country. That means we need to bring together all of the EU countries to fight against the causes of migration and to fight illegal immigration. It is clear that the topic of security is as much a worry for people as the topic of prosperity. However, we have a mandate to assume responsibility – and we will now assume it now, almly with our partners. Sean Clarke on the Guardian’s graphics team shows how only a grand coalition or a so called “Jamaica” coalition are viable. With the SPD ruling out any cooperation with the CDU in this parliament, that leaves a coalition between Merkel’s CDU, the pro-business FDP and the Green party as the only option: The SPD lead candidate, Martin Schulz, has confirmed the party will not renew its grand coalition with the CDU, which clearly hit the party’s support with its base: With tonight’s result, co-operation between CDU and the SPD is coming to end ... We were all in agreement to become the biggest opposition party. Our next task is to close ranks work shoulder to shoulder again as a party. We will discuss the election results without ifs and buts, and take our time. This is another bitter hour in our history, but social democracy has survived and managed to show its strength – even when confronted with an extreme far-right party showing its ugly face. Simon Usherwood, a European politics specalist at the university of Surrey, has a short Twitter thread on the impact of the result on Brexit. In short, not a lot – a political upheaval in Germany will not translate into any major shift in the country’s policy on the UK leaving the EU: Angela Merkel will now have to form a coalition government - an arduous process that could take months – after sliding to about 32% of the vote from 41.5% in in 2013. The SPD’s 20% score is a new new post-war low and the party has now formally ruled out the possibility of a new “grand coalition” with the Christian Democrats: deputy leader Manuela Schwesig has said the party will go into opposition. An alternative coalition for Merkel would be a three-way tie-up with the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) and the ecologist Greens, a combination that has not yet been tested at national level known as the “Jamaica” option – the three parties’ colours are those of the black-gold-green Jamaica national flag. Both the FDP and the environmentalist Greens have played down the prospect of a Jamaica coalition, but as they have been out of government for four and 12 years respectively, they may be lured into an alliance by the prospect of power. The SPD’s decision also means the AfD will not be the official party of opposition in the Bundestag. My colleague Philip Oltermann is at the AfD’s post-election gathering, a night club in the east of the German capital, where the scene is understandably one of celebration. Alexander Gauland is one of the far-right party’s two top candidates: Early analysis from commentators casts the result firstly as a very poor night for Angela Merkel – almost a defeat – that will leave her significantly weakened on the domestic stage. The Economist’s Jeremy Cliffe says: But it is also disastrous performance for the Social Democrat SPD, whose projected 20% matches its lowest ever score. The Centre for European Reform’s Christian Odendahl reckons their result is so bad that it probably rules out a new “grand coalition”: Angela Merkel is heading for a fourth term as Germany’s chancellor after her centre-right CDU party and its CSU sister party won 32% of the vote, initial exit polls have projected. The estimation puts the Christian Democrats comfortably ahead of their outgoing coalition partner and main rival, the Social Democrat SPD party led by Martin Schulz, which ended a miserable campaign with just 20% – a near rout. But as predicted, the far-right, anti-immigration AfD has spoiled the chancellor’s party, clearing the 5% parliamentary threshold for the first time in its four-year history with a score of 13%, making it the third largest party in the Bundestag and possibly the official opposition. The smaller, pro-business FDP party, Merkel’s favoured coalition partner, looks set to return to parliament after missing out in 2013 with a share of 10%, while the Green party won 9% and the left-wing Die Linke 9%. How does the electoral system work? Germany’s recently amended electoral system, combining direct and proportional representation, is complex. The country’s 61.5 million voters get two votes on a single ballot paper: the first for a local representative, the second for a party. Roughly half the Bundestag’s seats are guaranteed to go to the 299 representatives of the country’s electoral districts, each chosen by their constituents with their Erststimme, or first vote, in a straight first-past-the-post contest. The rest are allocated according to the national vote share won by every party that clears a 5% threshold in the second vote, or Zweitstimme – which is also used to determine the overall number of seats each party winds up with: if a party scores 25% of the national vote, it must get 25% of the seats. Sometimes parties return more Erststimme representatives than they are entitled to, according to the Zweitstimme. So to compensate, the other parties get extra seats – which means the Bundestag, theoretically made up of 598 representatives, could expand to as many as 800 (it currently has 631). Once a governing coalition has been formed, which can take up to a month, Germany’s president (a largely ceremonial role) nominates the chancellor – usually the leader of the largest party – who is confirmed by parliament in a secret ballot. It’s already standing room only at the far-right AfD party’s headquarters, journalists on the spot and the party itself are reporting: Under its lead candidates Alice Weidel, a 38-year-old management consultant and Alexander Gauland, a 76-year-old German nationalist, the party has bounced form around 8% in the polls in August to between 11% and 13% last week. Its manifesto calls for all mosques and minarets to be banned, Muslim calls to prayer to stop and and people wearing the veil to be criminalised. The AfD has also called for a change in attitude to Germany’s historic crimes in the second world war. If polls are accurate it is expected to garner between 60 and 85 parliamentary seats. Today’s election results are being watched intently across Europe. Germany is the continent’s largest economy and its central role in EU decision-making is difficult to exaggerate. Contrary to many Brexit campaigners’ expectations, Merkel’s likely return as chancellor will make little difference to the terms on which the UK leaves the EU. But Greece, the EU member that has remained in the single currency thanks (some might say) to Teutonic largesse, is another matter, writes Helena Smith in Athens. All eyes are on Berlin. The ruling Syriza party has made clear it is rooting for its comrades-in-arms, the leftwing Die Linke. But with Germany having provided most of the three emergency bailouts that have kept debt-stricken Greece afloat – and dictated the tough conditions attached to them – the real talk here in Athens is who, if anyone, will replace Herr Wolfgang Schäuble at the helm of the finance ministry. The Syriza-led coalition is hoping to navigate Greece out of international supervision when its current €86bn bailout officially ends next summer – and, if all goes well, come to some agreement that sees its gargantuan debt load being substantially written off as well. Who is sitting in the finance minister’s chair will be likely to play a key role in how smoothly both go (or don’t). Much will depend on the make-up of the coalition that is eventually formed and whether the small liberal FDP party is a member of it, say Greek officials – who are preparing for a long night. The AfD is not popular everywhere. Here one Berlin resident posts a picture of a banner hanging from an apartment block in his home city today: My colleague Philip Oltermann points out that the nativist, anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party, which is set to enter the Bundestag for the first time, will not be – as many are saying – be the first far-right party to do so since the second world war. The last overtly nationalist party in the German parliament after 1945 was the Deutsche Partei, which had a part in government from 1949 until 1960. Recent polls have shown support for the AfD surging up to 13%, and many observers feel they may do better than that, particularly if turnout is low. This could in theory give the anti-Islam party around 70 seats in the new parliament. No other party will work with the AfD so it stands no chance of being in government, but its arrival in the Bundestag – and in appreciable numbers – marks a major shift in the tone and dynamic of Germany’s post-war politics. Sigmar Gabriel, Germany’s foreign minister, vice chancellor and a leading member of the social democrat SPD, is plainly not expecting his party to pull anything big out of the hat: “It’s not looking good,” he said earlier this afternoon. Going into the vote the SPD, which has governed in a so-called “grand coalition” with Merkel’s CDU since 2013, was trailing up to 15 points behind its rival on around 21-22% against the Christian Democrats’ 34-37%. The party enjoyed an early bounce following the nomination of the former European parliament president as its candidate to challenge Merkel, but that soon subsided. Judging by how it looks likely to perform, the party may well be reluctant to enter into another “grand coalition” with Merkel’s CDU. Voter turnout by early afternoon stood at 41.1%, the Federal returning officer has said based on a survey of a representative sample of polling stations – fractionally down on the previous election in 2013, when 41.4% of eligible voters had cast their ballots by 2pm. The figure does not include postal votes. Angela Merkelvoted shortly after 2pm at a polling station near her home in Berlin’s Mitte district with her husband, Joachim Sauer, who shielded both of them with an umbrella against the cold drizzle. The couple smiled and nodded at bystanders and reporters. Welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Germany’s federal elections – the vote that will decide whether Angela Merkel returns as the leader of Europe’s largest economy for a fourth consecutive term. Polls indicate there is little doubt that Merkel’s centre-right CDU and its CSU sister party are heading for a comfortable victory over their social democrat SPD rivals, and that “Mutti” – mummy – will remain chancellor. But in a major step-change in German politics, a late polling surge by the far-right, anti-immigrant AfD party is set to see it enter the Bundestag for the first time, possibly finishing as the third largest party and forming the official opposition in the new parliament.

Judged purely in punditry terms, the cross-dressing ex-footballer’s appearance on Match of the Day didn’t go well, but he has been trending heavily on social media where “reaction … has been almost universally divided”. David Tennant’s narration neatly skewers Auntie’s dilemma: “The problem for the BBC is that they don’t know what to do.” Jonathan Wright Through the Lens of Larkin 7.30pm, BBC4 Philip Larkin showed that not only was a bigot capable of poetic genius but he could also have a sideline in photography. He prefigured today’s selfies with a series of posed self-portraits, and documented his life, loves and the environs of post-second world war Hull, whose library he joined in 1955. The poet John Wedgwood Clarke visits the East Riding of Yorkshire and talks to those who knew Larkin. David Stubbs Rellik 9pm, BBC1 Under-used for a long time, post-Fortitude, Richard Dormer is in danger of being over-exposed as an intense policeman with ambiguous motives. In Rellik, though, there are more serious worries. Namely, how Gabriel will track the murderer and juggle his complex personal life – all the while contending with the reversed narrative. Tonight, Gabriel looks for his daughter in the incessant rain, Asim receives a threat, and creepy Barker is in for questioning.

This medical marvel, and more, will be explored in their new three-part series on human biology. The topics in this growth-themed episode range from fascinatingly fertile to deathly dull, but the brothers’ best bits are their personal reflections on adolescence: “I was probably as embarrassed by your puberty as my own,” remarks Xand/Chris. Ellen E Jones The Vietnam War 9pm, BBC4 Debut of Ken Burns and Lynn Novick’s 10-part study of the Vietnam war. It is, predictably, superb, reflecting judiciously on the resonant folly of the US’s intervention in Indochina, and including interviews with people who fought on all sides – and who opposed the war. This first episode reflects on the conflict’s gestation, as Vietnam is divided after the eviction of its French colonial overlords. Absolutely unmissable.

Parents of young children might be fooled into thinking that their mission has already been a success. After all, there’s already a CBeebies Peter Rabbit adaptation that paints the sedate, 115-year-old Beatrix Potter character as a go-get-’em adventurer whose escapades are typically soundtracked by a series of nightmarish sub-Levellers songs about standing your ground and laughing in the face of danger. But the scientists persisted. Yes, they’d hugely damaged the Peter Rabbit brand, but they hadn’t yet irreparably ruined it. Then one day, one of the scientists called his colleagues around. Shaking with the power of his own awful imagination, he pointed at what he’d written on his blackboard. It read “3D live-action/CGI animated adventure comedy movie”. The other scientists gasped, but one – emboldened by this hideous new vision – went one step further. He grabbed a piece of chalk and, trembling, added “Starring James Corden” beneath it. The scientists applauded. One started vomiting. They’d done it. At least based on its trailer, the Peter Rabbit film appears to have been aggressively engineered to make people sad. Even more so than other kids’ properties that have been given needless updates over the years, the Peter Rabbit film looks like the result of some blisteringly inept manhandling. Sure, Thunderbirds might have opted for a live-action remake directed by Riker from Star Trek. And, sure, The Magic Roundabout might have self-immolated twice over, casting Robbie Williams as Doogal in the UK version and rebranding entirely as Doogal (‘Things are about to get hairy!’) in America. And, obviously, Postman Pat was crushed into dust the moment someone made a film about him entering X Factor and fighting off a legion of robot cats. But there’s something genuinely harrowing about the sight of Peter Rabbit – gentle, Edwardian Peter Rabbit – thoughtlessly injuring some birds, or grabbing a pile of lettuce leaves and making it rain like a banker in a stripclub, or literally twerking. No joke, all of these things happen in the trailer. There’s even a moment where a badger hurls a hedgehog at a dartboard, and it’s so much like the dwarf-throwing scene from The Wolf of Wall Street that you’re left with the incontrovertible feeling that this entire venture was put together by people who genuinely hate Peter Rabbit. Just look at Mr McGregor. In all previous versions he’s been a villain – his primary objective has always been to cook Peter Rabbit in a pie – but in this trailer he’s the only sympathetic figure. He’s the guy who comes home to find his house trashed by Peter Rabbit, and his despair is palpable. “Not again,” he’d say if he hadn’t been so utterly numbed by trauma. That’s how much of a dick this Peter Rabbit is. He actually makes you side for the baddie. For shame. The fact that Corden – who, thanks to his roles in Trolls, The Emoji Movie and now this, seems like a man hellbent on screwing up as many kids as he can – voices Peter Rabbit just underlines it all. Something has gone terribly, terribly wrong along the way here. Beatrix Potter was a famous stickler for protecting her work – she refused to sell the Peter Rabbit rights to Walt Disney – so there is no way on Earth that she’d have ever given the green light to a slow-motion car crash like this. But now the floodgates are open, let’s really go for it. Let’s give Tom Kitten a machine gun and a thirst for vengeance. Let’s give Squirrel Nutkin a rocketpack and a sleeve tattoo.

What makes them so difficult to get right is that there’s no clear-cut formula. But there are certainly a few pointers to help you along. Ultimately, the sole point of a cover letter is to draw attention to your CV, which holds all of your relevant information, experience and skills. In just a couple of short paragraphs, you should be able to show competent language skills, that you’d be suitable for the role in terms of your skills and experience, and that you have a genuine interest in the job. To get this right, a cover letter should be unique to the organisation and job you’re applying to. “It must never feel like a one size fits all application letter that has been sent out to everyone,” says Hannah Morton-Hedges from Momentum Careers Advice. It’s important to show that you’ve researched the company, so you’re able to clearly show you’re the right person to work there. “We love to see covering letters where applicants have made a real effort to connect with us, show that they understand a bit about us and therefore why we would be a particularly good match for each other,” says Rachel Gowers, a people and culture manager at customer ratings firm TruRating. “What makes cover letters tricky is that they will always be subjective,” Morton-Hedges adds. “In my experience, it is those candidates who are really able to articulate their specific interest in the organisation who produce the stand-out examples.” In terms of what should actually go in the letter, the advice can vary, but essentially you should “explain why you have applied for this job, what appeals to you about the role and why you would love to work for this organisation”, says Lisa LaRue, career and interview coach at CareerWorx. Highlight why you would be suitable for the job – but make sure you don’t repeat the information on your CV. “A cover letter must explain how you meet the employers needs; it’s not about you, so don’t overuse ‘I’,” LaRue says. It’s an overstated but vital point that employers don’t have a lot of time to look at job applications, so cover letters should always be kept short and succinct. Jon Gregory, a job search, application and interview specialist, suggests that the best formula is to write an introduction that “states what job you are applying for and that you believe you’re a good match based on the ad requirements for the following reasons...” He suggests you should then include a three bullet point summary of why you are a great choice to interview: “It gets them to open your CV with enthusiasm.” Another option is “an introduction, a body consisting of two paragraphs outlining your suitability for the role – including competency examples wherever possible – and a closing paragraph reiterating your interest and fit for the role,” says Victoria McLean, founder of CityCV.co.uk. The style of the cover letter will always depend on the person and the industry, but it’s widely recommended to keep professional. Sarah Archer, founder of CareerTree, says: “Some [sectors] are more traditional and will expect a formal letter style, others will be happy with an informal approach.” It’s always best to address the letter to a named person – LinkedIn is usually a good place to search, or it’s advisable to call the organisation and ask for the correct name. If not, you can use “Dear Sir/Madam” (although this formality may not be suitable for more modern, startup companies). If you’re worried about coming across too professional so that any semblance of your personality disappears, you could open the letter with something friendly like, “I hope you’re well”, advises Andrew Fennell, the director of StandOut CV, adding, “keep the tone of your writing slightly conversational, especially when emailing.” To maintain a more natural and personal tone, try drafting it in “spoken form first. This can help to signpost any overly formal or clunky wording”, says Lis McGuire, founder of Giraffe CV. And if a job ad doesn’t specifically ask for a cover letter, it’s always worth writing an email in the shape of a cover letter anyway. “A cover letter is simply a note to introduce yourself and ensure that your CV gets opened, so in this case you should write your cover note in the body of the email,” says Fennell. McGuire agrees: “A cover email is a pitch. Imagine it as what you’d say to the recipient if you had the chance to hand over your CV and letter in person.” A good cover letter should be able to make potential employers take an interest in you. But to show them why you’d be the right person for job, you must first “know what is good about yourself. The key is to take stock of your unique selling points”, says LaRue. “You need to really understand the value you bring to a potential employer to tell them why you’re best for the job.” Looking for a job?

The government repeatedly claims it is pumping money into rapid improvements, while a number of stories in recent days reinforces the impression that services are unravelling in the face of unparalleled demand. The Education Policy Institute has revealed that more than a quarter of children referred to specialist mental health services in 2016-17 – tens of thousands – were turned away (pdf). According to figures obtained by Labour MP and mental health campaigner Luciana Berger, for the third year running more than half of clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) are planning to either cut or freeze their mental health budgets, despite government pledges that funding will increase. Researchers from the University College London (UCL) Institute of Education and the University of Liverpool have shown that 24% of 14-year-old girls and 9% of boys reported experiencing depression. The numbers indicate that mental health problems among girls rise sharply as they enter adolescence, and parents underestimate the problem. A review of almost 300 case files by children’s charity Barnardo’s has shown that two-thirds of care leavers with mental health needs were not receiving any help from public services. It estimates that one in four care leavers suffer a mental health crisis. Personal stories brutally expose the consequences of poor care. In August, senior family judge Sir James Munby said the nation would have blood on its hands if an NHS bed could not be found for an acutely suicidal teenage girl. In June, the Times Education Supplement revealed that treatment thresholds for children were so high that a growing number were driven to carry out mock suicide attempts – including taking overdoses – so they would get treated. Yet around 120,000 more people are expected to receive mental health care in 2016-17 (pdf). There are now access standards and waiting time targets. The government aims to recruit an additional 21,000 mental health workers by 2021. The Department for Education has committed £1.4bn over five years to improving children’s mental health services. Growing numbers of children are receiving treatment for illnesses such as eating disorders and psychosis. NHS England’s mental health dashboard is bringing long overdue transparency to mental health services – and of course is exposing problems, such as more than half of CCGs missing their target for access to talking therapies. The political and media convulsions around mental health are reminiscent of changing attitudes to child protection in recent decades. A hidden, little understood and desperately underestimated problem has now burst into the national consciousness. Claims of improvements are buried by data from the public sector, regulators, charities and academics exposing the scale of the problem, while growing understanding drives up demand for services. Under intense pressure, the NHS is beset with contradictory signals – record funding and record deficits, growing staff numbers and increasing vacancies, growing productivity and falling performance scores. Now mental health services have never looked worse, just as they begin to show progress on a long journey of improvement. A big part of the problem, as always, is translating national promises into local action. CCG figures obtained by Berger indicate that many parts of the country still regard mental health as a low priority, while others are hamstrung by the ceaseless financial demands of acute hospitals. The workforce plan looks desperately optimistic, with little confidence among service providers (pdf) that the NHS will be able to recruit enough psychiatrists and mental health nurses. It depends on everything from creating new roles to changing retirement rules and improving the health of the workforce. Ringfencing the extra money won’t help. It will simply exacerbate serious financial problems elsewhere in the system. Mental health services are certainly improving, but parts of the country are falling behind. Parity of esteem with physical health is a myth in many places. Mental health workers are still not accorded the respect they deserve from other professionals. The financial and workforce pressures across the NHS are a serious impediment to progress. It is fanciful to imagine that major advances in mental healthcare can be sustained without fixing the problems in primary care and hospitals.

No one in English league history has failed more often – nine times in 10 attempts – in the post-season than the Lancashire club. That is not to say that if you had offered their fans a top-six finish in pre-season, when their manager Simon Grayson was poached by Sunderland, they would have turned you down. But now, under Alex Neil, even at this early stage in the season, there are genuine hopes of a top-two finish and promotion to the Premier League for the first time. It is not just the numbers – fourth in the table, one defeat in eight, two points from the top – that support this theory, but the manner in which they have gone about their business: no Championship side have conceded fewer goals and they look incisive and attractive going forward, with the much-coveted Jordan Hugill leading the line. It is the numbers on the balance sheet that makes all this even more impressive. Since arriving in July, Neil has made just one permanent signing, Darnell Fisher from Rotherham United. Seeing value in a defender who was part of a relegated side who conceded 98 league goals last season is perhaps a little unconventional. Yet Fisher has been outstanding, and with the help of the others Preston have conceded only twice in the seven league games he has played. Neil has added three other new faces: Stephy Mavididi on loan from Arsenal and two from the under-18s: Callum Roberts and Josh Earl, who has already made the left-back spot his own. Everyone and everything else already existed at in the first-team, yet in the space of 12 weeks, Neil has transformed them from a steady mid-table side that finished the last two seasons in 11th. All the work has been done on the training ground to create a new philosophy focused on counterattacking football and a high press. “I wanted to change the style of play from the previous regime – which had good success at this club, so there’s no mocking that, but I felt looking at the squad there was enough energy and quality to go and play differently,” Neil says. “When the opposition have got the ball, we want it as quickly as possible. We don’t sit off the game and let them have it.. Make them make mistakes. Hurt them in the transitions. When we’ve got it, we want to rotate it quickly, don’t give them a chance to get set and press you, and try to be as aggressive with our passing as we can.” Neil’s high-octane style does come with its downsides. Injuries could be more prevalent while discipline is already poor: Preston are top of the Championship charts by a distance in that regard. The availability of their most important players could wane in the coming months. But talking to Neil, still only 36 years old, you can feel a fire has been lit under him. He speaks in a thick Scottish accent – the only remaining manager in England’s top two leagues to do so – in the same single-minded way that his team plays: with relentless energy. As he prepares for Millwall on Saturday, Neil is a man in a hurry – but between the Norwich sacking in March and Preston hiring him, he had time to reflect on what went wrong in Norfolk. “A learning curve for me was getting to the Premier League with Norwich where I felt at times we had to adjust our approach,” he explains. “Looking back, I would never do that again – I would carry on with the style that I’ve adopted. Now, I’ve got the courage of my convictions in terms of how I want my teams to play. I’ve got complete clarity in my mind.” Neil’s style is only possible with certain players, and he was lucky to inherit attackers who are lung-busting fit and possess great pace and speed of thought: Sean Maguire, signed from Cork City in the summer, and Tom Barkhuizen, a January addition from Morecambe, have particularly impressed alongside Hugill, a square-shouldered six-footer signed from Port Vale in 2014 who was the subject of £8m bids from Wolves and Reading in the summer. Hugill even handed in a transfer request, which was rejected. “Although he’s been promised the riches of wherever, the one thing Jordan did was conduct himself in an immaculate manner. But I did have some difficult conversations with him. We didn’t want to lose our striker; he wanted to try and further his career and make some money for himself. But when the window shut he made it easy for myself, for himself and for the squad.” Without that fee, money remains tight and a strict wage cap remains in place. But signing and polishing young diamonds from the lower leagues and Ireland seems to be working. “I think age is a big thing,” Neil adds. “A lot of the Norwich players had made their money, and there’s a big difference from younger players trying to find their way.” Only Barnsley and Brentford have fielded a younger starting XI than Preston this season in the division. A founding member of the Football League, Preston perhaps do not get the recognition they deserve. “The issue with the club, from an outside perspective, is that we’re one of the clubs that hasn’t been in the modern-day Premier League, says Neil, who took Norwich up via the play-offs in 2015, with North End replacing them by winning the League One version against Swindon. “Because we haven’t been there, we get disregarded to an extent.” Indeed they are one of only five Championship clubs to have never played in the Premier League, but right now they are getting closer with each game."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/22/documents-that-kim-philby-passed-to-ussr-on-display-for-first-time","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T13:36:56Z","webTitle":"Documents that Kim Philby passed to USSR on display for first time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/22/documents-that-kim-philby-passed-to-ussr-on-display-for-first-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/22/documents-that-kim-philby-passed-to-ussr-on-display-for-first-time","fields":{"headline":"Documents that Kim Philby passed to USSR on display for first time","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Secret wartime documents passed by a British double agent to his Soviet handlers have been made public for the first time at a Moscow exhibition dedicated to the spy’s career. Kim Philby was the most notorious of the “Cambridge five”, British communists who spied for Moscow and evaded suspicion for years due to their upper-class credentials. He worked for the Soviet Union from the 1930s onwards and was unmasked in 1963. During his years working for British intelligence as a double agent, he passed hundreds of sensitive documents to the Russians. The documents on display in Moscow are mainly from 1944 and concern diplomatic cables intercepted by British intelligence, which Philby then passed on to his Russian handlers. The documents are marked at the top in red: “Top Secret. To be kept under lock and key: never to be removed from the office.” One, dated 31 July 1944, is a record of a cable from the Japanese ambassador in Venice to the foreign minister in Tokyo, and recounts a meeting the ambassador had with Benito Mussolini, in which the Italian leader spoke of a visit to Germany to meet Adolf Hitler on 20 July, the day an assassination plot against the Nazi leader failed. Through the circuitous route of the Japanese ambassador reporting Mussolini’s description of the day, intercepted by the Brits and passed by Philby to the Soviets, Moscow received a report of the failed bombing attempt: “The force of the explosion was astonishing, and the Führer sustained minor injuries to his left hand and arm. He also hurt a joint in his right shoulder and some of his hair was burned.” Other British reports of Japanese cables on display detail German military plans and relay concerns about potential weak spots in the German army planning. The documents have recently been declassified by Russia’s SVR intelligence service, the successor to the foreign spying arm of the KGB. After fleeing to Russia in 1963, Philby lived in Moscow until his death in 1988. Some of the spies he helped train after his arrival in Russia attended the opening of the exhibit, as did Sergei Naryshkin, current head of the SVR. “He spent the last 25 years of his life in Russia working as a consultant for the Soviet foreign intelligence, and today many of our current Russian intelligence operatives proudly call themselves Philby’s students,” says Naryshkin. The exhibit provided a report from a training seminar Philby held for young KGB spies in the early 1980s on how best to work in the west. Philby complained that many of his students insisted on arguing forcefully in favour of Soviet policies. “I have tried to persuade them that their primary object is not necessarily to defend Soviet policy, but to establish close contacts with people, and that in a pluralistic society can only be done by conceding that many views other than the Soviet view can be sincerely and intelligently held,” Philby’s report states. Although he never learned Russian and surrounded himself with British newspapers and books while living in Moscow, Philby remained a committed communist to the end. In an address Philby made to his KGB comrades in 1977, to mark the 60th anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution, he heaped praise on Felix Dzerzhinsky, the founder of the Soviet secret police. He said that although he had worked in western intelligence services before his flight to Moscow, it was only now he felt at home: “There I felt myself surrounded by wolves; here I know that I am with comrades, colleagues and friends.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/sep/24/uci-cycling-world-championships-2017-elite-mens-road-race-live-peter-sagan","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T15:08:53Z","webTitle":"Peter Sagan wins third consecutive world road race title – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/sep/24/uci-cycling-world-championships-2017-elite-mens-road-race-live-peter-sagan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/sep/24/uci-cycling-world-championships-2017-elite-mens-road-race-live-peter-sagan","fields":{"headline":"Peter Sagan wins third consecutive world road race title – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"After 267.5km, it came down to a matter of inches. But Peter Sagan is the world champion again, just as he was in 2015 and 2016, and the rainbow jersey is his once more. A remarkable achievement. Thanks for reading! Some race too for Great Britain’s Ben Swift. He had a mechanical failure with four laps to go, and had to change his bike, but got back in the saddle and back up to the front of the peloton very quickly. With 300m to go, he looked like he might get on the podium, but it wasn’t to be. That would have hurt for the home favourite Alexander Kristoff. He looked the more likely to take the victory coming down the home straight, but Sagan dug deep and found something. Remember he skipped the Vuelta specially to train for this event, and that might just have been the difference in that last lap. Former Astana rider Scarponi died earlier this year while on a training ride following a collision with a minibus. Sagan – I’m sorry to say without his long locks, he’s had a haircut – looks relaxed, laughing and joking with his friends as he makes his way through the crowd. He looks like he’s been out for a morning stroll, not 6hours28minutes in the saddle. Here he is in front of the cameras: For the last five kilometres, I said to myself, it’s already done. But it’s unbelievable. This is something special. You saw in the climb, we were in pieces. And at the finish, it all happened in seconds. I am very happy, thank you to all my national team-mates. I want to dedicate this win to Michele Scarponi, it would have been his birthday tomorrow. And I want to dedicate this victory to my wife. We are expecting a baby. Matteo Trentin of Italy grabs fourth and Great Britain’s Ben Swift comes in fifth! What a performance! Sagan is mobbed by his adoring fans. The Slovakian becomes the first man to ever win three consecutive world titles. He’s quickly becoming a legend in this sport. We barely mentioned his name the whole race, but he bided his time, wasn’t ruffled by the early attacks and timed his move to perfection. Sagan pips Kristoff on the line! By only a few inches. That was a photo finish, but Sagan just about got there ahead of Kristoff! Michael Matthews, the Australian, comes in third. Alexander Kristoff and Peter Sagan go for the line, they’re neck and neck and they sprint down the home straight! 100m to go! It’s all change! Alaphilippe has gone. Ben Swift is there, Sagan is there … Helpfully, the TV coverage has dropped completely. The single camera that seems to be working is a fixed one on the 1km mark. We’re waiting to see who comes round the corner first … Alaphilippe has dropped Moscon! Three kilometres left! Five kilometres left, as the riders rush down the flat into the city centre. Vasil Kiryienka is closing on the two leaders. Onto the cobbles they go, will we see another attack? This is by no means a definite race-winning lead over the peloton. Simon Geschke is leading the chasing pack, GB’s Ben Swift is there too! Where is Sagan? Out of nowhere, Italy’s Gianni Moscon, who is normally part of Team Sky, joins Alaphilippe. So it’s two riders out front, with a lead of about 10 seconds. Nine kilometres left! Ten minutes! And it is Alaphilippe that pulls away! He’s out of his own, but has a decent lead of about five seconds. Up on his haunches he pulls himself up Salmon Hill. Greg Van Avermaet attacks! Ooooof! Julian Alaphilippe follows! And onto Salmon Hill we go. It’s the first bit of the climb that is the hardest. The Swiss are well positioned. This is it! Tony Gallopin is the next to go. But he’s on his own. No chance. Yep, Langeveld and Martens are caught. They went too early. Oh my! Something from the spectators rolled into the middle of the road, and about 10 riders came within a hair’s breadth of hitting it. That could have been disastrous! It’s all going to come down to the final climb of Salmon Hill, I’m sure. Langeveld and Martens would have expended a lot of energy there, and there’s fresh legs at the front of the peloton. The peloton hurl themselves up the first of the three inclines, as they leave the city centre. Dutchman Sebastian Langeveld and Germany’s Paul Martens lead an attack out and open up a gap! 14km to go. Mas did open up a gap of about five seconds but the peloton is stubborn. We are one group once more. The riders cross the line for the last time –19km left – and the bell sounds, the crowd goes wild. The people line the streets in the city centre, and there’s a large park with a big screen with people cheering. I can’t see a blade of grass, they like they’re cycling in Norway. If you’re wondering where Sagan is, he’s nestled nicely in the peloton, sheltered. The riders cruise down the hill into the city centre for the penultimate time. Spain’s Lluís Mas is the next to have a go, but he’s on his own. One lap to go. Thirty kilometres to go. Wellens’s leading pack still has a small lead, six seconds. Dumoulin has been caught. But we’ll see lots of these attacks in the next few minutes. Dumoulin attacks again up Salmon Hill! And this time, he gets clear of the peloton! It looks like Wellens and co will be caught. Tom Dumoulin charges out from the peloton with Diego Ulissi but they are caught almost immediately. Just testing the water. But that little burst means that the peloton is just 11 seconds behind now. The USA’s Tejay van Garderen goes down! He was in the middle of the tightly-packed peloton and touched wheels. He gets his leg caught but doesn’t look hurt. That should be his race over. Two laps to go as the leaders cross the line for the 10th time. Germany’s Nils Politt has attacked from the peloton on his own, he’s 16 seconds ahead of the pack, 23 seconds behind the leaders. The leading pack has extended their lead. I really didn’t see that coming, but Wellens – his face grimacing – has put his foot on the gas, dragging six others with him. Lots of jostling and chatting going on in the peloton, as team-mates try and get themselves together to discuss their tactical plans for the remains 40km. Four of the nine British riders have retired: Adam Blythe, Owain Doull, Jonathan Dibben and Ian Stannard have all called it a day. I reckon we’ve got about an hour of racing left. The average speed is up to about 45km/hr. Britain’s Scott Thwaites at the front of the peloton there. The gap got to as big as 36 seconds but it’s back to 26 seconds now. Barguil and the French team are leading the chase at the front of the peloton. I think we’ll see them catch the leaders in a few minutes. Up Salmon Hill they go. The leaders complete their ninth lap, three to go. It’s been five hours and twelve minutes in the saddle so far. Ouch. The peloton don’t appear to be too concerned by that breakaway group. They aren’t going flat out to reel them in, the gap has risen to 32 seconds. The lead group comprises of Wellens, Boom, Haller, France’s Julian Alaphilippe, Spain’s David de la Cruz, Italy’s Alessandro De Marchi, Colombia’s Jarlinson Pantano and Australia’s Jack Haig. Sixty-five kilometres to go, and Haller and Wellens now have established a breakaway group of about eight riders as they strode up Salmon Hill. Lars Boom has joined the group. There a gap of about five seconds. The peloton splits! The road narrows and as the peloton tightens, there’s a small breakaway at the front, led by New Zealand’s Jack Bauer and France’s Warren Barguil. The peloton quickly catches them, but I think this will be the start of lots of sniping attacks by different riders. We’ll see if any of them stick. Barguil then has a go, with Lars Boom hot on his heels, but again the peloton reels the Frenchman in. Some of the leading riders – Sagan, Matthews, Hagen, Van Avermaet – are Marco Haller is the next to lead the charge. He leads the race for about two minutes before Belgium’s Paul Wellens catches his back wheel. Belgium’s Julian Vermote has had a crash at the front! It looks like a pedal touched the concrete as he zoomed around a bend. He went down hard, and his chain came off. Everyone else managed to avoid him, but that’s Vermote’s race run. He’s OK, gives a thumbs up to the cameras. The peloton complete another lap, four to go. The average pace is about 40km/hr, but expect that to rise from hereon in. It rains 250 days a year in Bergen, but the course is bone dry today. That really makes a big difference on a lot of those long, sweeping bends and on that 600m stretch of cobbles. There’s barely a breath of wind. The peloton envelope Smit, and we are one group. It’s the Belgians and the Polish riders that are at the front at the moment. Michal Kwiatkowski, one of the favourites and the winner of this race in 2014, is there. Any questions, thoughts or comments, hit me up on michael.butler@theguardian.com | or tweet me @michaelbutler18. The South African Willem Smit is the only one remaining of that leading group, which was originally a 10-man strong group. But as he glances over his shoulder, the peloton are just a few seconds behind. Smit whizzes down the hill at about 70km/hr and into a tunnel as he enters the city centre. The peloton have injected some pace, and are now less than 30 seconds behind the leaders. Ninety kilometres to go, and I’m a little surprised that it has taken this long, particularly those that aren’t traditionally sprinters like Tom Dumoulin won’t want to leave it late for his attack. He’ll want to get out in front with a lap or two to go, and hopefully stave off any late challenges. Salah Eddine Mraouni has slipped from the leading pack, he’s clinging onto the solitary Maxim Belkov, who attacked from the peloton a few minutes ago. But the Moroccan is struggling to keep pace, he’ll slip back. The peloton cross the line, there’s five laps to go, and there’s about 2min 45secs behind the leaders. There’s a small crash at the back of the peloton as they whizz round a corner, Colombia’s Nelson Sotto goes down but he’s straight back up and back in the saddle. No other casualties, although of course some of the nearby riders did lose some momentum as they negotiated their way around the crash. We’ve had just five riders retire out of the 196 starters. The most notable of those is Mathew Hayman, the Australia captain. Another Australian, who does have a genuine chance of victory here, is Michael Mathews, who won the green jersey at this year’s Tour de France. The two most challenging parts of the circuit are the 600m ride through the cobbles in the city centre – which adds up to a total of 7km by the time that they have ridden 12 laps – and of course Salmon Hill. It’s not a massive climb, just 1.5km, but the total climb in the race adds up to 2,400m, which is nothing to sniff at. In terms of the finish, the city centre is pancake flat, has those cobbles, and a hairpin bend about 300m before the line, which there is a straight sprint to. I expect there to be a sprint finish on the final lap, although it probably won’t be a big group. Salmon Hill should break up the peloton nicely. There’s about 100km to go then, and the leaders are less than 1min57secs ahead of the peloton. It’s not a case of if they will be caught, but when. Brit watch: Mark Cavendish is not here – he was pipped on the line in last year’s race by Sagan, and knocked off his bike by the Slovakian at the Tour de France – he is still recovering from his injuries and there’s also no Geraint Thomas. There’s nothing left in the tank for Chris Froome, who claimed bronze in the time trial here earlier this week. Ben Swift represents probably GB’s best hope, although he’s realistically probably aiming for a top-10 finish. GB do have a full nine-man team out here, including Peter Kennaugh, Ian Stannard, Owain Doull and Adam Blyth. Ooooof! The gap between peloton and the leaders is now down less than three minutes and Russia’s Maxim Belkov have just launched a chase of the pack, he’s 27 seconds clear of the peloton, 2min21secs behind the leaders. The race started with a 40km ride along the coast into Bergen, and they are just about to start their seventh lap of 12 around the city circuit, which includes a 1.5km climb up Salmon Hill – a 6.4% average gradient to the top – which is 987m above sea level. It’s fair to say there’s a bit more enthusiasm on the sidelines compared to last year’s race in Doha … We join the men’s race about 150km into 267.5km race. Their is a breakaway group of nine riders – Ireland’s Conor Dunne, Sean McKenna, USA’s Alexey Vermeulen, South Africa’s Willem Jakobus Smit, Morocco’s Salah Eddine Mraouni, Costa Rica’s Andrey Amador, Sweden’s Kim Magnusson, Azerbaijan’s Elchin Asadov and Albania’s Eugert Zhupa. Three minutes and 50 seconds behind them is the peloton, including Lars Boom, Dumoulin, Sagan, Michal Kwiatkowski, Edvald Boasson Hagen and some of the other favourites. The gap was as big as eight minutes so the peloton are slowly reeling the leaders in. Anyway, back to more important matters in Norway. Holland’s Chantal Blaak was the surprise winner of women’s world road race title yesterday: she’s served as a domestique in various teams throughout the years but was fully deserving of the win, despite suffering a nasty crash early on – that left her with a bloodied shoulder - she broke away with six others on the final lap (including three Dutch riders) and eventually pulled clear, rolling home 28 seconds ahead of second-placed Katrin Garfoot. Britain’s Lizzie Deignan finished a disappointing 41st, three weeks after appendix surgery. Hannah Barnes was the highest-placed British cyclist in 14th overall. If you haven’t done so already, you should read William Fotheringham’s excellent interview with Deignan, which was published on Friday. Always worth getting that Grease video out. Superb lip-syncing from Peter and his wife (playing Sandy) Katarina. They got married in 2015, where the Slovakian turned up looking like something out of Game of Thrones, cut a log up with a chainsaw, released a dove and rode off into the sunset. It is fair to say that Peter Sagan has had a mixed 2017 season. From his dramatic crash with Mark Cavendish and subsequent disqualification from the Tour de France to celebrating his 100th career victory at the Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec earlier this month, Sagan always seems to keep things interesting and decided to skip the Vuelta a España in order to train specifically for this race – having won it in 2015 and 2016, the Slovakian would become the first man since the race’s 1927 inception to complete the hat-trick. Unsurprisingly he’s favourite to retain his crown. After the heat, high winds and sandstorms in last year’s race in Doha, Qatar, in which approximately three spectators littered the side of the road, the UCI settled on Bergen in Norway for this year’s edition. Having visited the Norway town once myself, I can tell you that a McDonald’s meal will cost you in excess of £10 and that the weather is changeable, which should at least spice up the technical parts of the race, round the tight-ish corners, and across the cobbles. There’s no rain forecast but a downpour is never very far away in that part of the world. Sagan’s rivals will include the home favourite Edvald Boasson Hagen, Polish rider Michal Kwiatkowski, Colombian Fernando Gaviria, Italian Matteo Trentin and new time trial champion, Tom Dumoulin. The winner of the 2016 Olympic road race, Belgian Greg Van Avermaet, is also worth a punt. But all eyes will be on Sagan, and that’s the way he likes it.

The isle is Skye and the film, made by Bill Forsyth in 1983, remains one of Scotland’s cinematic triumphs. Fittingly, this stretch of Skye coastline is to become home to a brave new adventure for the Scottish film industry. This week the film producer Chris Young, a former disciple of Forsyth, is launching a major film centre on the south of the Hebridean island that will emulate Robert Redford’s famous Sundance complex in Utah. “The Sundance Institute’s feature film programme has really inspired us,” said Young this weekend. “At their base in Utah, with the backdrop of the Rocky Mountains, participants are encouraged to take creative risks and experiment.” After years working on small-budget films and Gaelic-language television projects, Young’s fortunes changed overnight in 2011 with the success of The Inbetweeners Movie, based on the popular Channel 4 sitcom. Its huge box office success, taking the record for the biggest opening weekend for a comedy in British cinemas, made its producer a rich man. “It was like winning the lottery,” Young told the Observer, “although few people had thought it would make money. Financial advisers were soon telling me to invest in property in London and I was on the point of doing so when I thought about my family back on Skye and realised there was a way to promote a homegrown Scottish film production centre as well as work near home.” The Young Films studio already running inside Sabhal Mòr Ostaig, a higher-education college in Fas near the Sound of Sleat, is the base for making the successful Gaelic television series Bannan and production soon starts on a major feature film about the Lockerbie disaster. But now, in collaboration with the Glasgow and Edinburgh film festivals and the National Film and Television School, Young has created a residential training scheme to encourage new talent, as well as planning an annual forum for directors, writers and producers to watch movies and discuss the industry. The new Young Film Foundation will initially offer six developing film-makers time to work on their projects under guidance and has won support from Creative Scotland. “The pilot will offer a unique opportunity for new Scottish-based writers, directors and producers to develop their projects with experienced industry practitioners across feature film, comedy and broadcast drama,” said the organisation’s Mark Thomas. Young, who was born in Edinburgh and speaks Gaelic, has lived on Skye with his children and his artist wife, Julie Brook, for 20 years and most of his work has been based there since 2012. “To me, it has always been an inspiring and creative place,” he said. “We couldn’t film Bannan without the support of our local community, so while conceiving this foundation it was important that it was very much tied to Sleat and Skye.” Young also aims to boost the wider Scottish production scene, which shows clear signs of a renaissance. Last year the Scottish culture secretary Fiona Hyslop revealed that a record £52.7m had been spent filming in Scotland in 2015. This was a £7m increase on the previous year and marked the growing use of Scottish landscapes as backdrops for large-scale productions, such as the recent hit British-American television show Outlander. The new Avengers blockbuster from Marvel Studios, Avengers: Infinity War, is thought to be the largest single production Scotland has ever seen, while director David Mackenzie is currently shooting a big budget film about Robert the Bruce for Netflix, Outlaw King, starring Chris Pine, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Florence Pugh. What is more, a contentious proposal for a £250m studio near Edinburgh won approval from the Scottish government last April, and BBC Scotland has announced plans for a new Scottish channel. In recognition of all this activity Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon announced last month that the National Film and Television School is to set up a hub in Scotland next year. It will be based at BBC Scotland’s studios in Pacific Quay in Glasgow and at Dumbarton Studios, just outside the city. But Young believes Skye can be both the biggest lure and a complementary facility for film-makers in Scotland. He plays down recent claims that the island is overrun with visitors. “This is a ridiculous claim really, because the island thrives on visitors and there are only a very few sites which get busy at certain times of year. I know people will want to come to Skye to make films and learn, and that is not just because of the new Torabhaig whisky distillery also opening nearby early next year,” he said. “Just as the Rockies are a huge feature of Sundance, we believe our place in the Scottish Highlands and islands is key to attracting applicants and world-class mentors. Eventually, I hope we can make Skye as renowned as Sundance.” Downloaded applications for the Young Film Foundation can be submitted in English or in Gaelic via the website from 23 October to 1 December."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/23/what-no-queues-has-apple-lost-its-core-supporters","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T23:05:29Z","webTitle":"What, no queue?

Former Aer Lingus chief executive Willie Walsh, now supremo of British Airways’ parent company IAG, was driving when he heard O’Leary interviewed on the radio, bragging about Ryanair’s low prices compared with those of the Irish flag carrier. Walsh, a pugnacious character himself, pulled over, called the radio station and invited himself into the studio to dispute his rival’s claims. What followed was an acrimonious encounter, each man lobbing vicious barbs at one another. But as soon as they came off air, a beaming O’Leary strode up to Walsh and shook his hand, saying: “That was brilliant Willie, we must do this again as soon as possible.” For most of his 23 years as chief executive, O’Leary has lived by the motto that there is no such thing as bad publicity. His roll-call of insults, outlandish claims and four-letter tirades is too long to rehearse exhaustively, but there are some particular highlights. He once joked that Ryanair pilots would “engineer a bit of turbulence” in order to boost drinks sales and has also said he would like to charge for use of the toilet. “I would wipe their bums for a fiver,” he quipped. Most bosses would never dream of insulting customers, but O’Leary has made a virtue of it, calling passengers forced to pay a €60 fine for forgetting their boarding card “stupid”. On occasion he has managed to insult diametrically opposed interest groups within a sentence. “The airline business is mostly run by a bunch of spineless nincompoops who actually don’t want to stand up to the environmentalists and call them the lying wankers that they are,” he has said. Born into an affluent farming family, he attended Clongowes Wood, the elite private boarding school in County Kildare, and Trinity College Dublin. While many airline bosses were once pilots, O’Leary trained as an accountant, advising the airline’s founder Tony Ryan on his personal tax affairs, before enjoying a rapid rise to the top job at Ryanair under Ryan’s wing. Somewhere along the way, he has become better known for bombast and an understanding of how to grab the attention of the media. Possessed of a shrewd financial mind, O’Leary spotted that the future lay in the low-cost model that has turned Ryanair into Europe’s biggest airline by passenger numbers, learning from and building on the business strategy pioneered by US carrier Southwest Airlines. Ryanair’s initial success was built on luring passengers with rock-bottom fares, while charging them for everything from checking in their luggage to inflight food and drink. Costs were also kept to a minimum by measures including making staff pay for their own training, uniforms and meals. However, after Ryanair slipped to a quarterly loss at the end of 2013 O’Leary introduced a radical new corporate philosophy – being nicer – which has helped the airline kick on to further success. The carrier introduced new features including allocated seating, bottle-warming, changing facilities, free room for children’s car-seats, an extra cabin bag for children and discounts on their checked-in bags. It also allowed passengers to take a second bag without incurring a fine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/23/anorexia-overshadowed-bbc3-series-youtube-confessionals","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T23:04:29Z","webTitle":"YouTube-style confessionals expose anorexia’s devastating hold in BBC drama","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/23/anorexia-overshadowed-bbc3-series-youtube-confessionals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/23/anorexia-overshadowed-bbc3-series-youtube-confessionals","fields":{"headline":"YouTube-style confessionals expose anorexia’s devastating hold in BBC drama","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Anorexia has long been a controversial subject for film and TV with dramas such as Netflix’s To The Bone attracting a wave of negative attention. Now BBC3 aims to counterbalance those negative headlines with Overshadowed, which mimics the feel of confessional YouTube video diaries to paint a devastating, realistic picture of the way in which the illness can take hold. The drama series was produced by Rollem, the company set up by screenwriter Kay Mellor, and written by Irish newcomers Eva O’Connor and Hildegard Ryan. Mellor became involved as executive producer after watching O’Connor’s play, Overshadowed and directed by Ryan, in Dublin. “I’ve been interested in body image for a long time and when I watched [the play] Overshadowed it seemed as though I was learning things about anorexia that I didn’t know before,” Mellor says. “I realised it might work on TV.” The TV version of Overshadowed comprises eight 10-minute episodes, and tells the story of Imogene (Michelle Fox), a gawky and enthusiastic teenager who starts up her own video blog, an upbeat mixture of tips, advice and light-hearted personal confessions. But beneath Imogene’s cheery facade things aren’t so straightforward: she’s made a new friend in Anna (O’Connor) who tells her that the only way to become perfect is to exercise more and eat less. The decision to personify Imogene’s anorexia, portraying it as a devil on the shoulder whispering bad advice, was based on O’Connor’s own lengthy experience with an eating disorder. “What I wanted to make clear is that anorexia is a mental illness and it’s relentless. It’s with you every minute of the day,” she says. “When somebody has an eating disorder they can be really difficult to live with. They can be cruel and reckless and self-destructive. “One of the things I wanted to say with Overshadowed is that it’s not the person that’s like that, it’s the thing living inside them. On my first day in therapy my therapist said, ‘imagine it like a creepy demon living in your biscuit cupboard’. That’s how the character was born.” They chose the 10-minute format and filmed from Imogene’s perspective to mimic the setup of YouTube’s streaming videos, says Ryan. It allows Overshadowed to reflect on how today’s teenagers watch content and comment on the way social media allows us to present our “best selves” to the world. “When I look at Instagram or Twitter, I’m always struck by the difference between the image and the reality,” says Fox. “Everyone posts the life they want you to see but what happens when that image becomes impossible to sustain?” O’Connor and Ryan didn’t want Overshadowed to fall prey to the issues that have affected previous anorexia dramas. Fox didn’t lose weight for the role and the progression of Imogene’s illness is instead suggested by clever make-up and wardrobe choices. “One of the biggest problems I have is when films or TV shows just make the person look thinner but still looking great. It brings a morbid fascination to the idea of eating disorders and that’s not what we were aiming for,” she says. Yet it is also not without hope. “The power is that you see her getting worse and worse but you also see her find her resilient self as well,” says Ryan. For O’Connor, playing the monster was ultimately an empowering experience. “I never wanted to play somebody with an eating disorder but I did want to talk about it,” she says. “Playing Anna is almost like my final two fingers to anorexia, like ‘ha, ha, I’m embodying you on screen now bitch.’ There’s something that’s really fun about that.” Overshadowed is on BBC3 from October"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/22/swansea-city-watford-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T17:30:37Z","webTitle":"Swansea City v Watford: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/22/swansea-city-watford-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/22/swansea-city-watford-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Swansea City v Watford: match preview","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Contrasting results for these clubs last weekend, Swansea picked up a point at Wembley and Watford were hammered 6-0 at home by Manchester City.

The 18-year-old has made only two Premiership starts for Harlequins, including a man-of-the-match performance against Wasps last weekend, but he was on Friday named in Jones’ 33-man squad for the three-day training camp in Oxford. In total Smith has played 196 minutes of Premiership rugby but he shone in the win over Wasps, kicking 14 points including two crucial late penalties. Jones first encountered Smith after a college match in 2015 when the Australian was in charge of Japan at the World Cup in Brighton, where Smith has just finished his studies. The Philippines-born fly-half is highly unlikely to feature in England’s first autumn Test against Argentina on 11 November, however, with Jones describing him as an “apprentice”. Jones considers Smith his fifth choice for the No10 jersey but he did concede that, while he knows 80% of the World Cup squad, he is on the lookout for bolters, highlighting Nehe Milner-Skudder’s late run into New Zealand’s side in 2015. The wing made his international debut a month before the World Cup but finished the competition with six tries and a winners’ medal. “What I would like to find is someone like a Milner-Skudder, someone who comes out of the blue and gives you something so different in a World Cup year,” Jones said. “I reckon now we have 80% of the squad about right but we’re looking for the X-factor rookie to come out. There’s a place for that sort of player and it could be someone like Marcus Smith. Who knows? “If you look at the squad, then he’s fifth choice stand-off so he’s going to be shining boots and holding bags and that’s a great education for him. He’s got a lot to work on in his game and what we want to do is educate him so that in whatever period of time, two weeks, five months or two years, he’s ready to play Test rugby for England.” Jones has history of blooding young fly-halves, having given Matt Giteau, who went on to win 103 Australia caps, his Test debut against England aged 20, before he had even played professionally. Smith starts on Saturday for Harlequins against Leicester and will be in direct competition with George Ford – and Jones will be in the crowd to witness. “It’s clear that Marcus has got talent,” Jones said. “What we don’t know is if he’s got the desire, work ethic, application and the ability to keep his feet grounded. Because you read the newspapers now and he’s the next Jonny Wilkinson. But he hasn’t done anything.” He then referenced a blunt soundbite to make his point, cleaning it up along the way, as he added: “As the [former] Chelsea coach Ray Wilkins once said: ‘He’s hardly kicked a ball.’ That’s true for Marcus but he’s definitely worth looking at and definitely worth bringing forward and seeing how far we can take him. “I’m sure he’s going to be good at shining George Ford’s boots. He’s an apprentice and he’s come to learn about the game, so don’t get too excited. You’re going to get some fantastic shots of him polishing boots.” Smith should know what is in store. The teenager joined up with England for last month’s pre-season training squad in Teddington as he awaited his A-level results from Brighton College, where he was on a sports scholarship – he played cricket for the first XI and had a trial with Tottenham Hotspur – after his family relocated to the UK from Asia. If Smith is fifth in line for England, Ford is first choice with Owen Farrell, Alex Lozowski and Piers Francis also ahead of the teenager. Francis’s selection is a surprise considering he is yet to make his Northampton debut since his summer switch from the Blues in New Zealand, because of a jaw injury. “I was impressed with him in Argentina, with his work ethic, his desire to get better,” said Jones of the 27-year-old, who won his first two caps against the Pumas. “And he’s a handy player because he plays 10 and 12. That versatility really helps him. He kicks goals too.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/22/tyrone-mings-accident-stamp-zlatan-ibrahimovic-head-bournemouth","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T17:41:52Z","webTitle":"Tyrone Mings: ‘It was an accident – there’s no way I meant to stamp on Zlatan’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/22/tyrone-mings-accident-stamp-zlatan-ibrahimovic-head-bournemouth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/22/tyrone-mings-accident-stamp-zlatan-ibrahimovic-head-bournemouth","fields":{"headline":"Tyrone Mings: ‘It was an accident – there’s no way I meant to stamp on Zlatan’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Tyrone Mings is casting his mind back to that notorious flashpoint with Zlatan Ibrahimovic last season and considering whether he thinks the public perception of him has changed. “Probably, because I’d always been seen as sort of the Mother Teresa of football,” Mings says, breaking into laughter. “Everybody had such a charitable perception of me through things that I’d done to not really aim to give myself that tag. So as soon as that happened, I was given so many other labels, mainly from Man United fans via social media, but also via the pundits who were on Sky Sports at the time. I don’t think their comments helped.” Mings, to be clear, is not moaning or seeking sympathy – that is not his style. An affable and gregarious character, the Bournemouth defender is full of positive energy and walks into the home dressing room for this interview in a way that betrays no sign of the news he is about to share concerning an injury blow. A meeting with a back specialist the day before saw him diagnosed with a potentially serious problem, ruling him out for a couple of months, just when he had hoped to kick on after signing a new four-year contract. “What can you do?” Mings says, shrugging his shoulders. He is frustrated and bitterly disappointed, and conveyed that to Eddie Howe, Bournemouth’s manager, as he travelled back from London on Wednesday evening, yet Mings has also learned to keep this sort of setback in perspective. One of the subjects he talks about at length is the importance of “not pinning all my happiness on football” – a shift in mindset that is framed around the bitter experience of fighting his way back from the horrendous knee injury he suffered in August 2015, when he snapped the cruciate and medial ligaments in his left knee only six minutes into his first appearance for Bournemouth. Mings was still at the stadium, fearing the worst and waiting for a knee brace to be fitted, when he posted on Twitter: ‘If Carlsberg did debuts, it definitely wouldn’t go like this.’ Self-deprecation comes easily to Mings, who played non-league football and worked as a barman and a mortgage adviser before joining Bournemouth via Ipswich Town. A smile is never far from his face, even when reflecting on the backlash he received on social media in the wake of the Ibrahimovic incident. It turns out that KTM Design, the interior architecture practice he set up in Bournemouth with an old school friend from Chippenham, picked up a whole new client base that day. “Our social media page got inundated,” says Mings, shaking his head with a wry grin. “Hate-mail, not business inquiries.” For anyone who has not seen what happened at Old Trafford on that March afternoon, Mings was accused of stamping on Ibrahimovic’s head – “a cowardly act,” said Gary Neville on Sky – while the United striker was prone. Ibrahimovic responded by elbowing Mings in the side of the face moments later. Both were retrospectively banned: five matches for Mings and three for Ibrahimovic. “I didn’t recognise up until half-time that it was even a big deal,” Mings says. “Because I hadn’t meant to do it, I didn’t feel like it would be a talking point. But I realised when [José] Mourinho came over when we were coming out for the start of the second half and started giving me some abuse, saying: ‘You think you’re clever. You’re going to get an eight-match ban.’ “I just brushed it off, but then the referee said something to me as the second half started, saying: ‘It will probably get reviewed.’ I said: ‘What will get reviewed?’ He said: ‘The stamp on his head.’ I was thinking: ‘I don’t need you to tell me that just as we’re about to start the second half.’ And then when I got into the dressing room after the game, someone checked their phone and told me just how big the coverage of the incident was.” Up until that trip to United, Mings was seen as football’s good Samaritan. He became national news a few months after joining Ipswich, when he offered his complimentary tickets to a fan who had said on social media he could not afford to go to a game. Then a story emerged that Mings had spent Christmas Day feeding the homeless in Suffolk. Next was the tale about buying replacement Ipswich shirts for the supporters who were left frustrated when Mings changed his squad number. New to the world of professional football, Mings wondered what all the fuss was about when the media focused on his acts of kindness. At Old Trafford the spotlight shone on him for other reasons. Mings became public enemy No1 in the eyes of United supporters and he did not need to read the chief executive Ed Woodward’s quotes this week to discover that #mufc was the most used hashtag in global sport. “If ever there is going to be an event like that [with Ibrahimovic], you probably don’t want it at the team with the biggest fanbase in the Premier League,” Mings says, chuckling. “My recent picture on Instagram before that game was a photo of an office design that we’d done at KTM. I think before the game it had about 13 comments on it. By the time I’d checked it again, at 7pm on that Saturday, it had about 2,500. Every inbox was full. I had people from China with Man United badges as their Facebook picture trying to call me on Facebook. I still get it to this day. My Facebook inbox of message requests is full, the same on Instagram. Pretty much every time I tweet something football-related, something to do with a stamp is said.” The abuse and constant stream of opinions on social media did not bother Mings in the slightest but other things did. It was important to him, for example, that Howe believed there was no intent on his part, and he will always be grateful to the manager and the club for their “unwavering support” while he protested his innocence. He nods when it is put to him that Danny Murphy, speaking on Match of the Day, said the only person who truly knows whether he intended to hurt Ibrahimovic is Mings himself. “It was an accident,” he says. “The fact that I jumped, slightly colliding with Rooney in the air and I was looking at the ball at the time, there’s no way I could have meant to stand on his head. And I would hate for anyone to think otherwise, that I would intentionally try to stamp on someone’s head when they’re lying on the floor. So the ban was really disappointing because of why it came about and the fact I’d just had a run in the team. I was finding my feet and I think I played well in that game at United but that was my last match of the season.” Restless at the end of that campaign, Mings returned to action 48 hours after the final game and in the most unlikely of surroundings. Sat at home on a Tuesday night with Omar Sowunmi, his friend who plays for Yeovil, Mings posted on Twitter: ‘I wanna go kick some ball tonight.’ A Bournemouth supporter responded: ‘Littledown, 8.30.’ To the amazement of those taking part, Mings turned up with Sowunmi and played seven-a-side for an hour. “I didn’t know that when I got there 10 out of 12 people would have Bournemouth shirts on,” Mings says, laughing. “It was a little bit naive probably but there was no harm done.” With Mings, who has been restricted to only 14 appearances for Bournemouth, it is easy to understand his desperation to play. He came into the professional game late and then lost 12 months with that awful knee injury. The 24-year-old still remembers waking up from the first of his three operations, looking down at the staples that had to be used to hold the skin together because his knee was so inflamed and feeling devastated. “My dad was with me when they did the grand unveiling,” Mings says, smiling at his choice of words. “The surgeon explained what had happened, they cut the bandage off to change the dressing and it was one hell of a state. How it was feeling and how it looked – I couldn’t fathom in my head the process that you go through to get that back to a normal knee and for me to be playing again.” That journey was exhausting, especially mentally. Mings admits he “fell into such a bad place in the first six months” as he mulled everything over. He thought about all the focus that had been on him as the club-record signing, worried about Bournemouth being relegated and his Premier League dream disappearing, and even started to work out how many years he had left to play the game. Lonely and low, he sought help from a psychologist. “It was only really when I started working with him so intensely that, mentally, I changed my attitude towards football, my injury and my whole outlook on life.” One of their key breakthroughs was redefining happiness. Mings came to realise how dangerous it was to hang everything on his football career and instead saw a need to “find some relevance in another way”. He started to spend more time with his family, in particular his three sisters, of whom he had seen little since moving to Ipswich in 2012, and also threw himself into his interior design business, which is two years old next month and going along nicely. Even now Mings continues to find ways to stimulate his mind. He is developing an app that will allow people to create, organise and play football tournaments in their local area – “I can’t say too much about that because I don’t want people to nick my idea!” he says, laughing – and he plans to open his own football academy in his native south-west soon. The end result is that life feels much more balanced. “If you make one thing your life and soul – as much as football is my career and main focus – then it turns into a very mentally unstable place to be,” Mings says. “Now, if anything goes wrong in football, whether it be injuries or team selection, I’ve got four or five other things that I can lean on. And as much as I’m disappointed with a football setback, and very competitive and I show that to the manager at times when I probably shouldn’t, and I always want to play, when I look at the bigger picture, I realise that these feelings are – it’s not the end of the world. And if everything was taken away from me, I feel I could still find happiness in other areas of my life, which is the point I’ve always wanted to get to.” Mings knows there are always areas where he can improve. Without any prompting, he brings up the fact that he made an error of judgment towards the end of last season, when he filmed himself on a night out in Dublin, wearing a Gary Barlow mask and generally looking like he was enjoying himself a bit too much. “Clearly it wasn’t the right thing to do and I won’t be doing it again any time soon,” he says. At the other end of the spectrum, the sort of good deeds that prompted him to mention that Mother Teresa moniker at the start still go on, although Mings has no desire to shout about them and, because of his heightened profile these days, believes “it’s definitely harder to prove the sincerity of doing any of those things now”. For the moment he is more interested in winning his latest fitness battle. “I’ve got two discs at the bottom of the back that are quite badly damaged, that obviously happened over a period of time, and there’s inflammation on one of the vertebrae as well, which has come from the angle of my pelvis and spine,” Mings says. “It’s disappointing and not what I was expecting because I felt like everything was going in the right direction. But it’s also nothing more than I’ve dealt with before.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/23/uber-london-ban-austin","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T16:01:12Z","webTitle":"'There is life after Uber': what happens when cities ban the service?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/23/uber-london-ban-austin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/sep/23/uber-london-ban-austin","fields":{"headline":"'There is life after Uber': what happens when cities ban the service?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When Uber and Lyft abruptly ended services in Austin last year, 10,000 ride-share drivers lost their jobs overnight and riders across the Texas city were stranded. “It left us all in a lurch,” said Frances DeLaune, who was working as a driver when the taxi apps shut down service there in May 2016 after refusing to comply with local regulations. She recalled how some turned to crowd-sourcing on Facebook where passengers posted ride requests and drivers showed up to help strangers: “People were panicking.” With the surprise news on Friday that Uber had been stripped of its license in London – paving the way for the Silicon Valley company to wage a major court battle – some are looking to the cities and countries that have pushed out the hailing app to see what could lie ahead if Uber loses its fight with Transport for London (TfL). But, as thousands of London drivers brace themselves, Uber’s critics argue that it’s possible to have successful ride-share systems that also adhere to local laws. “There is life after Uber,” said Kirill Evdakov, co-founder and CEO of Fasten, a ride-share company that moved into Austin weeks after Uber and Lyft left. “Competition and choice is an improvement for everyone. A company’s profits can suffer, but for consumers, it’s just positive news.” A not-for-profit organization called RideAustin also quickly helped to fill the void after Uber and Lyft departed in protest over a requirement that they conduct fingerprint-based background checks for drivers. “It was not difficult to create and set up a ride-share and still follow the rules,” said Bobbi Kommineni, vice-president of strategic programs at RideAustin, which immediately worked with city officials on fingerprinting. “It was a lot of sleepless nights and all-nighters getting it working. We built it from scratch.” When Uber left Austin, Jacob Trevino said, he and some drivers temporarily relocated to San Antonio, a city 100 miles south that still allowed Uber, sharing hotel rooms while struggling to make ends meet. “Being my full-time job, I was extremely stressed out about it,” he said. “It was kind of a nightmare. But at least I was able to make money.” Charlotte, an Austin driver who requested her full name not be used, said she tried to give rides through Facebook when Uber shut down, but was worried about safety risks and the lack of insurance: “Those of us who still wanted to help get people around assumed a ridiculous and inordinate amount of personal risk just trying to help the community. It was scary.” Trevino said he was initially skeptical that small local operations could replace the giant corporations, but said he now appreciated that there were different options in Austin – where Uber and Lyft were allowed to return in May. “We’re very lucky. We have one of the most diverse ride-sharing markets in the entire country,” said Trevino, who drives for both RideAustin and Uber. “As long as there is somebody there to treat the drivers fairly … any company willing to fill in that gap can succeed.” Austin, the liberal Texas capital with a growing tech industry, is not the only government to stand up to Uber’s tactic of rapidly expanding by openly defying existing laws. After Uber launched in Alaska in 2014, the company fought with the state’s labor department and ultimately paid a fine and left the market. The taxicab industry celebrated, but state legislators eventually paved the way for Uber’s return. The Uber app was also shut down in Vancouver, where cab drivers took out an injunction against the company. Some alternatives, including a carpooling app, have since formed, but Uber is now on track to return by the end of the year. Earlier this year, Uber announced it would shut down its operations in Denmark after prosecutors accused the company of operating an illegal taxi business. Four drivers subsequently received fines of 696,600 kroner ($111,700) for more than 7,000 trips. Soon after, a similar company launched in Denmark, called Ubr City, which claimed it was a “freight and courier service” transporting goods, but functioned like Uber. Within hours of its launch, Ubr City was reported to police. Uber has also battled bans and suspensions in Taiwan, Hungary, Bulgaria, Italy and parts of Australia. Uber’s new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, tweeted Friday that the company was “far from perfect” but had 40,000 drivers and 3.5 million Londoners “depending on us”, asking officials to “work [with] us to make things right”. In an internal email obtained by the New York Times, he added: “There is a high cost to a bad reputation.” If Uber won’t reform its ways in London, other competitors will step up, said Carys Afoko, communications director of SumOfUs, a consumer group that has criticized Uber: “The alternative for them is to behave like responsible companies and not ignore laws and put customers’ and drivers’ safety at risk.” While Uber at times has taken as much as a 30% commission from drivers’ pay, RideAustin drivers keep their full wages, and Fasten charges drivers a flat fee of 99¢ per ride. “It’s really been fun watching these companies grow organically within the community,” said DeLaune, who drives for RideAustin. “I’m a lot happier than I was before.” When Uber no longer has a monopoly, drivers are better equipped to fight for their rights, said Evdakov. “They have more power. If you don’t listen to us, we’re going to turn you off.” The return of Uber and Lyft to Austin, however, has been challenging for the smaller competitors, said Kommineni, noting that RideAustin has lost 50% of its market share as a result. Some of her drivers now work for both companies, she said, though others hope to never return to Uber and are loyal to the local organization. “They hate what Uber did to them,” she said. “We came in and provided a service when they were abandoned.” Contact the author: sam.levin@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/22/leicester-city-liverpool-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T17:09:09Z","webTitle":"Leicester City v Liverpool: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/22/leicester-city-liverpool-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/22/leicester-city-liverpool-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Leicester City v Liverpool: match preview","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Liverpool visit Leicester City for the second time this week, after losing 2-0 in the Carabao Cup, and Jürgen Klopp has the task of arresting a poor run of two draws and two defeats with 10 goals conceded in all competitions.

Four months later the iPhone launched. The following month the first episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians aired on US TV. There is no doubt it was a Damascene year for celebrities and social media, and while these three events might seem unrelated, they mark the starting point for an exhibition at the Saatchi gallery in London over the past two days to mark 10 years of the Kardashians’ reality TV show. “If Britney can get through 2007, you can get through anything!” read the opening text of the exhibition in neon, as if to acknowledge the baton. Like everything else about the Kardashians, E! Entertainment Television’s Keeping Up with the Kardashians: 10th Anniversary exhibition was anything but modest. Occupying two rooms at London’s Saatchi’s gallery it was an immersive experience rather than artistic celebration and gave a clear narrative of how the family have played the media. In the last decade, KUWTK (an acronym coined by fans on social media) has evolved into a compelling, high-profile, high-concept document of what makes someone famous. It is aired in 160 countries, is the longest running docusoap in the history of television and has become a blueprint for reality TV. E4’s Made in Chelsea and ITV’s The Only Way is Essex were born in its wake. Like its most famous byproduct, Kim Kardashian, the show has become masterful in its reinvention. For every resolved drama – the family always hug at the end of an episode – a new one is teased out of the mundane reality of ordinary life. Celebrity reporter Olivia Foster cites the Kim Kardashian rule – that if you compare pictures of Kim taken two weeks apart, there would always be something different. “There is always Kim Kardashian ‘news’,” she says. “Even if it’s just about different coloured hair.” The Saatchi gallery might have seemed an unusual place to chronicle this anniversary – on Wednesday it hosts a retrospective of the American sculptor Alexander Calder – but the two are behemoths within their respective industries. And in recent years the art world has found commercial success celebrating the careers of cultural figureheads. In 2013 the V&amp;A’s David Bowie Is became its fastest selling exhibition, and the museum is currently near the end of a similar homage to Pink Floyd. Which suggests that the world is keen to explore what – or rather who – constitutes art? At the Kardashian exhibition the answer was “contouring booths”, a white rose backdrop for re-enacting Kim and Kanye’s wedding photo, and a wall of Kardashian selfies. Most curious was a neon timeline of the show’s ascent, modestly contextualised within major world events, pasted across one wall. Regardless of where you stand on the Kardashian phenomenon it is simply that, and the exhibition was testament to it – tickets sold out almost as soon as they went on sale. To understand the success of the show is to understand the Kardashian-Jenner family. KUWTK follows the lives of the Kardashian-Jenner family – Kim, Kourtney, Kylie, Kendall, Khloe, Rob, their mother Kris and a rotation of partners and parents – news of Kylie’s pregnancy has just broken on TMZ – as they buy, shop, overdose, divorce and, most compellingly in the case of one family member, transition. It has been met with a wall of criticism. Derided for monetising their babies – and promoting conspicuous consumption, the series has arguably shifted the concept of what reality TV can do within the confines of its genre. “The Hills and The Osbournes always seemed stilted and set up,” says Issy Sampson, the former news editor of Heat magazine. KUWTK, by comparison, is hyper-reality television. There is nothing you don’t see. The family first entered the cultural psyche after Robert Kardashian, the former husband of matriarch Kris, gained notoriety for defending OJ Simpson in his murder trial, turning his family into “Calabasas celebrities”, named after the suburb of Los Angeles they called home. But it wasn’t until Kim Kardashian, then a 26-year-old stylist, found herself embroiled in a sex tape scandal that conversations about the TV series started. Psychologist Susie Orbach is among those wary of this culture. “[The Kardashians] seem to be an example of the dangers of the self-representing the body,” she says. “Observing oneself being observed – that is a tragic diminishment. But it also the commentary of our society right now and she [Kim], and they, are perpetuating that.” But all this isn’t new. Historian Stephen Greenblatt describes this as “self-fashioning”, a way of composing one’s public persona according to a set of socially acceptable standards. At Grazia magazine, about five years ago, there was an initial reluctance to put Kim Kardashian on the cover. But the magazine took a risk and found her image sold issues. “We were surprised because she seemed a bit low-rent at the time,” says one former employee. “But back then people seemed to care about Kim’s life, her marriage, her babies, and obviously her bum, and regardless of what we thought, she was like media glue. Once she was in, it was impossible to look beyond her.” Kim Kardashian’s success came from her selfies. “She was putting out the image she wanted to put out. Everything else just followed,” says the employee. Sampson agrees: “Magazines are still obsessed. [The Kardashians] still shift copies in a rapidly declining market. I don’t think there was one day in my entire Heat career I didn’t talk about Kim or her family – and I can only remember one issue that she didn’t appear in.” But the sticking point with the exhibition was that it was about television, a medium that could be considered outdated in our social media world. KUWTK TV viewing figures have been largely in decline since 2014, including a controversial episode that followed a “badly shaken” Kim after thieves had tied her up and held her at gunpoint in her Paris apartment before making off with her jewellery. The issue is, one TV editor said, “that the media had been so oversaturated with the minutiae of this event that by the time we watched Kim on screen, we felt like we had already gone through it all already”. Britney Spears is currently on a multimillion dollar residency in Las Vegas so it seems reinvention truly is the answer to longevity. In that spirit, it is unlikely the Kardashians will be going anywhere soon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/23/skilful-marcus-smith-eddie-jones-england-vision","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T21:00:26Z","webTitle":"Marcus Smith the flower in Eddie Jones’ blossoming England vision","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/23/skilful-marcus-smith-eddie-jones-england-vision","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/23/skilful-marcus-smith-eddie-jones-england-vision","fields":{"headline":"Marcus Smith the flower in Eddie Jones’ blossoming England vision","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Eddie Jones has given himself a licence to skill. The coach who plucked Matt Giteau from the obscurity of club rugby in Canberra at the start of the decade to make him a Wallaby sees the same potential in the Harlequins fly-half Marcus Smith, who this week links up with the England squad for the training camp in Oxford. As the fifth outside-half in the squad Smith’s chances of appearing in one of England’s three autumn internationals at Twickenham are remote. The 18-year-old has not been picked for the present but the future with Jones wanting a close look at a player who in his few appearances for Quins has shown an old-fashioned, natural instinct to run a game. Jones has used his two years in England to visit Premier League football clubs, impressed at the high skill levels of players in attack. Defence has dominated for most of the 22 years rugby union has been professional, with many countries and clubs getting players to bulk up before they focus on their skills, something Jones is anxious to change. “I have always said that there are talented rugby players in England, although sometimes it is hard to find them because they are not given an opportunity at the early age they are in other countries and so you have to dig deeper, but football impresses me because players’ individual skill levels are incredible,” says Jones. “In 20 years of professionalism in rugby, defensive skills have improved enormously but there is a question mark over whether attacking skills have and I do not think we pay enough attention to a really important area. “Individual skills have to be more consciously developed at an earlier age. It has not happened, except in New Zealand where they focus on individual skills early, because junior development became specialised. People are coaching for a living at that level and how do you get a side to win? By making them organised. You can organise defence and you can organise attack and it takes away from individual skill development because you don’t have time to do both. “It is something that needs to be addressed. What I like about Marcus Smith is that he has a feel for the game: he understands it and what he is going to do. He does things no one tells him to and, while there are areas he needs to work on, when you have a feel for the game you have a chance of making it as a 10. “We have to manage him because young players are like flowers, delicate. It is about how much water and sunshine they receive. Too much too early they grow up too quickly and their base foundations aren’t strong enough. You have to quietly build them up over a period of time until they are ready. I am not sure yet if he is good enough; we have the opportunity to find out.” Jones’s squad is a mixture of his Six Nations winners and those who impressed in Argentina in the summer, such as the flankers Tom Curry and Sam Underhill, the lock Nick Isiekwe, the prop Harry Williams and the fly-half Piers Francis. He omitted four of this summer’s Lions in New Zealand: George Kruis and James Haskell have had injuries but Kyle Sinckler, the Harlequins prop who was involved in an incident in an Auckland nightclub after the final Test, and Jonathan Joseph have been left out and are unlikely to face Argentina in the first November Test, with the coach saying that those in the squad he named on Friday have a head start in selection over those who were omitted. “Some players are off the pace and that is reflected in selection,” Jones says. “Why they are off the pace? Because of the Lions, because of their own attitude, because their girlfriend has left them, because their boyfriend has left them? We don’t know but these are things we need to find out.” The World Cup starts in Japan in two years this weekend. Jones is halfway through his stint as England head coach, adamant he will take his leave of the game at the end of the tournament. When asked which of the three bids he backed for the hosting rights to the 2023 event, he says he does not care because he will be somewhere else. But his passion for the sport and coaching still burns so fiercely it remains hard to see him walking away. “At the moment we’re only worried about Argentina,” he says when asked how he viewed the state of the leading nations at the midway point between two World Cups. The southern hemisphere supplied the four semi-finalists in 2015 but Argentina have won three and lost 15 of their Tests against tier one nations since then, South Africa’s recovery from the worst year in their history in 2016 was burst by New Zealand last weekend and Australia always seem to be one defeat away from a crisis. “Argentina are trying to work out their identity and it’s difficult,” says Jones. “You’ve seen Australia up and down, South Africa up and down, New Zealand remain strong and France can be anything. The great thing is we are developing competition: on Thursday I had to ring 50 players to tell them they were not in the squad. That’s how much it has improved. But you never get ahead of the game. Life is full of contradictions: what you have in mind now might not be the case tomorrow.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/live/2017/sep/22/john-mccain-no-republicans-healthcare","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T21:23:56Z","webTitle":"McCain says no on healthcare | The minute","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2017/sep/22/john-mccain-no-republicans-healthcare","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2017/sep/22/john-mccain-no-republicans-healthcare","fields":{"headline":"McCain says no on healthcare","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Senator John McCain said the latest Republican plan to dismantle Barack Obama’s healthcare law did not pass his test for “regular order” and he would be voting no, likely ruining the bill’s chances for passing.

He is perhaps best known for his influential textbook McQuail’s Mass Communication Theory (1994), a comprehensive survey of how the media works. Denis was born in Wallington, Surrey, to Irish immigrant parents, Annie (nee Mullan) and Christopher McQuail. After schooling at St Anselm’s college in Birkenhead, where he showed an aptitude for languages, he spent his national service in the Intelligence Corps learning Russian and studied history at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He then took up a research position in the television research unit at Leeds University. His first book (together with Joseph Trenaman), Television and the Political Image – a groundbreaking study of the influence of television on the 1959 general election – was published in 1961. In Leeds Denis met and married Rosemary Beveridge. He moved to Southampton University in 1965 and in 1975 became a professor, following an analysis of newspaper content for the third royal commission on the press (1974-77), which proposed a written code of practice for newspapers. In 1977 he became professor of mass communication at the University of Amsterdam, a move that opened up international networks that he would support for the rest of his life. A firm believer in collaboration, he co-founded both the European Journal of Communication and the Euromedia Research Group. Through his career Denis accepted various short attachments to other organisations, including the Universities of Harvard, Columbia, Pennsylvania, Rome and Moscow – where he was made honorary professor in 2010. His later books included Media Performance: Mass Communication and the Public Interest (1992) and Journalism and Society (2013). After retirement he took great pleasure in travelling with Rosemary to various conferences and engagements, where his thoughtfulness, kindness, intelligence and wit meant he was always in demand. He continued to write, and to the last was scribbling new thoughts on backs of envelopes. A lover of good food and wine, Denis was also a devourer of thrillers, a painter, an admirer of churches, a gentle cyclist, an amateur card player, a gardener and an occasional supporter of Tranmere Rovers. Rosemary died in 2014. Denis is survived by their children, Rachel, Thomas and Matthew, and nine grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/23/parsons-green-attack-foster-charities-fear-child-refugee-crackdown","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T19:30:24Z","webTitle":"Foster charities fear child refugee crackdown after Parsons Green attack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/23/parsons-green-attack-foster-charities-fear-child-refugee-crackdown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/23/parsons-green-attack-foster-charities-fear-child-refugee-crackdown","fields":{"headline":"Foster charities fear child refugee crackdown after Parsons Green attack","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Britain’s largest fostering charity has made an impassioned plea that the Parsons Green terror attack should not lead to a new crackdown on child refugees coming to Britain. Eighteen-year-old Ahmed Hassan, who is believed to have arrived illegally in the UK two years ago as an orphan from Iraq, was charged with the terror attack that injured 30 people nine days ago on a rush-hour District line train. Fostering and adoption agencies are worried that the government will use the bombing in west London as a pretext to stop child refugees being settled in the UK. In a letter to the children’s minister, Robert Goodwill, Tact Care’s chief executive, Andy Elvin, states: “Any attempted crackdown on child refugees would be wholly disproportionate to the evidence of potential risk.” The letter also claims that “by not accepting asylum seeking and refugee children in a planned way the Home Office are, inadvertently, increasing risks”. Elvin said that security arrangements put in place in countries such as Greece were designed to ensure that potential terrorists were identified long before they could enter western Europe. “If children and young people can be assessed in the camps and reception centres in southern Europe, then this information can be used by local authorities to match them with available foster and other placements in the UK,” he wrote. “If they have a family option here, the information can be used for local authorities to check that the relatives are suitable and able to offer care. He also raises concerns that the government has made no attempt to “strongly refute” negative press coverage of foster parents and child refugees in the wake of the Parsons Green attack. “It should be noted that the overwhelming majority of recent terror attacks have been carried out by men born in the UK who grew up in their birth families,” said Elvin. Hassan, who was stopped by Kent police near Dover a day after the attack, allegedly bought online the parts to make the improvised explosive device that was fillled with shrapnel. Following the attack, police searched a home in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, owned by foster parents Penelope and Ronald Jones, who are believed to have been looking after Hassan. Another refugee who had been looked after by the foster couple, a 21-year-old Syrian, Yahyah Farroukh, was released without charge last Thursday. Two other people, aged 25 and 30 respectively, remain in police custody in connection to the UK’s fifth terrorist attack of the year. The debate on child refugees and terrorism has drawn fresh attention to the plight of unaccompanied minors in Europe at a time when dozens of young people in Greece have been left in limbo for more than a year after expecting to be admitted to the UK as part of the government’s commitment to helping Europe’s most vulnerable young refugees. Up to 60 children were expected to come to the UK under a scheme created by the Labour peer Alf Dubs, originally intended to resettle around 3,000 child refugees into the country. No unaccompanied minor has been transferred to the UK this year through the scheme, despite commitments by the government to house another 280 children. On Friday, charities said they had identified 300 children in Greece who were eligible to be settled in Britain, but the vast majority had disappeared due to the UK government’s failure to act on the information. Lord Dubs visited Athens on Thursday to assess the situation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/22/theresa-may-speech-brexit-prime-minister-florence","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T16:53:01Z","webTitle":"May’s breakup speech made Brexit sound magical … if you’re drinking Bacardi | Marina Hyde","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/22/theresa-may-speech-brexit-prime-minister-florence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/22/theresa-may-speech-brexit-prime-minister-florence","fields":{"headline":"May’s breakup speech made Brexit sound magical … if you’re drinking Bacardi","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I increasingly picture Brexit as one of those criminally underwhelming Christmas theme parks in which the UK specialises. You know the ones: visitors are sold expensive tickets to a magical wonderland, and turn up expectantly to find a muddy car park with brawling elves, a grotto that turns out to be two strings of fairy lights inside a Portaloo, and a chained, motionless husky you tell your kids is “probably just sleeping”. There are at least a couple of these festive horror shows annually. As one of the elves at the infamous Lapland New Forest informed customers a few years back: “Santa’s gone home. Santa’s fucking dead.” The two men who sold tickets to that one on a false prospectus ended up being sentenced to 13 months each. I see Boris Johnson is still redrafting his Brexit prospectus, most recently in a Daily Telegraph article that spent much of the week threatening to derail Theresa May’s major speech, if not to presage his own resignation. Why? Because that’s just the shit the Tories pull these days. There is nothing so perilously unstable they couldn’t somehow contrive to destabilise it further. Nothing gets them hotter than the clock ticking or the possibility of running each other out. Instead of taking back control they find new ways to be incontinent. You can tell the people who got us into this mess were former journalists, because despite having just the 50 years to work out what type of deal they wanted, the cabinet is doing it right on deadline. And so to May’s speech, heralded by some as a big reset that would clarify a UK approach that might hitherto have been euphemised as cryptic. It took place in front of a backdrop reading: “Shared history. Shared challenges. Shared future”, which is Italian for “Is it too late if we stop being delusional? It is, isn’t it?” The Florentine location suggested that the government has now spent easily as much time laying the ground for multi-layered Renaissance metaphors as they have wondering vaguely what’s going to happen to the automotive industry in 18 months’ time. That said, the odd thing does seem to have become clearer. May has now asked for a two-year transition deal, which would give the UK unfettered access to the single market in return for us accepting both free movement and the fact that Nigel Farage is going to completely wet his pants. The optics in Florence were slightly better for May than they were at her speech at the UN earlier this week, which pictures showed was as sparsely attended as a one-woman Edinburgh fringe show about self-harm. Delivery-wise, though, there were no surprises. The prime minister came across as the most humourless and uptight Brit in Florence since Maggie Smith threw open her casement at the start of A Room With a View and discovered the prospect of a brick wall. “I thought we were going to see the Arno,” says Helena Bonham-Carter, in the tone of voice one might otherwise reserve for the observation: “I thought there was going to be a grotto”, or “I thought we were going to have an extra £350m a week for the NHS.” For the past few months, May’s messaging strategy has been predicated on the fact that the EU doesn’t have the internet. Thus you can spend a year being as rude and dismissive about them as you like for the benefit of the media back home, then fly to Europe and smilingly urge them to “be creative”, and everyone will take kindly to it. To call the speech optimistic didn’t really cover it. Many of the lines had the flavour of something you’d say if you were leaving your wife of 40 years for a Babestation presenter who’d once read out one of your texts. This period could be remembered “not for a relationship that ended, but a new partnership that began”. Well, I mean … it COULD be. If you’re drinking Bacardi. (Incidentally, my favourite story of the week suggested that civil servants in David Davis’s department are so concerned about the lack of preparation for a no-deal scenario that they have begun writing emails stating the perils, to cover their backs in preparation for the inevitable Chilcot-style inquiry when it all goes tits up.) This was a breakup speech that again reminded Europe it was not us; it was them. But the fact remains that if you had killer information that you had to protect at all costs, the text of a Theresa May speech would be the place to conceal it. So instantly forgettable is anything she says that it is highly possible she has been fitted with a perception filter. Thanks to advance briefings, we already knew that Britain would fork out at least £20bn by way of an exit bill, which Boris Johnson has repeatedly suggested we shouldn’t pay. At least when the Bullingdon Club smashed things up they left a cheque at the end. Then again, in later life Boris has been – how to put this delicately because of the others involved? – less present to deal with the consequences of his actions. I suppose on the scale of things one can just walk away from in life, the EU isn’t the most unforgivable. As for Boris’s own manoeuvres, his allies seem to think he has done enough this week to be able to resign later and say he told them so. What a man of principle he remains. I am reminded of a passage I shrieked with laughter at in his book about Churchill (a work that obviously turned out to be a thinly veiled fantasy portrait of himself). “To some extent all politicians are gamblers with events,” this ran. “They try to anticipate what will happen, to put themselves on the right side of history.” Remarkably, Boris characterised Churchill’s 1930s opposition to Hitler as just this type of self-motivated punt. Churchill “put his shirt on a horse called anti-Nazism … and his bet came off in spectacular fashion”. Dear, dear. If only we had Churchill’s other column – the one where he argued the case for a fascist dictatorship, Lebensraum and the elimination of Jews from Germany. Still, as Johnson went on to note, these kind of reputation-stakings “gave him the chance to test his egocentric thesis that he was special”. At least the focus returning to May on Friday afternoon offered a brief opportunity to forget Brexit’s Special One. But, for the prime minister’s part, her speech showed her to have once again identified the wrong sort of deficit in her Brexit approach. The problem is not that she hasn’t been positively, repetitively platitudinous enough – it is that she has never begun to outline the specific negatives to those expecting a cakewalk. She may never acquire the courage to admit it – and her less washed-up colleagues are still too treacherously ambitious to do so – but Santa’s gone home. • Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/22/ding-liren-candidates-place-beat-wesley-so","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T19:11:20Z","webTitle":"Leonard Barden on Chess","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/22/ding-liren-candidates-place-beat-wesley-so","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/22/ding-liren-candidates-place-beat-wesley-so","fields":{"headline":"Ding Liren secures historic 2018 Candidates place by beating Wesley So","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Levon Aronian and Ding Liren will meet in the four-game final of the $1.6m World Cup in Tbilisi, starting at midday on Saturday with free live coverage of play available online. For both the Armenian and the Chinese grandmaster the final may be an anticlimax after their desperate semi-final battles which ensured that both qualified for the 2018 Candidates in Berlin, the event which decides Magnus Carlsen’s next world title challenger. Ding beat Wesley So of the US 3.5-2.5 while Aronian eliminated France’s Maxime Vachier-Lagrave 5-4 in a match where the loser had several chances and which was the only one in the entire World Cup to go to Armageddon, where White has five minutes on the clock to Black’s four but a draw counts as a win for Black. In a strange coincidence both matches featured the basic endgame of king and queen against king and rook, which is a theoretical win but can prove troublesome in practice. Here, though, both Aronian and Ding showed faultless technique. The overall picture of who plays in the Candidates is now a little clearer. Sergey Karjakin (the defeated 2016 challenger), Aronian and Ding are sure. Two rating spots will be decided among So and Fabiano Caruana of the US and Vlad Kramnik of Russia, and this race is so tight that Caruana’s results at the Isle of Man Open and Kramnik’s at the European Club Cup could settle it. The final leg of the Fide Grand Prix at Palma de Mallorca will provide two more qualifiers, with the Azeri Shak Mamedyarov and Vachier-Lagrave the front runners. And finally there is the organiser’s wild card, which is still anybody’s guess. In terms of historic significance Ding is the standout, the first Chinese player ever to qualify for the Candidates. China has been knocking on this particular door for nearly a decade as its young squad has confidently captured gold at the 150-nation Olympiad and at the world team championship. Some observers downplayed these results on the grounds that China, which dominates women’s chess, had no male GM firmly in the top 10. Ding has changed that, as although So missed a difficult winning chance in their first classical game, Ding was better over the match. The 24-year-old has an individual and pragmatic style, playing for initiative yet a highly professional grinder over long games. For most internet viewers the Tbilisi final will be less interesting than the Chess.com Isle of Man tournament, which also starts on Saturday with Magnus Carlsen as top seed and a host of other elite GMs. Aronian had his back to the wall at the start of the game below as Vachier-Lagrave had won the first of their two 25-minute rapid games. The Armenian had prepared the openings bomb 15 Bc4!+ where the normal,plan is to meet h5-h4 by Nh1 or Nf1. Black was doing quite well after the knight sacrifice, but evidently there was a psychological effect leading to the dubious 21...g5 and the fatal blunder 24...Qd4 after which Black’s defences immediately collapsed.

The US Coast Guard in Miami said a British Royal Navy helicopter hoisted a woman and two children from the overturned vessel on Thursday. A distress call had been sent from the boat on Wednesday, stating it was disabled and adrift in seas and facing six-metre waves (20ft) and 100mph winds. The man has not been named and the coastguard said his body has not been recovered because it “inaccessible to search and rescue crews” under the boat. US Coast Guard Rear Admiral Peter Brown said: “We initially got the call, a vessel in distress, a family of four, north of St Croix, literally in the teeth of a hurricane. We were obviously concerned. We didn’t ask their names and didn’t ask why they were out there.” The crew of Royal Fleet Auxiliary Mounts Bay helped in the rescue of the three people off the island of Vieques. Commanding officer Cpt Steve Norris said: “My ship and crew demonstrated exceptional teamwork today to save these lives, and I am immensely grateful to them all for their efforts in this operation. “It is with regret that we understand that a fourth individual at the scene is missing, presumed dead. Our thoughts go out to their family at this difficult time.” Local media reported earlier on Friday that they believed a British man was trapped inside the boat and died before the others were rescued. US Coast Guard footage shows three people stranded on the capsized vessel and desperately waving for help before being winched to safety. Hurricane Maria has moved across the Caribbean over the past few days, claiming the lives of at least 19 people so far, with many others missing. It made landfall in Puerto Rico at 11.15am BST in the south-east coastal town of Yabucoa and is the strongest storm in more than 80 years to sweep across the country – flattening homes and plunging the island into darkness after taking down power lines. Gov Ricardo Rossello said: “We have not experienced an event of this magnitude in our modern history.” The governor’s spokesperson added: “This is total devastation.

Hold your horses","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When Paul Manafort, a Ronald Reagan veteran, moved to take charge of the amateur-hour Donald Trump campaign in early April 2016, the press coverage was respectful, even a bit fawning. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani was quoted in the New York Times calling Manafort’s ascension “a step in the right direction” and in the same story Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio hailed the move as welcome evidence that Trump knew that he needs to hire “experienced and seasoned hands.” Since campaign reporters are suckers for sage political hands, Manafort’s career as an international influence peddler only attracted intermittent interest. A May 2016 Wall Street Journal story on lobbyists in presidential politics devoted just one sentence to Manafort “whose firm in the past represented a number of foreign governments”. That bland statement was the equivalent of describing the first world war as a small territorial misunderstanding among European nations. This week we learned, through a series of leaks, that Manafort’s foreign entanglements appear to be a central target of Robert Mueller’s investigation. The New York Times provided fresh details (including a picked lock) about a predawn July FBI raid on Manafort’s apartment searching for foreign bank records and computer files. Manafort’s emails, according to the Washington Post, reveal that the Trump campaign chairman offered a Russian oligarch, close to Vladimir Putin, private briefings on the presidential race. Phrases like “black caviar” in the emails allegedly refer to the kind of payoffs that Manafort had hoped to obtain from Russian interests. In fact, there are now so many documents about Manafort in governmental hands that they may have to name a federal records depository after him. CNN reported that the FBI had been periodically wiretapping Manafort under a secret court order since 2014 flowing from his work for ousted pro-Russian Ukrainian strongman Viktor Yanukovych. Yes, it is dizzying to keep up with. Especially during a week when the Times led the paper with a story that Mueller has requested White House documents relating to the firings of ethically compromised national security adviser Michael Flynn and embattled FBI director James Comey. For those of us who wake up every morning with a sense of dread that Trump has nuked Denmark overnight, it is tempting to take these investigative fragments and imagine Chief Justice John Roberts presiding over an impeachment trial in the Senate. Or to picture a high-profile federal trial in which Manafort details the Trump campaign’s direct coordination with Vladimir Putin. There is only one problem with these liberal fantasies – suggestive incidents do not automatically add up to unequivocal evidence. Maybe grifters and fixers gravitated to the Trump campaign because they saw an opportunity for personal enrichment. A Manafort email from April 2016 asked an associate, “How do we use [the campaign] to get whole?” During the campaign, as Newsweek reported, Flynn, was flogging a business plan to build a series of nuclear reactors in the Middle East with partial Russian backing. Even Jared Kushner had far more on his mind than electing his father-in-law president. The Kushner family real-estate empire has been tottering under the weight of the debt burden from its ill-considered $1.8bn purchase of a Fifth Avenue office building. The Kushner company, according to Bloomberg, “has failed to secure foreign investors, despite an extensive search, and its resources are more limited than generally understood”. It was worth remembering that few in Trump Tower during the campaign had any realistic expectation that a bilious billionaire turned reality-show host could be elected president. As a result, a certain get-it-while-you-can ethos appears to have shaped the behavior of insiders like Manafort, Flynn and Kushner. In legal terms, maybe all that Trump is guilty of is terrible taste in campaign advisers and bad luck with his son-in-law. Even Russia’s use of Facebook and other social media platforms to boost Trump during campaign does not prove collusion. The reported $100,000 in illegal Russia campaign ad purchases on Facebook did not have to depend on the Trump campaign for targeting. Many Republican strategists would have happily advised anyone masquerading as a pro-Trump American-based Super Pac. None of this is meant as a defense brief for Trump. Rather, it is a reminder of the high bar of proof needed to convince Americans who do not avidly watch MSNBC that Trump’s conduct warrants being removed from office. I asked two Republican campaign consultants, both Trump critics, what it would take to convince a significant fraction of the Republican base to support impeachment. The answer: a piece of paper signed by Trump cutting a deal with Russia for financial gain. In short, to use the Watergate phrase, “a smoking gun”. Right now, based on what we know from the Mueller investigation, all we have are some troubling bullet holes.

With 19 wins in his first 20 games in charge, Eddie Jones has made a confident start on the rocky ascent towards 2019, and his 33-man training squad for next week’s camp in Oxford represents the next phase of that climb. Even three players deemed good enough to be 2017 British &amp; Irish Lions – Jonathan Joseph, Kyle Sinckler and James Haskell – find themselves outside a deliberately slimmed-down squad, with the recently sidelined George Kruis also omitted. Admittedly it is “only” a training camp but, injuries permitting, Jones concedes those named will have “a head start” in terms of selection for England’s first Test against Argentina on 11 November. The subliminal message is self-explanatory: there will be no short cuts into the 31-strong squad for Japan in two years’ time. What the approach will be for the subsequent two Tests against Australia and Samoa is less clear, with Jones adamant he has yet to make his mind up on precisely how many of his leading men will feature in all three autumn fixtures. The player-welfare implications for England’s Lions players will need to be factored in and negotiations are continuing with the Premiership clubs over whether those rested may also be excused from club duty. It may also suit all parties if one or two fringe candidates were released to represent the Barbarians against New Zealand on 4 November. Either way, Jones sounds like a man who has already done the bulk of his experimenting and intends to finish dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s between now and Christmas. This also extends to how England intend to play in the future, with tin hats advisable for those suggesting within Jones’s earshot that copying the All Blacks’ attractive style is the way forward. Courting neutral popularity has never been Jones’s priority and he is hardly about to start now. “Spending your whole life on your iPhone is popular but it doesn’t mean it’s right,” he said. “There’s a certain sort of rugby we need to play to win the World Cup and it’s not going to be popular rugby. We’ll play the rugby that suits us. We don’t need to copy New Zealand.” In virtually the same breath, it should be said, he could be heard pining for a game-breaker akin to the All Blacks’ Nehe Milner-Skudder, who could offer him something completely different but, in Jones’s mind, 80% of his 2019 squad already appears pretty much settled. The remaining 20% – in effect only six or seven players – will need to offer something he does not feel he already possesses. Into that category, you might imagine, would come the barrelling Sinckler but Jones clearly does not want the Harlequins man getting ahead of himself and, for the time being, has opted instead for the stronger set-piece presence of Exeter’s Harry Williams. It is a similar story with Joseph, whom Warren Gatland decided he simply had to pick for the Lions tour. Jones favours the opposite approach: anyone perceived not to be busting a gut at club level every week is potentially dispensable. “Some guys need to work on their games,” the Australian added brusquely. “We’ve had those discussions with them.” Haskell might consider himself slightly unfortunate given he has only just returned from finger surgery, but no one will be more keenly aware that the back-row landscape is rapidly shifting. England now have two significantly younger No7s – Bath’s Sam Underhill and Sale’s Tom Curry – whom Jones rightly senses have “something about them”. With another contender, Exeter’s Sam Simmonds, also earning a conspicuous namecheck as a possible Test openside of the future, the 32-year-old Haskell is going to have to dig deep to see off the young pups. “Hask knows what he’s got to do and I know he’s going to attend to that very seriously,” said Jones. “We’ve been quite fortunate with the young guys coming through and they’re challenging the establishment.” Among those also being pushed to up the ante further is Newcastle’s Mark Wilson, an impressive tourist in Argentina during June, while the fit-again Jack Clifford is also nowhere to be seen. Things are hotting up in other forward areas, too, with Bath’s Tom Dunn and Saracens’ Nick Isiekwe being invited to stake a claim in the absence of the injured Luke Cowan-Dickie and Kruis, only just back for Saracens against Sale this weekend following an ankle strain. Behind the scrum there is yet more high-profile recognition for the exciting 18-year-old Quins fly-half Marcus Smith while Northampton’s versatile new signing Piers Francis offers a further midfield option despite having yet to make his Premiership debut. If Manu Tuilagi ever manages to stay fit enough to string together a sequence of games, Joseph starts tearing it up again for Bath or a repentant Denny Solomona gets back into Jones’s good books – “He’s got work to do on his game and maybe on his drinking game as well” – England really will be spoiled for choice. Even a stalwart like Mike Brown is going to have to up his game at full-back to see off the Lions duo of Anthony Watson and Elliot Daly, whom Jones still regards as a potential starting option at 15. “That’s the great thing, if you look across the squad, there’s real competition,” added Jones, employing another of his favoured cricketing metaphors. “No player can feel like he can just turn up, bowl his 10 overs for 30 runs and be happy. You’ve got to compete and be at your best. The only way we’re going to be the best team in the world is if we’ve got that. That’s what we’re moving towards.” Jones’s captain, Dylan Hartley, understands the increasing reality better than anyone else as he prepares to resume his rivalry with Jamie George for the starting No2 jersey. “We’ll see how Dylan is at the camp,” Jones said. “He understands that. Every time he comes in it’s like an audition; if he keeps doing the job well he’s got the job for that period of time but he’s got good hookers underneath him biting at his ankles.” Hartley will be into his 34th year by the time of the next World Cup; neither he, nor his colleagues, will conquer that distant summit without doing some seriously hard yards."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/27/the-knowledge-most-unlikely-gigs-football-stadiums","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T09:55:13Z","webTitle":"What are the most unlikely gigs played at football stadiums? | The Knowledge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/27/the-knowledge-most-unlikely-gigs-football-stadiums","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/27/the-knowledge-most-unlikely-gigs-football-stadiums","fields":{"headline":"What are the most unlikely gigs played at football stadiums?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“While randomly scouring the internet I stumbled across a Wikipedia entry suggesting that scouse Brit-pop four-piece Cast once played a gig at La Bombonera, Boca Juniors’ atmospheric home ground in Buenos Aires,” begins George Jones. “It seems an unlikely happening. Can any readers tell me if this is true? And, if so, which other bands have played unlikely gigs at grounds? I don’t suppose the Bluetones have played the Maracanã. Have they?” Um, no they haven’t George. And the Knowledge did try to contact Cast frontman John Power for confirmation of the Bombonera gig but at the time of publication he’s yet to get back to us. We have been able to dig out some evidence of a band from around that era, Toploader, playing Stoke City’s Britannia Stadium (as it was known in 2000), which seems a pretty big space to fill with one hit song. But staying in the Potteries, Paul Beard points us towards Vale Park, which hosted the Heavy Metal Holocaust on 1 August 1981, where leather and long hair dominated a stage headlined by Motörhead with Ozzy Osbourne and Mahogany Rush among the support acts. What is unlikely about this gig is not that those bands filled out a stadium in the Midlands, an area well-known for once producing headbangers in the way Catalonia would go on to churn out multiple tippy-tappy footballers. It’s unlikely because the festival (supposed to be headlined by Black Sabbath, who pulled out) caused so much dread among local residents – perhaps fearful that Osbourne and Lemmy would eat their pets – that it looked destined to be banned. To save the day all it took was the promise of some sun, sea and deck chairs. “In response all the concerned elderly residents were shipped off to Blackpool for a day out, paid for by the promoter,” writes Paul. “Lemmy was born locally and there was a plaque put on the stadium to remember him and the gig. Since he died Port Vale have been crappier than normal. Coincidence? And yes, we run out to Ace of Spades.” Readers of a certain age may (just about) remember the second summer of love and a time when baggy jeans, fluorescent T-shirts and trainers replete with Grolsch bottle tops were de rigueur. No one represented the ethos of baggy-era music better than the Happy Mondays, who weren’t the most polished band around but carried the vibe effortlessly. So steeped were they in the Madchester scene of the late 80s/early 90s that surely their epochal gig would have been in their home city? Not so. On 1 June 1991, Shaun Ryder stepped out on stage at Elland Road, Leeds and asked: “Are you Man U, you?” of the 30,000-plus crowd who had packed out a stadium where that utterance would usually have been loaded with menace from moody home fans. This was enemy ground for a Manchester band, not that those in attendance caused any bother. When it came to music even the leftover football casuals of the day were lovers not fighters. The gig was imaginatively called Match of the Day and featured The Farm, The La’s and Northside as support acts. It was a cracker by all accounts – and deemed by many to be the apex of the baggy scene. Tony Wilson and Factory Records never missed a trick; they quickly released the Mondays’ set as an album when they heard bootleggers – including Ryder himself – were making a packet off illegal copies. And finally, here’s an offering from Steven Turvey, who takes us to Johannesburg. “If you’re looking for unlikely bands/football ground combinations, may I point you in the direction of the Kaiser Chiefs, who once supported the Foo Fighters on tour in 2014,” he begins. “One of the gigs they played was at FNB Stadium in Johannesburg (or more precisely, Soweto). FNB Stadium, more recognisably known as Soccer City (host of the 2010 World Cup final and that Nigel de Jong challenge) is also a frequent home ground to the Kaizer Chiefs football team, after whom the band were named. Has that ever happened before, or since …?” We’re guessing not. Readers? The league’s dustiest chequebooks “After seeing this week that Newcastle’s record signing is still, incredibly, Michael Owen, £16m from Real Madrid in 2005, what is the oldest record signing in football? My lot, Millwall, are still stinging from wasting £800,000 on Paul Goddard way back in 1989,” winces Joe McDonagh. Peter Tomlin informs us there are only two Football League sides with older record signings – Luton Town, who paid £850,000 for Danish international Lars Elstrup in 1989, and Newport County, who have somehow never surpassed the £80,000 fee for Alan Waddle, way back in December 1980. Newport picked up the baton this summer after Exeter City broke their 37-year transfer record on deadline day to sign Aberdeen’s Jayden Stockley. “I also discovered that my local club Stevenage have the lowest record transfer –£20,000 paid for Richard Leadbetter in February 1999,” Peter adds, warming to his theme. That edges out newcomers Forest Green Rovers, who paid £25,000 for Bury’s Adrian Randall – also in 1999. Starting the season in style “Arsenal have begun their first three league games of the 2017-18 season by sporting three different kits (red at home v Leicester, black away v Stoke City, aqua blue v Liverpool). Is this the first time this feat has occurred?” ponders Calum Brereton. “I believe in 2011-12 AFC Wimbledon wore four different kits in their first four games of the season,” notes Andrew Rockall. The Dons pulled off this achievement by wearing a special white kit to commemorate their Football League debut/return in their opening match against Bristol Rovers – MBMed by Scott Murray. Wimbledon’s next two fixtures were away to Dagenham &amp; Redbridge and Plymouth Argyle – we’ll take Andrew’s word for it that the yellow away and maroon third kits got an airing. Finally, the club’s blue home kit was worn for the first time in the 1-1 draw with Hereford United at Kingsmeadow. We can’t match that, but Fiorentina could be the team to watch this season – the Serie A side have four different change kits, inspired by the city’s historic Calcio Storico contests. La Viola began the season in three different outfits – white at Inter, their traditional purple at home to Sampdoria and red at Verona. The run was broken by the home match with Bologna, but with all-blue and all-green versions yet to be worn, Fiorentina could conceivably wear five different kits consecutively later in the season. Knowledge archive “My wedding is booked at the London Wetland Centre at the end of May (a week after the season finishes, naturally), and all four of the Craven Cottage floodlights are clearly visible from the main ornithology viewing observatory, which is also the room where the ceremony will take place,” wrote Mark Haines in 2011. “In fact, that was a significant reason for choosing this location. Where else, other than in the stadium itself, is it possible to exchange wedding vows in full view of a ground?” “I’d like to propose a church in Belgrade where my cousin was married several years ago,” writes Ivan Grujin. “Though it doesn’t quite fulfil Mr Haines’s criteria of an unobstructed line of sight (mostly because of the Serbian Orthodox church’s obstinate stance on transparent walls), it is located across the street from Partizan Stadium. I think it merits consideration since the wedding party and all the guests parked in the stadium parking lot, and since the north stand is the first thing you see upon exiting the church.” It’s the blue-green building you can see close to the stadium here. But the place to get married if the key aspect of your nuptials is not the correct shade of red for your napkins but the ability to see as many football grounds as possible, seems to be the Ashton Memorial in Lancaster. “I was married at the Ashton Memorial,” begins Alan Lamb. “From there you can see Lancaster City’s Giant Axe. I’ve not been up to check, but I reckon you would also be able to see Morecambe’s Globe Arena and Blackpool’s Bloomfield Road. There’s also a fair chance of seeing the floodlights at Barrow’s Holker Street and Fleetwood’s Highbury Stadium. With sufficiently powerful binoculars.” For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive Can you help? “Plymouth Argyle have endured a rough run of four consecutive home defeats in which they’ve ended each game with 10 men,” sighs James Dart. “Have any teams gone on longer red-card home runs? Or just longer consecutive red-card runs?” “I’m sure I remember a Panini (or such-like) sticker, back in the early 70s, with a Division One player crouched down over the ball with a cigarette clearly in his hand. Any Panini obsessives out there, ready to pan through their archives?” asks Graeme Westwood. “I noted earlier this year that a team played with four left-footers in their back four. Has there ever been a successful team with 11 left-footers?” wonders Rupert Ward. “In their Carabao Cup tie last week, Sunderland’s team had more combined appearances for Everton (238) than their opponents – Everton (230),” says Niall McVeigh. “Are there any other teams who have managed this?” “In League Two, Lincoln City have drawn three, won three and lost three of their first nine matches, scoring 11 and conceding 11. Have any teams finished a season with stats as balanced as theirs?” wonders Jack Aherne.

Young people declare it too old, while old people say it’s too young. No one likes John Humphrys apart from the scores of people who can’t get enough of his harrumphing, and would picket Broadcasting House in the unlikely event of him being crowbarred from his desk. Women invariably find it too male, though there are men who still balk at the sound of two female presenters. Pity the poor mug patrolling the programme’s Twitter feed and wading through the torrent of indignation and invective while still on the first coffee of the day. Lately, however, the ire levelled at the programme has gone up a notch. The extra helping of irritation has largely been directed at Sarah Sands, who was appointed editor in January following eight years in charge of the London Evening Standard. Among the complaints thus far – and it’s been said that many are coming from inside the network – are that it has become lightweight and magazine-ish, that fashion and arts stories are being given undue prominence, that the political argy-bargy has been toned down, and that it is failing to set the news agenda. Certainly, Sands has made a clear decision to give more coverage to subjects and figures that have long been marginalised by a show fixated on world politics and the goings-on in Westminster. She has pledged to give greater prominence to what she calls “girls’ stuff”, which is good in principle, but is perhaps an unfortunate way to describe stories that men might find interesting and women could just as easily find a turn-off. The very fact that “girls’ stuff” has been viewed negatively points, of course, to a wider and long-standing problem with Today: that even with a woman at the helm, and two female presenters, it is still seen as a mouthpiece for and about men. (This would also account for some of the vitriol being aimed at the show’s editor). In any case, the big interview slots have, in recent weeks, occasionally been turned over to cultural figures, among them the former Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman, the novelist John le Carré and the actor Judi Dench. This, apparently, is a bad thing for those who can’t enjoy breakfast unless it is soundtracked by a barking match between Humphrys and whichever hapless politician has been frogmarched to Broadcasting House, or between the advocates in one of the frequent issue-based items pointlessly reduced to adversarial “for” and “against” positions. For this listener, the content shift suggests a programme trying to broaden its remit, to think about who is listening – and, crucially, to evolve. Having said all that, I listened to the Shulman interview and cringed throughout due to the banality of the questioning. If Today really wants to refresh the format, it needs to treat these supposedly “lighter” subjects with the seriousness and depth they deserve. That Today is, apparently, no longer setting quite so much of the news agenda strikes me as a win, if not for the show itself then for the wider media which has too often relied on the programme to determine the day’s coverage. It’s significant that the latest wave of criticism coincides with a broader sense of cynicism about the so-called mainstream media. Sands’s job is a thankless one, but here’s hoping she stands her ground, continues to blow away the cobwebs and ignores the petulant traditionalist rumbling. Her show may be a broadcasting institution, but there are plenty who see it as arrogant, fusty and, in the age of the 24-hour news cycle, potentially surplus to requirements. Today still has a part to play in the national conversation, but to stay relevant it is quite right that it should adapt and change. Better that the listeners grumble than turn off altogether. • Fiona Sturges is a freelance culture writer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/22/leading-eu-figures-react-to-theresa-mays-florence-speech","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T17:24:00Z","webTitle":"Leading EU figures react to Theresa May's Florence speech","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/22/leading-eu-figures-react-to-theresa-mays-florence-speech","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/22/leading-eu-figures-react-to-theresa-mays-florence-speech","fields":{"headline":"Leading EU figures react to Theresa May's Florence speech","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, has welcomed Theresa May’s Florence speech as “a step forward”, but stressed that Brussels would have many questions for the British side about the “concrete implications” of her words when the fourth round of Brexit talks get underway next week. “The speech shows a willingness to move forward,” he said, after the prime minister ruled out the “have cake and eat it” approach to negotiations favoured by leading Brexiters. In her speech on Friday, May asked EU countries to agree to a two-year Brexit transition, during which the UK would continue to enjoy unfettered access to the single market. She said the UK did not “pretend that you can have all the benefits of membership of the single market without its obligations”. In a statement, Barnier acknowledged May’s concession that the UK would pay into the EU budget until 2020, which guarantees €20bn (£18bn) of funds promised by the government. But the EU will be looking for reassurances that the UK will pay a share of the EU’s unpaid bills, pensions and other liabilities, totalling at least €40bn. However, Barnier also highlighted that May’s speech did not clarify how the UK intended to honour its responsibility for protecting the peace in Ireland, while observing EU trade and customs rules. Barnier welcomed May’s promise to protect the rights of EU citizens, but said this must be translated into a precise negotiating position. “We look forward to the United Kingdom’s negotiators explaining the concrete implications of prime minister Theresa May’s speech,” he said. In her speech, May said EU citizens arriving during the transition period would benefit from free movement. Poland’s EU affairs minister, Konrad Szymanski, struck a similar note to Barnier, saying May’s offer needed to be “re-confirmed” at the negotiating table. “Only progress made at the negotiating table will allow the European Council [of EU leaders] to conclude that the sufficient progress has been made.” France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said that while he welcomed May’s “willingness” to move forward, more progress was needed on the rights of EU citizens in Britain and the border with Ireland as well as the so-called “divorce settlement”. “Before we move forward, we wish to clarify the issue of the regulation of European citizens, the financial terms of the exit and the question of Ireland,” he said. “If those three points are not clarified, then we cannot move forward on the rest.” Ireland’s Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said May’s call for a two-year transition period was a “step in the right direction”, although clarity was needed. He said he was particularly happy about May’s reassertion of support for protections for Northern Ireland’s Good Friday peace deal, and for a frictionless border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s Brexit co-ordinator, said the UK position was “becoming more realistic”, but lacked detail about the future relationship. “We heard a lot about what the UK doesn’t want (the single market, the customs union, the EEA [European Economic Area] or an FTA [Free Trade Agreement],” he said in a statement. “We hope to hear from them soon how they see the ‘deep and special partnership’ with the EU,” he said, throwing May’s slogan back at her. Members of the European parliament sounded a more critical note. The leader of the centre-right European People’s party in the European parliament, Manfred Weber, said May had brought no more clarity to London’s positions. “I am even more concerned now,” he tweeted. “The clock is ticking and time is running faster than the government believes in London.” Ingeborg Grӓssle, a German centre-right MEP, who chairs the European parliament’s budget control committee, told the Guardian that things remained “as vague as before”. “We thought it might be a speech for Europeans, but in fact it continued to be a speech for the UK,” she said. Grӓssle welcomed May’s words for the 3.5 million EU citizens in the UK, in which the British prime minister said: “We want you to stay.” But the MEP voiced irritation with May’s call for “a creative solution” to the UK’s future trading relationship with bloc. “She put forward a lot of contradictory positions ... as if it is a matter of creativity. It is not a matter of creativity, it is a matter of logic and respect of basic EU law.” The harsh response from MEPs will complicate life for the British government, as the European parliament has the power to veto a Brexit deal. The main themes of the EU response have been in plain sight since EU27 leaders drew up Barnier’s negotiating mandate in April, a document that cemented the bloc’s negotiating stance. Barnier referred to it again when he said there would be no bespoke transition deal: the UK would have to accept the EU’s “regulatory, budgetary, supervisory, judiciary and enforcement instruments and structures”. This means the UK must accept free movement of people, pay into the EU budget and observe the jurisdiction of the European court of justice and all EU laws during the two-year transition May is seeking."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/sep/22/hughie-fury-joseph-parker-wbo-heavyweight-title-boxing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T16:23:13Z","webTitle":"Hughie Fury sets sights on Joseph Parker and being best of the rest | Kevin Mitchell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/22/hughie-fury-joseph-parker-wbo-heavyweight-title-boxing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/22/hughie-fury-joseph-parker-wbo-heavyweight-title-boxing","fields":{"headline":"Hughie Fury sets sights on Joseph Parker and being best of the rest","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The electricity that normally runs through the leadup to a world title fight has barely flickered in Manchester this week, although Hughie Fury’s circuitry sparked into life when he shoved the amiable New Zealander Joseph Parker at the weigh-in on Friday. After a week that began with Parker’s promoter, David Higgins, being escorted from a press conference for supposedly upsetting the hosts by demanding a neutral referee then settling his differences with Fury’s father and trainer, Peter (to everyone’s smiling satisfaction), normal boxing service was resumed with some unsubtle histrionics the day before they fight for real at the Manchester Arena. While it was not exactly Donald Trump staring down Kim Jong-un, Fury, the unbeaten, untested Mancunian challenger, felt inclined to raise the temperature after an exchange of pleasantries with the quiet New Zealander. Parker holds the WBO title vacated by Fury’s semi-retired cousin, Tyson, who was also restrained in the 30 seconds of hand-baggery that ensued. The multiple prize they are reaching for is made up of a decent payday, Parker’s quarter slice of the world heavyweight title and the right to stay in the mix for a shot at Anthony Joshua or Deontay Wilder, who have more legitimate claims on the sport’s ultimate accolade. Joshua defends his WBA super, IBF and IBO titles against Kubrat Pulev in Cardiff next month, while Wilder, who rarely leaves his Alabama backyard, travels to Brooklyn in November to put his WBC belt on the line against the unpredictable and talented Cuban veteran Luis Ortiz. That is the proper context of Fury-Parker; two willing prospects fighting for third place. To pretend otherwise is to go along with the game’s ludicrous attempts to sell bronze as gold. Wilder said this week: “I am the best, I am the toughest, whatever’s going in their country. They’ve got to come to me.” And he first has to beat Ortiz, who has a dangerous streak in him and nothing to lose towards the end of a largely ignored career. Whoever commands top billing will be decided, as ever, by the financial clout and selling power of the incumbent, and Joshua can claim to prevail in that department, given his access to Sky Sports’ pay-per-view money, and having retired Wladimir Klitschko so impressively in his last fight. Parker-Fury will make history of its own on Saturday night, going out to 25 countries on YouTube – which looks as if it will become a significant part of the future of showing sport – as well as 20 countries on traditional TV. As the promoter Mick Hennessy said this week: “Everyone with a smart TV can watch it. It’s going to be a tremendous production.” It might well be but the quality of the product will determine that. Hennessy added: “It’s gained a lot of attention and it’s something everyone needs to stay peeled on. There’s going to be an upset in the heavyweight division this weekend. This young man’s going to make a huge statement at the tender age of 23.” If so, he will have overcome a long spell out with a debilitating blood disorder that left him with bleeding skin and drained stamina. While Parker, a slight betting favourite, has been more active, he has yet to show he has the extra class to move to the elite level. As his well-travelled trainer, Kevin Barry, a silver medallist at light-heavyweight at the 1984 Olympics, was candid enough to concede this week, Parker’s last two performances have been below-par. It would be surprising if he does not raise his level. Nevertheless Fury, expertly tutored by his father, inspired by his cousin and blessed with quick hands and a keen fighting instinct, may have a few too many tricks for him over 12 rounds. Meanwhile, two similarly well-mannered pugilists, Luke Campbell and Jorge Linares, contest the Venezuelan’s WBA, WBC diamond and Ring magazine lightweight titles in the famed Forum in Los Angeles in the small hours of Sunday morning. Sky and HBO have that one. Campbell, the London Olympic gold medallist, gets his world title shot at 29, and he has a mountainous challenge against Linares, who has prevailed in three excellent fights in the UK, against Kevin Mitchell and Anthony Crolla, twice. A fourth win over British opposition looks likely. “This is why I turned professional, for big nights like this,” Campbell said. “We’ve worked hard and we’ve worked smart. I’m physically and mentally ready for this, I believe in my own ability. He’s strong and durable with plenty of experience but this is my time.” As young champions arrive, an old one leaves. Andre Ward’s decision at 33 to quit boxing considerably diminishes the stock of quality fighters on the world stage. Nobody, amateur or professional, has beaten this extraordinary super-middleweight/light-heavyweight since he was 13. He says his body is giving up on him, so it sounds as if he has made a sensible decision. Contractual wrangles with HBO, however, have not helped."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/25/trump-global-vision-nightmare-un-world-peace-security-antonio-guterres","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T09:36:14Z","webTitle":"Trump’s global vision is a nightmare.

The UN has to act","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The presidential cavalcades have departed Manhattan. But the aftershocks of Donald Trump’s speech to the UN general assembly still reverberate. “You can be sure of one thing,” a veteran UN official whispered to me during the speech: “Trump never fails to disappoint.” Still, there had been enthusiasts, including John Bolton, once George Bush’s ambassador to the UN, whose grandstanding and savaging of the organisation is still recalled with a shiver by many older hands. Bolton declared Trump’s tour-de-force to be the “best speech he has given yet”. Trump’s American exceptionalism, directed as much towards domestic TV networks as to the rest of the world, has it that sovereignty is all, and that this should be the guiding principle for all nations. So, “America First”, and the question now for the United Nations is how many will choose to follow the US’s lead? And where does this leave an organisation founded on the principles of peaceful cooperation and multilateralism? In part we know the answer, because Trump has already noisily extricated the US from the Paris climate change agreement. His boastfulness over this piece of unilateralism was not repeated at the UN, where he failed to mention “climate” or “change” even once. But other populists will take heart. Trump’s irredentism will have gone down well with Vladimir Putin of Russia and Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines. It did with Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. It would have been appreciated by Narendra Modi of India. It will have chimed with the hardline nationalists now calling the shots in Hungary and Poland. If “Rocket Man” in Pyongyang really had his wits about him, he will have noticed that Trump and his acolytes keep mentioning that they have no real problems with democracy-hating, human-rights-suppressing regimes – so long as they don’t threaten the US and its allies with ballistic, nuclear-carrying, missiles. Trump’s interest in the UN, until recently at least, had more been directed towards winning a multibillion-dollar “capital master plan” deal to renovate the UN headquarters. A decade ago, he promised Ban Ki-moon that he, Trump, could do it “cheaper and faster”, but never came back with a business proposal. Ban’s successor, the former Portuguese prime minister António Guterres, must have hoped that Trump would stay in real estate and not come to occupy some of the best-known real estate in the land, namely the White House. Guterres has had the unenviable task of trying to rein in Trump over the past nine months. Ivanka Trump, for instance, has been to lunch on the 38th floor with the secretary general and his advisers. By all accounts she has also developed a good relationship with the politically ambitious US UN ambassador, Nikki Haley. Trump was more complimentary about the United Nations than many had expected, saying that it “had great potential”. This perhaps was not least because Guterres is committed to reforming the organisation. But reform means different things to different people. To Trump and Haley, it means substantial cuts in UN peacekeeping budgets (so that monies saved can be spent on the US military). For many countries in the global south, UN reform means taking the ossified architecture of 1945, in particular the security council, and reconfiguring its permanent five membership to give Africa and South America a place at the top table. It will be easier to achieve the former than the latter. Next week, for instance, one of the leading UN humanitarian agencies is set to lose $37m from its $270m annual budget. Peacekeeping budgets have already been slashed and more cuts are likely to be in the pipeline. The US may be the UN’s biggest funder, but overall less than 1% of the federal budget is devoted to foreign aid – including UN contributions. So Guterres will have to tread a careful path and avoid being seen as being far too faithful to the Trump administration’s approach to reform. For while the UN may be based in New York, it is not the private property of its most powerful member. But more importantly still, he will surely not be able to avoid taking a stand against Trump’s all-out assault on a vision of the world that drove his political forebears to help construct the UN out of the ashes of the second world war (and the ruins of its neutered predecessor organisation, the League of Nations). Guterres’ evocation last week of a “world in pieces” was powerful, but he will need to call Trump out more strongly still, lest the infection of extreme nationalism, unilateralism and militarism spread. Trump is a narcissistic bully. His recklessness was in brutal evidence on occasions this past week in New York. The trouble is that bullies don’t usually respond well to kindness. And as Robert Mueller’s noose tightens still further, coupled with Trump’s inordinate ability to offend virtually everyone in his own party, this could lead in quite quick succession to a more practical and emollient president, Mike Pence, occupying the White House. Accepting Trump’s view of the world as the new norm is not only defeatist, it is plain wrong. The world expects the UN secretary general and the UN to take a tough stand with those who defy international norms, whether they be in Pyongyang, Tehran, Moscow – or even Washington DC. Since global politics abhors a vacuum, a failure by the UN to provide a strong, moral lead presents an intriguing prospect that in the short term at least, global peace and security may yet come to rest in the hands of the European Union, the US generals who now populate the higher echelons of the Trump administration and the Chinese Politburo.

Other butterfly species were less fortunate, however, with declines seen across the three common species of white butterflies. The green-veined white and both the large white and small white were down more than a third on last year, reflecting difficult weather conditions. The red admiral is one of the best recognised butterflies in Britain thanks to its distinctive black, orange and white markings. More than 73,000 were counted in this year’s census carried out by the Butterfly Conservation charity between 14 July and 6 August. The large showing came on the back of a bumper year last year, and a mild winter and spring that helped some of the species stay in the UK – a new development in recent years, possibly assisted by a warming climate, for what used to be a summer visitor from southern Europe. The red admiral was not the most numerous butterfly in the count. The gatekeeper, also known as the hedge brown, with orange and brown wings and prominent black spots, was seen more than 93,000 times, up nearly a quarter on last year. This year’s wet summer, the 11th wettest on record (though temperatures were above average), spelled poor conditions for butterflies, which thrive in warmer and sunnier summers. Last year was also a bad year for butterflies and moths, so improvements this year are relative in many cases. It was a bumper year for the count itself as a record 60,000 people took part in the three-week census which is the world’s biggest survey of butterfly numbers. More than 550,000 butterflies were recorded, but the record number of surveyors hides a more concerning picture: each participant saw on average only about 11 butterflies, the lowest number per person since the count began in 2010. Richard Fox, head of recording at Butterfly Conservation, said: “It hasn’t been a vintage summer for butterflies, but there have been some real positives. The highlight has been the huge number of people that have got involved, spent time enjoying and counting our native butterflies and moths, and done something useful and important in the face of so much wildlife decline.” The other most numerous butterflies spotted by volunteers were the meadow brown, whose numbers were third highest, the peacock with nearly 30,000 examples, the common blue with nearly 20,000, and the speckled wood butterfly at more than 18,500. Despite the good news for the red admiral, butterflies in the UK are under threat, both from a changing climate, with the last 10 years showing a pattern of damper summers, and from human factors. Butterflies are losing their habitat as a result of intensive farming, pesticides, urbanisation and populations becoming cut off, and the added pressure of weather changes is having an impact on their breeding and food sources. Butterflies and moths are also valuable to farmers and gardeners as pollinators, though on a smaller scale than bees."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/23/mental-health-data-shows-stark-difference-between-girls-and-boys","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T09:00:12Z","webTitle":"Mental health data shows stark difference between girls and boys","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/23/mental-health-data-shows-stark-difference-between-girls-and-boys","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/23/mental-health-data-shows-stark-difference-between-girls-and-boys","fields":{"headline":"Mental health data shows stark difference between girls and boys","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A snapshot view of NHS and other data on child and adolescent mental health reveals a stark difference along gender lines. As reported earlier this week, the results of a study by University College London and the University of Liverpool show a discrepancy between the emotional problems perceived by parents and the feelings expressed by their children. Researchers asked parents to report signs of emotional problems in their children at various ages; they also presented the children at age 14 with a series of questions to detect symptoms of depression. The study reveals that almost a quarter of teenage girls exhibit depressive symptoms. Data from NHS Digital, which examines the proportion of antidepressants prescribed to teenagers between 13 and 17 years old, shows that three-quarters of all antidepressants for this age group are prescribed to girls. Eating disorders are one of the most common manifestations of mental health problems, and are in some cases closely related to depression. A year-by-year breakdown of hospital admissions for eating disorders indicates that, while eating disorders in both boys and girls are on the rise, more than 90% of teens admitted to the hospital for treatment are girls. Records also show hospital admissions dating back to 2005 for individuals under 18 years old who committed self-harm. While the numbers for boys have seen a smaller amount of variation with a general upward trend, the figure for girls has climbed sharply during the last decade, with the most significant jump occurring between 2012/13 and 2013/14. Two of the most common methods of self-harm are poisoning and cutting. Self-poisoning victims are about five times as likely to be girls, and the number of girls hospitalised for cutting themselves has quadrupled over the course of a decade. Although self-harm, depression, and other mental health problems are more commonly reported and identified in girls, suicide rates are far higher among boys. This data is consistent with research on differences found between men and women in methods used to commit suicide, the influence of alcohol, and other social or cultural factors. In the UK the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

Even after the controversies that the ride-hailing app has faced worldwide and the concerted opposition of unions, employment-rights lawyers and black-cab drivers, few expected TfL’s verdict that Uber is not a “fit and proper” firm to run taxis in the capital. While Uber’s battle to survive in London will take place first in the courts, political heat will be piled on the capital’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, during an appeal process that could take a year or more to play out. For Uber to highlight the livelihoods of 40,000 drivers may seem a bit rich from a firm that has long insisted it does not employ them and is fighting rulings on workplace rights for its “partners”. Its trump card could be consumer sentiment, with about 3.5 million Londoners using the app, many finding Uber more convenient and cheaper than traditional black cabs. As with Ryanair, passengers have flocked to a cheaper transport alternative without worrying unduly about the employment practices: a petition (started by Uber) calling on Khan to reverse the decision quickly reached 200,000 signatures on Friday. However, rivals claim the US cab-hailing app’s fares are artificially low, that its “surge pricing” – increasing fares in line with demand – shows a more accurate picture of what an Uber monopoly could look like. Uber says prices are not due to subsidy but the efficiency and scale of its system. The technology itself has not proved difficult for rivals to emulate, simply the scale of its business. If the rapid global spread of its brand made it appear unstoppable, it could yet prove the MySpace of taxi apps, with competitors emerging worldwide. In the wake of London verdict, Google searches for Hailo, a similar app using black cabs, and Addison Lee, the largest single private-hire fleet in London, rocketed. Uber has already prompted traditional minicab firms to up their game, with many now likewise providing detail to customers on time of arrival, fare, driver’s name, car type and registration. TfL is adamant that the licence decision is not about Uber’s technology, despite past courtroom tussles over the app’s workings. Instead, the issues are Uber’s conduct and approach – noises that chime with global concerns right up to its Silicon Valley head office, where allegations of a culture of sexism and bullying led to co-founder Travis Kalanick stepping down as chief executive. Some have voiced suspicions of political grandstanding by Khan on the eve of the Labour party conference. TfL’s view is that Uber’s time is up for quick fixes, after a four-month extension to their licence granted in May. Khan had the unanimous backing of the London Assembly in June to reject Uber unless it reviewed its practices. The charge sheet against the company covers medical and background checks on drivers and reporting serious criminal offences, all of which are now likely to be argued out in court. Authorities have also been grappling with the growing headache of congestion, with thousands more private-hire vehicles on the capital’s roads, and also increasing complaints about “cross-border” drivers licensed in London plying for trade around the country. Uber has a fight on its hands, at a time when its close connections in British politics are diminished. Although it has faced suspensions and bans in a host of European countries, to be forced out of a major global city would be a serious reversal for a firm whose near-$70bn (£52bn) valuation of 2016 now looks ever more dubious."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/22/yorkshire-pudding-wrap-draws-crowds-becomes-a-social-media-sensation","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T17:10:32Z","webTitle":"Yorkshire pudding wrap draws crowds, becomes a social media sensation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/22/yorkshire-pudding-wrap-draws-crowds-becomes-a-social-media-sensation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/22/yorkshire-pudding-wrap-draws-crowds-becomes-a-social-media-sensation","fields":{"headline":"Yorkshire pudding wrap draws crowds, becomes a social media sensation","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s 1pm on Friday afternoon and scores of people are queueing patiently outside a small cafe in the shadow of York Minster. The York Roast Co usually specialises in pork sandwiches and roast dinners, but today the crowds are here to sample the business’s surprise new hit – the yorkshire pudding wrap. The delicacy consists of a large flattened yorkshire pudding, wrapped around a mound of carved meat, stuffing and some token veg, smothered in a thick gravy. It is, as one customer describes it, “the ultimate comfort food”. The past week has seen the morsel become a social media sensation. On Tuesday, the company posted a picture on their Facebook page of the wrap glistening seductively with gravy. That post, which has had over 30,000 shares, was spotted by the BBC, who on Wednesday published a short video online of the wrap being prepared with the bucolic tones of Dvorak’s “New World” Symphony – the music from the Hovis ad. That video has had 12m views on the BBC’s Facebook page at the time of writing, 11m more than a clip of Donald Trump’s threat to meet North Korea with “fire and fury”. It has been a surprising week for Wayne Chadwick, managing director of York Roast Co. He has had to take on extra staff in his shop on York’s historic Low Petergate. “We really weren’t expecting this,” he says, taking delivery of 200 extra kilos of pork to meet the increased demand. “We’re getting a lot of students coming in,” he says. “They want to be able to tell their mums that they’ve had their Sunday dinner. It is essentially a Sunday dinner in a wrap.” In many ways the yorkshire pudding wrap tastes exactly as you’d expect it to. The yorkshire pudding is pleasantly greasy, the portion of meat generous and the gravy thick and salty. It leaves you feeling satisfied, if slightly guilty. As Ashley Mand, a local estate agent queueing for his lunch, says, it is not really the sort of thing you’d have more than once a week. When the business first started selling the wrap in March it made up around 20% of sales. This week that figure is over 70%, and Chadwick now has plans to take the wrap nationwide. Alongside the two branches in York, the York Roast Co has shops in Chester, Shrewsbury and Salisbury, but Chadwick wants to expand to other tourist hotspots, including Oxford, Cambridge and Bath. And why stop with the UK? “Somebody from Perth in Australia emailed to say ‘any chance of opening a franchise?’,” he says. “The Chinese, the Japanese, the Americans, they all want to try a yorkshire pudding.” Sitting down to enjoy their long awaited wraps, 35-year-old payroll clerk Stuart Peers and 34-year-old accountant Stephen Haggan stop first to take pictures of their meals to post to social media. The self-described foodies have come through from Manchester for the day, a one-and-a-half-hour train journey, in part because of the lure of the wrap. “The yorkshire pudding is nicer than having bread, I think,” says Peers. “Sometimes when you get a carvery meat sandwich it’s a bit boring because it’s just the meat on its own, but this is like a whole roast dinner.” “We’ve got a friend in Australia who has tagged himself [underneath the video on Facebook] saying ‘I need this in my life’,” Peers adds. “We’ve messaged him just now just to wind him up.” Working behind the counter, frantically flattening yorkshire puddings and making wraps, Scott Bastiman looks a bit despairing. He says the team made more than 1,000 wraps on Thursday and it doesn’t look like it’s going to get quieter today. He says plaintively: “Why did this have to go viral?” Additional reporting: Imogen Cooper"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/22/ayr-report-british-horseracing-authority-over-gold-cup-meeting-abandonment-horse-racing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T16:33:05Z","webTitle":"Ayr must report to BHA over valuable Gold Cup meeting being abandoned","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/22/ayr-report-british-horseracing-authority-over-gold-cup-meeting-abandonment-horse-racing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/22/ayr-report-british-horseracing-authority-over-gold-cup-meeting-abandonment-horse-racing","fields":{"headline":"Ayr must report to BHA over valuable Gold Cup meeting being abandoned","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The British Horseracing Authority has asked Ayr racecourse to report on the circumstances surrounding the abandonment of the track’s three-day Western meeting, due to a small area of waterlogged turf on an otherwise raceable track. The final card of the meeting, including the £200,000 Ayr Gold Cup, was abandoned on Friday morning, 24 hours after news of the potential problem emerged. The BHA’s request for more information stops short of a formal investigation but the regulator will be keen to address the surprise and disappointment among punters and professionals alike at the sudden loss of a meeting offering £700,000 in prize money. “The BHA has requested a report from the racecourse executive regarding the circumstances surrounding the last few days,” Richard Wayman, its chief operating officer, said on Friday, “including exactly what the issue with the track is, what has caused it, what procedures are in place to address the issues, their prospects of racing at other forthcoming fixtures and the communication around the fixture cancellations.” There was also some confusion on Friday evening over the possibility that the meeting’s feature race could be rescheduled. While Wayman suggested that “we are doing the best we can to try to save the Gold Cup itself, which is such a valuable race for horsemen and an important betting event,” the message from the track was that all hope was lost. “Sadly there won’t be a 2017 Ayr Gold Cup,” Iain Ferguson, Ayr’s head of PR, said on Friday. “We explored certain things, like maybe even running it at the end of next week, but we’ve got to get to the bottom of what’s wrong. It’s pouring with rain now, so we couldn’t risk that. It was also mooted about maybe running the Gold Cup at another track but William Hill didn’t want that, so it won’t be happening.” Ayr will now investigate whether “an underlying issue” may have been to blame for a strip of ground about 15m wide across the width of the course which refused to drain. Tim Easterby, one of the north’s leading trainers, told the Racing Post on Thursday morning that the turf was in “absolutely magnificent condition apart from one place where the drain has bubbled up”, and a drainage problem is likely to be the initial line of inquiry. “Since 15 August we’ve had 180mm of rain, which is seven inches,” Ferguson said. “On Wednesday into Thursday, there was another 17mm and, when the guys came in Thursday morning, there was this waterlogged patch, about 15 metres wide. “We had a helicopter up to try and dry it out and we also got some machines in from Hampden Park, to try and suck out any moisture in the ground. The rest of the course would have been heavy yesterday and today it’s just soft but that patch, although all the water’s gone, it’s false ground. A horse could put a foot in and struggle to get it out. “Now we’ve got to try to find out what caused it. The course has been here since 1907, before that it was agricultural land and there’s old field drains underneath. It could be one of those that’s collapsed but the simple answer is that we just don’t know.” The loss of Saturday’s card is a blow not just for the racecourse, which was not insured against abandonment, but also its local economy, which could be facing a seven-figure loss. Racing as a whole, meanwhile, is likely to miss out on its cut from the turnover on one of the most competitive and popular betting races of the season. “Everyone thinks we were insured but we’re not,” Ferguson said, “and the reason probably is that we’ve never lost a meeting like this before. “It’s hard to put a figure on it but it [the total cost] is a considerable amount of money, probably into seven figures. It’s not just the racecourse itself, it’s the local community. It’s traditionally the second biggest weekend of the year in the area and the last hurrah of the summer. “After this weekend there’s nothing really for the local businesses, like hoteliers and taxi drivers, until Christmas.People plan their holidays around this and it’s a local holiday as well too, so it’s a massive blow.” Ayr’s final two Flat meetings of the year, on 3 and 12 October, may now be switched to the hurdles course, which would not allow the track to stage any sprint events. The course will open its doors on Saturday, meanwhile, to ticketholders for any day at the Western meeting and racegoers with pre-booked hospitality. “William Hill have 250 guests here and we’re opening hospitality for anyone who’s already booked and wants to come,” Ferguson said. “People with tickets for Thursday, Friday and Saturday will get refunds but they can still come if they want to watch the away racing ITV Racing, which was due to cover four races from the Ayr card, will replace the gap in its schedule with three races at Newmarket."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/22/betsy-devos-scraps-obama-rules-on-investigating-campus-sexual-assault","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T16:25:28Z","webTitle":"Betsy DeVos scraps Obama rules on investigating campus sexual assault","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/22/betsy-devos-scraps-obama-rules-on-investigating-campus-sexual-assault","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/22/betsy-devos-scraps-obama-rules-on-investigating-campus-sexual-assault","fields":{"headline":"Betsy DeVos scraps Obama rules on investigating campus sexual assault","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Trump administration on Friday scrapped Obama-era guidance on investigating campus sexual assault, replacing it with new interim instructions allowing universities to decide which standard of evidence to use when handling complaints. The education secretary, Betsy DeVos, has said the Obama rules were unfairly skewed against the students accused of assault. Her new temporary guidance allows colleges the freedom to decide which standards of evidence they want to use when investigating complaints of sexual assault. Advocates for student survivors of sexual assault quickly condemned the news, with some saying DeVos lacked the legal ability to change the standard of evidence – one of the most controversial elements of the debate surrounding campus sexual assault. In her statement, DeVos said: “This interim guidance will help schools as they work to combat sexual misconduct and will treat all students fairly … schools must continue to confront these horrific crimes and behaviors head-on. There will be no more sweeping them under the rug. But the process also must be fair and impartial, giving everyone more confidence in its outcomes,” she said. Under Obama’s instructions from 2011 and 2014, colleges were notified the department expected them to use “the preponderance of the evidence” standards, while DeVos lets colleges choose between that standard and “the clear and convincing evidence standard”, which is harder to meet. The temporary guidance will be in place while the education department gathers comments and comes up with new rules. The Obama guidance did not create the “preponderance of evidence” standard, advocates argued, but merely put schools on notice that they were required to use this standard under longstanding federal law. “[It] is simply unlawful to flip a civil right on its head,” said SurvJustice, a nonprofit that provides legal assistance for students bringing claims of sexual assault. “The department has exceeded its authority to intentionally place protections for those accused of sex discrimination over those victimized by sex discrimination … It has no legal authority to advance rights for only accused students.” But the change is sure to be welcomed by the scores of advocates who feel the current policies are unfair to students who stand accused of sexual assault. DeVos has faced consistent pressure since taking office from congressional Republicans, students who say they were railroaded by false accusations, and groups of legal scholars to backpedal the Obama administration’s approach to enforcing title IX, the federal law that prohibits gender discrimination in schools. Just a few weeks ago, DeVos appeared to be taking a more gradual approach to reform. In a 7 September speech at George Mason University’s law school, she said her department would issue a new guidance for schools handling sexual assaults, but in the speech she stopped short of saying this would rescind Obama’s guidance. At the time, advocates who had been fearful DeVos would withdraw the guidance said doing so would not change the rights of students who have been assaulted or schools’ obligations to investigate their complaints. Those are based on federal courts’ interpretation of title IX. But they cautioned that rescinding the guidance could leave schools confused about their obligations. “The department has to be really careful here, because they run the risk of confusing schools and leading them down the wrong path,” Fatima Goss Graves, president of the National Women’s Law Center, told the Guardian. While the Obama administration’s guidance unleashed seismic changes in the way colleges and universities handled accusations of sexual assault, it did so largely without creating new policies or requirements. What distinguished the previous administration’s approach was the fanfare surrounding its release and the Obama administration’s stepped-up enforcement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/01/our-history-of-the-20th-century-travis-elborough-review-diaries-journals","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T11:00:00Z","webTitle":"Our History of the 20th Century by Travis Elborough review – a story woven from 100 journal entries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/01/our-history-of-the-20th-century-travis-elborough-review-diaries-journals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/01/our-history-of-the-20th-century-travis-elborough-review-diaries-journals","fields":{"headline":"Our History of the 20th Century by Travis Elborough review – a story woven from 100 journal entries","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Travis Elborough, author of two previous anthologies, has raided the diaries and journals of 100 witnesses to compile this intriguing history of modern Britain. His sources range from movers and shakers to the relatively obscure and embrace all aspects of social, political and cultural life, including extracts from a couple of unpublished teenage diaries. There is plenty to entertain, amuse, enlighten and occasionally horrify. This is Beatrice Webb in 1903 on dinner with a brash young MP called Winston Churchill: “First impressions: restless, almost intolerably so ... egotistical, bumptious, shallow minded and reactionary, but with a certain personal magnetism, great pluck and some originality.” This, from Vera Brittain on a row with her piano teacher who expressed horror at her assertion that she intended to earn her living: “‘What were fathers for,’ he asked. I replied very heatedly that I did not intend to be kept by mine, that I had more brains than my brothers and why shouldn’t I use them.” The century ends with a whimper in the shape of this entry from former MP Oona King: “My whole life I thought I’d be at a wild party at the end of the millennium. Instead, I was queuing outside Stratford tube station. It was the only way to get to the Dome.” Ah yes, the Dome.

He was having an affair with Sally, his wife Rebecca’s 20-year-old daughter from another marriage. When Rebecca caught the icky couple in bed, a distressed Sally brained her with a trophy Patrick had received for “thought leadership” in 2003. His subsequent thought leadership involved desecrating Rebecca’s body and dumping it in a children’s playpark to make it seem like the work of the acid killer. Despite Patrick’s gory efforts at misdirection, Gabriel seemed to intuit that there was something off about him. But Richard Dormer’s raspy DCI abandoned the Barker investigation to track down his own daughter, Hannah, who had bunked off school to do some serious booze preloading before an illicit rave. In the end – also the beginning – Gabriel and Shepard caught up with a semi-conscious Hannah barely in time to save her from a sexual assault. In other words, this was the grimmest, grubbiest Rellik yet. Rewind Things kick off 11 days before episode two – another chronological jump so substantial it feels like it must be intentional. With Rellik’s tricksy reverse narrative structure, perhaps writers Jack and Harry Williams intend to present episodes as discrete jigsaws to be pieced together rather than parts of an intimidatingly large whole. Again, we’re in gloomy London at night, with Gabriel having retrieved Hannah from what was clearly a dodgy situation – she lies dishevelled and zonked out in the back seat of Shepard’s car. Once Hannah is home safe, Gabriel and wife Lisa have a brittle discussion about who might be to blame for their daughter acting out. Again it is implied that they are both guilty of some horrible – though separate? – misdeeds. Cut to Patrick Barker and his suspiciously young girlfriend, tossing some rolling luggage, women’s clothes and a big red hat into an abandoned car and setting it alight. “Is this what you really want, love?” he asks the girl, and there’s something weird about his intonation. The action rewinds to almost three hours earlier, with cops Mike and Asim waiting to interrogate concierge Brian Sweeney, who is late clocking on. (We later hear that Sweeney works 9pm to 9am, so this must be a little after 9pm.) The body of resident Rebecca Barker was been found, but Brian swears he saw her leave the building that morning, and – rather conveniently – has a smartphone recording to corroborate his story. Meanwhile, Gabriel is tearing through pubs and nightclubs in search of Hannah. Amid a druggy rave, he finds her passed out in a back room with a leering, semi-naked man who Gabriel immediately attacks with alarming, if understandable, ferocity. Another rewind, with flashes of a naked couple in bed. Gabriel and Shepard? Barker and his girlfriend? It’s almost six hours earlier, and we briefly check in with psychiatrist Isaac Taylor and Christine during a therapy session, one which the patient does not seem to be taking particularly seriously, judging by her sly Gloria Gaynor impression. Both seem to open up a little but the key moment comes when Isaac is called away and Christine, to her horror, discovers he has been taping their sessions on his laptop. If there was any doubt that Patrick Barker was guilty, we see him patiently scrubbing at a stain on a door and trying to reassure his girlfriend – Sally, he calls her – that there was no other way to avoid what happened. Shortly afterwards and he’s sitting across the interrogation table from Gabriel looking plausibly distraught, having been informed of his wife’s death. As with all the acid murders, the face and fingertips had been burned off, but Rebecca had been promptly identified by the serial number on her breast implants. Both Gabriel and Shepard suspect there’s more to Barker than meets the eye, but they get diverted by the news that Hannah has bunked off school. After a confrontational trip to her tearaway pal Cassie’s flat, Gabriel hears that Hannah knows about his affair. But is he hiding something else? Spool back 12 hours and a bloodstained Patrick is preparing to send Sally out in disguise so Brian the concierge can corroborate their story. There is a brief cut to the Markham family home, where we witness Hannah hearing her parents having a fight, which seems like a rather convenient way for her to find out about Gabriel’s affair. Unaware of how bad his day is going to get, Gabriel is called to the latest murder scene, where the sloppiness of the acid burns bothers him. “That’s the part the killer takes time over,” he muses. Shepard suggests it might be a copycat. The last rewind is another 13 hours to poor Rebecca and her little lapdog returning home early from a business trip to discover Patrick having sex with Sally. It’s only then that we discover that Patrick has seduced the daughter he apparently raised as his own. In a panicked fury, Sally kills her mother before she can reveal the affair. In the shellshocked aftermath, Patrick comes up with his grisly plan: to pin the murder on the acid killer … Press play So how does this eventful 36 hours look when viewed forwards? Patrick and Sally kill Rebecca after she discovers them in bed. The next morning, Sally pretends to be Rebecca while Patrick dumps her mutilated body in a park. Hannah Markham learns about her father’s affair and skips school. Gabriel and Shepard investigate the latest acid killer crime scene but tacitly agree that the latest body might be the work of a copycat. Patrick is pulled in to the station to be informed of his wife’s murder and is held under vague pretences late into the night. But instead of focusing on the case, Gabriel is tearing up London’s illegal rave scene looking for his missing daughter. He and Shepard find Hannah, while Patrick and Sally are burning all the incriminating evidence. And since we didn’t hear about any of this in the first two episodes, it looks as if they’ve got away with it. Notes and observations • There haven’t been many gags in Rellik but Brian whiling away his night shifts by using his smartphone to dictate a racy novel – imagining a heroic concierge’s encounter with a “fulsome bosom” – was a nice change of pace: “Love had placed him on a different spiritual plane …” • Another funny, if cruel line, was the hipster DJ’s response to scarred Gabriel’s aggressive line of questioning about his daughter’s whereabouts: “You’re a long way from Mordor, ain’t ya?” • This week’s cop shop B-plot involved an escalating prank war between detective constables Sam and Andrea that, in reverse chronology, kicked off with the horrific, context-free sight of a slaughtered pig oozing blood all over a living room. A cheap shock, but an effective one. • There was one last big fright in the final moments of the episode: who was the hooded figure ominously surveilling Gabriel in his kitchen?

The NBA great LeBron James also slammed Trump, telling reporters: “The people run this country, not one individual. And damn sure not him.” On Sunday, about 200 players sat or kneeled in a show of defiance against Trump, while others locked arms or raised fists. A few teams stayed off the field as The Star-Spangled Banner played. In a call with reporters, Lockhart, a former spokesman for Bill Clinton, said players were attempting to advance equality. “This is about going from protest to progress,” he said, noting that since the then San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began kneeling during the anthem, many players have become involved in community work and promoting criminal justice reform. In one NFL locker room on Sunday, the Miami Dolphins safety Michael Thomas discussed Trump: “It just amazes me that with everything else that’s going on in this world, that’s what you concerned about? You’re the leader of the free world and this is what you’re talking about? “As a man, as a father, as an African American man, someone in the NFL, one of those ‘sons of bitches’, you know, yeah, I take it personally. But at the same time it’s bigger than me, man.” Thomas’s use of “sons of bitches” referred to Trump’s remarks at a rally in Alabama on Friday: “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now’.” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, repeatedly insisted the president’s message was a matter of “patriotism”. “I think that it’s always appropriate for the president of the United States to defend our flag, to defend the national anthem, and to defend the men and women who fought and died to defend it,” Sanders said at the daily White House press briefing. Trump ignited anger among owners who donated to his campaign, close friend Robert Kraft among them. Tom Brady, quarterback for Kraft’s Super Bowl-champion New England Patriots who has himself come under fire over his friendship with Trump, said the comments were “just divisive”. Speaking on WEEI’s Kirk and Callahan radio show, Brady – who did not kneel but locked arms with team-mates before facing the Houston Texans – said: “I think everyone has a right to do whatever they want to do. If you don’t agree with it, that’s fine, you can voice your disagreement. I think that’s great. It’s part of our democracy, as long as it’s done in a peaceful, respectful way. That’s what this country has been all about.” Trump was undeterred, tweeting: “The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race. It is about respect for our country, flag and national anthem. NFL must respect this!” The president’s comments were nonetheless seen as directed at black players. Kaepernick, who is African American, began his protest to draw attention to fatal police shootings of unarmed black men. He remains unemployed, in what critics say is a league-wide block based on his political views. At a press conference on Monday, James said: “I wish I owned an NFL team right now. I’d sign him today.” James, who endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016, thrust himself into the debate on Saturday when Trump went after basketball star Stephen Curry, rescinding a White House invitation to the NBA-champion Golden State Warriors. That prompted criticism and rebuke from black athletes including James, who called the president a “bum”. James went further on Monday. “He doesn’t understand how many kids, no matter the race, look up to the president of the United States for guidance, for leadership, for words of encouragement,” he said. “That’s what makes me more sick than anything. It’s the most powerful position in the world, and we are at a time where the most powerful position in the world has an opportunity to bring us closer together as a people, and inspire the youth, and put the youth at ease, saying that it’s OK for me to walk down the street and not be judged because of the color of my skin or because of my race. “And he has no recollection of that. He doesn’t even care.” Speaking from the White House podium, Sanders denied that Trump’s comments singled out black athletes: “The president is not talking about race; the president is talking about pride in our country.” She struggled, however, when asked why Trump was willing to see nuance behind the white supremacists who marched in Charlottesville last month, resulting in violent clashes that left one counter-protester dead, but not in black athletes taking a knee to draw attention to criminal justice. “I think if the debate is really for them about police brutality, they should probably protest the officers on the field who are protecting them instead of the American flag,” Sanders said. Sanders also refused to engage with why Trump felt the ranks of white supremacists protesting in Charlottesville included “very fine people” while the athletes protesting during the national anthem were “sons of bitches”. “I think you are trying to conflate different things here,” Sanders told ABC News’s Cecilia Vega. “Look, we certainly respect the rights that people have, but we also need to focus,” she added. “This isn’t about the president being against something … this is about the president being for something.” Lockhart of the NFL stopped short of saying whether Trump was racially motivated. “The president knows what’s in his heart,” he said. “The president has chosen his form of dialogue, which is Twitter and statements that I’m not sure a sensible review of the facts would support. If the president wants to engage … he knows our number.” Trump did draw the support of several team owners in Nascar, who agreed with the suggestion that protesters should be fired. “It’ll get you a ride on a Greyhound bus,” said one, Richard Childress. “Anybody that works for me should respect the country we live in. So many people gave their lives for it. This is America.” Trump tweeted: “So proud of Nascar and its supporters and fans. They won’t put up with disrespecting our country or our flag – they said it loud and clear!” The next arena for protests will be the Monday night NFL game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Arizona Cardinals, in Phoenix. The high-profile NBA pre-season starts on Saturday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/25/german-election-has-redefined-narrative-of-european-party-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T13:47:57Z","webTitle":"German election has redefined narrative of European party politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/25/german-election-has-redefined-narrative-of-european-party-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/25/german-election-has-redefined-narrative-of-european-party-politics","fields":{"headline":"German election has redefined narrative of European party politics","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"After the Brexit vote in Britain and Donald Trump’s rise to power in the US, pundits predicted that a wind of populist, anxious, resentful, anti-politics-as-usual change would sweep across Europe. Like a series of dominoes, the governments of the Netherlands and France – and possibly, if rather more implausibly, even Germany – would fall to the Eurosceptic forces of Geert Wilders, Marine Le Pen and Frauke Petry. The heavy defeats of Wilders’ Freedom party and Le Pen’s Front National (now in deep crisis) in elections this year ended that narrative and swung the momentum the other way: in Europe, or at least western Europe, populism was dead. The 13% share and third-place finish of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) in Germany’s federal elections are a reminder that both narratives are flawed. Populism in Europe is here to stay – but evidently can be beaten. Even Germany, with the weight of its history, is not immune. The context of its vote was, though, particular: it took place barely two years after chancellor Angela Merkel’s humane but politically risky decision to open the country’s borders to more than a million refugees and migrants. Nearly 90% of AfD voters, who came from all of Germany’s established parties and none (35% did not vote in the 2013 election), said they wanted stronger borders and felt Merkel’s migrant policy ignored people’s concerns. One of a string of populist parties across the European Union claiming to be “the voice of the people” abandoned by a supposedly corrupt, unaccountable elite, the AfD would have struggled to clear 5% in national polls without that decision. But populist parties have successfully harnessed the broader fears and resentments of discontented voters across the EU, and are generally performing better in elections now than at any time since the second world war. There is no reason to think they will go away any time soon. The illiberal governments of Poland and Hungary, with their attacks on the independence of the media and judiciary and steady erosion of democratic checks and balances, show what happens when populists run the country. In Norway, the populist, anti-immigration Progress party is a junior coalition partner again after elections in which it won with just over 15% of the vote. Populist parties are also in governments in Finland, Hungary and Slovakia. Austria’s populist Freedom party is polling at 24% before elections on 15 October, on course to join a government led by the centre-right People’s party – successfully rebranded the New People’s party by its 31-year-old leader, Sebastian Kurz. But as events in the Netherlands, France and Germany showed, populist parties – even when they have polled at or near 20%, as the PVV, Front National and AfD did during their respective campaigns – can be beaten back. All ended up winning around 13% of the vote. And even if, like the AfD, they make a significant electoral breakthrough, they are not predestined for government. If your support is based mainly on opposition, it has a ceiling. Populist parties also collapse more readily than others into infighting and factionalism – as the AfD appears already to be doing. Nonetheless, as the Dutch political scientist and expert on populism Cas Mudde remarks, in an electoral landscape increasingly fragmented by the decline of traditional mainstream parties and the rise of new alternatives, populist parties, even if they win 10-15% of the vote, can still wield considerable influence. In recent years populist parties have won an average of 20% of the vote, often split between two or more parties, in elections in many European countries, Mudde notes: unprecedented since the war, but far from being a majority. “Populists tend to ask the right questions but give the wrong answers,” Mudde says. “They force issues on to the agenda that mainstream parties have ignored.” Liberal parties will have to start treating them like regular parties, he says. “You fight populists not by ignoring them, demonising them or adopting their agendas, but by clearly addressing all the issues – including the ones they care about – on the basis of your own ideology. By making a positive, clear and convincing ideological case.” • This article was amended on 27 September 2017. An earlier version said Progress won 16% of the vote. This has been corrected to say just over 15%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"teacher-network/2017/sep/25/into-film-awards-entries-open-for-young-film-makers-and-their-teachers","type":"article","sectionId":"teacher-network","sectionName":"Teacher Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T11:15:43Z","webTitle":"Into Film Awards: entries open for young film-makers and their teachers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2017/sep/25/into-film-awards-entries-open-for-young-film-makers-and-their-teachers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/teacher-network/2017/sep/25/into-film-awards-entries-open-for-young-film-makers-and-their-teachers","fields":{"headline":"Into Film Awards: entries open for young film-makers and their teachers","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Into Film Awards 2018 – celebrating achievements in film by young people and the work of those who teach them – are open to entries from schools across the UK. Run by charity Into Film, with the support of partners the Guardian Teacher Network and NATE, the awards invite schools to champion their best film-makers, reviewers, film clubs, and teachers using film for learning. Into Film works with schools across the UK to make more of film as a tool for education through clubs, cinema screenings, resources and training to support classroom teaching. Categories include live action, documentary, animation and educator of the year. Some of the winners of the 2017 awards were The Magic Pencil (best animation 12 and under), a comedy about a girl who finds a pencil that does all her schoolwork for her; My Not So Ordinary Life (best live action 13 and over), about life with autism; and the Lost Station (best documentary 12 and under), looking at the historical influence of a train station on a town in Cumbria. A full list of last year’s winners can be found on the Into Film Awards website. Last year’s educator of the year was Nic Williams, a teacher at Blue Bell Hill primary school in Nottingham, who was praised for his hard work helping children and their families get the best out of the school’s film sessions. “We use film to encourage a love of learning,” he says, “whether that’s through film club, writing reviews, watching and discussing a film in the classroom, or through our family learning, which brings adults and children together with film and uses that to develop conversation and family reviews. We’ve seen a real difference – if you can get a child to love learning then everything grows.” The closing date for entries is 31 January 2018, and winners will be announced at a red-carpet event in London in March. For information on how to enter, and to access film-making tips and resources, visit the Into Film website. The categories are as follows: The film-making awards There are three film-making categories across age groups and genres. Films may be made with professional equipment cameras, or shot on a mobile phone – judges will be looking for creativity and original thought. The subcategories include: Best animation 12 and under Best animation 13 and over Best live action 12 and under Best live action 13 and over Best documentary five to 19 Ones to watch This category honours three young people aged 13 to 19 who have demonstrated exceptional talent and ambition in any aspect of the film-making process.

Uber’s London licence expires on 30 September, although it will continue to run taxis while it pursues a legal appeal process that could last a year. TfL said last week Uber was not a “fit and proper” private car-hire operator and cited four areas of concern, including its approach to reporting criminal offences and carrying out background checks on drivers. But sources close to TfL indicated that a change of conduct from the taxi firm, the culture of which is being reformed by its new chief executive, could leave the door open to a fresh licence application. Dara Khosrowshahi, who succeeded Uber founder Travis Kalanick as CEO a month ago, wrote in an open letter: “While Uber has revolutionised the way people move in cities around the world, it’s equally true that we’ve got things wrong along the way. On behalf of everyone at Uber globally, I apologise for the mistakes we’ve made. “We will appeal [against] the decision on behalf of millions of Londoners, but we do so with the knowledge that we must also change.” Sadiq Khan, the London mayor and chair of TfL, said he welcomed Khosrowshahi’s apology. “Obviously I am pleased that he has acknowledged the issues that Uber faces in London,” Khan said. “Even though there is a legal process in place, I have asked TfL to make themselves available to meet with him.” However, another Uber executive told the BBC on Monday he company did not understand the concerns of London’s transport regulator. Fred Jones, an executive at Uber’s UK operation, said: “Sitting down with TfL representatives as soon as possible would be the most helpful thing to really understand their concerns, to work out what they are. It is just not clear to us what those concerns are.” When asked why Uber does not report criminal offences directly to the police and instead notifies TfL, which lengthens the investigative process, Jones said: “We follow the rules.” Referring to one specific incident involving an Uber driver who sexually assaulted a passenger, he said: “We hold our hands up, we made a mistake. In that incident we just didn’t realise when that passenger wrote in how serious it was ... We apologise to everyone involved.” The Uber driver involved stayed on the company’s books and went on to commit another, more serious, attack. Jones defended Uber’s usual practice of notifying TfL of criminal offences. “As soon as we receive a serious complaint or we are alerted of it, we restrict the access to the app and immediately investigate and that would involve notifying TfL.” He added that Uber had set up a working group. “This is absolutely something we will work on with the police. This is absolutely an area where we want to go further.” Khan said Uber had brought “unfair pressure” on TfL, employing an “army” of PR experts and lawyers. The mayor said: “I want companies that abide by the rules, I want companies that innovate, harbour new technologies, I want disruptive technology coming to London but you’ve got to play by the rules.” In a separate dispute, Uber will on Wednesday challenge a tribunal ruling over the employment status of its drivers, which lawyers say is also a public safety issue. Uber is attempting to overturn a landmark ruling that its drivers are workers, with rights to paid holiday and the minimum wage. Lawyers representing the original claimants, James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, said Uber was deliberately “kicking the can down the road” and had so far ignored the ruling from October last year. Paul Jennings, of Bates Wells Braithwate, said: “At the heart of this is safety. Imagine if it was bus or train drivers who couldn’t take a paid holiday. Given the numbers involved and the nature of this work, there is a real risk.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/sep/25/county-cricket-final-round-essex-v-yorkshire-somerset-v-middlesex-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T19:25:57Z","webTitle":"Middlesex unhappy with pitch as Somerset strike back in basement battle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/sep/25/county-cricket-final-round-essex-v-yorkshire-somerset-v-middlesex-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/sep/25/county-cricket-final-round-essex-v-yorkshire-somerset-v-middlesex-live","fields":{"headline":"Middlesex unhappy with pitch as Somerset strike back in basement battle","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When Middlesex bowled out Somerset for 236, the jigsaw at the foot of Division One began to fall into place. Yorkshire were safe and Middlesex would be, too, should they score 250 in their first innings or avoid defeat at Somerset. Hampshire, who lost the first day at Edgbaston to rain, need eight points against Warwickshire to secure survival. The trouble for Middlesex is that they lost their top three for five runs and by stumps were 18 for three on a pitch turning aggressively enough for Jack Leach – who dismissed Stevie Eskinazi and Sam Robson – to open the bowling for Somerset. With Middlesex privately furious about the heavily spinning surface served up for them, the deliberations of the cricket liaison officer running the match, Wayne Noon, could prove fascinating and vital. Somerset, having won an important toss, had looked set for more than the single batting point they managed but, sparked by the wickets of James Hildreth and Roelof van der Merwe in successive balls from the left-arm spinner Ravi Patel (who finished with career-best figures of seven for 81), they lost their last six wickets for 30. The three points Yorkshire picked up for bowling out Essex for 227 (at which point bad light prevented further play) secured their Division One status, which their head coach, Andrew Gale, described as “obviously pleasing after the situation we’ve been in, but also frustrating that we’ve found ourselves there”. Both sides seemed happy enough with their day’s work. Essex, having been put in, had battled back from 80 for five through punchy innings from Ryan ten Doeschate, James Foster and Simon Harmer, who made a freewheeling maiden half-century. For Yorkshire, who were not always consistent on a helpful surface, there were three wickets each for Jack Brooks and Steve Patterson. The gulf in prize money for second (£240,000) and third (£115,000) place was on show as Surrey declared on 201 for eight to prevent Lancashire picking up a third bowling point. Given nine overs before stumps, Lancashire – who will soon announce the signing of Durham’s Graham Onions, who has said he is leaving – reached 17 without loss. Kumar Sangakkara, in his final first-class match, had earlier been caught hooking for 14, one of a career‑best four for 50 for Saqib Mahmood, while the leg-spinner Matt Parkinson, 20, found big turn and took two for 42. In the Division Two promotion race, the late runners Northamptonshire were denied any play by rain at Leicestershire, while Worcestershire managed only 26 overs against Durham. Worcestershire are 90 for three, with Joe Clarke unbeaten on 46. There was more play at Hove, where an unbeaten stand of 123 between Sussex’s Delray Rawlins and Michael Burgess held up Nottinghamshire. Time to sign off. Thanks very much for your company, it’s been a joy once more. Just three more days to go! Here’s the scores on the doors: Division One: Middlesex 18-3 v Somerset 236 Essex 227 v Yorkshire Lancashire 17-0 v Surrey 201-8d No play yet between Warwickshire and Hampshire Division Two: Sussex 230-5 v Nottinghamshire Worcestershire 90-3 v Durham Glamorgan 18-1 v Kent 302 Derbyshire 104-2 v Gloucestershire No play yet between Northants and Leicestershire Speak in the morning! Until then... And Lancs are 17 for none at stumps having battled through nine overs. Well done them. Into the last over of the day at Old Trafford. Lancs 17 without loss. Interesting stuff from Taunton... Possibly, but surely not. Surrey could easily say they thought this evening was a great time to bowl. Happened lots in day-night matches so don’t think this is too different. Just 25 overs possible at New Road. Worcestershire 90 for three against Durham, with Joe Clarke 46 from 46. Surrey not made the breakthrough yet; Lancs are 12 without loss with four overs remaining. So Surrey declared on 201 for eight declared! Lots of money at stake between second and third! Stumps at Chelmsford! So that must be stumps here. Everyone heading for the Pavilion, and more covers coming out. Looking very much like stumps here too.. Stumps at Taunton! Middlesex 18 for three... Covers coming on at Chelmsford. Essex 227 all out! Porter holes out to Carver. How many of the remaining 12 overs will we see? Umpires having a chat. Middlesex three down! Robson gone to Leach. 5 for 3. Oh my. Harmer out! He made a belting 64 but is lbw to Carver. Essex 222 for nine. Middlesex four for two! Eskinazi gone to Leach, who opened... Harmer has a 50, and this is a great fightback from Essex. From 80-5, they are 208-8. Middlesex, though, are 1 for 1 after Compo got a duck. Right, so Somerset’s one batting point means this: Yorkshire are safe Middlesex need 250 Hampshire need 8 points v Warwickshire 200 up for Essex! Grievous has 42... What a knock from Joe Denly! He has 150, and Kent are 294-8. FYI. Somerset 236 all out! Middlesex, provided they don’t fancy a naughty declaration five down, need 250 for safety. Ravi Patel took seven for 81! That, unsurprisingly, is a career best. Yorkshire, therefore, are safe... Play back underway. Essex 185 for eight. Here come the umpires at Chelmsford! As Martin Ibbotson points out, if Somerset don’t get 300 - or even 250 - Middlesex could simply declare for whatever they are two down for, and know they are safe. How naughty do they feel? Somerset are nine down! Patel has his sixth, Leach - who may be looking forward to a bowl. 230 for nine... Yorkshire praying they don’t manage 20 more. Well it’s barely raining here, but we are off the field. Bit frustrating. Somerset have edged their way to 230 for eight. Eight down! Bess gone for a duck. Patel has 5, btw. Coverton gone! 214 for seven. If they don’t get 250, Yorkshire are safe. Patel gets Roloef first ball and it’s 206 for six! Two bowling points for Middlesex... Hildreth goes reverse sweeping Ravi Patel and Somerset are 205 for five! And Somerset have a batting point! And we are going off for a bit of rain at Taunton, and that's tea. 184-8. Oh dear. Back on at Old Trafford and Taunton. Off for the day at Grace Road. Wagner’s fun is over, toe-ending Brooks to mid-on. 183 for seven. Looked a belting player against England u19s in the summer. Karl Carver is on! 177 for seven. Six! Wagner picks one up off his feet and smacks Coad into the newly named Doug Insole Pavilion. 175 for seven. So, tea at Taunton and Somerset are 193 for four. Huge session coming up in that match. Stumps at Edgbaston! No idea if that’s good or bad for Hampshire. Westley has had a precautionary x-ray on his right thumb. Hearing it’s not broken... 156 for seven. Joe Denly has a century, and it's his magnificent effort that has carried Kent to 201 for six. Sussex 100 for four, as Mullaney gets Hutton. And Worcestershire are 15 for two. Bit going on in the promotion race. Oh no. Ten Doeschate caught behind pushing forward to Patterson! Essex need Wagner to do the business once more. 142-7. Abell run out! Somerset 175-4. Bad time for a collapse. Foster smacked Patterson down the ground for four but goes next ball, holing out at cow. Stand 55, Yorkshire have a second bowling point. And now they are off for bad light at Old Trafford. Foster andrew Tendo have put on 50! That's the Essex story this year. And Worcestershire are 10-1. Mitchell gone, to Rushworth. Few yarns in that dismissal. Surrey 112-5 as Parry gets Foakes! Saqib Mahmood has a third! Borthwick gone for 30, and Surrey 110 for four. Notts have a point! They need 11 more... Sussex are 61 for three. Bartlett gone at Taunton! Patel’s second. 139-3... Sanga is out! Mahmood with the wicket, and Surrey are 80 for five! Oh my goodness. Anyone seen this filth? Kent are 127 for six, but have the advantage of still having Joe Denly there. He’s got 49. Have a look at this. So they are on at Hove, and Sussex are 30 for one. Trescothick is gone to Patel, Somerset are 118 for two, and this is in play. 2pm start at New Road. And Surrey are 72-2 at lunch. Parkinson got Stoneman in his first over. Lunch! Essex 84 for five. Sanga is in, and has 13 from eight! Surrey 72-2. Five down! Ravi lbw to Brooks. Three in three overs - 80-5. Wicket! Browne bowled through the gate by Coad, and its 80-4! Good question! Anyone? Wicket! Brooks returns, and gets Lawrence leg before. Yorkshire have a point! 74 for 3. Wicket and lunch at Taunton! Stirling gets Byron, and Somerset are 93-1. Here’s the Westley wicket. First wicket down at Old Trafford, as Burns goes to Saqi Mahmood. Surrey 47-1. Wicket! Westley gone, and hes in some pain. Gloved to second slip, ran from the field... Broken thumb I reckon. 63-2... What a start for Somerset! 67-0. Chopra has looked in great touch - he hit Patterson out of the ground - but he is gone! Caught second slip. It's 41-1. Read Gary Naylor’s talking points! Essex are 28-0 after eight overs. Looking steady, and Patto is on early. And now Billings is gone. Kent 39-4. Well Sam Billings has moved to 18 of 12 and Kent are 38 for three... Kent 21-3 as Northeast goes! Few changes at Old Trafford for Lancs. Hameed, who has had an op, is obviously out. Mahmood and Parry in too. Surrey have Borthwick back for Ryan Patel. Lancashire: Davies (w), Jones, Livingstone, Vilas, Chanderpaul, Croft (c), McLaren, Mahmood, Parry, Bailey, Parkinson Surrey: Burns, Stoneman, Borthwick, Sangakkara, Foakes (w), Pope, S.Curran, Clarke, Batty (c), Meaker, Dernbach Well, Varun Chopra has leaned into cover-drives with the first two balls of the match. Two, then four. Lancashire are fielding first against Surrey... Teams here, then. Four minutes away from the start. Essex batting first, without a toss. They are unchanged, while Yorkshire have left Bresnan out for Carver. Essex: Chopra, Browne, Westley, Lawrence, Bopara, Tendo, Foster, Harmer, Wagner, Porter, Cook Yorkshire: Lyth, Brathwaite, Lees, Ballance, Leaning, Hodd, Patterson, Fisher, Brooks, Coad, Carver So Kent are one down! DBD out, and now Dickson gone, to Hogan. 14 for 2. Well unsurprisingly Essex will bat first here. So the covers being drawn back and I suspect, with low clouds about, there won’t be a toss. But Ballance and Tendo will come together for a chat. That looks very dark. Right, they are getting going down at Taunton! Big news. He’s off to Lancs, I believe. Kent have won the toss and are batting against Glamorgan. Not a pretty scene at Grace Road, where it’s might wet. A bit on prize money. Essex have obviously sewn up the really important bit, but there’s plenty for Surrey and Lancs to play for. Second place shares £240,000, and third £115,000. The winners of Division Two gets £120,000, and the runner-up £57,000. Me too! I have three transfers and - criminally - five skipper changes to make. I’m in disarray! I normally do a teams and tosses tab, but we haven’t had many of them, so I’ll leave it for a little while. Covers being slipped back on at Chelmsford... We are having a toss at 10.30 here at Chelsmford. And there’s one at 10.20 at Old Trafford. Delayed start at Edgbaston too... Morning Stuie! Teams from Taunton, where Somerset have won the toss and will bat first! Somerset: Trescothick, Byrom, Bartlett, Hildreth, Abell*, Davies+, RvdM, Coverton, Bess, Leach, Groenewald Middlesex: Robson, Compton, Eskinazi, Malan, Voges*, Stirling, Simpson+, Harris, Finn, Murtagh, Patel Bit of gentle sass in this... Delayed start at Old Trafford and Hove too... There's a bit of moaning over a very used pitch at Taunton. Anyway, Somerset have won the toss and will bat... Well we have a delayed start here at Chelmsford. The covers are off and the umpires are having a look. Warm ups beginning. Good morning, happy Monday – it’s an even greyer one than usual – and welcome to the final week of the season on County Cricket – live! I’m Will Macpherson and I’m here to guide you through the action from Chelmsford (the weather isn’t great) where the Champions, Essex, meet the not-quite-safe-former-champions Yorkshire. Hopefully we will have Vic Marks at Taunton on all the other days, but not today. I’ll keep you abreast of developments there in his absence. The Taunton game is the real biggie. Somerset are 16 points behind Middlesex, who thrashed Lancs last week. So it’s do or die for Somerset. Win or bust. Even if they win and pick up fewer bonus points, they’re gone. The pitch will no doubt be absolutely jam-packed with spice. Hampshire, who are at Edgbaston, are also not safe. They need a high-scoring draw to guarantee their safety. Yorkshire need seven points. Oh it’s so confusing! In Division Two, the picture is a touch clearer. For promotion, Worcestershire need six points against Durham and Notts need 12 against Sussex. If either of those two things doesn’t happen, Northants – who are playing against Leicestershire – will come into the equation with a big win. Here’s our full fixture list. Division One: Essex v Yorkshire Lancashire v Surrey Somerset v Middlesex Warwickshire v Hampshire Division Two: Worcestershire v Durham Sussex v Nottinghamshire Leicestershire v Northamptonshire Kent v Glamorgan Gloucestershire v Derbyshire I sense that there’s a bit of weather about this morning. Why not pass the time by reading Vic pontificate on the Ashes touring party which will be announced on Wednesday. You can contact me! Below The Line (play nicely) By email: will.macpherson.freelance@theguardian.com On twitter: @willis_macp I greatly look forward to hearing from you. Team and toss news to follow, and I’ll try to keep you as clear on where we are promotion-and-relegation-wise as possible. All that leaves me to say, as ever, is enjoy the cricket. There’s not much left."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/26/marriage-equality-support-rebounds-and-yes-side-leads-in-voting-guardian-essential-poll","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T18:01:20Z","webTitle":"Marriage equality support rebounds and yes side leads in voting – Guardian Essential poll","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/26/marriage-equality-support-rebounds-and-yes-side-leads-in-voting-guardian-essential-poll","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/26/marriage-equality-support-rebounds-and-yes-side-leads-in-voting-guardian-essential-poll","fields":{"headline":"Marriage equality support rebounds and yes side leads in voting – Guardian Essential poll","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Support for marriage equality has rebounded and the yes side holds a decisive lead among Australians who have already voted in the postal survey, according to the Guardian Essential poll. The poll found that 58% of Australians support a change in the law to allow same-sex couples to marry, up three points from 55% last week, compared with 33% who oppose it and 9% who are undecided. More than one-third of Australians (36%) have already voted, with many more saying they will definitely vote (45%) or probably vote (8%). Among those who have already voted, 72% voted yes compared with 26% who voted no. Yes voters also outnumbered no voters in the “will definitely vote” category (57% to 39%) and “will probably vote” (43% to 35%). Among people who say they will not vote, 64% said they did not support same-sex marriage and just 13% said they did. The results of the poll, if replicated in the survey, would deliver a decisive win for marriage equality, although advocates have warned campaign efforts must be sustained until the 7 November deadline for votes to be received by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The Equality Campaign executive director, Tiernan Brady, said: “Undoubtedly these numbers are really good ... however, it is only a poll and we are in no way complacent.” “We know that the Australian people are for marriage equality and have been for many years but for that value to be reflected in the result of the survey everybody needs to vote.” The Guardian Essential poll found a majority of women (63%), men (52%) and even people over the age of 55 (54%) supported changing the law to allow same-sex couples to marry. Greens voters were the most likely to have already voted in the postal survey, with 49% already having done so, and 84% of Greens said they supported marriage equality, adding evidence that “hard yeses” had turned out early. The poll finds Labor and the Coalition tied on primary votes of 37% while Labor leads the Coalition 53% to 47% in two-party preferred terms, a slight increase from last week’s 52-48 result. The Greens are steady on 10%, the Nick Xenophon Team steady on 3% and One Nation dropped one point to 7%. The poll of 1,026 Australians has a margin of error of plus or minus 3%. Asked if they are concerned same-sex marriage may impact on religious freedoms, 35% were either very or somewhat concerned compared with 58% who were either not very or not at all concerned. Over the course of the campaign 24% said their concerns about religious freedom had increased, compared with 61% who said they had stayed the same and 5% who said their concerns had decreased. Brady said the “Australian people have seen through the misdirection and the white noise”. “They know it’s a straightforward question about a very simple matter: should lesbian and gay people be treated equally by the law of the land.” Some Australians reported holding religious beliefs in heaven and hell (40%), creationism (34%), and angels and demons (39%). Smaller but not insignificant numbers reported belief that climate change is a hoax (21%), vaccines cause autism (14%) and that vibrations from windfarms cause long-term health damage (16%). Australians are very sceptical of private health insurance, with 60% saying it is not worth the money you pay for it compared with 31% who said it is. Large majorities want the government to cap increases in premiums to inflation levels (82%) and to limit private health insurance companies profits if they want to increase fees (84%)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/28/fingerpicking-good-how-blues-guitarist-fiona-boyes-arrived-with-help-from-a-rubber-chicken","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T00:24:54Z","webTitle":"Fingerpicking good: how blues guitarist Fiona Boyes ‘arrived’ with help from a rubber chicken","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/28/fingerpicking-good-how-blues-guitarist-fiona-boyes-arrived-with-help-from-a-rubber-chicken","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/28/fingerpicking-good-how-blues-guitarist-fiona-boyes-arrived-with-help-from-a-rubber-chicken","fields":{"headline":"Fingerpicking good: how blues guitarist Fiona Boyes ‘arrived’ with help from a rubber chicken","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Fiona Boyes, one of the world’s best fingerpicking blues guitarists, had wanted to record an album with engineer and recording alchemist “Professor” Keith O Johnson for ages. She didn’t expect it would involve rubber chickens. Boyes, who was born in Mount Waverley in east Melbourne, had been asked by Reference Recordings, the renowned audiophile label co-founded by Johnson in the 1970s, if she wanted to record with him in the US at the famed Skywalker Sound studios. She jumped at the chance. “I walked in there being very formal and reverential, going into this hallowed studio with this revered engineer, and [Johnson] is running around with a squeaky chicken,” Boyes says. “He was running around this huge space with a squeaky rubber chicken that was dressed like Elvis, and I was like, ‘Um, this is not what I was expecting.’” The pair recorded 16 songs in two days. The result? That album, Professin’ the Blues, has just won best acoustic album for 2017 at the Blues Blast music awards in the US, making Boyes the only Australian to achieve the feat. Boyes didn’t learn to play guitar until her mid 20s but she has been on a winning streak ever since. She stormed on to the international stage in 2003 when she became the first woman and first non-American to win the International Blues Challenge, and has been recognised by American blues royalty as one of the best female fingerpickers since Memphis Minnie, who recorded from the 1920s to 50s. The Blues Hall of Fame pianist and singer Pinetop Perkins called Boyes “the best gal guitar player I heard in more than 35 years”. Her versatility means she’s impossible to categorise: she’ll jump from Louisiana swamp blues to driving classic Chicago sounds, rollicking New Orleans barrelhouse to wailing laments, and back again, in a 30-minute set. Boyes recently returned to Australia from an eight-week international tour, but she still wants to talk about Johnson. “He’s an audio genius,” she says. “We had three days in the studio but the first day was just Professor Keith setting up his equipment. “Then we recorded live. There was no monitor, no headphones, no ability to overdub, you just had to capture the performance.” Johnson’s methods might be unconventional but that only adds to the magic, she says. “He’s like the Wizard of Oz. He likes to use these toys and other strange things, like a mechanical music box, to tune the room, to get a sense of where the overtones are, and how the sounds sound.” Skywalker Sound studio itself, located on a California ranch once owned by the Star Wars director George Lucas, was built to record film soundtracks, which it still does. But Johnson used the cavernous space, which fits a symphony orchestra, to sit only Boyes and a couple of musicians. Then he captured all of their sounds from different positions in the room, quietly. “I’ve always preferred to record live in the studio … but this was like doing a live concert in a beautiful space,” she says. Conditions had to be “just right” to “capture the organic sounds” of the acoustic instruments, Boyes says. “The drummer and the double bass player had to play with a great deal of control … for the drums to be at the same acoustic level as an acoustic guitar. “That’s one of the nicest ways of capturing roots music.” Boyes says she didn’t hear the album until this year, even though she recorded it in February 2016. And when she received a special two-disc vinyl version in May, complete with her extensive liner notes, it felt as though she’d finally made it. “To see that on a proper gatefold vinyl album, it felt like I’d arrived,” she says, adding: “I haven’t been game to play it! I’ve taken it out of its package and stroked it lovingly, because it’s so exciting to see, there’s something intrinsically marvellous about holding vinyl, but I haven’t played it.” The critical reception to the album has delighted Boyes, who says the record captured a special moment in time for her. “I think it’s served the music well,” she says of Johnson’s collaboration. “He recorded this with a lot of the equipment he built himself. Even the cables. I mean, that was a whole trip.” • Fiona Boyes will be playing on Thursday 28 September at the Stag and Hunter Hotel in Newcastle, and on Friday 29 September at the Django Bar, Camelot Lounge, in Marrickville, Sydney. She will also appear at the Byron Bay Guitar Festival in November"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/25/john-mcdonnell-labour-members-didnt-want-to-split-party-on-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T17:02:57Z","webTitle":"Labour conference votes to back party’s official policy on Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/25/john-mcdonnell-labour-members-didnt-want-to-split-party-on-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/25/john-mcdonnell-labour-members-didnt-want-to-split-party-on-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Labour conference votes to back party’s official policy on Brexit","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Labour conference has voted to back the party’s official policy on Brexit, after its ruling body released an eleventh-hour motion to counter accusations the party was not allowing delegates a meaningful say. The national executive committee published the document after the party faced criticism from some of its own MPs for avoiding a vote on the UK’s membership of the single market. The one-and-a-half page statement deals with the UK’s future relationship with the EU by saying: “Labour is clear that we need tariff- and impediment-free trading relationship with the EU. Labour’s priority is an outcome that puts jobs, living standards and the economy first. “The precise institutional form of the new trading and customs relationship needs to be determined by negotiation. Labour will not support any future arrangements that see the introduction of a hard border or which restricts free movement between Ireland and the UK.” Pro-EU party members and MPs had hoped delegates would support their bid for a vote on more divisive issues, including free movement and permanent membership of the single market, which polls suggest have widespread support among members. But the party leadership was spared any potentially embarrassing split after members picked eight “contemporary motions” for debate and vote, including in areas such as social care, but not on Brexit, encouraged by the pro-Corbyn grassroots movement Momentum. Earlier, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, dismissed controversy over the decision to exclude Brexit from a series of debates, saying it was the decision of members, who wanted to “build a consensus” on the issue. He said Labour delegates had chosen instead to select debates on “bread and butter issues” such as health and housing, and did not wish to divide the party over Brexit. Speaking on BBC1’s Breakfast programme, McDonnell rejected the idea that the issue was being ignored. “I think you’ve got this wrong,” he said. “There will be a debate about Brexit, a very thorough one. Keir Starmer will be introducing it, there will be the normal report from the national executive committee, and if people want to vote on that they can. “But the way we organise conference now, the delegates themselves, no longer the leadership, decide on what motions they’ll debate, and that’s what the delegates have done. They’ve chosen other issues.” In his speech on Monday, Starmer trod a careful line on Labour’s position on the single market, saying the party in government would build “a new, progressive partnership with the EU” that mirrored single market benefits. “Options for achieving this should not be swept off the table,” he said. Starmer said remaining in a customs union in the EU was “a possible end destination for Labour” and said the party would be open-minded in its approach to the single market. “We are flexible as to whether the benefits of the single market are best retained by negotiating a new single market relationship or by working up from a bespoke trade deal,” he said. “No rash, ideological red lines preventing a sensible deal. Labour are now the grownups in the room.” Speaking later at an event with Labour’s MEPs, Starmer said he believed a Brexit deal could be achieved that would be as good as being in the EU. “I do not want to get in to the approach that says: ‘It will never be as good as it was on 23 June 2016,’” he said. “I fundamentally reject that, I think if we work hard we can do better than that. “I’ve got a six-year-old girl and a nine-year-old boy and I am not going to let them grow up with their dad saying to them: ‘It will never be as good as it was.’” McDonnell and the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, have kept a more ambiguous stance on the single market, arguing for continued membership during a transition period but committing only to seeking access to it once Brexit is complete. McDonnell argued that delegates had not chosen Brexit as a topic for a binding vote because they did not wish to split Labour over the issue, saying: “On Brexit, the interesting thing is people are trying to build a consensus now, and not divide the party. And also, what I think is interesting, build a consensus not just in our party but within our communities. I think that’s the nature of the decisions.” Momentum was thought to be highly influential in the result of the ballot because it emailed members to recommend four topics that were chosen. Asked about this, McDonnell said: “All the groups send round their advice to delegates on what they think should be the priorities to be debated, whether it’s Momentum or Labour First or Progress or whatever. “But it’s the delegates themselves that decide. This is the nature of our party now. We’re saying that it’s the rank-and-file membership who will take the decisions and control the agenda at conference, not the leadership any more.” Asked about his idea of maintaining some access to a “reformed” single market, including changes to freedom of movement, McDonnell said he hoped this would be possible. “We believe we can have a relationship with the single market that we think will overcome a lot of the perceived disbenefits that were highlighted during the referendum campaign, and gain and maintain a lot of the existing benefits. Again, that’s to be negotiated,” he said. On BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, McDonnell said it could not be guaranteed that Labour’s position on the single market would be finalised if there was an election in six months. “We’re building that answer now, but we’ve got to have consensus,” he said. “We can’t be in a situation where we try to impose a solution on the British people.” Labour was working as fast as it could to “define the new relationship we’ll have with EU”, he said, including consultations with business and communities. The goal was, he said, “a compromise within the community that brings us the benefits of the EU, as they are, and overcomes some of the disbenefits”. He added: “We think we can build a compromise and consensus, The country was split down the middle – we’ve got to try to bring the country back together again. We think we’re the only party that can do that.” The Labour London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said he wanted to see the UK remain permanently in the single market after Brexit. “I want us to continue to be members of the single market,” he told Today. “If we can’t achieve [this], the less best scenario is us having access to the single market.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/25/bank-of-england-warns-a-consumer-debt-crisis-could-cost-banks-30bn","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T11:52:18Z","webTitle":"Bank of England warns a consumer debt crisis could cost banks £30bn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/25/bank-of-england-warns-a-consumer-debt-crisis-could-cost-banks-30bn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/25/bank-of-england-warns-a-consumer-debt-crisis-could-cost-banks-30bn","fields":{"headline":"Bank of England warns a consumer debt crisis could cost banks £30bn","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Bank of England has issued its strongest warning yet about the UK’s ballooning consumer debt, saying Britain’s banks could incur £30bn of losses on their lending on credit cards, personal loans and for car finance if interest rates and unemployment rose sharply. After assessing the fast growth in the consumer credit market, Threadneedle Street is requiring the banking system to hold an extra £10bn of capital as protection against any future losses after finding that lenders are underestimating their exposure to bad debts in an economic downturn. Publishing its latest assessment of risks to the financial system, the Bank also spelled out specific concerns about the impact of Brexit on £20tn of derivatives contracts used by companies and financial firms to manage their risks. The UK’s withdrawal from the EU also raises questions about whether banks will be able to hold consumer data in Britain and the ability of insurance companies to make payments to consumers across the bloc. The Bank’s financial policy committee (FPC) – set up to look for risks to the financial system in the wake of the 2008 crisis – is requiring more capital to be held after being concerned of a “pocket of risk in the rapid growth of consumer credit”. It follows a warning in July by Alex Brazier, the Bank’s executive director of financial stability, of a “spiral of complacency” about a consumer credit market that was growing at 10% a year when household income had grown only 1.5%. The Bank had already told lenders to start amassing £11.4bn of extra capital in the next 18 months to protect against the rise in consumer debt. But it is now requiring them to hold another £10bn of capital after bringing forward stress tests of the UK’s lenders based on hypothetical scenarios of interest rates rising to 4% and unemployment reaching 9.5%. This found they would incur losses of £30bn over three years – about 20% of their consumer lending – and £10bn more than might have been expected after last year’s stress tests when Barclays and Lloyds incurred the largest losses from such lending. Shares in banks were knocked and Jasper Lawler, head of research at financial group LCG, said profits could be hit by the Bank sounding the alarm on rising debt levels. “Any restriction on lending, particularly unsecured lending like credit cards and car loans would be a direct hit to a big profit centre for banks and insurers,” said Lawler. Each lender will be told how much they are affected at the time of the annual stress tests in November while the smaller lenders – such as Virgin Money and Co-op Bank – which do not participate in the tests will also be assessed. “Today’s action goes further than the red-flag waving we’ve seen from the FPC up until now,” said Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics. But, she said it was unlikely to slow the economy or prevent interest rates being raised from their 0.25% historic low in November. While the Bank is not concerned that consumer debt will be a risk to economic growth as it is only 11% of household debt, it is a risk to lenders’ ability to withstand losses in a downturn as these loans are less likely to be repaid when consumers lose their jobs or face higher interest rates. But the charity StepChange said more needed to be done to help “millions of households trapped in spiralling persistent debt”. “Action is needed to stop products like credit cards and overdrafts walking people into difficulty, and lenders must do more to help people safely manage their way out of persistent debt,” said Mike O’Connor, chief executive of StepChange. Labour has proposed a cap on credit card rates, meaning people would not have to pay back more than twice the amount of their credit card borrowings, to try to help those customers with long-standing debts. With the £30bn of potential losses, credit cards would be most severely affected with a 25% default rate, with 15% for personal loans and 10% on car finance. Requiring lenders to hold more capital against consumer credit could lead to them pushing up interest rates or being more selective about their lending to cover their additional costs. Hannah Maundrell, editor-in-chief of financial website Money.co.uk, said the initial impact would be on lenders rather on borrowers. “It’s the highest financial power telling lenders they need to be careful and set aside an extra £10bn if they want to sail through Brexit unscathed,” she said. The Bank’s risk assessment also considers the impact of a hard Brexit – one with no deal when the UK leaves the EU in March 2019 – on the way that derivatives contracts are handled by the City and concludes tens of thousands of deals could be affected. This is a quarter of all contracts, for instance to protect against interest rates or oil prices increasing, that are not passed through clearing houses. For large dealers between 2,000 and 4,000 of their counterparties would need to be contacted to change the terms of contracts. The Bank warned “there are no precedents” for these types of changes to take place within the 18 months left before Brexit. Legislation could be needed to allow existing contracts to remain as they are – a process known as “grandfathering” – and only new ones are affected by the changes that are taking place. The Bank – which has seen each firm’s Brexit plans – said they also lack “robust contingency plans” to tackle changes to the way that they will be able to store consumer data in the UK after March 2019. “Many firms currently rely on data centres located in the United Kingdom to provide financial services across Europe,” the Bank said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/24/deliveroo-valuation-hits-2bn-after-food-delivery-firm-raises-new-funds","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T20:50:01Z","webTitle":"Deliveroo valuation hits £1.5bn after food delivery firm raises new funds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/24/deliveroo-valuation-hits-2bn-after-food-delivery-firm-raises-new-funds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/24/deliveroo-valuation-hits-2bn-after-food-delivery-firm-raises-new-funds","fields":{"headline":"Deliveroo valuation hits £1.5bn after food delivery firm raises new funds","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Deliveroo has achieved a valuation of more than $2bn (£1.5bn) after the British takeaway food delivery firm raised $385m in new funds. Deliveroo said the new funding brought the total it had raised since launching to $860m, with the latest round meaning the company has nearly doubled its value since its last fundraising in August 2016. In that funding round, the company raised $275m in a deal it said valued the business at about $1.1bn. The new funds have been earmarked to help the startup business expand into new cities and countries, to enlarge its technology team and to work with restaurants to develop delivery-only kitchens, the company said. Deliveroo currently operates in more than 150 cities across 12 countries and has about 30,000 riders on its books. Like the taxi app firm Uber, which was stripped of its London operating licence on Friday, Deliveroo has been criticised by unions, which say it is exploiting its workers by not offering basic protections and the minimum wage. The controversy around Deliveroo has centred on the employment status of its riders. The company argues the government should change the law either to allow additional rights for self-employed riders or to create a new category of employment. It claims that self-employed status gives both it and its staff flexibility. However, the Central Arbitration Committee – a government body that resolves workplace disputes – is investigating whether Deliveroo’s drivers are independent contractors or whether they should be classified as workers with rights to holiday pay, the national minimum wage and collective bargaining via a union. A group of 20 British riders is seeking compensation in a similar employment tribunal case. The new investment has also been unveiled just days after it emerged that the Deliveroo founder, Will Shu, handed himself a 22.5% pay rise last year. Shu, a former investment banker who set up Deliveroo from his London flat in 2013, increased his salary to £125,000 and handed out close to £4.5m in share bonuses to directors and hundreds of other head office staff, despite a 300%-plus increase in losses. The new funding for his company is being led by two US-based investment companies, T Rowe Price Associates and Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, which have previously backed technology startups such as Facebook, Airbnb and Tesla."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/24/catalan-campaigners-hand-out-million-independence-referendum-ballots","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T15:30:53Z","webTitle":"Catalan campaigners hand out a million referendum ballots","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/24/catalan-campaigners-hand-out-million-independence-referendum-ballots","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/24/catalan-campaigners-hand-out-million-independence-referendum-ballots","fields":{"headline":"Catalan campaigners hand out a million referendum ballots","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Catalan independence campaigners have held rallies across the region, distributing 1m ballot papers a week before people are due to vote in a sovereignty referendum that the Spanish government has vowed to stop. Thousands of people congregated in town squares around Catalonia on Sunday to show their support for the vote as tensions between the pro-independence regional government and the Spanish state continued to rise. Speaking at a rally in Barcelona, the president of the independence group Òmnium Cultural, Jordi Cuixart, said: “Here are the packs of ballots that we ask you to hand out across Catalonia.” Carme Forcadell, the speaker of the regional parliament, told a Barcelona crowd: “I ask you to go out and vote! Vote for the future of Catalonia!” The distribution of voting slips comes days after Spanish Guardia Civil officers raided regional government buildings, arrested 14 senior Catalan officials and seized almost 10m ballot papers. The Spanish government has also drafted in thousands more police officers and tightened its control over the region’s funding, while the constitutional court has announced that 24 referendum organisers will be fined between €6,000 and €12,000 (£5,300-£10,600) a day until they abandon preparations for the vote. The raids and arrests brought 40,000 people on to the streets of Barcelona in protest on Wednesday night. Although the demonstrations were largely peaceful, there were scuffles and two Guardia Civil vehicles were attacked. A chief prosecutor later asked the national court to consider investigating the demonstrators for sedition. The Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has repeatedly said that the 1 October referendum – which the central government insists is illegal and unconstitutional – will not take place, and the legislation underpinning the vote has already been suspended by Spain’s constitutional court. However, the Catalan regional president, Carles Puigdemont, has refused to back down and has said the Spanish government is acting “beyond the limits of a respectable democracy”. On Saturday, the Catalan government accused Madrid of trying to take control of the region’s police force, the Mossos d’Esquadra, after the Spanish interior ministry said it would coordinate the policing operations intended to prevent the referendum. A spokesman for the ministry told the Associated Press that Catalonia’s chief prosecutor had informed the heads of the national police, the Guardia Civil and the Mossos that the ministry would oversee the operation “in light of what happened last week”. The ministry denied suggestions that it was taking command of the Mossos, with an official telling AFP the move was “simply to agree on a means of coordination”. But Joaquim Forn, the Catalan interior minister and the civilian head of the Mossos, called the measure unacceptable, adding: “We denounce the attempt by the state to intervene in the police forces of Catalonia.” The Mossos tweeted a statement, which read: “We’ll continue working as we have until now. We will exercise our powers to guarantee security and public order and be at the service of citizens.” Rajoy made another call for organisers to abandon their referendum over the weekend, saying: “It would be sensible, reasonable and democratic to stop and say there won’t be a referendum, which they know won’t happen.” Pedro Sánchez, the leader of the Socialist party, also urged the Catalan government to stop the vote. “The [regional] government’s headlong rush will only bring frustration and division,” he told La Vanguardia on Sunday. “I’m once again asking President Puigdemont to call off a vote that doesn’t possess the necessary democratic guarantees to constitute a referendum. Doing so would go a long way in the search for a political solution.” The anti-austerity party Podemos called on Sánchez to join it in trying to remove Rajoy from office so that a referendum could be negotiated between the governments in Madrid and Barcelona. “We need a government of democratic and plurinational unity that will organise a referendum in Catalonia, negotiate it and bring about a dialogue that gives a prominent role to the people, towns and nations that make up Spain,” the Podemos leader, Pablo Iglesias, told a meeting of local and national politicians in Zaragoza on Sunday. The event was picketed by a crowd of far-right protesters and a bottle thrown at Violeta Barba, the speaker of the Aragon parliament. Puigdemont has argued that the Spanish government’s response was proving massively counterproductive. “A lot of people are angry about the democratic abuses that have been committed by the Spanish government,” he said on Friday. “We’re seeing a reaction – and people taking to the streets with pots and pans – in areas where the independence movement isn’t supposed to exist.” Polls suggest that while Catalans are almost evenly split over the issue of independence, the overwhelming majority of the region’s 7.5 million people would like the matter put to a vote. A survey for El País this week found that 82% are in favour of a legal and mutually agreed referendum. If next Sunday’s poll goes ahead, Catalans will be asked: “Do you want Catalonia to be an independent country in the form of a republic?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/life-and-physics/2017/sep/24/uk-invests-65m-in-deep-underground-neutrino-experiment-in-us","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T11:37:58Z","webTitle":"UK invests £65m in Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment in US","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2017/sep/24/uk-invests-65m-in-deep-underground-neutrino-experiment-in-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/life-and-physics/2017/sep/24/uk-invests-65m-in-deep-underground-neutrino-experiment-in-us","fields":{"headline":"UK invests £65m in Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment in US","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"DUNE is one of the better particle physics acronyms. The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment involves a large, sensitive detector which will indeed be deep underground - in the Sanford Lab at the Homestake goldmine in South Dakota – and will study neutrinos produced from a high-intensity beam of protons at Fermilab in Illinois. UK scientists from several universities are already deeply involved in the experiment, and Cambridge’s Prof. Mark Thomson is one of the two spokespeople who lead the experiment internationally. The science of neutrinos is fascinating, with wide implications for our understanding of the universe and how it operates. Neutrinos are produced copiously in the Sun, and are the second most abundant particle in the universe. In the original conception of the “Standard Model” of particle physics, they were taken to be massless. The discovery that they actually have a - very tiny but non-zero - mass remains the only major modification forced upon the Standard Model since it was established. Fittingly, the first measurement leading to that discovery took place in the Homestake mine, which will now be reoccupied by one of the DUNE detectors. A goldmine in more than one sense. The fact that neutrinos have mass has important implications. It affects their role in how large scale structures – galaxy clusters – formed in the universe after the Big Bang, for example. It may also have a profound impact upon why the universe is made of matter not anti-matter. Most of the laws of physics are unbiased between matter and anti-matter. This means that equal amounts of the two should have been produced in the Big Bang, so where all the antimatter has gone is a bit of a mystery . Non-zero neutrino masses allow a quantum mixing between different types of neutrino, and this mixing could allow differences between their matter and anti-matter interactions. That in turn may go some way toward explaining the mystery of the missing antimatter. Seeing whether that is the case is one of the major goals of DUNE, as well as of other neutrino experiments around the world, including the proposed HyperKamiokande experiment in Japan. The UK has a long-standing particle-physics partnership with the US, including the current Noνa neutrino experiment and precision muon experiments. There is significant support for the programme via CERN as well, something established in response to the European Strategy for Particle Physics. Prof. Christos Touramanis at the University of Liverpool is co-leader of the large-scale DUNE prototype activities at CERN. Particle physics is a complex international endeavour; not only do the experiments address deep questions, the international pooling of expertise enables big leaps forward in technology. On signing, the UK Science Minister, Jo Johnson said Agreements like this also send a clear signal that UK researchers are outward looking and ready to work with the best talent wherever that may be Perhaps a predictable emphasis given the current political situation, but it is true, important and worth saying. I for one am keen to see the results.

He may be six years into a relationship, have just published his first book and made a splash with the recent TV mockumentary Carnage. But he still can’t help telling us – it’s the first thing he says – how undermined he feels by a single empty seat on the front row. Plus ca change, plus c’est le meme angst-ridden Amstell, laying bare his overthought emotional life in the name of our entertainment. The new show is called What Is This?, with emphasis firmly on the middle word. The “this” is life, that mysterious thing Amstell can’t bring himself to just get on with like everyone else. After all: why? OK, so he’s not as riddled with self-loathing as he once was. Back then, he could barely get out of bed; now, “I get out of bed, but I don’t know why I’ve done it.” Existential angst, or wealthy man’s privilege? A bit of both. Amstell doesn’t remotely apologise for being famous – one droll gag finds him repaying his mum for the use of her womb by introducing her to Derren Brown. But it’s clear celebrity is just one more circle of alienation for a man whose every social interaction feels like an out-of-body experience. It’s heartwarming to hear of his newfound happiness: he’s touching about the relationship here, as he traces his experience of learning to love and be loved. But, in the same way that he once addressed unhappiness with bewildered detachment, so, too, contentment is just something else to observe and analyse. That’s the stuff of the show’s final third, as Amstell shares his own and his partner’s unconventional rules on fidelity, and how several recent party experiences have scrambled his boundaries, and his sense of how lustily we all ought to be handling one another. But most of What Is This? is retrospective. For the first time, Amstell tells his coming out story on stage – not only the telling-the-parents moment, but the several-year process of self-acceptance that preceded (and followed) it. Casting himself as comically naive and vulnerable, even in the early years of his celebrity, he recounts two experimental solo trips – to Paris, aged 18, then Miami at 21 – both tending to the irresistible conclusion: “Oh yes: gay.” But his family try to talk – or shock – him out of it, and their disapproval, internalised, proves hard to live down. The middle section describes how he does so, as therapy and bitter experience teach Amstell that his dad isn’t an ogre, but “just a man, who doesn’t know what he is doing”. I’d have enjoyed this routine more if I hadn’t read it word for word in the previous weekend’s Guardian. Amstell starts the show with a joke about the deal he struck to publish transcripts of his live comedy. “Who for?,” he marvels, to which (now I know it includes new material as well as old) I can volunteer the answer: anyone who’d just love to know all the punchlines before they watch Amstell’s brand new show. But it takes more than spoilers to spoil What is This?: a lovely hour that strikes a beautiful balance between perky and pained, anxious and ironic. Occasionally, justifying a laugh-free moment, he’ll claim he’s not trying to be funny, just wise. The best of his material – and there’s a real sense, early in the tour, that Amstell is enjoying delivering it – manages to be both at the same time. At Oxford Playhouse, 24 September; Leicester Square theatre, London, 27-28 September; then touring until 29 November. https://www.simonamstell.com/"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/24/mccluskey-corbyn-critics-silenced-labour-conference","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T12:19:07Z","webTitle":"McCluskey: Corbyn's critics will be silenced at Labour conference","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/24/mccluskey-corbyn-critics-silenced-labour-conference","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/24/mccluskey-corbyn-critics-silenced-labour-conference","fields":{"headline":"McCluskey: Corbyn's critics will be silenced at Labour conference","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The leader of the UK’s biggest union, Len McCluskey, predicts the Labour conference in Brighton opening on Sunday will be the most united for decades, with Jeremy Corbyn’s critics silenced and backstabbing by cabals of rightwingers halted. McCluskey, Corbyn’s biggest backer, predicted a series of reforms aimed at empowering grassroots members and shifting the balance of power decisively to the left through the conference. “In my 47 years in the party, I have never seen it so united,” he said, adding: “I suspect this will be a conference like no other.” The Unite leader is feeling vindicated after a turbulent two years in which both he and Corbyn were vilified by large parts of the parliamentary Labour party and the media. In an hour-long interview with the Guardian, McCluskey said he did not think there was now any “serious opposition” in the parliamentary Labour party to Corbyn. “Yes, you will always get one or two irrelevant individuals desperately seeking a headline, but no one takes them seriously.” The parliamentary Labour party had behaved appallingly, gripped by a panic that Corbyn was going to lead Labour over the precipice, he said. “Suddenly, they have realised that not only was that not the case but they themselves have been reinvigorated.” McCluskey added that “the rightwing cabals in the Labour party” had been knifing Corbyn in the back. “We stood by him. Yes, I do feel some personal satisfaction and very proud of our union in defending him.” He is still not talking to the Labour deputy leader, Tom Watson, whom he accuses of having plotted against Corbyn, but expressed a hope that he too had changed his ways since the better-than-expected showing in the general election. “I do not want to speak for Tom Watson – perish the thought – but it does appear that his manoeuvres to undermine Jeremy have come to an end. “Perhaps he is just another MP who thought that things were going to go terribly wrong and now realises that is not the case.” The proposed reforms to the party, which were agreed to by its ruling national executive this week before going to the conference for a vote, would have been hotly contested by the right until recently. The proposals include reducing the threshold for becoming a candidate for the leadership from support of 15% of Labour MPs and MEPs to 10%, virtually guaranteeing there will be a candidate from the left in future elections. Momentum, the grassroots movement set up after Corbyn’s leadership victory in 2015 to pursue a leftwing agenda, had wanted the threshold reduced to 5%. But the really significant change, McCluskey said, was the “Corbyn review” that would look at democratising all party structures and could be completed within a year. The role of the parliamentary Labour party in choosing the candidates for leader and deputy leader would be diluted by giving grassroots members and the unions a say too. He defended the involvement of the unions, saying they had been integral to the Labour party since its formation. Labour is on a permanent election footing in case of a snap election. McCluskey said it was impossible to rule out an election being called at any time, but he expected it to be in early 2019, believing Theresa May would not get a Brexit deal through the Commons. Unite, unlike other unions that have seen their political funds depleted by the general elections in 2015 and this year, has a healthy £15m political fund in spite of giving Labour £4.5m for the June election. McCluskey said that while the union executive would decide the exact amount it would give to Labour, it would not be found wanting. But he added that Labour had to find extra sources of revenue next time to match the Conservatives, perhaps from big individual donors or through crowdfunding, as Barack Obama did. He acknowledged that while the Labour manifesto had been popular, not all of it had worked. “Corbyn’s team are … looking at those areas that worked and those that didn’t work as strongly as they would have hoped. They are trying to deal with some of the demographics in play. Clearly, the grey vote is an issue that Labour have to work on to win the trust and convince them that Labour is on their side,” McCluskey said. Labour is set to embrace the idea developed by Obama’s campaign team and advocated by Momentum of having party members campaign on community issues such as closures of libraries, A&amp;E departments and swimming pools. McCluskey reiterated his belief that it would be right for the next leader of the Labour party to be a woman, mentioning Emily Thornberry, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Angela Rayner. McCluskey was mocked in the media and by May recently for saying he would support illegal strikes and drawing parallels with Nelson Mandela, Mahatma Gandhi and others who had broken the law on matters of principle. He disclosed he had written to May suggesting a way to end the illegal strikes controversy. In the letter, dated 14 September, he wrote: “You will have seen some media coverage suggesting that I had compared myself to Mandela and Gandhi in opposing the law. Indeed you made such a reference at PMQs. Can I assure you I would not be so arrogant or so stupid as to compare myself with such great individuals?” The government introduced legislation that declares strikes illegal if there is a low turnout. McCluskey, in his letter, said the way out of the impasse would be to have workplace or electronic ballots, which he predicted would ensure high turnouts, rather than postal ballots, which have notoriously bad ones. McCluskey and Unite campaigned for remain, and he said he was pleased with how Labour was developing a Brexit policy, even though it was not a finished article. He said it was important that the momentum from the June election be maintained, and unions and MPs had to tap into it too. “The unions have to bottle a bit of Corbynism and take it with us. That is what I am hoping for. Get a bottle of Corbynism. And give it to some of our MPs and instruct them to take three spoonfuls a day and they will soon get out of this negative kind of depressing world they live in,” he said with a smile."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/24/theresa-may-has-faced-series-of-cabinet-plots-to-oust-her-book-says","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T18:46:10Z","webTitle":"Davis dismissive of Johnson's influence on May's Florence speech","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/24/theresa-may-has-faced-series-of-cabinet-plots-to-oust-her-book-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/24/theresa-may-has-faced-series-of-cabinet-plots-to-oust-her-book-says","fields":{"headline":"Davis dismissive of Johnson's influence on May's Florence speech","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Boris Johnson’s personal blueprint for leaving the EU had no influence on the prime minister’s flagship speech in Florence, David Davis, the Brexit secretary, has said. Davis dismissed the idea that Johnson had changed the government’s thinking on Brexit after allies of the foreign secretary briefed several newspapers that his 4,000-word Telegraph article stopped the prime minister veering towards a softer Brexit. They said Johnson had managed to keep transition to two years and successfully stopped May backing the so-called “Norway option”, under which Britain would continue to have access to the EU’s single market in return for payment and adherence to its rules and regulations. But Davis downplayed his colleague’s significance, telling the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “I have to say that the policy in the prime minister’s speech has been coming for a long time. Some of it we were designing months ago. I don’t think there has been any change in policy in the last few weeks.” Johnson’s article was published a week before May’s Florence speech, in which the foreign secretary called for the government to honour Vote Leave’s pledge to bring back £350m a week to spend more on the NHS. In a further dig at Johnson, Davis praised an interview given by Amber Rudd, the home secretary , in which she accused the foreign secretary of “backseat driving”. Asked whether he agreed with her assessment, he said: “My car has only got two seats ... It was a very good interview, I thought.” The briefings about Johnson having influenced May’s Florence speech are the latest evidence of the tensions and power struggles in cabinet. Davis is set to embark on a fresh round of talks on Britain’s EU withdrawal when he meets the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, in Brussels on Monday. While Barnier has welcomed the “constructive spirit” of May’s speech, it is unclear whether it will be enough to unlock the talks and enable them to move on to the next stage covering Britain’s future relations with the EU, including a free trade deal. The scale of plots to replace May over the summer was also revealed this weekend in a new book about the aftermath of the EU referendum called Fall Out: A Year of Political Turmoil. The account by Tim Shipman, political editor of the Sunday Times, gives details of how the prime minister came closer to being toppled than has been publicly acknowledged. It gave details of how senior cabinet ministers after the election considered ousting May in June, including an offer by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to back Johnson for the leadership. It revealed that Hammond texted Johnson in the early hours as the election results were still coming through to say he would back him for the leadership if he continued to run the economy, while Davis would also keep his brief. However, the plan came unstuck when Davis would not back the idea of being junior to Johnson. A source confirmed to the Guardian that several cabinet ministers had texted Johnson giving him their backing for a potential run against the prime minister in the immediate hours after the election, when the results were still not clear. Since then, Hammond and Johnson have been on opposite sides of the Brexit argument. The chancellor has been pushing for a transition period of longer than two years that maintains the status quo, while the foreign secretary has been battling to reduce the length of the transition and is unhappy with signing up to new EU regulations after March 2019. Some senior Conservatives believe Johnson is trying to goad May into sacking him for insubordination so that he is well positioned among Brexiters to replace her as leader when the time comes for another contest. Shipman’s book detailed two other plots to oust the prime minister. The second was an attempt by supporters of Davis, which was widely reported before parliament’s summer break. One source was reported as saying Davis was well aware of the attempt by one of his supporters to collect names of Tory MPs willing to challenge the prime minister, which reached between 30 and 50. The book says the third attempt was a growing campaign to prepare Rudd for a leadership bid if the role became vacant. It said senior Conservatives such as David Cameron and Sir John Major rallied around Rudd as a candidate from the moderate wing of the party after Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, ruled out standing in a snap byelection. The machinations over the Tory leadership leave May in a vulnerable position going into the Conservative party conference, where she will have to get through a speech to the grassroots membership. Senior figures with ambitions for the leadership are also likely to use the conference platform to set out their pitches for the future of the party and Brexit. The party conference in Manchester in just over a week’s time will also be grappling with the issues of how to appeal to younger people with better policies on student fees and housing. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, won young voters over in large numbers during the election."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/25/australian-republic-movement-poll-shows-charles-unpopular-even-at-home","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T18:00:00Z","webTitle":"Australian Republic Movement poll shows Charles unpopular, 'even at home'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/25/australian-republic-movement-poll-shows-charles-unpopular-even-at-home","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/25/australian-republic-movement-poll-shows-charles-unpopular-even-at-home","fields":{"headline":"Australian Republic Movement poll shows Charles unpopular, 'even at home'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The prospect of King Charles has given hope to the Australian Republic Movement, with polling showing not even the British are enthused by the heir apparent ascending to the throne. Polling by FTI Consulting of 2,531 UK citizens on behalf of the Australian movement late last month found more than half of respondents believed the Queen best embodied the spirit of the United Kingdom but just 39% trusted Prince Charles and only 37% wanted him to replace his mother. The Duke of Cambridge, Prince William, who follows his father in the succession line, proved a more popular choice at 41%, while 7% wanted another royal family member and 14% thought the monarchy should not exist. When it came to who should be a head of state of a country, 46% strongly agreed it should only be a citizen of that country, while another 33% slightly agreed with that statement. The Australian Republic Movement chief, Michael Cooney, said the message was clear – a King Charles was “unpopular and untrusted, even at home”. “What this really shows is that the question for Australia is not whether we have change, it is what kind of change we have,” he said. “And the choice is between either King Charles or an Australian, chosen by Australians, to be the head of state.” Cooney said the decision to poll UK citizens was made because “they have more influence over the result than we [Australians] did”. He said that, despite the popularity of the new generation of royals, with William, Catherine and Harry helping to reinvigorate interest in the monarchy, Australia would have Charles as its head of state. “The one thing we know is it is highly predictable and the next king of England and king of Australia is Charles,” he said. “We are not going to have William as our next king. “Becoming a republic will not stop them from visiting for things like the Invictus Games, or the Commonwealth Games, or things like that. But it will mean we have a chance to have our own head of state.” Cooney said that, particularly in the current Australian political climate of “divisiveness and huge debates about our identity”, a republic was needed more than ever. “We need to repair our political system to make it more inclusive and more unifying,” he said. The republic movement is hoping for a national vote by 2020 asking Australians if they want an Australian head of state and how they would like that person to be chosen, before, if all goes as they plan, proceeding to a referendum by 2022."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/sep/24/royal-bank-of-scotland-delays-introduction-of-low-rate-credit-card","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T14:40:36Z","webTitle":"Royal Bank of Scotland delays introduction of low-rate credit card","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/sep/24/royal-bank-of-scotland-delays-introduction-of-low-rate-credit-card","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/sep/24/royal-bank-of-scotland-delays-introduction-of-low-rate-credit-card","fields":{"headline":"Royal Bank of Scotland delays introduction of low-rate credit card","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Royal Bank of Scotland has postponed plans to introduce a cut-price credit card amid concerns about the £200bn of lending amassed by UK households. The bank, which is 70% owned by the taxpayer, has decided against launching a more competitive credit card at a time when the consumer credit market – personal loans, credit cards and car finance – is facing scrutiny from the Bank of England. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, said: “We just don’t think now is the right time, with consumer debt having grown so much.” McEwan has been reviewing whether to return to the cut-price credit card market, despite announcing in 2014 that he was shunning deals on credit cards offering 0% interest rates. The option had returned to the table because of shrinking growth in its credit card business. McEwan has concluded that the timing is not right but will review the market again next year. McEwan said he had concerns about zero-balance transfers – where people can take out a new card to pay off an old one, at an interest rate of 0% – as they included up-front fees and customers did not always know what rate they moved on to when the special offer ended, which could saddle them with a surprise increase in borrowing costs. Instead, customers should be taking advantage of the low-interest environment to pay back their debts, he said. “I think financial institutions should be encouraging people to get their debts paid down and when you’re on zero balance that is the best time as it’s costing you nothing.” Nonetheless, concerns over the car finance market – which loaned more than £40bn to vehicle buyers last year – have not deterred RBS from moving into this market. Last week, it launched a personal contract purchase (PCP) product, which is the most common deal for buying cars, for its NatWest current account customers. On Monday, the Bank of England will provide an update on its views about lenders’ activities in the fast-growing consumer debt market, having warned this year that it might have to use the announcement to unveil measures for tackling rising household borrowing. Alex Brazier, the Bank’s executive director of financial stability, warned in July of a “spiral of complacency” about a market that was growing at 10% a year when household income had grown only 1.5%. “By September, we will have assessed whether the rapid growth has created any gap in the line. If it has, we’ll plug it,” said Brazier. The Bank has already told lenders to start amassing £11.4bn of extra capital in the next 18 months and written to lenders that provide car finance to ask them to analyse the effect of a fall in car values. It has also asked for details on the basis on which they were issuing personal loans and ordered banks to look at the terms under which they are granting 0% balance transfers on credit cards. About 45% of the £65bn of credit card debt is on zero-balance transfers but figures show that their users still struggle to clear historical debts. At the end of the interest-free period, half the balances are at the same level as when the offer began. The car financing product is for secondhand cars and when NatWest customers look at a PCP offer they will also be provided with the terms they would have received for a more straightforward loan. PCP deals offer cars for small monthly payments. At the end of the PCP contract, customers have the option to make an agreed “balloon payment” or hand the keys back to the dealer and walk away."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/25/labor-mp-ridicules-universal-basic-income-push-and-says-it-would-worsen-inequality","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T18:01:00Z","webTitle":"Labor MP ridicules universal basic income push and says it would worsen inequality","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/25/labor-mp-ridicules-universal-basic-income-push-and-says-it-would-worsen-inequality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/25/labor-mp-ridicules-universal-basic-income-push-and-says-it-would-worsen-inequality","fields":{"headline":"Labor MP ridicules universal basic income push and says it would worsen inequality","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Labor MP Jim Chalmers has ridiculed the push to introduce a universal basic income in Australia, saying it would be a “backward step” for workers that could increase inequality and cost the budget billions. His criticism of the concept puts him squarely alongside the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, who has been pushing back for months against internal and external calls to adopt the welfare policy. Chalmers has cemented his critique of universal basic income in a new book, co-written with Mike Quigley, the former chief executive of NBN Co, on technological change, the labour force and inequality called Changing Jobs: The Fair Go in the New Machine Age. The book, released on Monday, meets head-on the concern that technological change will make inequality worse if it is left unattended. Chalmers and Quigley argue that Australia’s schools, its industrial relations regime and social security system will need to change dramatically in coming years, as machines rewrite the rules of the economy, in order to keep people employed. But they have given special attention to UBI, writing that the feared widespread loss of jobs in the coming age of automation will not be fixed by giving everyone a basic income. They have criticised the American futurist Martin Ford and the US tech entrepreneur Elon Musk for promoting the concept. “For someone with the imagination and resolve to make electric cars mainstream, send rockets into space and plan for the colonisation of Mars, billionaire and tech entrepreneur Elon Musk is surprisingly simplistic and defeatist when it comes to the impact of technology on the labour market,” they argue. “If Australia were to adopt a form of UBI, it would be a backward step. It would mean giving the same amount of government support to a high-level CEO as to a single mum struggling to keep food on the table. “It would mean dismantling a system that ensures support goes to those who need it most. If it replaced the current system, it would actually increase inequality, not decrease it, by substituting an untargeted system for a targeted one.” Instead, they recommend a number of improvements to Australian social security. They say big data and matching technology should be used, not to demonise recipients or treat people as guilty of welfare fraud until proven innocent, but to ensure the social security system is responsive to people’s needs. “This could involve some sort of top-up technology to take into account irregular work patterns, hours and wages, responsive in real time and better at combining some social security and some work ... It could provide a different safety net – a ‘safety web’ – by predicting social problems at the household level before they emerge.” They also say governments ought to consider how “income smoothing” could play a role in the future economy, so temporarily displaced workers do not suffer a substantial drop in living standards when they lose their jobs to machines. “Income smoothing means evening out people’s income over time so they are less susceptible to the peaks and troughs of employment,” they write. “Some proposals suggest supplementing income once a displaced worker is forced to accept a far lower-paying job; others ‘top up’ support during this transition to a new role. “A more radical proposal (sometimes associated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions) envisages people or even larger employers paying a premium to the government in anticipation of episodic periods of unemployment in the new machine age. The government would then pay displaced workers a certain percentage of their previous salary for a set time.” The book includes more than 30 policy recommendations, which they say could be adopted over many years. Their recommendations for classrooms include: training and mentoring more Stem teachers; compulsory coding and robotics in primary and secondary schools; an emphasis on computational thinking in existing subjects; and needs-based funding for schools to combat technological inequality."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2017/oct/03/top-boys-back-with-added-drake-it-seems-netflix-has-saved-another-cult-show","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T17:06:28Z","webTitle":"Top Boy's back with added Drake?

It seems Netflix has saved another cult show","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"If you thought you had seen the last of the Summerhouse crew – and their curious fixation on food – you were wrong. After a four-year hiatus, Netflix is to announce what the show’s star, Ashley Walters, has been hinting at for some time: it is reviving Channel 4’s award-winning gang drama Top Boy for (at least) two more seasons. Better still, Drake’s likely involvement will pique the interest of many who don’t even know that Hackney exists, much less what being caught with 10-bags of dubs might get you. The show warrants its return. Set on the fictional Summerhouse estate in north London, it’s an unforgiving portrayal of gang culture – often disturbing, sometimes funny but always distinctively British. Since it first appeared in August 2013, Top Boy has followed Dushane (Walters), the charismatic drug kingpin who acts as a surrogate father figure to his young underling drug dealers on the estate. And, as much as it delivers the requisite mayhem you would expect from the gangster genre (kidnapping, mutilation and death are ever-present dangers), it has always remembered to portray the daily battles of low-income families. Series one has a harrowing mental health storyline, with the promising young footballer Ra’Nell struggling to manage his mother’s breakdown. Although it attracted some criticism from Hackney residents, the consensus was that it was a cut above your typical urban drama. It was never just an exploitative portrayal of black criminals – it shows the predicament of black business owners and professionals, too. In series two, solicitor Rhianna strives to balance her career and her relationship with Dushane, ultimately choosing the former. We also see the effects of gentrification on the community, as hairdresser Lisa learns that developers will be buying up her entire street. Local businesses are shoved out to make way for new money, and, predictably, Rhianna encourages Dushane to launder his cash through the venture. This Netflix deal shows once again how streaming services are adept at spotting fallen TV shows that have gained cult followings. We have seen Netflix bring back Arrested Development, Hulu resuscitate The Mindy Project and Yahoo Screen give Community a new lease of life. Traditional commercial TV relies on advertising, and, when incoming revenue doesn’t cover costs, even prestige shows are ruthlessly culled. Advertisers aren’t a concern with Netflix’s subscription model, and it seems happy to take a gamble on a show’s fanbase buying the service for one show and sticking around for everything else. Come for the Sense8, stay for the Samurai Gourmet marathon. Every serious TV viewer has a list of shows we mourn like a lost relative – unicorns cut down in their prime, too pure for this world, misunderstood by an idiotic public and mistreated by cold-hearted network execs. Traditionally, we sucked it up and moved on, nursing a grievance like our last pint on earth. That streaming is taking on this particular heritage project offers hope for other viewers that their own dreams may not be over. Perhaps, more importantly, it encourages risk-taking in the industry. You’re a lot more likely to take chances artistically if you don’t think you’re going to get your throat cut for not excelling commercially. That it can develop a showcase for black British talent as powerful as Top Boy can only be a good thing for quality, diverse TV."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/04/suzuka-f1-lewis-hamilton-sebastian-vettel","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T08:09:48Z","webTitle":"Suzuka the Everest of F1 tracks will push Hamilton and Vettel to cliff edge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/04/suzuka-f1-lewis-hamilton-sebastian-vettel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/04/suzuka-f1-lewis-hamilton-sebastian-vettel","fields":{"headline":"Suzuka the Everest of F1 tracks will push Hamilton and Vettel to cliff edge","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"So often the venue for a dramatic denouement to the season but also so much more, the Japanese Grand Prix is one of the jewels in F1’s crown. As drivers and fans descend on Suzuka this weekend excitement and anticipation will be shared. Few circuits quite stir the heart as does the 3.6 mile, figure of eight challenge, whose configuration demands technical skill, touch, judgment and bravery, and rewards them with one of the greatest thrill rides. There is a rich history to this grand prix, for so long the finale or penultimate race of the season. The championship has been decided at Fuji or Suzuka 13 times, more than in any other country. The former famously hosted the first Japanese Grand Prix in 1976 when James Hunt’s and Niki Lauda’s battle for the title reached its dramatic conclusion on the rain-drenched speedway and since then the latter has staged some of F1’s most gripping and decisive spectacles. This year’s fight between Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel will not be decided on Sunday but it will be a race to savour. The drivers revel in it because to complete a quick lap is to have got the better of the most demanding, unforgiving but rewarding of trials. Damon Hill won his world championship at Suzuka in 1996. “It’s a bit like our Everest or K2,” he says. “It was quite terrifying mostly. It is demanding, it is more like the Isle of Man TT for us than some circuits. You can’t make a mistake. If you do you are going to pay the price – it is going to bite you. But racing drivers are a bit weird like that, we like that sort of thing.” He is not alone in his assessment. Elements of the circuit are sublime. Standing watching on the inside of the entrance to the S-curves, the precision required from the drivers to thread the needle and exit the sequence with maximum speed into the Dunlop curve is magnificent to behold. The car must be absolutely committed going into the first left-hander but drivers must keep their foot in for the right that immediately follows. Get it wrong, as Nigel Mansell did in qualifying in 1987, and Suzuka is unforgiving. Mansell’s crash and his injuries cost him his chance to win the world championship. Nor does it get any easier. The double right-hander of the Degner curve follows the Dunlop. Carrying speed into it is crucial and the car becomes unsettled as the second right looms. The track dips into it causing compression and on exiting the bowl there is no run off on the left. Anything less than perfection means the lap is gone. The challenges follow thick and fast in its wake: the low-speed hairpin, the sweep through Spoon, the mighty high-speed direction change of 130R, and finally the chicane. Little wonder drivers rate success at Suzuka as one of the highest achievements in Formula One. Hill says his finest moment was not that championship winning race, where a single point was enough to ensure the title, but his remarkable victory in 1994 when he mastered Michael Schumacher and the track in atrocious conditions. “That was probably the toughest race of my life,” he says. “I had to beat Nigel Mansell, Michael Schumacher and Jean Alesi. I had to win that race or the championship would have been over. It was hugely special, the race where I drove to my highest level ever. I don’t think I ever got back there. “It was more satisfying because it was at Suzuka. The degree of difficulty doesn’t get more difficult than that. To beat Michael in those conditions – I think I could hold my head up and say I reached the top.” He had, and he had also made his entry among a host of unmissable grands prix. Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost’s battles in Japan are a fundamental part of F1 history. Senna won his first title in 1988 having chased down Prost in the wet, after stalling his McLaren from pole. The following year Senna had to beat his rival to stay in the fight, and Prost shut the door on him going into the chicane. They both went off and although Senna rejoined and won he was disqualified for having not made the corner. Alessandro Nannini inherited his one and only F1 win and Prost the title. A year later in 1990 when Honda (who built Suzuka as a test track in 1962) were riding high supplying engines to McLaren, three million people applied for the 120,000 tickets on offer when the pair went head to head again to decide the title. The rivalry now bitter, led to one of Suzuka’s most controversial moments. As Prost took advantage heading down the hill into turn one, the Brazilian ploughed into a non-existent gap to take both cars out, their retirements guaranteeing his second world title. Johnny Herbert, who took one of his seven Formula One podiums at Suzuka in his season alongside Schumacher at Benetton in 1995, knows the top drivers revel in proving themselves on the narrow, unforgiving circuit. “The challenge is keeping between the white lines,” he says. “For Lewis, Sebastian, Kimi [Raikkonen], Fernando [Alonso]– that’s what they enjoy, that’s what I enjoy, that’s the challenge. Running off and coming back on again without a penalty – you can’t do that at Suzuka.” The best have long tested themselves against that challenge and a host of other drivers have made their contributions to the circuit’s memorable races. In the final round at Suzuka in 1998, Mika Hakkinen led Schumacher by four points and held his nerve to take the title. Two years later the pair fought all race long before Schumacher took the win and his third title by two seconds. In 2003, Schumacher fought back from 14th on the grid to take the eighth place he needed, while Raikkonen could not secure the win he required as Rubens Barrichello took the chequered flag. It is not only the drivers or the layout that make Suzuka special but some of the most enthusiastic fans in the world. Their love of the sport is both broad and comprehensive. Herbert last raced there for Jaguar in 2000. He has not been forgotten. “I still have a superfan who turns up every year,” he says. “She is there to greet me and see me off in the bus in the evening. She’s back in the morning, she’s there on the Sunday before I get sent off to the airport. The Japanese have that passion for the sport.” They will be there en masse this weekend to watch Hamilton and Vettel go up against one another on one of the great stages. It is not to be missed. “The very best get the most out of themselves and enjoy Suzuka,” Herbert says. “For race fans it gives you a buzz because you can see the guys on the ragged edge and pushing themselves. They are having fun doing it and you can see they are. Everybody gets the right vibes, it’s what F1 should be all about.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/live/2017/oct/03/las-vegas-shooting-trump-puerto-rico-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T03:35:56Z","webTitle":"Las Vegas shooting suspect's girlfriend is a 'person of interest' – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2017/oct/03/las-vegas-shooting-trump-puerto-rico-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2017/oct/03/las-vegas-shooting-trump-puerto-rico-live-updates","fields":{"headline":"Las Vegas shooting suspect's girlfriend is a 'person of interest' – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"We are wrapping up this blog now. Thanks for reading. You can read the latest coverage here: Gunman Stephen Paddock’s girlfriend is “a person of interest” in the criminal investigation into the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. She is reportedly on her way back to the US. Donald Trump plans to visit Las Vegas on Wednesday, and the White House has suggested that the tragedy should not inspire new gun control laws. Portraits are continuing to emerge of the victims, which include local government workers, students and travelers from across North America. A 59th victim died on Tuesday night, according to the Associated Press. The death toll from the shooting is now at least 60, including the gunman. ATF has said 47 firearms have been recovered in three locations - the hotel room, Verde and Mesquite, Nevada – and that 12 of them had been modified. Officials believe the attack was carefully planned and have discovered that Paddock set up cameras in and around his hotel room – two in the hallway and one in the peephole of his room door. The sheriff said the suspect’s motives still remain unknown: “This person may have radicalised, unbeknownst to us, and we want to identify that source.” Gun control advocates have called for reforms, including a ban on “bump stocks” used to convert a semi-automatic rifle into a weapon that fires like a fully automatic one. Anonymous law enforcement officials told several outlets that Paddock wired $100,000 to the Philippines before the shooting. Meanwhile ABC in Australia says it has been told that Marilou Danley, the partner of Paddock, has left the Philippines and is returning to the US. The Associate Press is just reporting that another person has died of their injuries sustained in Sunday’s mass shooting. It means that the number of victims has risen to 59. The shooter Stephen Paddock is also dead which would mean a total death toll of 60. Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center said the victim died Tuesday afternoon. No details about the person were released and the hospital said it still has 31 people in critical condition. The additional fatality kept the death toll at 59 after Clark County Coroner John Fudenberg revised his earlier count of victims downward by one. Undersheriff McMahill also clarified earlier reports of cameras set up by the shooter in the hotel. He said that two cameras had been set up in the hallway, and one in the hotel room door’s peephole. The coroner gave updated numbers of the dead, clarifying that the 59 included the shooter and 58 victims. McMahill returned to the podium to show some dramatic police body camera footage from the night. But first he paid tribute to Charleston Hartfield, a Las Vegas police officer who was off-duty at the festival with his wife. McMahill choked up as he talked about Hartfield, calling him a “hero”. Though the officer was at the festival as a civilian, McMahill said, “he was acting as a police officer. Special agent in charge Jill Snyder also updated reporters on the firearms that have been recovered. She said 47 firearms had been found in 3 different locations, including the hotel room, and Verde and Mesquite, Nevada. The weapons – rifles shotguns pistols – were purchased in Nevada, Utah, California and Texas. Snyder said that none recovered appear to be homemade. She added that several bump stocks were found. At an evening press conference, Las Vegas undersheriff Kevin McMahill is updating reporters on details of the shooting and investigation, but warned: “I need some patience from you. This investigation is a long time from being concluded.” He said that it would be days before the hotel room was finishing being processed. He also that the shooting lasted for “somewhere between nine and 11 minutes.” “I want you to think about that,” McMahill said. “That’s a remarkable response by this police department.” Cameron Robinson was a young city of Las Vegas employee, who was at the festival with his boyfriend, Bobby Eardley, when the popping sounds started. Eardley recalled on Tuesday, “And I just remember being really upset – why would somebody set off firecrackers at a venue like this when shootings have happened?” After a second round, Eardley decided it was time for them to move: “I remember seeing people sitting on the ground and wondering why they were sitting because they were going to get trampled. And I realized they were bleeding.” Eardley, 36, and Robinson, 28, had been together for four years after meeting on OkCupid; a year ago Robinson moved in with Eardley in St George, Utah. Robinson was a records specialist for the city. “Long before he came to work for the city he gave me his resume,” recalled his boss, Las Vegas city attorney Brad Jerbic, “and the first thing I remember noticing is that he got his bachelor’s degree when he was 20 year old – that immediately got my attention.” When Jerbic hired him several years ago, his desk ended up being in the center of the office. “It was a perfect metaphor,” Jerbic said. Robinson organized potlucks, brought food to the office, ran games at the Christmas party. With Robinson, “everything went up a notch. If it was fun it was more fun, if the records were being processed efficiently it was more efficiently.” Robinson’s sister, Meghan Ervin, wrote on Facebook: “I was never suppose to say good bye to you little brother. You were suppose to take over the world ... I love you to the moon and back.” What did Eardley love about him? “He’s my other half. I’m the crazy, fly by the seat of your pants - he’s the straight laced and level headed one. ... And so many other things. His quirky little smile, his big teeth, his crooked sunglasses… so many things.” Read the Guardian’s full account of the victims: A California correctional officer has been identified as one of those killed in the shooting. Derrick “Bo” Taylor, 52, was a 29-year veteran of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, department spokesman Bill Sessa confirmed to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Taylor led inmates fighting wildfires, a position, Sessa said, that many officers sought because they believed in inmate rehabilitation. Gunman Stephen Paddock’s girlfriend is “a person of interest” in the criminal investigation into the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. Donald Trump plans to visit Las Vegas on Wednesday, and the White House has suggested that the tragedy should not inspire new gun control laws. Portraits are continuing to emerge of the 59 victims, which include local government workers, students and travelers from across North America. Police have said authorities found 23 guns in the suspect’s hotel room. Gun control advocates have called for reforms, including a ban on “bump stocks” used to convert a semi-automatic rifle into a weapon that fires like a fully automatic one. The sheriff said the suspect’s motives still remain unknown: “This person may have radicalised, unbeknownst to us, and we want to identify that source.” Officials believe the attack was carefully planned and have discovered that Paddock set up a camera in a room service cart to watch the hallway outside his room. Anonymous law enforcement officials told several outlets that Paddock wired $100,000 to the Philippines before the shooting. All but three of the victims have been identified. A US official told the Associated Press that the shooter Stephen Paddock had reported at least a “dozen gambling transactions of $10,000 or more” in recent weeks. More from the AP: The official also said Tuesday that Paddock had transferred $100,000 to the Philippines in the days before the attack... The official said investigators are still attempting to trace that money. The official, who was briefed by law enforcement, wasn’t authorized to publicly discuss an ongoing investigation. The person also said investigators are focusing more attention on what the girlfriend of Paddock may have known about the attack. Federal investigators are expected to question Marilou Danley when she returns to the US on Wednesday. The Guardian’s Tom McCarthy on why gun control has failed in the US: From one angle, the answer is complicated. It involves the powerful gun lobby, political partisanship, the hundreds of millions of guns already in US civilian hands, the fact that mass shootings, while horrifying, represent only a sliver of US gun deaths, and a national mythology attached to guns. From another angle, the answer is simple. The United States could, in fact, adopt gun control – if the public felt strongly enough about it. “If public opinion does not demand change in Congress, it will not change,” Barack Obama said in June 2014. Read the full report here: The Las Vegas emergency management team says it no longer needs donations at the family assistance center it set up after the shooting: Here are some other ways to continue supporting the victims: Nevada governor Brian Sandoval, a Republican, has responded to questions about why the state has not enforced a new gun control measure voters approved last November. As Guardian reporter Lois Beckett explained, voters passed a law that would have required private sellers to conduct the same criminal background check on buyers that licensed gun dealers already use: Days before it was scheduled to be implemented, the state’s attorney general, also a Republican, released a legal opinion saying the law was unenforceable and that citizens were “excused from compliance”. (The law may not have prevented the Sunday attack, given that the suspect is believed to have passed a background check, but it could have provided a further paper trail to track his purchases). It turns out that Nevadans for Background Checks, the group that backed the ballot measure, sent a letter to the governor threatening to sue over the blocked policy – days before the Las Vegas mass shooting. The letter sent last week gave Sandoval a deadline of 9 October to begin implementing the policy before the group took the state government to court, according to the Nevada Independent. The governor’s office has since responded to local reporters asking about the lawsuit threat, saying he would ask the attorney general for an opinion: Jason Aldean, the country music star who was playing a headlining set when the gunman started firing at his audience, has just announced that he is canceling his upcoming shows this weekend: I feel like out of respect for the victims, their families and our fans, it is the right thing to do. It has been an emotional time for everyone involved this week, so we plan to take some time to mourn the ones we have lost and be close with our family and friends. His tour will resume in Tulsa, Oklahoma next week. Read more on Aldean from Guardian writer Mark Guarino: Suspect Stephen Paddock used to berate his girlfriend at a local Starbucks, employees told the Los Angeles Times: Canadian media has confirmed the identity of a fourth Canadian killed in the Las Vegas attack, Ashifa Kassam reports from Toronto. Tara Roe Smith, 34, and her husband were at the festival in Las Vegas as part of a weekend getaway. The mother of two young children, who was originally from Manitoba but lived in a small community near Calgary, became separated from her husband and friends when the gunman opened fire. As news of the shooting broke, friends and family of Smith pleaded for assistance in locating Smith on social media. “My cousin and his wife Tara Smith were at the concert. Please pray that’s she is safe. They were split up during the commotion,” her cousin, Christa Ehman, posted on Facebook. The White House’s message on gun policy following the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history is that “new laws won’t stop a mad man” and that the problem isn’t “too few gun laws”. According to a copy of official talking points the White House distributed to Trump allies, obtained by NBC News, the administration has is pushing a strong defense of the Second Amendment: We welcome a reasoned and well-informed debate on public safety and our constitutional freedoms, but we reject the false choice that we can’t have both. And when it comes to gun control, let’s be clear: new laws won’t stop a mad man committed to harming innocent people. They will curtail the freedoms of law abiding citizens... We shouldn’t rush toward compromising our freedoms before we have all the facts. The full text is here: Gun control advocates, however, have argued that there are clear policies and restrictions that could have saved lives. From Guardian senior reporter Lois Beckett: Gun control advocates are calling for a ban on “bump stocks”, the largely unregulated novelty devices which Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock may have used to convert a semi-automatic rifle into a weapon that mimics the continuous fire of a fully automatic weapon. At least two bump stocks were recovered in Paddock’s hotel room, the Associated Press reported on Monday night, citing law enforcement sources. It is not yet clear whether they were used in his attack. Bump stocks attach to semi-automatic weapons and harness the recoil of the gun to allow a shooter to fire much faster than they could do if they repeatedly pulled the trigger – as the rifle recoils, the trigger bumps forward into the shooter’s finger to speed up the rate of fire. As one company that sells the devices, Bump Fire Systems, put it on its website, “Did you know that you can do simulated full-auto firing and it is absolutely legal?” It listed the price of one stock at $99.99. More on the policy debate here: Former first lady Michelle Obama offered her condolences to the victims on Tuesday, speaking with television producer Shonda Rhimes at the Pennsylvania Conference for Women in Philadelphia. From CBS News: Obama lamented that offering comfort to victims of gun violence has become “too much” of part of the job of being president, and expressed her condolences to the victims and families of the deadly Las Vegas shooting... She said that much of the role as commander-in-chief is “overseeing that kind of loss and really not having a solution to offer families when you comfort them”. And there is a dearth of solutions to the increasing occurrence of gun violence violence because the country is “not at that point yet”, she suggested. Describing the challenges of being in the White House during tragedies, she added, “That’s the kind of stuff that you’re dealing with on a day-to-day basis, and you open the newspaper, and every thing in it is your husband’s responsibility and indirectly, yours.” The president is leaving Puerto Rico now and says he is preparing to visit Las Vegas Wednesday to pay his respects: Sam Levin here, taking over our live coverage of the Las Vegas shooting, following the news that all but three of the 59 victims have been identified. Portraits of the lives lost are starting to emerge. Here are a few: Lisa Romero-Muniz, a high school secretary from Gallup, New Mexico, was an “incredible loving and sincere friend, mentor and advocate for students”, the Gallup-McKinley County Public Schools interim superintendent, Mike Hyatt, said in a statement. “As a colleague, she was also outgoing, kind and considerate of all those she worked with,” he said. A wife, mother, and grandmother, Romero-Muniz had been in Las Vegas with her husband to see the country music singer Jason Aldean for their wedding anniversary. Charleston Hartfield: An off-duty Las Vegas police officer and military veteran named Charleston Hartfield was identified by friends as a victim, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. “I don’t know a better man than Charles,” said Troy Rhett, who said he’d been friends with Hartfield for eight years. “They say it’s always the good ones we lose early. There’s no truer statement than that with Charles.” Sonny Melton, 29, who lived in Big Sandy, Tennessee, and worked at a nearby hospital, was the first victim publicly identified. Family members confirmed to the news station WSMV that he was killed in the gunfire. His wife, Heather Melton, told WZTV that her husband had shielded her from bullets on the ground when the shooting began. “He saved my life and lost his,” she said. A friend of the couple told the Paris (Tennessee) Post-Intelligencer that the two had gotten married about a year ago. Read the Guardian’s full account of the victims from reporter Jamiles Lartey: The latest from Las Vegas sheriff Joe Lombardo’s afternoon press conference on Sunday’s mass shooting, which killed 59 people and injured more than 500 others. Marilou Danley, the suspect’s girlfriend, is a “person of interest” who is cooperating with police but outside the country. Danley went abroad on 25 September, before the gunman, Stephen Paddock, booked into the Mandalay Bay on the 28th. She is in the Philippines, Lombardo said. The gunman modified some of his weapons and set up a camera in a roomservice cart to watch the hallway outside his room. Lombardo said a “bump stop” modification appears to have been used on some of the guns. Police have identified all but three of the 59 people killed. Families searching for missing relatives can go to or call the Las Vegas Convention Center, which is serving as a hub for emergency efforts. Investigators recovered “numerous electronic items, additional five handguns and two shotguns and a plethora of ammunition” at a Reno property owned by Paddock. They had previously found 23 guns in the shooter’s hotel room in the Mandalay Bay resort, 19 at his home in Mesquite, Nevada. Police also have 67 body cameras and hours of surveillance and phone footage to parse. A hotel security guard briefly engaged the gunman while police were searching for his location, Lombardo said. Then police and Swat teams converged on the room, around which time Paddock is believed to have killed himself. Anonymous law enforcement officials told several outlets that Paddock wired $100,000 to the Philippines before the shooting. NBC, CNN and the New York Times reported the detail, but none of the unnamed officials identified the intended recipient or purpose behind the transfer. The gunman’s motive remains unknown. The sheriff says police are looking at video on more than 67 body cameras, and even more footage from surveillance cameras, phones and other sources. He shies away from other details of the investigation. Going through all the video will take an enormous amount of time, he says, in part because of chain-of-custody issues and the sheer hours of footage. A reporter asks about training and the police response to the shooter. He says patrol officers assessed the situation, and that a hotel security guard, due to “the unfortunate actions” of the gunman, briefly engaged him. After that point police, security, and the Swat team coordinated to descend on the room. He’s asked again about the gunman’s girlfriend. “I’m comfortable saying she’s located in the Philippines,” is all Lombardo will divulge. He stops taking questions shortly thereafter. “This was obviously premeditated. The shooter evaluated everything he did, which is troublesome,” Lombardo says. A reporter asks whether room service was provided to the gunman’s room over the course of his stay, from 28 October to 1 October. Lombardo says it was. Lombardo praises emergency responders, from police to firefighters and medical personnel, at length. He says he prays that any citizen who might see something would tell police, “because we can’t see all things at all times.” He urges people not to fear they might “bother the police”. “We ask you to bother the police.” “What went right is we saved hundreds of lives,” he says, saying that he’s horrified by what could have happened “with this guy having an ability with those weaponry, the carnage that could occur”. “A lot more was prevented with police action in short time and private security action to save some lives” Lombardo says the gunman had set up a camera in a room service cart outside his Mandalay Bay hotel room. He thinks that he did so in an attempt to monitor anyone who might be approaching. Fielding a question about the length of the shooting, Lombardo says that police’s best estimate is approximately nine minutes of sustained gunfire. The sheriff details more of the police response, saying it was “hard to pinpoint the room from the outside”. Police teams split up, he said, and “moved over to the Mandalay Bay in order to locate and engage, but that was in conjunction with the Mandalay Bay security.” One member of hotel security at first engaged with the gunman, then “backed off” and coordinated with police until the Swat team arrived. Lombardo praises the “fantastic” work of the hotel security, and citizens who worked to help each other in the chaos. “I don’t want anybody assuming that they would be unsafe by staying at one of our hotels.” A reporter asks about police training, and whether the sheriff is concerned. “Of course I’m concerned. The world has changed. Who would have ever imagined this situation. I couldn’t have imagined it. For this individual to take it upon himself to create this chaos and harm is unbelievable.” Sheriff Lombardo says police have completed the investigation at the Reno property. He says they recovered evidence there: “numerous electronic items, additional five handguns and two shotguns and a plethora of ammunition.” “We have served search warrants at three separate locations. the room at the Mandalay Bay, the Mesquite location and the Reno location.” Someone asks what are the modifications on the weapons. Lombardo says Alcohol Tobacco &amp; Firearms are working on that, but that he can say he’s aware of a modification called a “bump stop”, that can make up a semiautomatic to function more like an automatic weapon. Asked about the gunman’s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, he says that he can’t provide details but that she is on communication with police and they anticipate working with her in the investigation. He does not say her current whereabouts: “all I know is the Philippines.” He categorizes her as “a person of interest”. He again warns that he will not have many specifics to give out. “There is a lot of information I do know. Okay. But it’s an ongoing investigation. And when I say I do not know, I may know.” Asked about injuries, he says that he believes the count has decreased slightly because of a “double-count issue” at one of the hospitals. “We have trampled injuries, we have people trying to escape and injuries of their own device, we have gunshot wounds, so if you’re looking at total injuries,” he says, “it goes across the board.” The sheriff says that the city appreciates the outpouring from the public and corporations, but that officials are struggling to handle logistics as well as the investigation and services for victims and their families. There comes a point where we can’t manage it. The Red Cross is unable to manage it. If it’s hard goods such as water, or canned goods, or stuff that will not become perishable, Three Square and Catholic Charities are accepting donations. Commissioner Steve Sisolak next says that a GoFundMe for the victims has raised $3.7m so far, and a few private citizens have separately given several hundred thousand dollars. MGM Resorts, in turn, has donated an additional $3m. Nevada police have begun a press conference to update the public on the investigation into Sunday’s mass shooting in Las Vegas, one of the worst in modern American history. Sheriff Joe Lombardo speaks first. He stresses “it’s an ongoing investigation so it’s limited the details that I can give you.” “Our department has worked through the night to identify all of Sunday night’s shooting.” He says they have identified all but three victims, and the FBI are working to clear the crime scene at the hotel. He says that police anticipate Las Vegas Boulevard will open in the next few hours as the federal agents finish their work. “We’re asking for anyone who might have information about the shooting in a criminal capacity or you are a victim, call 311.” If you are out of state 702-828-3111. At the convention center, family reunification is still going on, where people can go to file missing persons report, contact the coroner, and ask for information. That phone number is 1-866-535-5654. San Juan mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz has responded to Donald Trump’s remarks that Puerto Rico’s recovery has “thrown our budget a little out of whack,” and his suggestion that the island has not suffered “a real catastrophe like Katrina.” “I would hope that the president of the United States stops spouting out comments that are hurtful to the people of Puerto Rico,” Cruz told CNN. “It doesn’t make you feel good.” Cruz described two extremely dissimilar meetings with White House staff. One was for the cameras, she said, in which Trump held court among various officials, praised many of them, and compared the catastrophe favorably to hurricane Katrina in 2005. “You can be very proud, only sixteen instead of thousands [killed] in Katrina,” he said. “Sixteen versus literally thousands.” This meeting, Cruz said, “was a public relations situation” that did not deal with the problems on the island. “We tend to judge human crises by the number of people who die instantly,” she said. “So of course when you say Katrina there were thousands, that doesn’t convey the message that people are dying on a continuum because they don’t have dialysis, they don’t have healthcare, they’re drinking out of creeks.” “Sometimes his style of communication gets in the way,” Cruz said, of accomplishing goals. “Rather than commander in chief he really becomes miscommunicator in chief.” The mayor briefly met the president at the Muniz air base earlier on Tuesday, and reportedly tried to tell him that their shared priority was to save lives, saying “it’s not about politics.” She echoed that point to CNN, saying: “it’s about respect for the Puerto Rican people and it’s about saving lives.” Cruz praised other federal officials in the Trump administration, saying that after the president’s remarks she and four other mayors spoke at length with officials from the budget office, small business administration, and other agencies. “There was a disconnect between what they were hearing and what was really happening,” Cruz said, calling this second meeting “productive”. She stressed the logistics involved in recovery, especially with communications and roads still in disarray, if not inaccessible, around much of the island. “We need robust centers of distribution, a robust supply chain that is not only robust but also consistent,” she said, adding that too often, “you get one pallet of water today you don’t get five for the next week.” She said that she and the officials talked about long-term planning with contracts, saying that they should set aside 20% of funds for municipalities, and create regional distribution centers to help re-establish supply lines around the island. “If you have a $1m contract, set aside $200,000 of that so that it is the municipality that does the work,” she said. The two meetings, she said, were “totally disconnected”. Cruz described one as “Alice in Wonderland” and the other as “back to reality”. “I saw a real connection between the reality and the White House staff,” she said. “I would love to say nothing more than to stand in front of the camera and to say we were heard and things are moving along,” she continued. But she said she could not, given the circumstances: “if we don’t have interconnectivity, if we don’t stabilize the hospitals, if we don’t have a robust supply chain…” Leaders of the House of Representatives have again delayed their plan to loosen regulations on gun silencers in the wake of the Las Vegas rampage. “We are all reeling from this horror in Las Vegas,” House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters on Tuesday. “This is just awful.” Lawmakers have indefinitely shelved the bill, supported by the National Rifle Association and a House committee last month, Ryan said. “I don’t know when it will be scheduled,” he said. House Republicans have also proposed a bill to let people with concealed-carry permits to take their guns across state lines. Earlier this year they delayed a vote on the silencer bill after a gunman attacked Republican lawmakers practicing baseball. Democratic leaders in the House have pushed for new gun rules in the wake of the shooting, though Republicans, who have stymied such efforts for years, control both chambers of Congress. The House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, and senators Richard Durbin and Chris Murphy have urged for background checks on all gun purchases. “Gun violence is a public health crisis,” Durbin said on Tuesday, invoking the mass shootings in Chicago, Oregon, and elsewhere in the last few years. “We failed to respond in time for those victims and their families. But if we work together, we can stop shootings in the future.” Pelosi asked Ryan to create a committee to research gun violence and recommend prevention solutions. But the effort appears largely symbolic: a bipartisan effort to expand background checks failed in the Senate in 2013, after the massacre of 20 children and six adults in Newtown, Connecticut. On Tuesday, senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, echoed the White House in saying that discussion of new gun rules would be “premature”. The president has met San Juan mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, according to the White House pool report, but the exchange was brief. On Tuesday Trump shook the hand of the San Juan mayor he publicly insulted, after declaring on Twitter on Saturday that she had “poor leadership.” According to the pool report, the pair “exchanged pleasantries,” and Trump asked Carmen Yulín Cruz how she was. Before meeting the president, Cruz said in a statement that she wanted to make clear to him that their shared priority should be “about saving lives, not about politics”. Trump accused Cruz of “poor leadership” over the weekend, after she criticized his acting secretary of Homeland Security, who called Puerto Rico “a good news story”. Cruz responded to the acting secretary with an impassioned speech: “If anybody out there is listening to us, we are dying, and you are killing us with the inefficiency and the bureaucracy.” Trump later criticized the work of Puerto Rican relief works, saying “they want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort.” He then called his critics “politically motivated ingrates”. On Tuesday he said that Cruz had “come back a long way”. NBC News’ Andrea Mitchell tweeted that, during their short encounter on the island, Cruz told Trump “it’s not about politics” and that “Trump didn’t answer then pointedly ignored her.” On Puerto Rico, the president is continuing along his tightly controlled press tour with residents, local officials and relief workers. At one location, toured the Cavalry Chapel, in south-east San Juan, he started tossing some supply items into the crowd, according to the White House pool report. Shaking hands with people in the crowd, the report reads, “picked up a can of tinned chicken breast and held it aloft for the crowd to see.” “He handed one man in the crowd a pack of batteries.” Then, as his wife followed him: “he held up a flashlight and showed it to the crowd, shaking hands the whole time.” “Trump kept picking up items from tables laden with supplies, showing them to the crowd and handing them to people with outstretched hands. ‘There’s a lot of love in this room,’ the president said. ‘Great people.’” The president “moved to a pile of yellow bags containing rice and handed them to whoever was nearest. He tossed rolls of paper towels into the crowd. Two were caught but one fell onto the carpet. The first lady was handing out small boxed solar panels.” According to the pooler, chief of staff John Kelly “conferred in quiet tones” with the director of FEMA, Brock Long. The University Medical Center of Southern Nevada has provided a few harrowing details of how its patients are faring in the aftermath of Sunday’s shooting. The hospital is the main critical trauma facility in the region, meaning that it has been at the center of efforts to save the lives of the worst injured people. More than 20 people were admitted in critical condition, the center said in a statement, and many still need breathing tubes. Many of the gunshot victims did not require surgery, but did need blood transfusions or chest tubes. The hospital took in 104 people in all in the hours after the attack. Anonymous law enforcement officials have told NBC News and CNN that the Las Vegas shooting suspect, Stephen Paddock, wired $100,000 to an account in the Philippines at some point before Sunday’s shooting. According to NBC, citing unnamed “senior law enforcement officials”, Paddock wired the money to an account there in the week before the shooting. His girlfriend, Marilou Danley, was born in the Philippines and was abroad at the time of the shooting. A law enforcement official also told CNN that Paddock wired $100,000 to an account in the Philippines, but similarly had no information about to whom it was intended. Police said Danley, who has been abroad since 25 September, is cooperating with them and plans to meet with investigators on her return to the US. They said at a briefing on Monday that Paddock, who checked into his hotel on 28 September, was seen on surveillance footage taking suitcases – now believed to be weapons – into his room alone. On Monday, las Vegas sheriff Joe Lombardo said that police have spoken repeatedly with Danley but believe her “at this time not to be involved” in the shooting. Dozens of off-duty police officers and firefighters were in attendance at the Las Vegas music festival on Sunday night. Several were injured or killed, or lost loved ones in the shooting. San Francisco police chief William Scott has identified one of the 59 killed as, Stacee Etcheber, the spouse of an SFPD officer. Stacee was taken in a senseless act of violence as her husband, SFPD officer Vinnie Etcheber, heroically rushed to aid shooting victims in Las Vegas on Sunday. Stacee was a beloved mother of two young children and a well-loved hair stylist in Marin County. As we grieve, we ask the public to keep the Etcheber family in their thoughts, along with all of the victims of this tragic incident.” The president is currently meeting with Americans on Puerto Rico who are struggling to rebuild in the wake of hurricane Maria. But his cohort is sparse: only his familiar aides and a select group of residents and leaders. He is expected to deliver more remarks over the course of the visit; the itinerary handed out by the White House shows that he intends to stay in and near the capital of San Juan. Despite the president’s effusive praise for federal recovery efforts, Puerto Rico’s situation remains dire, as the territory’s government makes clear on a site tracking its progress. Only 6.89% of the island has power and only 45% has potable water. In Puerto Rico’s north, on 13% has safe water. Flights are running at 25% capacity, and only 27% of ATMs are operating. More than 9,400 people are still in shelters around the territory. Much of the island has little to no capacity to communicate – meaning people do not know where to deliver supplies or how to get them. And the crisis is one that exacerbates with time: in 80-90F heat, with large areas of stagnant, often polluted water, health risks like mosquito-borne illnesses multiply. Although federal agencies have tried to tally the deaths during and after hurricane Katrina (between 1,100 and 1,833, depending on the count), the actual number will likely never be known. State officials continued counting victims for months after the storm had dissipated, of direct victims (people killed by drowning or debris, for instance), and of indirect victims, such as being cut off from medical care or lacking basic supplies in the aftermath of the hurricane. Trump continues to go name various cabinet members and administration officials around the room. He sees Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget chief. “Mick is in charge of a thing called the budget,” the president says. “I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you’ve thrown our budget a little out of whack,” he says, “because we’ve spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico. But that’s fine because we’ve saved a lot of lives.” “Every death is a horror but if you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina and the hundreds and hundreds of people who died,” he says, alluding to the 2005 catastrophe during and after which between 1,100 and 1,833 people died. “And you look at a storm like this which was really overpowering,” he continues, asking the governor what the current death toll on the island is. Rossello says 16 people were confirmed killed; officials have repeatedly said they expect the toll to rise. “You can be very proud, only sixteen instead of thousands in Katrina,” the president says. “Sixteen versus literally thousands.” In Puerto Rico, Donald Trump is addressing military and recovery personnel and the territory’s leaders. He recounts the string of hurricanes, Harvey, Irma and Maria, that swept through the Caribbean on paths toward US states and territories. “I was going to be here a week ago if you remember and that was the day of the hurricane,” the president says. He then goes on an extended litany of thanks to various federal officials, Puerto Rico’s governor and its congresswoman. “Brock has been unbelievable,” he says, to FEMA administrator Brock Long. He thanks Elaine Duke, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, who last week called the recovery a “good news story”, angering San Juan’s mayor. “This has been the toughest one, this has been a category five, which few people have ever even heard of,” Trump says. Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico as a category 4 hurricane. He thanks homeland security adviser Tom Bossert, and general Buchanan. “There’s no doubt about it you are a general,” he says. “I don’t want a general who plays games.” He thanks Governor Ricardo Rossello: “Your governor, he’s not even from my party and he started right at the beginning appreciating what we’ve been doing. He’s been tremendously supportive.” “Right from the beginning this governor did not play politics. He was calling it like it was,” Trump continues. “He was giving us the highest grades, and on behalf of our country I want to thank you.” “I also want to thank you congresswoman,” he continues, reading Jenniffer González-Colón’s name off a piece of paper. He says he “watched [her] the other day” and was happy to hear what she was saying. “It’s not about me and it’s about these incredible people from the military to FEMA and the first responders.” As Donald Trump arrives in Puerto Rico – Air Force One has landed and greeted Governor Ricardo Rossello and military personnel – Nevada’s leaders are still pleading for locals to give blood. At least 12 people remain in critical condition at the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, a spokeswoman said, and more than 500 others remain injured. Governor Ricardo Rosselló has arrived at Muñiz Air National Guard Base, where Donald Trump is due to arrive in the next few minutes. Rafael Lenin Lopez is one of the journalists also waiting for Air Force One. Canadian authorities have identified two more victims of the Las Vegas shooting, Ashifa Kassam reports from Toronto. CTV News has confirmed the identity of a third Canadian killed in the attacks: Calla Medig, of Jasper Alberta “My heart is numb knowing such a tragedy struck our small community,” Tessa Mac of Jasper said in a Facebook post. “Heaven is an even brighter place now that they have you Calla.” Another Canadian outlet, CBC, has spoken a Vegas bartender who, after coming across an injured Canadian who would later die from his gunshot wounds, spent more than five hours by his side, using his phone to break the news to his girlfriend and speak to his parents. “I couldn’t just leave him by himself,” she said. The international aid group Oxfam has announced it is joining the recovery effort on Puerto Rico, and accused the Trump administration of a “slow and inadequate response” to the crisis. “We are outraged at the slow and inadequate response the US government has mounted in Puerto Rico,” Abby Maxman, the president of Oxfam America, said in a statement. “Clean water, food, fuel, electricity, and health care are in desperately short supply and quickly dwindling, and we’re hearing excuses and criticism from the administration instead of a cohesive and compassionate response. “The US has more than enough resources to mobilize an emergency response but has failed to do so in a swift and robust manner.” The group said it would pursue “a two-pronged response” of lobbying Congress and federal agencies to send more resources and waive barriers to that aid. Oxfam has also sent a team to assess and counter the risks of unsafe water, areas without shelter, and cholera and other diseases. San Juan mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz has accepted an invitation to meet with Donald Trump, she has just announced in a statement. “This is about saving lives, not about politics,” she says. “I have been invited to attend a briefing with President Trump today while he visits Puerto Rico. I have accepted the invitation on behalf of the people of San Juan and out of respect for the American people represented by the office of the president of the United States. I will use this opportunity to reiterate the primary message: this is about saving lives, not about politics; this is about giving the people of Puerto Rico the respect we deserve; and recognize the moral imperative to do both. To save lives we need a robust and continuous supply chain of aid, we need to adapt standard operating procedures to local reality. And above all we need to cut the red tape. Open channels of communication are always good to have but they must produce much needed results. This is a humanitarian crisis and it must be treated with that sense of urgency. That is the only way to complete the only mission that matters: saving lives. That is what it is all about.” Trump attacked Cruz at length over the weekend after she pleaded for help and criticized the administration’s characterization of Puerto Rico as a “good news story”. “If anybody out there is listening to us, we are dying, and you are killing us with the inefficiency and the bureaucracy,” Cruz said on Friday. The president then accused her of “poor leadership” and said critics of his administration, which hesitated to waive restrictions on shipping to the island, were “politically motivated ingrates”. On Tuesday morning he said Cruz had “come back a long way”. CBS’s David Begnaud, on Puerto Rico since Maria made landfall there on 20 September, reports that the island has made a tiny improvement in its supply of electricity. The president is due to arrive around 11am local time. Governor Ricardo Rosselló is scheduled to meet with him, as is Kenneth Mapp, governor of the US Virgin Islands. A day after a gunman opened fire on a concert in Las Vegas, American officials are grappling with its aftermath – fighting to save lives in hospitals, struggling to reunite families, mourning and investigating – while also contending with a crisis off the mainland: the recovery of hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico. President Donald Trump is en route to the island early Tuesday morning, before any new updates from Nevada authorities on the Sunday night shooting. Here’s what we know: A gunman killed 59 people and wounded 516 when he opened fire from a 32nd-floor hotel room into the crowd at a country music festival on the Las Vegas strip. He had 23 guns in the room, including AR-15-style rifles, and another 19 and thousands of rounds at his home, in Mesquite, Nevada. He checked into the large, two-room suite on 28 September, and broke windows to fire outward. Authorities named the suspect as 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, a wealthy real-estate investor and gambler. Described by family as having no strong political or religious feelings, his motive remains unknown Trump called the attack “an act of pure evil” on Monday, and said he would visit Las Vegas on Wednesday. The White House resisted calls to consider new gun laws, saying it would be “premature” to discuss them. Republicans in Congress, set to loosen rules on silencers, delayed their plans. Before departing for Puerto Rico on Tuesday, the president broached the shooting. “What happened in Las Vegas is in many was a miracle,” he said. “The police department has done such an incredible job, and we’ll be talking about gun laws as time goes by.” Although police have not described the shooter’s mental health at all, the president called him “a sick man, a demented man, a lot of problems, I guess”. “We’re looking into him very, very seriously. We’re dealing with a very very sick individual.” On Puerto Rico, rescue and recovery teams are still struggling with the devastation on the island, where millions of people have limited or no access to safe water, electricity, shelter, or medicine. At least 16 people have died since hurricane Maria made landfall as a category-four storm on 20 September. The mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yulín Cruz, pleaded for help, saying on Friday: “if anybody out there is listening to us, we are dying.” Trump derided the mayor over the weekend, and said attacked critics who said his administration was slow to help Americans on the island, calling them “politically motivated ingrates”. The governor, Ricardo Rosselló, said that in an optimistic scenario 80% of Puerto Rico could have power by the end of October. Overall recovery for the territory, which was struggling with a long-running financial crisis before the storm, could take a decade. Rosselló ordered an indefinite curfew to deter crime. The president again defended the work of federal authorities – and again claimed that locals were not doing enough. He said Cruz has “come back a long way” but “we need their truck drivers to start driving trucks.” In Texas and in Florida, we get an A+. And I’ll tell you what, I think we’ve done just as good in Puerto Rico, and it’s actually a much tougher situation. But now the roads are cleared, communications is starting to come back. We need their truck drivers to start driving trucks. On a local level, they have to give us more help. But I will tell you, the first responders, the military, Fema, they have done an incredible job in Puerto Rico. And whether it’s her or anybody else, they’re all starting to say it. I appreciate very much the governor and his comments. He has said we have done an incredible job, and that’s the truth."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/03/rodney-bickerstaffe-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T16:06:25Z","webTitle":"Rodney Bickerstaffe obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/03/rodney-bickerstaffe-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/03/rodney-bickerstaffe-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Rodney Bickerstaffe obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"For more than three decades, Rodney Bickerstaffe, who has died aged 72, was one of the best known faces of the British trade union movement. Bickerstaffe, or “Bick” as he was almost universally known, was immediately recognisable by his dark, heavy-framed NHS spectacles and a shock of hair that had many comparing him with Buddy Holly. His tough, uncompromising oratory often held Labour and trade union conferences spellbound, but behind these rhetorical masterpieces, ferociously denouncing inequality and poverty wages, was a highly thoughtful, pragmatic and strategic union leader who could be mixing it with Arthur Scargill one day and Tony Blair the next. Bickerstaffe commanded loyalty and affection among the low-paid workers he fought for and represented, first as general secretary (1981-93) of the National Union of Public Employees (Nupe), then as associate general secretary and general secretary (1993-2001) of Unison, one of Britain’s largest unions, with 1.3 million members. Unison resulted from the first major trade union merger – between Nupe, the white-collar union Nalgo and the health workers’ union Cohse – which was engineered by Bickerstaffe, who believed that Nupe’s overwhelmingly low paid, blue collar membership could only benefit by coming together with the other more powerful unions. It was he, more than anyone else, who took up the cudgels for a basic minimum wage for all workers following the winter of discontent of 1978-79, when public sector workers went on strike against the Labour government’s social contract. For not only did poorly paid public sector workers not benefit from their protracted strike against the pay caps set by James Callaghan’s government, but its subsequent collapse heralded the election of Margaret Thatcher and the Conservatives. Bickerstaffe, who had come to national prominence at that time, anticipated the all-out assault on the ability of the trade union movement to organise and negotiate. He saw that the binmen and gravediggers – his members – had become useful scapegoats for Fleet Street editors focused on uncollected rubbish and the unburied dead. According to his longtime colleague in Nupe, Lord (Tom) Sawyer, Bickerstaffe believed that a minimum wage was absolutely essential to offer basic protection to the poorest paid. Yet at that time, it was opposed by many other trade unions, especially those in the manufacturing sector, in the belief that it aimed a dagger blow at wage differentials. Bickerstaffe would turn up urging a minimum wage at meetings attended, if he was lucky, by one man and a dog. Two decades later, the national minimum wage was introduced in April 1999 by Blair, a Labour prime minister with whom Bickerstaffe had little in common, yet for entirely practical and pragmatic reasons, maintained a good-natured working relationship. On one occasion, nearing his retirement, Bickerstaffe and his wife, Pat, were invited to Chequers, the prime minister’s country residence, for lunch. After the meal, an intermediary quietly informed him that Blair wished to offer him a peerage. He immediately and politely declined. Bickerstaffe was born in London, towards the end of the second world war. His mother, Elizabeth Bickerstaffe, a union activist from South Yorkshire, had been finishing her nursing training at Whipps Cross hospital in the heavily bombed East End during the blitz. Rodney was the result of a wartime romance. His father, Tommy Simpson – whom he never met – returned to Dublin and ceased all contact with the family. Much later, in the 1990s, Bickerstaffe’s quest to find his father finally led to his mother revealing his possible whereabouts. Tommy had died in 1991 but Bickerstaffe’s subsequent discovery of three half-brothers and a whole Irish family was not only a cause of huge delight to him, but helped further cement a long friendship with the former international development secretary, Clare Short, as she was reunited with her lost son, Toby. Bickerstaffe’s family tree can be traced back to the village of the same name near Ormskirk in Lancashire. At one time his mother’s family were so poor they lived in a Gypsy caravan in a field. Unsurprisingly, given his unstinting championing of the underdog, Bickerstaffe was one of the few public figures to loudly champion the cause of Travellers over the years. When he was still a small boy, his mother moved back to Yorkshire, and Bickerstaffe grew up in Doncaster. He went to Doncaster grammar school and studied sociology at Rutherford College of Technology (later part of Newcastle Polytechnic, now Northumbria University). His mother recruited her student son into the union movement and his rise was meteoric. He became a Nupe official in his late 20s and, moving from Yorkshire as an area officer to Newcastle, and later to London, Bickerstaffe launched a major campaign to recruit women to the union before becoming its local government officer in the dog days of the Callaghan government. He was appointed general secretary in 1981. During the bitter year-long miners’ strike of 1984-85, Bickerstaffe, along with Bill Keys, of the printworkers’ union Sogat, played a key role behind the scenes in offering support and battling for a settlement aimed at avoiding the mass closure of the coalfields. Bickerstaffe was one of the few who could talk directly to Scargill. Such was the concern among the trade union leadership that a combination of the obduracy of Scargill and Thatcher could end in a complete defeat for the miners that Moss Evans, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union, and Clive Jenkins, of the white collar ASTMS union, decided to try to have Bickerstaffe become TUC general secretary. But Bickerstaffe decided against, and Norman Willis duly assumed the post. Bickerstaffe, despite all attempts to get him to do so, would never betray his loyalty to the National Union of Mineworkers and indeed to Scargill, whatever his private misgivings about the latter’s strategic failings. Bickerstaffe surprised many when he announced his retirement from Unison at the age of 55, but in reality it was not a retirement at all. At the Labour party conference in 2000, he moved the successful resolution that linked the rise in pensions with earning or prices, whichever is higher, and in 2001 he succeeded Jack Jones as president of the national pensioners convention, which champions the rights of Britain’s 11 million pensioners. He became a passionate advocate of Palestinian rights, and president of War on Want, and chaired the Ken Gill Memorial Fund, dedicated to promoting the values of his old friend Gill, the internationalist and trade union leader. When union officials would turn to him in times of difficulty and stress, Bickerstaffe would invariably lift their spirits with what became something of a catchphrase: “Keep on keeping on.” In the years since his retirement Bickerstaffe had also been transferring papers, mementoes and videos to the Rodney Bickerstaffe Archive at the Modern Records Centre at Warwick University. Recently he expressed regret that he had not completed this mammoth task. Bickerstaffe is survived by Pat and their four children. • Rodney Kevan Bickerstaffe, trade unionist, born 6 April 1945; died 3 October 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"social-care-network/2017/oct/23/mum-wasnt-treated-prisoner-but-like-human-being","type":"article","sectionId":"social-care-network","sectionName":"Social Care Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T09:08:54Z","webTitle":"'Mum wasn’t treated like a prisoner, but like a human being'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2017/oct/23/mum-wasnt-treated-prisoner-but-like-human-being","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/social-care-network/2017/oct/23/mum-wasnt-treated-prisoner-but-like-human-being","fields":{"headline":"'Mum wasn’t treated like a prisoner, but like a human being'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When Elsa’s mum, Janet, was jailed for 10-and-a-half months last year, her daughter’s life changed in an instant. “Not having Mum there was the most awful thing,” says Elsa, now 15. “I felt like a huge part of my life was completely gone. Mum takes me to school, picks me up, takes me out, treats me. It’s not like my dad doesn’t do that, but it’s not the same relationship as you have with your mum.” For Janet, one of the most painful aspects of her sentence was the knowledge that her children would have to visit her in jail. “They’d never been anywhere like that and I thought I would be a huge embarrassment to them,” she says. Because Wales has no women’s prison, the journey to visit her would take an hour, across the border to Eastwood Park prison in Gloucestershire where all female prisoners from south Wales are sent. For some children in the west of Wales, it can be a six-hour round trip. On public transport, getting there and back in a day might be impossible. “I was completely distraught,” says Elsa, remembering her reaction to the prospect of visiting a prison. “I thought it would be awful, really scary. Most terrifying to me was [not knowing] how she lived there. Where was she sleeping? Was she getting enough food?” It’s these kind of fears that the Visiting Mum project aims to allay. Run by the Prison Advice and Care Trust (Pact) and volunteering charity Sova, the project is funded by the Big Lottery Innovation Fund and helps children from south Wales visit their mothers at Eastwood Park, with the aim of reducing the emotional distress caused to children and their mothers by incarceration. Given that the relationship between mental health and offending is well known, another aim is to reduce reoffending when women are released. In 2010, the Prison Reform Trust estimated that more than 17,240 children were separated from their mother through imprisonment. Despite the Welsh government’s adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, there is no national strategy in Wales for the children of prisoners, which means they receive little support. It’s hardly surprising: no data is routinely collected by local authorities about the children of prisoners in England or Wales, so nobody knows who they are. Dr Alyson Rees of Cardiff University recently published an overwhelmingly positive evaluation of the Visiting Mum scheme. She says that while mothers are imprisoned, children often have to live with relatives or friends and so may be in a different geographical area and have to move schools. “It’s a stigmatising thing to have a mother in prison,” says Rees. Only an adult can book a visit and as relationships between mothers and carers can become strained, this isn’t always as simple as it may seem. For children, the barriers to contact with a mother serving a custodial sentence can be very high. An alternative to ‘ordinary’ visits As well as solving some of the practical problems facing families by providing a volunteer to drive children, the Visiting Mum scheme also helps children explore their concerns about the prison environment. If the family wishes, their dedicated volunteer will spend time explaining what to expect as children go through security and will show pictures of the scenes they’ll encounter. Eastwood Park’s governor agreed thatspecial visiting arrangements could be made each month for children seeing their mothers. “On an ‘ordinary’ visit, which is just an hour, there can be 30 families in a room,” explains Sova volunteer Lynda Camilleri. “It’s noisy. The mum isn’t allowed to leave her chair, but children don’t want to sit down and chat because they’re kids, and there’s nothing the mum can do. She can’t go and paint or play with them, she can’t make a cup of tea or food for them. It’s important for kids to see their mum being a mum, but that can’t happen.” Under the Visiting Mum scheme, instead of several guards patrolling a packed visiting hall, there’s just one – the entire hall is given over to the family. “We set up the room. There’s a play area and we’ll do arts and crafts, games, [put out] breakfast things – brioche and croissants and tea and coffee. Mum can move around,” says Charlotte Parsons, families engagement manager for Pact at Eastwood Park. Camilleri, who has accompanied one set of children who hadn’t seen their mother for a whole year, says that having two full hours of quality time means that the vital parent-child bond, that could have been badly damaged, has a far better chance of being sustained through the mother’s sentence. “Even little things like taking a toddler to the toilet, she can do: that’s just not allowed on a normal visit.” For Elsa, who experienced ordinary visits too, the difference was stark. “There would be loads of other people there, it would be loud, and it was horrible to see her in a way that we had to do stuff for her, like make a cup of tea,” she explains. “We could sit next to her, hold her hand, but we weren’t allowed to go too close. With the [Visiting Mum] visits, which were so much more free, I could give her a hug whenever I wanted. It was lovely.” The scheme has been running for three years, and 167 children have been able to see their mother in a family friendly way because of it. Mothers who would have lost their relationship with their children have been able to nurture that bond. Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Prisons praised the scheme as “excellent” in its inspection last year. It costs £168,000 a year to run, covering two full-time workers, who carry out casework and parenting-relationship programmes, and a volunteer co-ordinator. Pact also produces information packs for teachers and social workers and runs events for professionals. But the funding has finished and no more has yet been found. “I’m sad,” says Parsons. “Today we had a lady [arrive] from Caerphilly. She wants to see her children and it would have been brilliant, but we’re not taking new referrals.” The impact of the scheme is obvious in the way Elsa recalls what two hours of private family time meant to her while her mum was in prison. “I really, really needed her. And this project helped me feel as if she was actually there for me. I had more phone calls with her and I felt safe, which I was really happy about. I don’t think, if it had been just normal visits, that I’d have felt that safe. And she wasn’t treated like a prisoner, but like a human being.” Some names have been changed Join the Social Care Network for comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

Rows of homes lead on to layered terraces that spill over with lush planting, forming a hidden multi-levelled oasis in the middle of Gospel Oak. “I can see the wooden screen that divides my terrace from my neighbours’, but it doesn’t spoil my view because it has slots in between,” he says. “But when I step out on to the terrace, I can’t see through it, because of the alignment of the planks, so it becomes a private space. That’s the kind of thinking architects do.” It is the kind of subtle thinking about the details of everyday living that was at the core of Brown’s ground-breaking designs for high-density, low-rise social housing in Camden in the 1960s and 70s, for which he has just been awarded the RIBA royal gold medal, the UK’s highest honour for architecture – 40 years after his last project in the country was completed. “It is an absolutely dumbfounding surprise,” he says, eyes wide with shock. “I’m in a state of tiswas about it. I stopped following architecture years ago, so I had no idea there was this renewed interest in my work until recently. I thought my buildings were a curiosity of the past that people had largely forgotten about.” Brown is now celebrated for his inventive housing schemes and enjoys the accolade of being the only living architect to have all of his work in the UK listed. But recognition has been a long time coming. For much of his professional life he was damned, unable to shake the stigma surrounding his final project in the UK. Stretching for 300 metres along a railway line near Swiss Cottage, the Alexandra Road estate is another concrete megastructure overgrown with lush terraced planting, with the air of a ziggurat. It is “the most architecturally celebrated housing scheme built in Britain in the last half-century”, writes Mark Swenarton, in a handsome new book on the pioneering projects built in Camden in the period, under borough architect Sydney Cook. Now grade II*-listed, the estate was over budget, beyond schedule and subject to an interminable public inquiry that finished Brown’s career – even though the findings of the inquiry finally exonerated the architect. “It was an absolute nightmare,” he recalls. “I couldn’t work in England ever again. And when Margaret Thatcher came to power, she swiftly destroyed everything we had worked for anyway, by scrapping social housing altogether.” A place of pilgrimage for architecture students and film location scouts alike, Alexandra Road is still a startling sight. Its raked stacks of studios and maisonettes form a marching crescent of concrete fins either side of a curving pedestrian street paved with red bricks, with cars swept down below. It feels like walking down the middle of a rocky canyon, exotic plants sprouting from every cleft, little staircases leading you up to front doors and raised walkways. Speak to the residents of the 500-flat behemoth – which also includes a school, pub, youth club and community centre – and you get an idea of the affection with which the place is held. “It makes me smile every day,” says Sara Bell, who has lived here since 1985. “I’ve always loved it. My kids could play out on the car-free street when they were growing up, and it’s such a sociable place to live. We formed a co-operative and redid the park, and we even make our own honey.” She grew up around the corner and remembers visiting the gleaming white structure with a friend when it was first built. “It was so futuristic, we were absolutely bowled over. We’d never seen anything like it.” The sheen didn’t last for long. Like many estates of the period, Alexandra Road fell into disrepair. Maintenance regimes were abandoned by the council and the great hulk was left to crumble, becoming a den of antisocial behaviour. “There was a time when you got a raised eyebrow or a look of sympathy if you said you lived here,” says Elizabeth Knowles, who has been on the estate since it was first built. “At one point no one would deliver to our flats, and if you were a pizza delivery boy you were likely to be relieved of your pizza before it reached its destination.” There is still the odd run-down, smashed-up apartment, but the place is looking in reasonable condition these days. This is largely due to the energy of the residents, who signed a collective letter in support of Brown’s nomination for the medal – the greatest testimonial an architect could wish for. Taking on renewed relevance in light of the Grenfell Tower fire, Brown’s work shows how high densities can still be achieved in low-rise form, his projects drawing on London’s fabric of streets and squares. “We were trying to come up with a proper English modernism,” says Brown, who, after a formative period at high school in the United States, went to study at the Architectural Association in London. There he met a like-minded group who went on to become some of the pioneering social housing architects of their day. “Instead of violating the environment with towers and slab blocks surrounded by undefined space, we wanted to do housing that acknowledged our traditions and made a piece of city.” He first tested his ideas in 1963, when he built a row of five “upside-down” houses for himself and a group of friends on Winscombe Street in Camden’s Dartmouth Park. Children’s bedrooms were placed on the ground floor, with big barn doors opening on to a communal garden; the parents’ bedroom and living room were at the top, while the family zone was in the middle, the whole connected by spiral stairs. “It was built as a community, an extended family,” he says. “When you heard children’s laughter downstairs, you were never quite sure if they were your kids or someone else’s.” The homes had to be built to the space standards and budget of the local authority in order to secure funding, so they were directly comparable to council housing. Yet, because of the cleverly arranged plan, they had a sense of space and openness that made them feel markedly more generous. They caught the eye of Sydney Cook, who hired Brown to scale up his ideas for the borough, in the form of 70 homes at Fleet Road and, later, Alexandra Road. “I didn’t know it then, but it was the prototype for what would come next,” he says. “It sounds pretentious, but the three schemes can be read as a thesis, from the house to the city. They all share the same details, from the arrangement of public and semi-public spaces, to the terraces and sliding doors. In each case, I didn’t think I was designing social housing, but just housing. Good London housing.” It is the kind of approach that sorely needs to be revived. There are signs that the recent reappraisal of Brown’s work is filtering through into a new wave of council-led housing projects. Peter Barber’s small practice, for example, is working on a dazzling range of low-rise, high-density housing schemes for a number of local authorities, reviving back-to-backs, courtyard homes and multi-levelled terraced housing, cleverly “notched” with patios. Brown is humbled that his buildings are being looked at afresh, but he fizzes with anger at the current state of UK housing. “Neoliberalism has stripped out the social ideology from our country and led to a ruinous economy with ruinous housing,” he says fiercely. “I’m an old, old man, so my answer is probably not the right one, but I think we need a new national agency to govern standards and fund the construction of housing for properly mixed communities – crucially with maintenance costs financed for the whole life of the building.” As someone who has lived through more than 20 governments and the effects of their successive housing policies, his advice is well worth heeding. • Cook’s Camden: The Making of Modern Housing by Mark Swenarton is published by Lund Humphries."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/live/2017/oct/03/the-great-british-bake-off-2017-episode-six-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T20:17:59Z","webTitle":"The Great British Bake Off 2017, episode six – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/live/2017/oct/03/the-great-british-bake-off-2017-episode-six-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/live/2017/oct/03/the-great-british-bake-off-2017-episode-six-live","fields":{"headline":"The Great British Bake Off 2017, episode six – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Another unexpectedly emotional climax, at least for me.

Kate has also – frabjous day! – pulled off a pie Paul loves. She’s not out of this yet! Stacey though. Her pie looks like a boxed-in top hat, and has paper in it. Not even Tom Petty could pull that off. She looks extremely and non-performatively stressed. Oh, Stacey. Stacey can’t balance her fruit on her wonky pie, but is still seeing the funny side. Sophie is still bailing out her pie-boat, and Yan steps in to help Steven with his decoration. What a wonderful group of people. Particularly Yan. Shimmer spray! Steven really is Baking Batman. Where does he get those toys. STACEY WHAT IS THAT. I think I saw a relative of that on Close Encounters Of The Third Kind. Steven is securing his pie inflation perimeter with string. I would buy a book of his top tips. The man knows what he’s doing and then some. Think it’s fair to say Noel’s off the leash now. That was a ludicrously silly voice. Who do we think is going? Julia is cracking under the stress, until Yan helps her remove her pie collar easily and safely. Stacey having problems with her own leaky crack, “I’m going for straight on one side, caved in on the other, with a floppy crust.” Stacey is actually being very funny this episode. Meanwhile Sophie is … extracting meat juices with a huge syringe. Note to self, do not get on her bad side. Was that chicken upset because the family were eating pork medallions and not...chicken? Adverts make no sense at all to me anymore. Quick Selasi check in: No, I don’t think he’s watching. I would devour Liam’s pie and it wouldn’t touch the sides. His adapting to an unfamiliar technique, live, is dicing with death though, surely? “There’s a bit of baking paper still in there,” says a horrified Stacey, staring at her pie like a one-glove surgeon over a freshly stitched belly. Everyone is struggling to remove pastry cases from moulds, like wriggling out of skinny jeans while drunk. Smooth Steven slides his out like a buttered otter. “Air holes,” he explains, which seems a bit harsh on his fellow contestants. Who was asking for a meat free pie BTL? Saint Stacey has heard your prayers. Yan is also going internal, hoping to distract judges with an incredible sounding chequerboard interior. I can barely spell chequerboard, let alone make one inside a pie. Respect. Under advice from Stacey (“Change it.”) Liam is placating Bossman by moulding his pastry on the outside of a bowl. Julia is sticking to her own inside-the-bowl guns. Looks like we got ourselves a ball game. Steven reining in his design instinct is an interesting move. He could play safe and consistent and definitely make the final, then pull out a wham bam thank you ma’am once expectations are lowered. But it’s not what an artist would do. Everyone is confronting their own natures this week. It’s got quite existential. “Should I keep bossman happy?” he ponders, of his delicious sounding, unconventional curry goat pie that he’s draped, unconventionally, on the inside of a tin. Once again, love him. Liam is making a turmeric pastry. “I don’t know if it’ll be that great. Should be alright.” Oh Icarus! You have flown too close to the sun! The concept is simple. It has to look like it was made in a factory,” reports Bake-a-tron Steven model 0071008. He doesn’t ever stop working while he talks. His hands are modular, self-autonomous cooking aids. Hand raised family pie makes me think of a Prue wet-nursing a baby individual pie, on some straw bedding. I don’t want to think about that, so the least I can do is make you picture it too. It’s a big pie, basically. Family meal deal. Or it’s when you re-do the bathroom after reading i-D magazine too much Lola, lamination involves alternately folding and resting butter and pastry in the fridge so that when it cooks you get flaky, croissant like layers. I once made cronuts, which took three days of lamination and rising and was a profound ballache. No sweet treat is worth that. No reason for this, but who says you need a reason Julia’s ‘plan’ is maybe my favourite piece of television ever. Nandos do pasteis? That is a game changer. I often walked into my local cafe near me and when they don’t have any, I walk straight out. Try and fob me off with a Danish. There’s no substitute. Judging time! Liam has no swirl, but he seems to have got away with his scrambled egg in a cup technique. Stacey has “huge amounts of issues” (no comment), and Julia can’t pull off any magic with her rank rough puff, which Paul dismisses in record time. She comes last, followed by Stacey, with Kate a neutral fifth. Sophie is second, and scooter battered Yan takes the top spot! Nice to see her up there. AAAAH! “I think they have got dark patches on them,” muses Kate, looking down at a full tray of charcoal nuggets. More of this incisive commentary every Tue, journalism fans. Can you imagine going on this show and not being dumped out in the first week having got everything wrong? Baking is hard. Also, Julia describing anything she makes as “absolutely rank” is a highlight. Dying at all these serious voices saying ruffpuff over and over again. Apologies to any Madelines who are reading! You’re not boring, you shall inherit the earth. (Legal disclaimer: you won’t.) THERE! That’s the place! The monastery at Belem. I don’t remember any of that stunning Renaissance architecture and history. I remember the softness of the sugar, profound crisp of pastry, and the luxuriance of the custard ocean inside. Oh the memories. These are my Proustian madeleines. Actual madeleines are boring. Not us of course, we want nothing to do with that. Noel (flirting?) with Julia, telling her Portugal has the most beautiful people in it. People say that about whichever country in Europe they last visited, though, don’t they? I think it’s just Europe. Lovely Kate’s forgotten how to fold pastry and has, in her own words, “no idea what I’m doing.” She is possibly not long for the tent. Sandi promises to update her dating profile, in another affectionate pop at her mystifying spinsterhood. Campaign to get Julia and Kate to say “rough puff” every 2 minutes. Julia in particular sounds like an anxious magician. Omg omg omg. I have a gooey soft spot for pasteis de nata. I’ve been to that famous Portugese bakery that sells them in cardboard tubes like cannon ammunition, and bought about 50. Heaven. I felt, if you’ll pardon my Portugese, like a real Lisboner. Custard tart to you and me Love it when Liam turns Hackney Philosopher. Decent....decent.” Liam smashes it! Go on. Stacey’s pies are incredibly pretty to look at too, and she wins the Academy Award for combating moisture in mince. Her reaction is a model of grace and modesty, which … what are you playing at, producers? I was going to be nice anyway, and now you’ve just confused me. Once again LOL at Liam’s “Standard FC decorative pies.” Standard. Football. Club. For those moments when a blue shirt becomes self-aware. Yan’s pastry is buttery and flaky and perfect, but her chicken is dry, and her decoration formless. “… It is pastry week?” she counterargues. What a noble chancer. Love a bit o’ backchat. Soggy Botoooooom vegetarian faces sorry There’s something upsetting about eating pink mash, sniffs Prue, as Paul inverts all Steven’s pies, so the carefully wrought hearts tumble to the floor. “Disappointing” Julia is chastised like a schoolgirl for her paprika-heavy pie, while Kate’s vegetarian faeces are a bit sloppy. Sophie’s beautiful pies are described as a triumph. Paul dusts off his hand as if readying for a shake, then turns away with a “thank you.” WHAT a cad. That Oetker cupcake has more identities than James McAvoy in an M Night Shyamalan film. Ooh, judging time. ‘That’s a milk wash.’ Sophie demonstrates a rare activation of her bullshit mode. Good to see she’s got it in the arsenal. Get that quiche in, Tinyismynewt! Remember to adjust for fan assist. That was surprisingly high concept for a Pets At Home advert. Of course Liam hasn’t bought his own clock. “Can you let me know when there’s 30 seconds left please?” Love him. (In real life, he’s no doubt awful. TV lies, remember!) (They are both exceptional comic performers elsewhere!) GOOD GOD the return of the Noel and Sandi comedy skit. This time, an acceptable joke about Noel “glazing over” is explained into the ground. Julia offers Noel some raw meat, which he declines on the grounds of not being a wolf. I bet dinner at hers is a high stakes tombola. Steven looks like he’s extruding pink McNugget meat into his pie. Presumably it’s going to end up the greatest dish ever created, but … how? Liam in comic dudgeon sounds EXACTLY like a chicken. Paul threatens to kick him out for supporting Manchester United, and a flabbergasted Liam addresses – who? The camera operator? It’s an eye-line I can’t remember seeing before. Sophie has “been fighting moisture problems the whole time,” which I am leaving well alone. But what the hell is that cat o’ nine tails looking device she’s scoring her shortcrust with? Noel is more perturbed she’s not baking a monkey or a sloth, or himself, as they are all arboreal denizens. Paul finds the bants too weird and checks out. Love it when three oddballs don’t quite click. She may have said vacuum sealer. Yan is using a vacuum cleaner to make her meat suck up spices? Will they be able to broadcast that? Ian from the year before that vociferously agreed. The coveted Hide and Slide ovens are in fact the bakers’ bane. I bet Paul fiddles with the settings, too. Speaking of which, fabulous Baker Boy Andrew from last year got in touch to explain how Sophie’s oven incident can easily occur: That pile of gibberish/esoteric information on Yan’s pad is apparently “the equation for the perfect pie.” She is amazing. Although, she is setting the bar quite high for herself. Most other bakers would have bullet points on their hands reminding them to turn the oven on. (See Sophie, last week.) Fleetwood Mac! Finally the man is talking sense. Adore them. There better be Fleetwood Mac n’ Cheese in one of those daddies, though, or he’s missed a trick. Steven looks unimpressed with everything, even when merely explaining the three ingredients in shortcrust pastry. (That’s just his face though; he’s clearly a passionate and focused baker.) Some things I love about Enfield Scientist Yan is that she is making a Science Pie (not a thing) and referring to it as Geek Pie, a Nathan Barley reference. Utterly on-message. “Four pies” is very much the blue shirt of the signature challenge world. Noel’s top this week has a sort of ladybird Ziggy Stardust appeal, while Sandi is wearing 101 dalmation coloured cats. Prue looks like Timmy Mallett has been invited on to the Captain’s table and panicked, while Paul is wearing a blue shirt. He don’t play those games. That was an admirably weird opening sequence, with a late-forming Life of Pi payoff. And Prue standing alone on a bridge, like Hasselhoff on the Berlin wall. In fairness, it’s true that TV producers quickly establish a narrative for these “characters”, editing footage to further that. But anyway, I’m WAY ruder about Prue, and I think she’s great. Ooh, here we go! That cupcake gets more disturbing each week. Here is your UNSEASONED, BLAND meal, sir. Last week a few people thought I was being too mean to Stacey, so this week I am going to be overly nice to everyone, in a sort of passive aggressive way. I’m a delight, yes? Tom Petty really could wear a top hat, couldn’t he? It’s very hard to wear a top hat. Hero. Did anyone just see a weather report with no weather forecaster? Just a disembodied voice. Very er, chilling. Hubert you are a man(?) with a checklist and a good attitude. Are you all in your pyjamas? Do you have snackables to hand? Better to go to the toilet now than later. Let us bingo, brothers and sisters. Liam doing a bogle after pulling off a bakewell. (Again.) Sophie mouth-smiling at Steven, eyes telling a different story. Yan further inhabiting a mad cockney scientist persona. Noel quizzing a contestant on whether the material world exists. Julia making noises that resemble the mating cry of a partridge, and there being consequences. It’s pastry week, and thank god. After “caramel 24 ways Tuesday” my arteries need some choux and short crust to cut through all the sugar. (You’re welcome, body.) Several fan favourites have been in jeopardy recently, and we’ll lose another baker tonight. That’s not a surprise, you know how the show works. But that doesn’t mean it won’t hurt. If their puff is deflated, or the suet doesn’t do it, they’ll be shown the door. Or whatever a tent has for a door. Usually just a flap, right? Paul Hollywood will show them his flap. I’ll be here at 8pm to chart the highs and lows as they unfold, and I’d love for you to join me!"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"housing-network/2017/oct/05/impact-universal-credit-video-council-tenant","type":"article","sectionId":"housing-network","sectionName":"Housing Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T09:53:07Z","webTitle":"'In a year, not one payment correct': a council tenant on universal credit misery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2017/oct/05/impact-universal-credit-video-council-tenant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/housing-network/2017/oct/05/impact-universal-credit-video-council-tenant","fields":{"headline":"'In a year, not one payment correct': a council tenant on the misery of universal credit","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The government has been warned by councils, charities and now even its own backbenchers that universal credit is a social policy disaster. But how does it feel to be on the receiving end of this controversial benefits overhaul? In the video, visually impaired council tenant Jo King, who lives on Newcastle’s Newbiggin Hall Estate, talks about dealing with delays and miscalculations ever since she was moved on to universal credit over a year ago. She explains how she has twice been left without any benefits at all. In order to survive, she was forced to stop paying her carer and request emergency food parcels. Her rent, which under a special arrangement is supposed to go direct to management organisation Your Homes Newcastle, has been consistently miscalculated, leaving her anxious and fielding regular calls from her rent officer. King’s plight is not unusual. Newcastle city council’s own figures show that by the end of June, 86% of tenants in the city receiving universal credit have fallen into rent arrears and the council has warned the system is putting vulnerable residents at risk of destitution and homelessness. Before universal credit was rolled out, only 53% were in arrears. Other councils have encountered similar problems. A survey in July by the Association of Retained Council Housing found that 73% of tenants on universal credit were in arrears – up from 31% under the old housing benefit system. The Trussell Trust, which runs food banks across the UK, has also reported problems. In areas with full universal credit there has been a17% increase in referrals for food parcels, more than double the national increase. However, the government is pressing ahead regardless. From October, the rollout of universal credit to disabled people and families is set to increase from five to 50 new areas a month. At the Conservative conference on 1 October, work and pensions secretary David Gauke suggested that there would be no rethink and people facing difficulties could claim emergency advance payments.

It’s a concept album too, its lovers lost in a post-oil urban dystopia apparently modelled on Lewes’ bonfire night celebrations.

In comments made at a meeting of his Likud party at the large settlement of Ma’ale Adumim, Netanyahu said he would support the “Greater Jerusalem” bill. The bill, pushed by rightwing MPs, would annex 19 settlements around Jerusalem, placing them within the city’s municipal boundaries. The legislation, drawn up by Yisrael Katz, a member of Likud and minister in Netanyahu’s coalition, is expected to be introduced in the winter session of the Israeli parliament, the Knesset. Ma’ale Adumim is a settlement of roughly 40,000 people just east of Jerusalem. It is considered strategic because it lies in the centre of the West Bank, and making it part of Israel could greatly hinder Palestinian statehood aspirations. “Ma’ale Adumim will always be part of Israel and in addition I support the Greater Jerusalem bill,” Netanyahu said during the meeting. He added that he was considering including Ma’ale Adumim within the same plan. “I am also weighing placing Ma’ale Adumim within the boundaries of Greater Jerusalem within the context of the Greater Jerusalem bill,” he said. “We will build thousands of housing units here,” he said. “We will add the industrial zone needed and the expansion needed to allow for the advanced development of this place … This place will be part of the state of Israel.” Observers have noted an increase in visits by Netanyahu to settlements in the occupied territories since Donald Trump was sworn in as US president in January. Since Trump took office – and despite requests by the US president to hold back on settlement building – an emboldened Netanyahu government has pushed forward with a steady stream of announcements on settlement building. The Palestinians seek the West Bank, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, as part of a future independent state, and consider all of Israel’s settlements to be illegal – a position that is widely shared by the international community. Israel says the settlements’ fate should be resolved through negotiations. Nabil Shaath, a senior adviser to the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, called Netanyahu’s comments “totally unacceptable”. “This is an attempt by Netanyahu to destroy the two-state solution and a clear refusal of any attempt to revive the peace process, especially by the United States,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/03/enable-raises-hopes-2018-return-prix-arc-triomphe-win-john-gosden-horse-racing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T13:44:00Z","webTitle":"Enable ‘in great form’ after Arc glory to raise hopes of 2018 return","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/03/enable-raises-hopes-2018-return-prix-arc-triomphe-win-john-gosden-horse-racing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/03/enable-raises-hopes-2018-return-prix-arc-triomphe-win-john-gosden-horse-racing","fields":{"headline":"Enable ‘in great form’ after Arc glory to raise hopes of 2018 return","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Enable is recovering well from her exertions when she was a runaway winner of the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe at Chantilly, giving real reason for hope the star filly will be kept in training next year. John Gosden, her trainer who has won two of the last three Arcs, estimates a decision on Enable’s future could be taken any time from the end of next week. “She’s in great form, she got back in very good order,” Gosden said between lots at the famous Book 1 sale at Tattersalls in Newmarket, generally regarded as the most important yearling auction in Europe. “She’s had a nice little walk and a lead-out yesterday, and a nice little walk and a trot and a pick of grass today. She has one cut on a hind leg from the race but when you run in a big Arc, you’re lucky to get away with that.” Enable still figures in some betting lists for a couple of races on Champions Day at Ascot a fortnight on Saturday but her trainer squashed any suggestion she might be asked to run again so soon after her moment of greatest triumph on Sunday. “Obviously she’s not running again this year,” Gosden said of Enable, who has won five Group One races in the past four months. “She’s done everything that we could begin to dream of and she’s done it so well. We’ll see how she is over the next 10 days and then Prince Khalid will make a decision as to whether she races next year.” Gosden is too diplomatic to open those negotiations through the medium of the press but there is no doubt he would love to have her for another summer’s racing. “She’s really only had 10 months’ racing in her life and, to that extent, she’s had one good season. It would be wonderful if she was in great order and could race again next season. I think she’d be a bit of a crowd-puller. “Before the Arc, she weighed more than she did for her first race of the year, which is pretty unusual, very unusual. She’s got a great constitution. She obviously lost weight from the race and the trip, she just went through the Channel Tunnel twice, after all. We eat on the way, they don’t eat quite so much!” Gosden revealed he had been affected by some of the pre-Arc nerves radiating from various pundits, who fretted that no three-year-old filly trained in Britain had ever won the race. “You have an awful lot of pressure, with a lovely filly like that. A lot is expected and then everyone saying: ‘Oooh, is she racing too late in the year, has she been doing too much?’ She was expressing herself as if she was in top order. My initial reaction was massive relief and then great joy for the filly to have achieved what she’s achieved and for someone like Prince Khalid to breed such a filly. It’s not easily done.” Gosden and another of his owners, Anthony Oppenheimer, surprised many by opting to skip the Arc with Cracksman but the consequence is they now have the clear favourite for the Champion Stakes. Gosden confirmed the colt will be aimed at that Ascot race and is “in great order”. Of the step back in distance to 10 furlongs, he said: “He’s won at that distance, he’s strengthened, he’s sharpened a lot, so I think he’ll be fine.” Gosden is not just buying on his own account at these sales. He is also advising Sheikh Mohammed’s Godolphin operation and is credited by some observers with guiding Godolphin away from its previous policy of boycotting the progeny of stallions based at Coolmore Stud. “The past is the past and we all move forward,” was all Gosden was willing to say about that, moments after standing with the Godolphin team as a son of Galileo, out of the Guineas runner-up Jacqueline Quest, was knocked down to them for 400,000 guineas. By the end of the day, Godolphin had paid £1.8m for three Galileo yearlings.

Its distinction – apart from that – is that it has only nine seats. So it has a star for every three diners, surely a first even for Michelin, whose brand is built on signifiers of exclusivity. “Small” is anything from 40 covers or fewer: nine is about as small as it gets. All small restaurants have one thing in common, which is that you can’t shout or guffaw, have an argument, talk about sex or Brexit, or do anything you wouldn’t otherwise do into a stranger’s ear. That is the only atmospheric standard, since small runs the complete economic spectrum: the Fat Duck has barely any covers because it is so classy that you wouldn’t want to see its chefs cooking for a horde, any more than you would want to see Picasso painting a peace mural the length of the Berlin Wall. There is no dress code, but your behaviour code is “reverent”. Other places are small because they don’t have big venture capital – or, indeed, any capital – and were mustered by the blood, sweat and tears of the (usually) owner-chef. A visit to Mary-Ellen McTague’s Aumbry in Prestwich, outside Manchester, was like walking into her front room. You could smell her hopes and dreams baked into the very walls, and root for them with all your heart. It was immersive, like going to a Hobbit’s house and getting drawn into one of their incredibly important, hairy-footed psychodramas. The food has to be really good for this effect, which, at Aumbry, it was. When it was closed temporarily for refurbishment, it reopened as a central Manchester pop-up. Which brings us to the pop-up. Pre-recession openings were all about the mega-restaurant, giant 200-seat affairs with spangly drop-lights; post-recession, there is a more fluid (read: skint), it-might-work-it-might-not approach, which manifests in tiny spaces, counter-eating and a walk-in policy that more or less guarantees that, if the place is any good, all the young people will get there before you. This works best in aggregate, a pop-up snack emporium, where you can always go nextdoor if all six or so seats at Mamalan are taken. Broadway Market in Tooting is fabulous for this at the moment. There is a restaurant in Lisbon, Taberna da Rua das Flores, that is so small it has a “table for two” that is actually two cushions on the stairs. It will serve you dog whelks 19 different ways and blow your mind, but you are still on the stairs. There is a point where small becomes absurd, and as you eat you can feel yourself becoming too big for the restaurant, like Alice in Wonderland. A side order of surreal is fine, but a big squashy banquette is kinder to your soul. • This article was amended on 5 October 2017 to correct a hoard/horde homophone."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/03/england-joe-hart-gordon-banks-slovenia-world-cup-2018-qualifiers","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T21:30:11Z","webTitle":"Joe Hart: ‘Playing for England was what other people did, I just supported’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/03/england-joe-hart-gordon-banks-slovenia-world-cup-2018-qualifiers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/03/england-joe-hart-gordon-banks-slovenia-world-cup-2018-qualifiers","fields":{"headline":"Joe Hart: ‘Playing for England was what other people did, I just supported’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Joe Hart has first-hand experience of that sickening sense of helplessness, the one that grips any opponent whenever the ball veers towards Harry Kane alone inside the penalty area. He endured it a little over a week ago at the London Stadium. He would have been aware out of the corner of his eye of the forward loitering menacingly in the centre as he watched Dele Alli break beyond West Ham United’s defence and sprint down the left side of his box. Hart was still chuntering at that concession when, moments later, he blocked Alli’s shot with his right thigh only to see the loose ball dribble inexorably onto the striker’s left foot. There was an inevitability about everything that followed, the goalkeeper’s desperate dive, with Hart left lowering his head to the turf in frustration. Everything Kane touches at present is flying in. The only consolation for the Manchester City loanee is that for the next few days at least, Kane is a team-mate rather than an adversary. “He is hot, isn’t he?” Hart said. “You just know you will get a hard shot with Harry. If you give him half an inch he will get a strike away on goal and make you work. There is no real secret to him and that is the brilliance of Harry. It is not dazzling skills. He is just brilliant at what he does, putting it in the corner. He is one of the best out there. He keeps scoring goals and you cannot ask for any more than that. Long may it continue in an England shirt.” Where Hart’s West Ham suffered – just as Malta, Everton, Borussia Dortmund, Apoel Nicosia and Huddersfield Town did in September – the England goalkeeper hopes Slovenia will follow suit. Kane has been unstoppable for the past month, with 13 goals in eight appearances for club and country. There have been five in his past four England games, going back to that timely equaliser at Hampden Park at the start of the summer. Maintain this kind of form and should passage be secured to the World Cup finals with success on Thursday, then England can hope to travel to Russia propelled by a player capable of taking the tournament by storm. “He is scoring as many goals as the people we relate to as being world-class, and he has been doing it for many seasons,” Hart said. “Harry gets put in that bracket, and he deserves to be. “He has Mauricio Pochettino [at Spurs], one of the hottest managers in the world, who regards him so highly, and there are reasons for that. Harry will keep being Harry and will keep scoring goals. I see that belief in him. Some of the rubbish that came his way when he did not score in August – but I still regarded Harry as the one you saw at the end of September with the same frightening number of goals. “Whether he keeps his form, scores 40 goals or ends up with 20, he is still a top player and we are lucky to have him. We have others in our squad, like Marcus Rashford, or Jermain Defoe who always has a goal in him, and a fully fit Daniel Sturridge is one of the best I’ve ever seen or played with. We have some top players. So lining up behind this team feels good and I feel we can do something. It’s down to us to do it.” With qualification tantalisingly close, England find themselves in that familiar position of hoping, praying, that next summer can be different. That potential will finally be fulfilled and talent realised. Hart has been here plenty of times before. As the most-capped player in Gareth Southgate’s squad, with an England career that will have stretched back a decade by the time the World Cup kicks off, he has been to four major tournaments. Yet, for all the encouraging qualification campaigns, those events in South Africa and Ukraine, Brazil and France have realised only four England victories. Hart will overtake Gordon Banks’s 73 caps by starting Thursday’s game at Wembley, and would equal David Seaman if he plays in Vilnius on Sunday but personal landmarks are not a priority. “It was never a dream to play for England because I just loved playing football, and to play for England was what other people did,” he said. “I just loved to support. So to play for my country is the proudest thing I could ever do and to have this many caps is amazing. But the most important thing for me is to do something with that. I have qualified for tournaments – that is done. It is not about qualifying any more. It is about trying to hunt down and be a part of that special moment when England do well at a tournament. I want to be part of that. I want to add to qualifying. “I feel great behind this team. It really excites me and fascinates what we have to offer but I have always felt that way. That is the worrying thing. People have always asked me what is the key and what needs to be different in a tournament. I cannot give an answer. If I could I would have a lot better record in tournaments. “I believe in the squad from the bottom of my heart. I believe we are capable but there is a big difference in believing in something and doing it. That is why we want to qualify on Thursday and take a good performance on Sunday and then look forward to making a big impact at this tournament. And use the belief and the quality to do so.” Stones: England not over-reliant on Kane John Stones has insisted England will not become over-reliant on the prolific Harry Kane and has talked up the strength of the collective within the squad. The centre-half’s manager at Manchester City, Pep Guardiola, referred to Tottenham Hotspur as “the Harry Kane team” over the weekend with the forward having scored 13 goals in September for club and country. However, Stones, who is set to start alongside Gary Cahill against Slovenia on Thursday when a win would secure a place at the World Cup finals, believes Kane would be uncomfortable with such a tag when it comes to the national side. “I think if you spoke to Harry and asked him, he would say he would not want it to be like that because that is the type of guy he is – a team player,” Stones said. “He knows the jobs and roles of everybody else and knows what he can bring into the team, and he is a massive part of it. I definitely think he would not want it to be like that and he would want to be known as part of an England team that won things and played great football, whoever was in the team. “Personally, I don’t think it matters who scores as long as the ball goes into the net. If Harry scores a hat-trick and we win, he is not a selfish guy – he will make sure that it is known that we won because everybody has done their job. That is the type of the guy he is.” Stones has played alongside the striker through England’s junior ranks from under-19s level and has charted the Spurs forward’s eye-catching progress in that period. “Everyone can see he is improving and has set the standard for himself,” he said. “He has scored consistently every season and bettered himself each season. On a personal note, I know he is working hard off the pitch to make sure that happens, so it is great to see him doing the business for his club. I know how hungry he is to keep improving. He has everything.” Stones has been in fine recent form and was a key performer on Saturday as City imposed themselves impressively upon Chelsea to claim a 1-0 victory. Replicating that proactive style with the national team remains an aspiration for England’s players. “We have got the players to do that,” added Stones. “It is difficult to bring how you play in the Premier League into international football – it is so different – but we are always striving to be better and there is a lot of likeness between how City play to international football, as with Tottenham and various other club.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2017/oct/04/lifting-police-pay-cap-morale-public-sector","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T06:23:21Z","webTitle":"Lifting the cap on police pay won't magically raise morale","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2017/oct/04/lifting-police-pay-cap-morale-public-sector","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/public-leaders-network/2017/oct/04/lifting-police-pay-cap-morale-public-sector","fields":{"headline":"Lifting police pay cap in England and Wales won't magically raise morale","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Conservative government may have hoped that lifting the public sector pay cap for police officers would make it easier for police forces to recruit and retain officers. But the distinctive nature of the police sector means this remains unlikely. A number of factors, including low morale, low unemployment levels and relatively high inflation, mean that the government’s recent decision to lift the public sector pay cap for police officers is unlikely to improve recruitment and retention problems. Since 2010 public sector workers have faced, first a pay freeze and then, from 2013, a pay cap of 1%. In December 2016 the independent Police Remuneration Review Body (PRRB) recommended officers should receive a pay increase of 2.8%. Following the Conservative’s failure to secure a majority in June’sgeneral election, due in some part to austerity politics such as the public sector pay cap, ministers recently announced that for police officers, at least, the pay cap would be lifted. They would receive a 1% rise plus a 1% bonus, funded from existing budgets. But I fear this will not make it easier for police forces to recruit and retain officers. The Institute of Fiscal Studies has produced a briefing note looking at the retention of police officers in England and Wales. Its key findings were: police officers, unlike virtually all other occupations in the UK, have security of tenure, are not employees and cannot be made redundant fluctuations in the size of the police officer workforce are largely driven by changes in entry rates rather than exit rates Forces located in areas where there are better outside local labour market opportunities, eg higher wages and lower unemployment are statistically associated with higher resignation rates. The IFS report suggests that the government’s changes on pay for police officers will have little, if any, positive effect on retention rates. This is due to the unusual nature of the police labour market. But in addition, the pay freeze and subsequent pay cap that officers have endured since 2010 has resulted in a 14.6% real term reduction in pay, according to the PRRB, whichfound 71% of officers said pay and benefits had a negative effect on morale. With inflation reported at 2.9% last month and unemployment at its lowest levels since the mid 1970s it is unlikely that the government’s very modest rise will improve recruitment and retention problems of police forces. That’s certainly the view of Calum Macleod, vice chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, who said that the decision on the pay cap has been “dressed up to sound like a rise” – but in actual fact is not and relies on chief constables to find the funds. Macleod has said that officers are angry and dismayed, adding that there are no signs whatsoever that the pay rise has boosted morale and in fact it has just served to cause more contempt.

He was instantly recognisable for his large spectacles and thick curly hair and moustache, which over the years turned from dark brown to grey. The switch to acting came when Ken Loach auditioned comedians for straight roles in his two-part drama The Price of Coal, written by Barry Hines, set in the coalfields of Knutt’s native South Yorkshire and screened in 1977, the year of the Queen’s silver jubilee. It was a process the director had followed for many years, as when he cast Duggie Brown in the 1969 film Kes (Brown was also in The Price of Coal), impressed by these performers’ lack of self-consciousness and ability to think on their feet. Knutt landed the leading role of Sid Storey, whose social and political awareness makes him the voice of miners who are implored to tighten their belts at a time of economic crisis while the pit bosses are planning an expensive facelift in advance of an official visit by the Prince of Wales. When the big day comes, Sid and his colleagues are working underground. Then, in the darker second, linked play, he is one of the survivors of a pit explosion. “I was never really a joke-telling type of comedian,” said Knutt. “I had routines that featured characters and I used lots of mimicry, so it felt like the part was made for me. My character was a bit to the left of Lenin, you might say, in his politics, but that was all because he wanted the best for his family and fellow workers. I just seemed to take to the role.” This was the beginning of Knutt’s 40-year acting career. In TV soaps, he had an on-off role in Coronation Street between 1980 and 1983 as Ron Sykes, who employed Brian Tilsley at his garage and eventually sold it to him, and in Emmerdale he played Albert Dingle (1995-97 and 2004) – brother of Zak and father of Marlon – who served a string of jail sentences for crimes such as stealing Eric Pollard’s car and committing armed robbery. More recently, Knutt joined the cast of the sitcom Benidorm for its 2016 and 2017 series. He played Eddie Dawson, first seen when going through a messy divorce and invited on his son Billy’s family holiday, much to the disenchantment of his daughter-in-law, Sheron. Knutt was born Robert Wass in Sheffield, son of George, a surface grinder in a steel foundry, and his wife, Nellie (nee Devey), who scrimped and saved to bring up Robert and his younger sisters, Helen and Tina. “We didn’t have enough cash for my mum to buy me any sweets,” he recalled, “so she would make up a cone of paper and put some sugar and cocoa powder in that, and I’d wet my finger and dip it in. Nothing tasted so good.” Later, he discovered that George was not his real father, and that he was the result of an affair his mother had with an American soldier during the second world war. Wass attended Nether Edge and Abbeydale grammar schools and in 1962, while still studying, he became lead singer with a comedy group, Bob Andrews and the Questors. A year later, he switched to the Whirlwinds, singing and playing rhythm guitar. On leaving school, he continued to perform in northern working men’s clubs while going through a string of day jobs, from vacuum cleaner sales rep to felt roofer. In 1965, he and the Whirlwinds’ keyboard player, Geoff Morton, left the group to form a double act, Pee and Knutt, and a year later, with Morton unwilling to turn professional, Wass went solo as Bobby Knutt. After finding national fame on TV in The Comedians during 1973 and The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club in 1975, he had his own series, It’s a Knutt House (1978), and was regularly seen in light-entertainment programmes such as Marti (1977), acting Marti Caine’s husband in sketches, and in game shows, while continuing to perform in clubs and theatre summer seasons. As an actor, he appeared in many popular programmes, including All Creatures Great and Small’s 1985 Christmas special, the sitcoms Stay Lucky in 1990, Rich Tea and Sympathy a year later and Last of the Summer Wine in 2000, the landmark drama Our Friends in the North in 1996 and several children’s series. He also played a drag queen in the writer Ken Blakeson’s TV film of the same year, The Bare Necessities. Knutt was the voice of Gaffer in Tetley Tea Folk commercials from 1997 and he appeared in many pantomimes at Sheffield’s Crucible and Lyceum theatres (1977-2008). His final screen appearance comes in the film Funny Cow, due for release this month, bringing his career full circle as he plays a concert secretary alongside Maxine Peake’s female comedian on the working men’s club circuit in the 1970s and 80s. Knutt, a keen bodybuilder who once owned a Sheffield health club, Intashape, wrote two volumes of autobiography, Eyup Knutty: The Life &amp; Loves of a Stand Up Comic (2009) and Eyup Again: Comedy and Tragedy 1982-2010 (2010), which recounted his career – and many affairs, until finding happiness with his third wife, Donna Hartley (nee Murray), Britain’s “golden girl” of the running track, who won two gold medals at the 1978 Commonwealth Games and a bronze at the 1980 Moscow Olympics, and later became a champion bodybuilder. They met while he was performing at Butlin’s Pwllheli holiday camp in north Wales in 1984 and married two years later, but she died of heart failure in 2013 while sunbathing in the back garden of the house that she and Knutt shared in Elsecar, near Barnsley. Knutt’s first two marriages, to Patricia Platts in 1965 and Carol Joynes in 1973, both ended in divorce. He is survived by Andrew and Simon, the sons of his first marriage, Cherine, the daughter of the second, and another daughter, Angela. • Bobby Knutt (Robert Andrew Wass), actor and comedian, born 25 November 1945; died 25 September 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/03/matt-lucas-little-britain-remake-would-not-play-black-character","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T12:26:08Z","webTitle":"I would not play black person in remade Little Britain, says Matt Lucas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/03/matt-lucas-little-britain-remake-would-not-play-black-character","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/03/matt-lucas-little-britain-remake-would-not-play-black-character","fields":{"headline":"I would not play black person in remade Little Britain, says Matt Lucas","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Matt Lucas has said he would not make jokes about transvestites and would avoid playing black characters if he remade Little Britain. The comedian told the Big Issue that he would not make a show in 2017 like Little Britain, which ran more than a decade ago, because he believed society had moved on. “If I could go back and do Little Britain again, I wouldn’t make those jokes about transvestites,” Lucas told the magazine. “I wouldn’t play black characters. “Basically, I wouldn’t make that show now. It would upset people. We made a more cruel kind of comedy than I’d do now. “Society has moved on a lot since then and my own views have evolved. There was no bad intent there – the only thing you could accuse us of was greed. We just wanted to show off about what a diverse bunch of people we could play.” Lucas, who appeared alongside David Walliams in the show, said he now thought it was “lazy for white people to get a laugh just by playing black characters”. His only aim, he added, was to entertain, rather than hold any agenda. “And as I’ve got older, I’ve become more empathetic, I care more about hurting people. I’ve only met Gary Barlow a few times, but I’ve apologised every time,” Lucas said. Barlow was one of the many musicians parodied by Lucas and Walliams. In their Rock Profile spoof series, the Take That frontman was portrayed as a bully constantly thinking about reforming the boyband. Little Britain became a staple of British television, memorable for its characters including the teenage mother Vicky Pollard, who once swapped her baby for a Westlife CD; Daffyd, the Welsh man who claimed to be “the only gay in the village”; Emily Howard, the unconvincing transvestite who wore old Victorian dresses; and Marjorie Dawes, the leader of a local “FatFighters” group. Despite its popularity, the show attracted criticism for misogyny and crude stereotypes of ethnic minorities and gay men. In an interview in 2010, Lucas, who is gay, said he never aimed to bring comedy out of racial characteristics and was simply playing a character “who happens to be a different colour”. The thing with Little Britain, Walliams said in the same interview, “was that we wanted to make it kind of like a cartoon strip come to life. So we wanted the characters to be quite simple in some ways.” “Sebastian is in love with the PM. Daffyd wants to be the only gay in his village. Vicky Pollard is the inarticulate juvenile delinquent. We didn’t want them to be too expansive, so those catchphrases were very key to the identity of those characters,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"culture/live/2017/oct/03/alistair-mcgowan-webchat-the-piano-album","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T13:12:50Z","webTitle":"Alistair McGowan – your questions answered on piano, football and why he'll never impersonate Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/live/2017/oct/03/alistair-mcgowan-webchat-the-piano-album","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/live/2017/oct/03/alistair-mcgowan-webchat-the-piano-album","fields":{"headline":"Alistair McGowan – your questions answered on piano, football and why he'll never impersonate Trump","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"SundridgePete asks: What’s the funniest thing you’ve ever done, and is it worth watching? saidzebedee asks: Are you comfortable impersonating a black person, or an Asian (i.e. Jamaican, Indian accents)?

This seems to be the challenge Alistair McGowan set himself with The Piano Album, his new collection of solo piano works that represent something of a curveball for the TV mimic. McGowan was not a renowned concert pianist when he took on the task of recording The Piano Album, but much like mastering a new voice or a new set of mannerisms, he devoted himself to the practice. And after rehearsing for up to six hours each day for nine months, he finally got a grip on the instrument that had eluded him since he was a boy. The point of putting an album out, he says, is to “encourage people of any age to play the piano, but perhaps particularly those at an age where it’s easy to think that it’s all too late”. It’s not McGowan’s first foray into the musical world. His 2016 show, Erik Satie’s-faction, was based upon the French composer’s humorous writings, and prompted him to learn some of Satie’s delicate pieces. But it’s safe to say that The Piano Album sees McGowan stepping out of his natural habitat of impressionist work – he’s best-known as the writer and voice artist behind The Big Impression and has a well-stocked awards cabinet to show for it.

(Obviously it’s in their interest to say that, though few go to the extent of the authorities in Rioja, whose categorisation of vintages mostly ranges from “good” to “excellent” – it will be interesting to see what they say this year, as the region was badly hit by frost.) That said, there’s a consensus that 2015 was an exceptional vintage, especially for reds from the classic regions of France: Bordeaux, Burgundy and the Rhône. The best wines from those regions won’t be ready to drink yet, or even released, but there are plenty of mid-priced wines on the shelves and wine lists that are probably as good as you’ve tasted for a while. The Rhône, in particular, is getting rave reviews, with one of its most prominent winemakers, Marcel Guigal, claiming it’s the best he’s ever known. His 2015s aren’t out yet, but in the meantime snap up Lidl’s Rasteau 2015 (14% abv), a generous, spicy, southern Rhône blend of grenache, syrah and mourvèdre at £7.99, or Aldi’s robust, warming Exquisite Collection Chateau La Diffre Plan de Dieu 2015 (£5.79; 13.5% abv), which would make a very decent everyday red. The Languedoc next door also has some corkers, among them Château Sainte-Eulalie’s gloriously ripe Minervois La Livinière Cuvée Cantilène 2015 (£13.50 The Wine Society; 14% abv). Modest clarets such as the Château Sainte-Marie Bordeaux Supérieur 2015 (13.5% abv) are unusually gratifying this year, with lovely, supple, ripe fruit – that’s £10.95 from Great Western Wine, and you get 10% off if you buy a case. The Co-Op has a very decent basic claret, too, Château Vieux Manoir 2015 (13.5% abv) for just £6.99, though make sure it’s the 2015 you’re buying Beaujolais also has great staying power, as wines such as the rich, opulent Domaine Calot Morgon Tête de Cuvée (£13.50 Stone Vine &amp; Sun; 13.5% abv) demonstrate. That should drink well until 2021, according to the website. Whites from 2015 are also worth snapping up, not least because many producers are already on to their 2016s. For instance, a magnum of Domaine Serge Laloue’s fabulous Sancerre Cuvée Silex 2015 (£36, or the equivalent of £18 a bottle, The Wine Society; 14% abv) is by no means cheap, but it would be a real treat for Christmas.

Suntan (Argyris Papadimitropoulos, 2016), 11.10pm, Film4 Middle-aged Doc Kostis (Makis Papadimitriou) is working quietly on a small Greek island, when a beautiful tourist, Elli Tringou’s Anna, arrives for treatment. She capriciously allows him into her hedonistic gang – it’s the sad eyes, and he buys the beers. But Kostis’s fantasy of a relationship with Elli is painfully exposed, chiefly by the ruthless contrast between youthful, uninhibited beauty and his paunchy paleness.

Renewable energy accounted for two-thirds of new power added to the world’s grids in 2016, the International Energy Agency said, but the group found solar was the technology that shone brightest. New solar capacity even overtook the net growth in coal, previously the biggest new source of power generation. The shift was driven by falling prices and government policies, particularly in China, which accounted for almost half the solar panels installed. The Paris-based IEA predicted that solar would dominate future growth, with global capacity in five years’ time expected to be greater than the current combined total power capacity of India and Japan. Dr Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, said: “What we are witnessing is the birth of a new era in solar photovoltaics [PV]. We expect that solar PV capacity growth will be higher than any other renewable technology up to 2022.” The authority, which is funded by 28 member governments, admitted it had previously underestimated the speed at which green energy was growing. The amount of renewable energy capacity forecast globally in 2022 has been revised upwards on last year’s forecast, driven by the IEA expecting a third more solar in China and India. While China dominates the expansion of renewables, the US is still the second fastest-growing market despite Donald Trump’s pledge to revive coal and the uncertainties he has brought at a federal level. Paolo Frankl, head of the renewable energy division at the IEA, said that solar and wind subsidies and other fundamentals meant the president’s impact would probably be limited. However, that could change if there were reforms that retrospectively hit the subsidies or if the US International Trade Commission imposes tariffs on imports of Chinese solar panels. “There is a risk, but at the moment our forecast remains strong,” said Frankl. India is set for a solar boom over the next five years, as bottlenecks such as integrating solar farms with the grid are overcome. The country’s renewable energy capacity is forecast to double by 2022, overtaking the EU on growth. The picture for the UK is a “mixed message,” said Frankl. The IEA has revised downward its forecast for the amount of green energy to be built in the UK between 2017 and 2022, with offshore windfarms expected to account for most of the growth. Despite the recent opening of the UK’s first subsidy-free solar farm, the prospects for British solar are fairly gloomy: the amount of solar forecast to be installed by 2022 is a fifth of the amount installed over the last five years. The report found that renewables are becoming increasingly comparable to fossil fuels on price, with wind and solar projects setting record low prices in government auctions. “Renewables may well become even cheaper than fossil fuel alternatives [over the next five years]. However, be careful because this does not automatically mean they are competitive and investment will flow. That depends on the risk of investment and whether remuneration flows make a project bankable or not,” said Frankl. The growth in renewable power will be twice as large as gas and coal combined over the next five years, the IEA said. While that will take renewables’ share of electricity generation from 24% last year to 30% in 2022, coal will still be the biggest source of power. The increasing scale of wind and solar power, and their intermittent nature at a local level, means that integrating them with power grids has become critical, the IEA said. Countries will need to bring forward policies that make grids more flexible, such as batteries and managing demand at peak times, it suggested. One energy expert said that the IEA report was, if anything, underestimating the speed of renewables’ growth and the impact of them becoming so cheap. Tim Buckley, director of energy finance studies at Australia-based analysts IEEFA, said: “2016 was another record high year of renewable installs and unexpectedly large renewable energy cost deflation, again highlighting the IEA’s continued underestimation of both these two trends driving the increasingly global market transformation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/04/british-voices-london-film-festival-paddy-considine-maxine-peake-lff","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T10:32:22Z","webTitle":"Witch doctors and gag merchants: the British talent set to light up London film festival","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/04/british-voices-london-film-festival-paddy-considine-maxine-peake-lff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/04/british-voices-london-film-festival-paddy-considine-maxine-peake-lff","fields":{"headline":"Witch doctors and gag merchants: the British talent set to light up London film festival","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A Zambian witch-doctor comedy, a serial-killer thriller set in Jersey and a drama about Jehovah’s Witnesses directed by a former member of the church are part of a exciting new wave of films by young, diverse British voices at this year’s London film festival. Rungano Nyoni’s I Am Not a Witch, Michael Pearce’s Beast and Apostasy by Dan Kokotajlo appear in the festival’s first feature competition alongside films from Israel, Spain and South Africa. The film-makers will be sharing the festival spotlight with a number of Hollywood A-listers, including Nicole Kidman, Colin Farrell and Emma Stone. It is hoped that the trio of films will maintain what has already been a strong year for debut features by British film-makers, with William Oldroyd’s dark period thriller Lady Macbeth and Francis Lee’s Yorkshire-set gay romance God’s Own Country having already proved popular with critics and performed well at the box office. This new crop of films move away from what the Zambian-Welsh director Nyoni describes as the “period dramas or gritty council estates” that usually characterise British cinema. There is a wide range of subjects being tackled, from the rural working-class stories of God’s Own Country and Hope Dickson Leach’s haunting family drama The Levelling, to the global tales of I Am Not a Witch or My Pure Land, a Pakistani western directed by British-based film-maker Sarmad Masud. “I think people are realising that films do need to break down barriers,” says producer Stephen Woolley. “It’s all part of being unique and original. Part of that is giving prominence to voices that have been silenced for years and years. We need to reflect society and what cinemagoers want, which is originality and a different perspective on the world. You can’t keep flogging the same stories, the same characters.” Woolley attributes some of the credit for this to the British Film Institute, which in 2014 introduced new requirements for any film seeking lottery funding. Productions were required to demonstrate diversity both behind the camera and within the film itself, including “identity relating to ethnicity or national origins, a specific focus on women, people with disabilities, sexual identity, age and people from a socially disadvantaged background”. The Levelling, God’s Own Country and Lady Macbeth have received BFI funding under the new criteria, along with recent hits such as Ken Loach’s Palme d’Or-winning drama I, Daniel Blake. But despite such progress, there remain areas where voices are marginalised. Of particular concern is gender disparity, with a recent BFI study showing that the proportion of female actors in British films was lower in 2017 than it was in 1913 and only 7% of films since 2000 had featured a majority female crew. Nyoni says that she hoped to hire a predominately female crew for I Am Not a Witch but struggled to find women to fill the roles. “It was a question of ‘Where are all the women?’” she says. “In short films it seems to be a bit more balanced, but when the stakes are high and when there’s money involved, the numbers seem to drop off more and more”. As well as first-time directors, this year’s LFF lineup features a number of established British names. Paddy Considine directs and stars in Journeyman, about an ageing boxer who falls into a coma after a fight, and also appears in Funny Cow, which stars Maxine Peake as a comedian making her way in the male-dominated 70s standup scene. This year’s opening gala meanwhile, is Breathe, a biopic of the pioneering wheelchair user Robin Cavendish, who is played by Andrew Garfield. The film is directed by Lord of the Rings actor Andy Serkis, another first-time director at the festival. Oscar hopefuls receiving previews at LFF include Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, which stars Frances McDormand as a mother seeking justice for her murdered daughter and Guillermo del Toro’s cold war-era fantasy The Shape of Water, which stars Sally Hawkins. Nicole Kidman and Colin Farrell will be in attendance in support of Yorgos Lanthimos’s absurdist horror The Killing of a Sacred Deer, while Stone stars in Battle of the Sexes, about the notorious 1973 exhibition tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs (played by Steve Carrell). The London film festival runs from 4-15 October."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/03/workers-rights-tories-employment-practices-theresa-may","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T11:55:38Z","webTitle":"Pro-worker Tories like me need to see concrete action from Theresa May | Nick Denys","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/03/workers-rights-tories-employment-practices-theresa-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/03/workers-rights-tories-employment-practices-theresa-may","fields":{"headline":"Pro-worker Tories like me need to see concrete action from Theresa May \r\n","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Consider how stressful it must be to be one of the 40,000 drivers who, due to TfL’s decision to stop Uber operating in London, do not know if their jobs are secure. They have spent time and money getting the necessary licences. Many have borrowed to buy that high-spec car to help them get better ratings. Theresa May was right to stand up to Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, for putting so many livelihoods at risk “at the stroke of a pen”. Now consider how stressful it must be not knowing week after week if you will get the hours you need to feed your family, whether you will be punished by your manager for staying in bed when you feel unwell, or if robotics will extinguish your career. Where has May been as millions of workers struggle to achieve basic financial security? The Conservative party should not leave British workers alone to deal with the challenges of artificial intelligence, the rise in flexible working and the need for new skills to sell to new markets. The repeated rhetoric about upholding and enhancing workers’ rights is welcome but questions are increasingly being asked about what these words really mean. The backtracking on mandating workers on boards, the watering down of reporting on gaps in pay, and the technocratic response to the worries of low-paid public-sector workers have all created doubts as to what the Conservatives will actually do for workers. To regain the trust of working people, May needs to announce that her government will introduce a good work bill to parliament. When she addresses the Conservative conference I do not want to hear an apology. The moment for saying sorry has gone. Nor do I want to hear a passionate defence of the status quo. In election after election people across the world are shouting that the status quo is not good enough. I want my prime minister to lead. May must show courage by committing to a radical agenda to reboot and rebalance our capitalism, otherwise the catchphrase “a country that works for everyone” will never become reality. This radical agenda must be grounded in people’s everyday feelings, not Brexit technicalities. It has to be about creating more homes and making sure loved ones are cared for and that we all benefit from the changing workplace. Ever since parliament banned children from going up chimneys, we as a society have decided that work is too important not to be governed by law. This good work bill needs to ensure that all work is fair and decent, that the vulnerable cannot be exploited by unscrupulous bosses, and that flexibility, which is at the heart of the successful British labour market, allows everyone to choose what works best for them. Above all, the bill must allow workers to be in control of their working lives and give them a meaningful stake in our economic adventure. The workplace is one of the least democratic environments in our society. Yet workers have a huge stake in the success of an organisation, and often see what is really happening on the shopfloor. They should be trusted with as much control over a business as shareholders. A quick way to increase their influence would be to introduce Matthew Taylor’s proposal to lower the threshold for introducing works councils so that only 2% rather than 10% of the workforce need to make the request. Staff should also have the same rights as shareholders to have their say on executive pay awards. Conservatives should also stop being suspicious of trade unions. Freedom only exists if everyone is able to do what they want to, and that freedom applies as much to workers who want to join together as it does to entrepreneurs who want to sell things. Businesses should not be able to stop unions advertising their services in the workplace, and the law should support collective bargaining within each workplace. At the same time, trade unions must show that they want to concentrate on workplace matters and represent all workers by ditching party political affiliation. These new enabling laws would only apply to trade unions that commit to being politically independent. Creating rights is meaningless unless everyone can enforce them. It is in the public interest that all operate within the law. Bad employment practices do not only harm the vulnerable; they also put responsible businesses at a competitive disadvantage compared with unscrupulous neighbours. The director of labour market enforcement should be given powers to conduct inquires into the employment practices of high-risk sectors. The Gangmaster and Labour Abuse Authority should be given proactive powers to carry out investigations of individual organisations to see if they are respecting employment rights. Edmund Burke, the philosophical grandfather of today’s Conservative party, knew that you had to change or die. The world of work is changing at high speed. If on Wednesday Theresa May does not meet this challenge with radical solutions, then hardworking families will look elsewhere for their rewards, and this Conservative government will die. • Nick Denys has been a Conservative activist for over a decade and was one of the founders of Tory Workers"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/03/braised-chickpeas-with-tomatoes-almond-and-garlic-recipe-rachel-roddy-a-kitchen-in-rome","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T11:17:08Z","webTitle":"Rachel Roddy’s recipe for braised chickpeas inspired by Patience Gray | A kitchen in Rome","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/03/braised-chickpeas-with-tomatoes-almond-and-garlic-recipe-rachel-roddy-a-kitchen-in-rome","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/03/braised-chickpeas-with-tomatoes-almond-and-garlic-recipe-rachel-roddy-a-kitchen-in-rome","fields":{"headline":"Rachel Roddy’s recipe for braised chickpeas inspired by Patience Gray","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This autumn, during a train journey from London to Whitstable in search of lunch, the best cook I know told me one of his great pleasures is a tin of marrowfat peas, reheated thoroughly, then seasoned with white pepper and a few shakes of Sarson’s malt vinegar. His description was so good, inducing such nostalgia for my granny’s pub, and fish and chips surrounded by warm newspaper, that I subsequently found myself paying the damn luggage supplement in order to bring a tin and bottle back to Rome. Then there is the friend who once described to me her affection for a tin of cannellini beans, warmed with olive oil and a squeeze of lemon to be eaten with cold mozzarella. Or the man who told me, in some detail, about his devotion to baked beans perked-up with Tabasco and eaten, with (not on) heavily buttered toast, on a tea-towel, on his lap while watching TV. Tins of beans, it seems, are private pleasures, and not just for speed. Add to this my partner’s love of any tin warmed and mixed with short pasta and my own of tinned chickpeas warmed with olive oil, lemon and loads of black pepper, then mashed with the back of a fork and eaten straight out of the small pan with the slightly melted handle. Italian call chickpeas ceci, which comes from the Latin Cicer arietinum, because each pea is reminiscent of a ram’s (Aries) head. They remind me of a plump hazelnut in a pointy hat. Chickpeas hold their own best in a tin, and I feel much the same way about them as my younger self did about cigarettes: if I didn’t have at least one pack standing by, I was twitchy. I also hoard dried chickpeas, for as useful and good as tinned ones may be, soaking and cooking your own is the way to get superb-tasting chickpeas with that unique and nourishing nutty flavour. What’s more, there is the cooking liquid, cloudy with the starch and goodness – therefore flavour and substance – that has seeped from the chickpeas as they simmered. Opinions about how long you should soak chickpeas before cooking varies dramatically. In her masterful book of Jewish food, Claudia Roden suggests one hour is enough, but notes that you can leave them overnight. Marcella Hazan also recommends overnight soaking. In Pasta the Italian Way: Sauces and Shapes, Oretta Zanini De Vita and Maureen Fant are emphatic that 24 hours are required. And Jane Grigson – also Enzo and Lina who run a stall here on Testaccio market – let their chickpeas soak for 48 hours – two whole days and nights of plumping until there is not a wrinkle in sight. Were my Grandma Roddy still here, she would have no doubt taken her “always on the safe side” lead from Jane and Lina, adding another few hours “just to be sure” – then marvelled at the sprouts. Suggested simmering times are equally varied, ranging from a swift 45 minutes to a lounging six hours (the chickpeas’ size and age makes a huge difference). In other parts of my life, such variations would be tiresome. However, when it comes to food writing and recipes, I enjoy these dramatic shifts in much the same way I enjoy the opinionated discussions that erupt spontaneously in Italian markets about those best methods and timings: “Two hours? Gesù, Giuseppe e Maria – you need two days!” As is so often the case, the answer somewhere in between an hour and two days, trying and tasting, knowing your chickpeas. I have settled upon a 24-hour soak, which means about an hour and a quarter simmer until tender (no one likes a chickpea bullet). And if you don’t have time, there are always tins. As I have already said, I do like tinned chickpeas. Today’s recipe for braised chickpeas comes from Patience Gray’s Honey From A Weed, a book I have been cooking from with renewed joy since reading Adam Federman’s meticulously researched biography of Patience’s remarkable life, which I highly recommend. The recipe, which originally comes from Catalonia, begins in much the same way as most recipes for braised chickpeas or soup, in that you add cooked chickpeas to aromatic vegetables – in this case onion, tomato and parsley – along with some of the cooking water. The uniqueness of this recipe is that you also add a finely pounded mixture of almonds and garlic called picada. This marvellous addition both thickens and lends the most delicious aroma and flavour to the stew as the heat awakens the garlic. It is a dish to serve as is, with cheese and bread, or on top of rice or couscous. I can imagine it going well with braised neck or roast lamb. It is good to be back. Braised chickpeas with tomatoes, almonds and garlic Serves 4 500g chickpeas, soaked in cold water for 24 hours, or 2 x 400g tins 2 bay leaves 1 garlic clove, unpeeled 6 tbsp olive oil 1 white onion, finely chopped 2 tbsp chopped parsley 500g fresh, ripe tomatoes, peeled and roughly chopped Salt and black pepper For the pesto 50g blanched almonds 1 tbsp pine nuts 2 garlic cloves 1 Drain the soaked or tinned chickpeas, put in a heavy-based pan and cover with 2 litres of cold water. Add the bay leaves and garlic, bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook until the chickpeas are very tender. Pull from the heat, add salt to taste, and leave to cool in the cooking liquid. 2 Warm the oil and fry the onion until soft. Add 1 tbsp chopped parsley and the tomatoes. Simmer, crushing the tomatoes with the back of a spoon. Cook until saucy. Dilute with a ladleful of chickpea broth, then add the chickpeas, leaving some broth remaining. Simmer for 10 minutes. 3 Make the pesto by pounding/blending the almonds, pine nuts and garlic into a paste. Stir into the chickpeas. Cook for another 10 minutes, adding more broth if you want. Stir in the last of the parsley. Serve with bread and cheese. Rachel Roddy is a food writer based in Rome and won the Guild of Food Writers food writer and cookery writer awards for this column.

Anne Longfield called for the justice secretary, David Lidington, to rewrite the “deeply shocking” child sexual abuse guidelines drawn up by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA). The draft guidance, revealed by the Guardian last week, means that, even if their abuser has been jailed, some child victims of sexual assault could be refused compensation on the grounds that they “consented”. The children’s commissioner, who is appointed by the government, said on Tuesday that the rules were “at odds with the law, public opinion and with the government’s definition of child abuse, published in February, which states that child sexual exploitation ‘can still be abuse even if the sexual activity appears consensual’”. Longfield said in a blogpost that victims of child-grooming rings were the most likely to be refused compensation by the CICA and that, according to specialist child abuse lawyers, many claims had been rejected. The case of Sammy Woodhouse, who was abused as a child by a Rotherham grooming gang and was initially refused compensation by CICA, was “just the tip of the iceberg”, she said. “Why is this happening? Put simply, some victims are not receiving compensation because CICA is applying guidelines that assume they consented to sex, even if their abuser has been jailed. That is simply unacceptable.” Longfield said the law was clear: the age of consent was 16, and it was also an offence for a person aged 18 or over to engage in sexual activity with a person under 18 if the older person held a position of trust. “It’s clear to me that the present guidelines are failing victims,” she said. “I will continue to push CICA and the Ministry of Justice to look at them again and to change them so that those who have gone through the most appalling abuse receive recognition that they were not to blame, that their lives have been severely affected and that they deserve some compensation to try to rebuild their lives.” She called on Lidington to insist the CICA’s new guidance did not “fail victims and add insult to injury”, adding to the pressure already placed on the minister by MPs. It is illegal to have sexual activity with a person under 16, but the CICA does not automatically pay compensation to victims. The government body began a review of its guidelines in July when it emerged that almost 700 child victims had been denied payments. Longfield said it was soul-destroying for child victims to have the CICA reject compensation claims, which were about much more than money. They were “recognition that the justice system and the state formally believes you – that the ordeal you have been through and its impact on your life is finally recognised, often after years of not being believed”. She said victims were likely to have left school without qualifications or training, and were likely to be in low-paid work or unemployed. “We aren’t talking about huge sums of money here, but for many, a few thousand pounds will help to turn around a life. I’ve heard of victims who have used it to go to university or college for the first time, or to set up their own businesses. Some feel that finally something positive has come out of the horrors they have had to go through as children.” The NSPCC also said it would write to the CICA to express its concerns over the guidance. It said: “It’s blindingly obvious that children can never consent to child abuse, and it is outrageous to suggest otherwise. Victims of child abuse, grooming and exploitation must never be made to feel that what they have suffered is in any way their fault.” A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman referred the Guardian to its previously issued statement: “Child sexual abuse is abhorrent. Our guidelines are designed to make sure that controlling and abusive behaviour is taken into account when handling compensation applications. We want to be sure that we never get these decisions wrong. “That’s why we are reviewing our staff guidance to make sure that we identify every instance where grooming could be a factor. We are actively engaging victim support groups and relevant charities to make sure the revised guidance is as robust as it possibly can be.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/20/more-than-a-million-of-europes-asylum-seekers-left-in-limbo","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T14:00:06Z","webTitle":"More than a million of Europe's asylum seekers left in limbo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/20/more-than-a-million-of-europes-asylum-seekers-left-in-limbo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/20/more-than-a-million-of-europes-asylum-seekers-left-in-limbo","fields":{"headline":"More than a million of Europe's asylum seekers left in limbo","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"More than 1.1 million people who sought asylum in Europe during the continent’s biggest refugee crisis since the second world war were still waiting up to two years later to hear whether they would be allowed to stay, according to a study. In the first Europe-wide analysis of the status of asylum seekers who arrived in Norway, Switzerland and the 28-member EU during the 2015-16 crisis, the Pew Research Center estimated more than half were still in limbo in December last year. The research also produced individual country data showing that how fast applications were handled varied dramatically according not just to the nationality of the asylum seeker but to the country in which they filed their demand, with Hungary and Greece proving particularly slow. With countries working through the backlog at wildly different rates and asylum seekers continuing to arrive, the researchers said the most recent available figures showed pending asylum applications still numbered 990,500 in June this year. The study analysed data from Eurostat, the European statistics authority, and other sources, including NGOs, to estimate how many of the 2.2 million who applied for asylum during the refugee surge still did not have a decision at the end of last year. “Lots of different data is released by governments, but little cross-nationally,” said Phillip Connor, the report’s lead author. “And often, asylum statistics give us only those who have been granted – not those who are still waiting.” The researchers estimated that 52% of the asylum applications filed in 2015 and 2016 – two years that, together, represent 20% of all applications received in Europe since the mid-1980s – had not been settled by the end of last year. In an estimated two-thirds of cases (760,000 people), this was because no decision had yet been made, while for the remaining third (385,000 people) it was because applicants were appealing against an initial unfavourable decision. Applications from an estimated 40% of asylum seekers (885,000) from the period had been granted, the study found, while 3% (75,000) had returned to their home countries and the whereabouts of another 5% (100,000) was unknown. Of a total of 16 countries of origin, three – Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq – accounted for 53% of all asylum applications in 2015-16, while of the 30 host countries, one – Germany – received almost half (45%) of all asylum seekers. Connor said one of the report’s key findings was some nationalities had “a far larger share of applicants still waiting for decisions than others”: 89% of those from Albania, 77% from Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iran, and more than 70% from Russia and Serbia, still had not heard whether they could stay. Significantly more asylum seekers from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Somalia, Sudan and Nigeria were also still waiting for a decision than the average, the researchers found – while only 20% of the 650,000 applications received across Europe from Syrian nationals had not yet been settled. Syrian applications were typically handled within one to three months during 2015 and 2016 in countries such as Belgium and Germany, the researchers found, while asylum seekers from Gambia and Eritrea, most similarly fleeing armed conflict or forced conscription, could also expect comparatively fast decisions. And regardless of asylum seekers’ country of origin, the researchers found that the speed with which applications were handled also varied dramatically according to the country processing it. “Some countries were much faster,” Collins said. In Hungary and Greece, more than 90% of asylum applications filed in 2015 and 2016 had not yet been decided by December last year, the researchers estimated – possibly reflecting strong public disapproval in those countries of the way the EU was handling the refugee issue. Between 60% and 70% of all applicants in Spain, Finland, Austria, Norway, France and the UK were also still waiting for an asylum decision in late 2016. But two of the top host countries – Germany and Sweden – proved far more efficient, processing at least half of all the applications they received."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/19/sign-up-to-the-un-ban-on-nuclear-weapons","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T17:42:44Z","webTitle":"Sign up to the UN ban on nuclear weapons | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/19/sign-up-to-the-un-ban-on-nuclear-weapons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/19/sign-up-to-the-un-ban-on-nuclear-weapons","fields":{"headline":"Sign up to the UN ban on nuclear weapons","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Around the world there are growing fears about the prospect of a nuclear war.

A legally binding nuclear weapons ban treaty has been agreed by 122 states at the UN, the culmination of decades of global civil society campaigning. That treaty opens for signature today, and more than 100 states are set to sign this ground-breaking document. This is an open invitation from the majority of the world’s states to all countries to sign up and work to make the abolition of nuclear weapons a reality. Our government says it is committed to the same aim, yet it boycotted the talks that produced the treaty and insists the UK will never sign. But the opportunity is there; the UK must seize it and work to make a success of it. The alternative is spiralling nuclear proliferation, massively increased danger and inevitable annihilation. For all our futures, we urge Theresa May to sign the treaty.

Three people were injured in the incident at the Zapad 2017 drills, a source close to the Russian Ministry of Defence told RBC news agency. “They weren’t civilians,” the source said. RBC also posted a video of what appeared to show a rocket from a passing Ка-52 “Alligator” combat helicopter explode close to a group of men dressed in camouflage fatigues. The footage shows at least one person knocked to the ground by the force of the impact. Fontanka, an independent news site, also posted video footage of the incident, which it said took place on Monday – the day the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, attended the Zapad drills. It said three rockets were fired by the helicopter. Unconfirmed reports said the incident took place at the Luzhsky firing range near St Petersburg. The defence ministry initially denied the reports, but was later said to have admitted the unplanned launch of a rocket by a combat helicopter at a military drill. “As a result of a strike by an unguided rocket, a cargo vehicle with no people on board was damaged,” Interfax cited a military official as saying. The Ministry of Defence did not clarify whether the accident had taken place during the Zapad drills. It said reports of injuries were “either a deliberate provocation or someone’s individual stupidity”. A video posted by the Conflict Intelligence Team, an independent Moscow-based group that monitors Russia’s military, showed what it said was the aftermath of the blast, including damaged military trucks. It said the registration number of one of the vehicles in the video indicated it belonged to the Federal Guard Service, which provides security for the Kremlin. The Zapad 2017 military exercises are taking place in Russia and Belarus and simulate a Nato-backed separatist revolt in northern Belarus. The seven-day drills are due to end on Thursday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/sep/23/i-was-kicked-out-of-halls-after-one-night-your-freshers-week-regrets","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T15:00:19Z","webTitle":"'I was kicked out of halls after one night' – your freshers' week regrets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/sep/23/i-was-kicked-out-of-halls-after-one-night-your-freshers-week-regrets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/sep/23/i-was-kicked-out-of-halls-after-one-night-your-freshers-week-regrets","fields":{"headline":"'I was kicked out of halls after one night' – your freshers' week regrets","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I was kicked out of halls after one night The very first night at university I had a few drinks (of course). I went to bed and I was woken up in the early hours by the fire alarm in my halls of residence. Being tipsy, as well as young and foolish, I punched the fire alarm control panel and dented it. The next day the hall manager gave me a massive telling off and evicted me from the accommodation. I spent the next two months living with a strict vegetarian family who set me a 10pm curfew. Alistair, West Midlands Joining too many obscure clubs I didn’t really put enough thought into the freshers’ fair I attended. I rushed around signing up for things I didn’t really care about, resulting in a clogged email inbox. I missed out on all the freshers events that could have helped me make friends with similar interests earlier on in the year. Seriously, go by yourself so you don’t get dragged along by impatient mates – you’ll thank yourself two weeks later when everyone else is sifting through thousands of messages from the Slug and Lettuce appreciation society. Al, Oxford University I stabbed myself in the abdomen It was the morning after my first night of university and I was eager to show off some new clothes. The thing was, the shorts I wanted to wear were too big, and so was my belt. The solution I came up with, in my drunkard morning naivety, was to use my new kitchen knife to fashion an extra hole in the belt. Problem solved. Except that it went horribly wrong: while still wearing the belt, I managed to stab myself an inch and a half in the abdomen. I sought help from my new flatmates, some of whom I was yet to acquaint myself with. I still remember their puzzled looks as I walked into the kitchen, distressed, bloodied and requesting medical assistance. Jack, University of Warwick Only socialising on drugs and alcohol There’s an insidious culture of heavy drinking at university. It completely consumed my first year. I felt it also made my mental and physical health worse; I was sick with cold most of the time. I should’ve had more courage to do my own thing. I also think it’s important for university societies and the student unions to think of ways in which students can socialise without alcohol. Anonymous I caused flaming pork chops to rain onto the street I was cooking some pork chops on an oven grill in halls when I was distracted by the arrival of a good-looking flatmate. I closed the oven door. A few minutes later smoke started pouring out of the oven and the fire alarms went off. In rushed the hall warden, who yanked open the windows, pulled the now-blackened chops from the grill, and hurled them – still on fire – out of the window and onto the street below. I might not have impressed my flatmate with my cooking, but the warden did later give me a job as his assistant ... Perhaps it was a punishment? Anoynmous Deciding that freshers’ week was a silly charade I reached university as a cynical 18-year-old and decided that freshers’ week was a silly charade and I never really let loose. While everyone around me was indulging in bravado-fuelled excesses, making memories and friendships that would last a lifetime, I never really bought into the spirit of the occasion. My university life picked up after finding the right group of friends a month in; but not indulging myself during freshers week is something I’ll always be irritated at myself for. My advice to any fresher would be to get it out of your system early on, enjoy it, speak to anyone and everyone because you only get one freshers’ week.

And if you’re wondering who’s going to pay for those tax cuts, Mnuchin’s got you.” The host then showed a clip of Mnuchin being asked about the administration’s tax plan, suggesting it will “pay for itself” based on the treasury’s growth models for the economy. “Now you might be thinking, Trevor, I recognize the name Mnuchin, but not from tax news. Well maybe it’s because last month he tried to get you to pay for his honeymoon,” Noah explained, referencing the report that Mnuchin and his wife Louise Linton requested a government jet for their honeymoon to Europe, which would have cost $25,000 an hour. “You know what makes this story even better?” Noah asked. “Mnuchin’s wife, Louise Linton, slammed someone on Instagram for having the nerve to even imply that the couple would make taxpayers cover their travel.” Noah then detailed Linton’s Instagram fiasco last month, in which she lashed out at a commenter on the social media site and asked: “Have you given more to the economy than me and my husband?” He also covered Linton’s memoir, In Congo’s Shadow, released last year about her gap year spent volunteering in Zambia when she was 18. Noah read aloud an excerpt of the book: “I try to remember a smiling gap-toothed child with HIV whose greatest joy was to sit on my lap and drink from a bottle of Coca-Cola.” “Guys, you may not believe this, but that kid on her lap was me!” Noah joked. “Wow. And by the way, I didn’t have HIV. I just really wanted that Coke.” “These two are both so out of touch it’s almost beautiful,” he continued. “I’m so glad they found each other.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/live/2017/sep/19/the-great-british-bake-off-2017-episode-four-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T20:20:06Z","webTitle":"The Great British Bake Off 2017, episode four – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/live/2017/sep/19/the-great-british-bake-off-2017-episode-four-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/live/2017/sep/19/the-great-british-bake-off-2017-episode-four-live","fields":{"headline":"The Great British Bake Off 2017, episode four – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Well there we go. The thoroughly well-deserved Star Bakersanship award goes to Kate, while, in a surprise to no one, Tom’s back on the sleeper to Edinburgh. Is he from Edinburgh? Who cares. He’s from somewhere, and he’s back there now. Thanks to all of you for the BTL bantz, armchair psychology and comments subsequently removed by a moderator. I’m off to down some syrup to cut through all this caramel. Or maybe I’ll borrow some of Prue’s lemons; she looks like she’s always got a few on the go. Come say hello on twitter, facebook or Instagram. Or just wiretap my house, and log a transcript of all my calls. That’s the sort of world we voluntarily live in now, isn’t it. See you next week! I meant The OA, not the OC. Which makes a little more sense with her weird hand movements. Sorry to all OC fans who I inadvertently just outed. Don’t like rubber, eh Paul? Not what the tabloids would have us believe. Looking forward to puddings next week. Hell, I’m looking forward to pudding tonight. This mango is going out the window. Poor Tom. Because he really did make a mess of it.” Prue is also available for eulogies. Noel, looking unfathomably like an Easter Island statue, announces star baker is...Kate! “James didn’t put his caramel parts on the cake” seems ironic. Alexa! Turn yourself off Alexa! Clear my browsing history Or Liam? I’d love it to be either. It’s a milestone of ageing when you no longer understand Crunchy Nut adverts. I don’t understand most adverts these days, come to think of it. Kate meanwhile performs brilliantly. They love her toffee apple bonfire night cake, and it looks like an explosion of childhood joy. She’s great at cakes is Kate. I think she might take this. Tom’s effort is gluey, underdone and not caramel. Someone get his coat. Or cut to an ad. Steven’s crown – a symbol of his o’erweening ambition – is stodgy and too full of itself. A parable as much as a cake. Do you really think Paul holds him to a higher standard? Maybe the producers told him too, else he seems like too much of a choux-in. Yan’s cake belongs in Tate Modern, though her sponge is tough. Mad Julia’s hand movements are very reminiscent of The O.C. if you watched that, which I assume you didn’t. James cake is rubbery – bad sign – while Liam’s trendy dripping and strong flavours unite Prue and Paul. Spice Boy’s coming into his own, isn’t he? Judging time! Sophie has done superbly, both in appearance and flavour. Paul is getting his Henry VIII on this week, downing a sugar egg filled with salted caramel, as Prue looks like she’s about to lose her lunch. Missing Middleton and her Miraculous Mirror Glaze Does anyone like Steven more as a result of this week’s revelations? A joyless monarchist with textural knowledge of old ladies’ hair? Please write in and let us know, in the interests of balance. LET ME KNOW Right, North Korea. I haven’t checked the news but presume everything is going well, and our heads of state are conducting themselves with dignity, yes? How do we feel about Stressy Stace this week? “It’s not as much of an erection as I wanted it to be.” Welcome to the club, Stacey. But seriously, if you’re going with that kind of material, don’t waste it on Prue. She’s the icy plunge pool of steamy bantz. Tinyismynewt, Noel and Steven heard your enquiry about male grooming and are chipping in! FYI, every man knows his rate of growth and has a mental beard calendar interacting with their social one. You’re welcome. That spin spin sugar work looks amazing and delicate. Like a butterfly’s dream. These guys know what they’re doing with showstoppers. “The royal family are my second family.” EEUURRGH. Steven is the Gary Barlow of the show. I KNOW HE WRITES ALL THE SONGS. I don’t have to like him. “The focus for me is solely on caramel,” expresses Steven without taking his eyes off his work. He reminds me of Dolph Lundgren in Rocky IV, the scientifically-engineered super-fighter who was so focused he sounded like he was on Mogadon. James is “back in with number two” like a man with Delhi belly. He is faintly adorable. Tom or James? Who’s going home? Gotta be one of them, right? Advertisers hoping it’s the latter. Yan’s tiger-stripe rainforest cake apparently has a caramel waterfall and biologically accurate micro-flora, with edible explorers making an anthropological field trip probably, and sounds intense. I hope she pulls that off. Cut to an ad! Feeling a bit sick with all this caramel. Tom’s banana and pineapple cake with passionfruit cream sounds almost savoury in comparison. Haven’t touched my mango. Poor James gamely explaining his six-element sponge, only to have everyone dissolve in laughter when he gets to the bit about “dipping his nuts in caramel.” Can you tell dentistry is on my mind? When was the last time you visited the dental hygienist? Unlike MJ, none of them were able to muster a smooth, smooth caramel. (Annie is not okay with it.) I agree with y’all, the instructionless, Marathon Man sadistry of that technical was a bit unfair. Talking sandwich in the Subway ad. Singing cupcake in the Dr.Oetker ad. What is with the anthropomorphised comestibles? It’s a sickness I tell you. I didn’t know you all love the history bits so much. I feel like the David Irving of baking commentators. Didn’t she win technical last week? Maybe it’s like that episode of Father Ted where the plane is about to crash, and Ted finds himself weirdly calm and capable. “I’m always expecting everything to go wrong anyway, so when it does, it’s a kind of relief.” Deep. Is that the worst technical in Bake Off history? No one achieved the brief. So there’s nothing to really play for here. Still: star baker Julia proudly claims her last place, Yan just ahead of her. Liam and James make the “winner’s” podium, leaving Stacey to hoist the tarnished, dusty cup. Well done! Judging time. Wow, they are effing this one up. Everyone’s efforts so far are too grainy. “Can none of you get caramel right?” enquires Prue, her Trunchbull turned up to 11. I’ve sort of gone off Steven. He’s seeming a bit like one of those fun-sponge high achievers, a bit “I like messing around too guys, but we’re here to do a job so why don’t we just get our heads down and do it?” What do you guys think? “I am always Russian in this tent,” laments Sophie before a quick cut to Julia. Oh, I think I definitely misheard her. Okay, a Selasi moment every week, tinyismynewt. We’ll keep a highly Selasi eye open. Noel pratfalls over a low hedge, signalling the unwelcome return of the historical vignette. Is this episode going to finish at midnight? Anyone for a cup of tea and a stroopwafel? “Absolutely rank,” decides Julia, unless I’m mishearing her. She then ululates and trills like a saltwater frog. She’s madder than a box of them. Adorable. That must be the filthiest thing ever heard pre-watershed. “I’ve never used a yeasted product that I haven’t kneaded.” Steven. You and me both, Steven. “You have to go low and slow” advises Prue ‘Snoop’ Leith. Prue’s chosen them because no one will have made them before, they’re counter-intuitive and the bakers will only have one chance to get it right. “Oh, you are cruel,” says Paul admiringly, realising he has until now been a mere apprentice in the arts of evil. Oh they’re the flat, dense Dutch waffles you put on top of hot drinks. Like a reverse coaster. I friggin’ love a stroopwafel. Didn’t they destroy most of our cities in the war? A deftly plotted racial minefeld Liam has made Tetris-themed shortbread for no reason at all, and earns a Hollywood handshake and a Toksvig 5. Go on, Liam! “Well done,” smiles Prue through gritted teeth, clearly thinking “Spare the rod and spoil the child, spare the rod and spoil the child…” They really do not agree on anything, do they? Cut to an ad! Steven’s hockey pucks divide the judges – Prue loves the bitterness, because “I don’t like sweet things.” Who would have thought, eh. He admires Yan’s flavours, but Prue is staying on-message. “I don’t like any of it.” Julia trying not to laugh when Paul points out her bulging lips. She’s obviously made him Caramel Week at the knees. Judging time! Kate impresses with her aromatic caramel, while Prue describes James’ effort as “a little unpleasant.” She’s not Encouraging Auntie, is she? Lola_Spice I love the idea of a spiteful, targeted ad break whenever Tom starts talking. Much potential here. I also have the dentist tomorrow, bewilderedpenguin! Are we chipped filling bredren? Ceramic doughnuts with a chipped filling are definitely not good for your teeth. Tom from the last series told me [WHEN WE WERE HANGING OUT KLAXON] that no one really appreciates quite how hot it gets in that tent. Sounds like it’s going to be a nightmare for these guys with the melty caramel. This could get messy. LOVE Liam putting his hand up to ask a question, like they’re all still in school. I miss school. Hated it at the time. Tom’s caramel has split! And he’s from Scotland. They may close Hadrian’s Wall to him. The Missing Middleton and her acetate collars, cooling in a bowl of ice. Didn’t mean that to sound quite so like a Cluedo accusation. Love it when someone points out ‘your stress sheen.’ Always a big help, I find. Maybe, bay be a Roman road, leading to the Star Baker wreath? Kate meanwhile is using bay to cut down the sweetness of her caramel, because in Roman times bay symbolised wealth. A la millionaire’s shortbread. I love the way she thinks! Unlike everyone else, Yan is not using a thermometer to gauge her caramel. The molecular biologist is turning away from science! Is there method in her madness, or the other way round? This is going to be interesting. Has she swapped personalities with Kate? Wow. Paul looks up to the ceiling when he swigs from a bottle of booze, like a businessman alone with a hotel mini-bar, trapped inside his life. That’s a hell of a technique. “I like the rum,” he decides. Kate’s putting in ‘likwid gloocows.’ Muscling in on Yan territory? Bakers are boiling their caramel as long as they can to colour it, without burning. “You’re basically playing caramel chicken. Which sounds delicious.” – Yan, obviously. James has “gone back to [his] American roots.” Lol. Those three years in Chicago didn’t really rub off on him, did they? He’s essentially a character from Thomas the Tank Engine. Or the Essex Hitchcock. “They could put rum in it,” – Prue. COULD THEY NOW. Sounds very similar to when I tell my friends, “You could bring round a bottle of something and a box of Maltesers, it’s up to you.” Sophie rolling her pin over chopsticks, as a guide rail to control depth. That is pure genius. Does anyone else do that? My kitchen-tricks nose is aroused. Making caramel is an absolute bastard, isn’t it. I’ve ruined multiple pans with it. They weren’t even my pans. Heyerette, your cousin’s way with a Twix straw is dark genius. It’s the forbidden experiment, like letting children be raised by wolves. Fun fact: Paul is a millionaire and loves bread, but is apparently quite tall. Is it just me or do the baker’s not all look a little fuller in the face after practicing with caramel for a week? It suits them. It’s usually haggard o’clock for some of them by this stage. “Julia’s stunning toadstool and snail.” Why isn’t he calling a spade an enormous tool? Bloody hell, are you ALL in your pyjamas tonight? I know I am. Autumn is here. CRYSTAL MAZE! Plus Richard Ayoade. A perfect conjunction. I’ll be watching that for sure. Ooh here we go... I wonder if she’ll lay into Julia this week to recreate the drubbing, from the past. Using the power of Science? I’ve eaten all my caramel treats and only have cubes of mango left. Awful. Evening all! I bet Yan will be torn between Bake Off and the women’s world cup qualifier against Russia. Last time I looked, England were up 4-0. But er, don’t turn over. Would you care to bingo? I should coco. Noel covering himself in caramel, immediate regret. Prue smacking someone’s hands with a ruler. Julia “innocently” baking a set of tits. Steven on a couch, talking about his father. Liam unsure if he’s having a laugh or a nightmare. Caramel, let me count the ways I love you. There are three: salted caramel, caramelised onions and Twix. I’m pretty sure onions don’t count, so I’m hoping to learn some new tricks tonight. What will the bakers make of the new theme? Who will walk out a finger-lickin’ victor, and who will meet a sticky end? I hope you’ll join me here, so we can watch the show together, sharing innuendo, gossip, and rabid partisanship. It’s like a regular liveblog, with a spoonful of baking soda thrown on top.

Moses Sumney has a slightly different take on what is drily termed “aromanticism” – an imperviousness to coupling up. Born of exacting self-scrutiny, it is bolstered by 70s soul, Greek myth and what sounds like a personal phalanx of angels that routinely dive bombs this gorgeously crafted album. We’re not all destined to be completed by some special someone, the LA musician seems to conclude. That the swooning, layered backing vocals on many of these 11 tracks turn out to be just Sumney, multi-tracked, underscore his exquisite isolation. Having reached a wider audience thanks to his guest spot on Solange’s A Seat at the Table album, Sumney is now taking his own stool at music’s countertop with a genre-resistant debut that juxtaposes guitars with harp sounds and electronic production. It recalls the delicacy of Anohni’s first album while sounding like little else – our own Sampha covering Tim Buckley’s Song to the Siren, maybe. Of course, the boy has some company. Jazz outlier Thundercat guests on bass, as does Paris Strother from King; Matt Otto, previously half of Majical Cloudz, helps out with production. And Sumney has had sleepovers. “All my old lovers have found others,” he notes on the spare, guitar-driven folk-soul of Indulge Me. Another fantasia finds a finger-clicking Sumney declaring: “I’m not trying to go to bed with ya/I just wanna make out in my car.” Discreet panting, a jazz flute and fruity strings mark the tryst (Make Out in My Car). Sometimes, Sumney considers, love founders on circumstance, or worse. A key track, the expansive Quarrel, is all low-key shimmies and pops, harps and muted horns – and prejudice. “Don’t call it a lovers’ quarrel,” demands Sumney. “We cannot be lovers/Cos I am the other.” As though to underline the point, the final two minutes unfurl into spacey soul and restless jazz. Sometimes, in our culture, being resistant to happily-ever-after seems akin to blasphemy. The pivotal track, Doomed, finds Sumney wondering: “If lovelessness is godlessness/Will you cast me to the wayside?” This time, the cavalry of angels doesn’t arrive; it’s just Sumney’s quaver and a little thrumming synth in the background. A riveting moment later, he is excommunicating himself. “Well, I feel the peeling/Of half-painted ceilings/Reveal the covering of a blank sky.” Sumney has described the album as “a sonic dreamscape” and if Aromanticism has a tiny drawback, it is an over-reliance on beauty. This former choirboy has a truly celestial falsetto, but he underuses his lower register. Plastic – included here, but originally released in 2014 – finds Sumney sliding assuredly down the octaves on a single vocal line. This album packs so much succour; only once – on Lonely World – are the virtuoso musicians he has assembled allowed to express any tension. The unexpected percussion hammers down like rain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/live/2017/sep/19/donald-trump-united-nations-general-assemly-live-updates-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T19:58:42Z","webTitle":"Speech at UN sees Trump threaten Pyongyang – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2017/sep/19/donald-trump-united-nations-general-assemly-live-updates-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2017/sep/19/donald-trump-united-nations-general-assemly-live-updates-news","fields":{"headline":"Speech at UN sees Trump threaten Pyongyang – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As the world’s diplomats prepare for a long night of speeches, we’re going to wrap things up for today. The highlights from today’s morning session: • UN secretary general António Guterres, who took over the international body’s top job in January, began the day by lamenting divisive political discourse and appealing for calmer rhetoric. • Minutes later, Donald Trump, the second world leader to address the assembly, threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea. • In a speech that lasted for just over 40 minutes, the US president, who was making his debut speech to the general assembly, railed against the countries he sees as enemies to the US, primarily North Korea and Iran. He did not mention climate change, which is one of the top issues being discussed at this week’s meeting. • Other leaders, including French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the president of the Switzerland confederation, Doris Leuthard, made critical allusions to Trump’s style of politics. “It’s not walls that protect us, it’s our desire to act,” Macron said. • The morning session concluded with a strong show of support for Trump from Israeli president Benjamin Netanyahu, who complimented the president for taking a strong stance against the Iran deal and being welcoming to Israel. • Netanyahu also said: “After 70 years, the world is embracing Israel and Israel is embracing the world”. The Guardian’s Julian Borger is reporting live from the winding halls of the United Nations headquarters in New York all week, and you can follow him here. For better or for worse, it now appears that on the question of Iran – a long term obsession of Netanyahu – Trump and the Israeli prime minister are completely joined at the hip. For the Israeli prime minister, that certainly helps reinforce his standing on the domestic front, but how much it will help him in persuading other members of the international community, especially co-signatories of the Iran nuclear deal who still support it, is more questionable. The optics in the region of a US president delivering a speech that could have been written by the Israeli embassy, and Netanyahu’s celebration of that speech, may have unanticipated consequences. Israel may also regret associating itself in the future so closely with such a bellicose and contradictory speech by Trump. Some similarities were striking with both Trump and Netanyahu make common cause with the Iranian people against the regime in Tehran giving an impression at least – whether true or not – that the speeches were in some way coordinated. Indeed this was a risk that was warned against by Israeli columnist Chemi Chalev ahead of Netanyahu’s speech, referring explicitly to the suspicion that Israel helped push George W Bush to a war against Iraq. Israel needed many long years to refute the allegation that, together with its neo-conservative lackeys in Washington, it pushed George W. Bush into the war with Iraq, and this at a time when, unlike Netanyahu, then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon maintained a low public profile. If there is a sudden and serious deterioration in relations between Washington and Tehran over the next few weeks, Israel will be hard-pressed to deny that this is what it wanted to achieve all along. When things get complicated, as they always do, it will be easy to point an accusatory finger at Netanyahu and his country. This brings an end to the morning session, two hours and 20 minutes after it was scheduled to end. This means no two-hour lunch break for the delegates – the afternoon meeting has already been called to order and the president of Mali is taking his turn at the podium. Netanyahu speaks again of his gratitude towards Trump for recognizing Israel and condemning the Iran nuclear deal. He says no speech “was bolder, none were more courageous and forthright as the one delivered by President Trump.” He says if the Iran nuclear deal remains, it will result in a situation similar to the one the world is currently facing with North Korea. He says an “Iranian curtain” has descended across the Middle East. He says he has a simple message for Iran’s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei: “the light of Israel will never be extinguished”. He continues: “Those who threaten us with annihilation put ourselves in mortal peril”. But, Netanyahu says, Israel is a friend to the people of Iran. He delivers the message in Farsi as well. He then lists some of the acts the Iranian government perpetrated against its people recently, including the jailing of journalists and the execution of gay men last year. Netanyahu then brings the speech back to where it began: a celebration of Israel innovation, noting how its technologies and people have helped people around the world. Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu begins by speaking about how his country is an “innovation nation” in water, autonomous vehicles, agriculture and technology. In almost the same breath, he says Israel is also very strong on collecting intelligence about terrorism. He says the general public might not know this, but our country’s intelligence agencies do. He commends Trump for visiting Israel on his first foreign trip as president, then recounts his own trips around the world in the past year, including Australia, Asia, South America and Europe. “After 70 years, the world is embracing Israel and Israel is embracing the world,” he says, garnering a round of applause from the audience. He makes a joke about wanting to go to Antarctica to see penguins, who he calls supporters of Israel. In response to the ensuing laughter, he says the audience might think it’s a joke, but penguins understand Israel’s conflict with Palestine is a “black and white issue”. Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan says global stability has reduced since last year’s general assembly. He says Turkey is anxiously watching the development of anti-Muslim sentiment and xenophobia. “We all have to shoulder responsibility for a safer and more prosperous world,” Erdoğan says. He says Turkey has not received adequate assistance, particularly from the European Union, to provide aid to refugees in the country. He calls the issue with Palestine “the gaping whole of the world” and encouraged Israel to work toward a two-state solution. He refers to the attacks on Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar as “almost ethnic cleansing”. He said if what’s happening there is not stopped, it will leave a “dark stain” on humanity. Erdoğan ends by saying regardless of our skin color “our tears are the same”. He urges the group to take action to end “the tears in the world”. Iran’s foreign minister responded to Trump’s general assembly address on Twitter. The Guardian’s Washington DC bureau chief, David Smith, has helpfully annotated Trump’s remarks to the general assembly this morning. The word ‘sovereign’ is used 21 times. As Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu prepares to deliver his speech, the country’s left-leaning daily Haaretz has posted a video compilation of the greatest hits of the corny stunts and props that Netanyahu has used in his speeches in recent years including the cartoon bomb supposed to show Iran’s progress in its nuclear programme and the somewhat bizarre ‘silent treatment’ he subjected the UN general assembly too. The Guardian’s Paris correspondent, Angelique Chrisafis, is watching Macron’s press conference at the United Nations. Now on stage: Qatar’s Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Than. There are two more people scheduled to speak after him, then the morning session will conclude. It was scheduled to conclude at 1pm. Up next: Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan Israel Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu Lithuania’s president Dalia Grybauskaitė is speaking before the general assembly. She talks about Russia’s role in spreading “fake news” and says aggression is not a strong diplomatic tool. “Bullies are weak because they are insecure,” she says. She continues: “Aggression can never make anyone stronger, it can never earn anyone a drop of respect”. She ends by saying “we cannot let fear win”. Trump has doubled-down on his earlier threat to “totally destroy” North Korea in a tweet. Colombia’s president Juan Manuel Santos Calderón also speaks passionately in favor of the United Nations. He says Colombia is concerned about Venezuela, its neighboring country. Venezuela “pains us,” he says. He calls on the international community to lend support to the people of Venezuela in the search for a “peaceful solution”. He speaks about how his country melts down weapons and says, as a recipient of the Nobel Peace prize, he believes we should all be working together. “We human being are one, what affects one of us affects all of us,” he says. He concludes by speaking about an issue he says he can’t ignore, the war on drugs. He says drug policies should emphasize decriminalization “It is time to accept while there is consumption, there will be supply,” he says. It is his last speech to the general assembly. “With the strength of love, we can overcome fear,” he says. Venezuela’s foreign minister Jorge Arreaza has responded to Trump’s speech. We do not accept threats from President Trump or whoever in this world. We are people of peace, peaceful people and we want relations of mutual respect. This racist and supremacist theory which he’s exposing, this return to the Cold War, for a moment we didn’t know if we were listening to President Reagan in 1982 or President Trump in 2017 Macron mentions “multilateralism” multiple times in his remarks – a clear rebuke to Trump – then explains at-length why he believes it is so important to the world order. He says multilateralism is needed to improve functions at the UN so countries can better coordinate crisis management. He returns to the thread about the UN giving world leaders an opportunity to provide a voice for the voiceless. “The safety of all of us is also our safety,” he says. “Their lives are our lives”. “It’s not walls that protect us, it’s our desire to act,” he says. Another Trump critique. “We cannot have on the one hand, one camp that is multilateral and another camp that is unilateral in its approach,” he says, calling again for multilateralism. At the end of his speech, he is met with enthusiastic applause. Macron says North Korea poses “an existential threat” and that it’s all the countries responsibilities, including China and Russia, to bring North Korea to the negotiation table. He pivots from North Korea to Iran, advocating in favor of the existing Iran nuclear deal. “This is a good agreement, an agreement that’s essential to peace” he says, at a time when there is potential for a “downward spiral”. Macron says this is a message he has been sharing with the delegations from the US and Iran. More on that, by Julian Borger, here: “When I hear our colleagues talk about the world that exists today they forget about the world behind us,” says France’s president Emmanuel Macron. He talks about advocating for people who do not have a voice and throughout the speech quotes refugees from conflict zones including Libya and Syria – as well as victims of natural disasters tied to climate change. Macron says France is opposed to chemical weapons in Syria and will continue its fight against terrorism there. He repeatedly emphasizes that these issues cannot be resolved solely with a military response – he says a political response is needed too. Macron also denounces the “ethnic cleansing” of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. He says France remains committed to the Paris climate agreement and that the country will be introducing an environment measure at the UN today. Again, he says world leaders should be looking forward instead of to the past. He’s been speaking for more than 22 minutes. The presidents of four countries have just spoken in favor of working together to end conflict and strife and warned of threats facing their countries and the world. Slovakia’s president Andrej Kiska spoke about the importance of working together to address crises like famine and conflict and putting aside “egoism” in responding to the world’s problems. “North Korea openly threatens our world with nuclear weapons,” he said. “Such disrespect to human life cannot be tolerated”. He stepped down and was replaced by Nigeria’s president Muhammadu Buhari, who talked about the threats of Isis and Boko Haram. He called for the empowerment of women and free and fair elections. “Our faith in democracy remains firm and unshaken,” Buhari said. The Czech Republic’s president Miloš Zeman ended his speech with a quote: “If I knew there would be doomsday tomorrow I would go today and plant my apple tree”. It is a reference to a quote attributed to Martin Luther, that may have actually originated with church members opposed to Nazi rule in Germany. And Liberia’s president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf just ended her speech. She is the first female president of Africa and highlighted the progress the country has made during her rule. Sirleaf has announced she will step down and the election for her successor is next month. “Liberia is your post-conflict success story,” she said. On Twitter, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders just highlighted a quote by Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama. People quickly responded to Sanders with the next line of Obama’s quote: “But aside from the humanitarian costs of that, they are right next door to our vital ally, Republic of Korea”. The second line highlights the impact a war with North Korea could have on South Korea, whose capital city of Seoul is just 35 miles south of the demilitarized zone, the heavily armed border between the north and the south. There are 10 million people in Seoul and 28,500 US troops in South Korea. Trump’s remarks were delivered around midnight in the Korean peninsula. Our Jerusalem correspondent, Peter Beaumont, has reaction to Trump’s speech from Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He says Netanyahu “could have written the section on Iran so closely does it ally with his own views on the threat posed by Tehran”. Praising Trump, ahead of his own speech later this afternoon, Netanyahu said: In my more than 30 years at the UN, I have never heard such a brave and clear speech. President Trump told the truth about the world’s lurking dangers, and called for them to be addressed with fortitude, to ensure the future of humanity. The president of the Switzerland confederation, Doris Leuthard, opens by speaking about the world’s greatest challenges, like famine, and says that “no one country” can solve these issues on their own. “The purpose of the UN is to maintain international peace and security,” she says, taking a moment to speak in English, though most of her address is in French. She makes a clear allusion to Trump, saying that country’s cannot solve the world’s issues on their own and that she is a patriot, which is why she believes in a strong UN. She then continues her address in French, touching on the need to reduce sexual exploitation (an effort which Switzerland is contributing funds to the UN to end), and to help resolve the conflict in Libya. “To each his own” is not a viable way of responding to global issues, says Leuthard, concluding her speech. A reminder: Switzerland has no head of state, but instead a committee of seven elected leaders, known as the Federal Council. Condé also speaks about terrorism, saying it can only be eradicated if poverty ends. He advocates for a two-state solution in the Israeli-Palestine conflict. He reaffirms the republic’s support of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. “African young people and women are determined to write a new page in the history of humanity,” he says, asking for the UN to help make that happen. He ends the speech with a call of support for the Paris climate deal and a request for increased international aid to Sierra Leone. Switzerland is next. After a five-minute break, the group has reassembled. Now up, Guinea’s president, Alpha Condé. “The fact Africa is lagging behind will not always be the case,” he says. He calls for diversified economies in Africa through investment in energy, infrastructure and agriculture. He says Africans “yearn for prosperity,” especially the country’s youth. “Africa has decide to take responsibility for itself and to speak henceforth with one voice,” he says, speaking at length about the impact of the African Union. He says the UN security council “no longer reflects current realities” and bemoans the lack of significant African representation on the council. He calls for an enlargement of the council to include African representatives selected by the African Union. While Trump’s speech touched on myriad topics including migration, terrorism and the threatened destruction of North Korea, but speech-watchers note he missed several other key topics swirling at this year’s UN general assembly. Trump speaks about the US middle class, saying they will be “forgotten no more”. He heralds the importance of patriotism, again emphasizing that countries can only resolve global conflict if they protect themselves and their interests first. “Now we are calling for a great reawakening of nations,” he says. “We need to defeat the enemies of humanity and unlock the potential of life itself,” he says. Trump thanks the audience and concludes, after about 41 minutes and 20 seconds, by saying: “God bless you, God bless the nations of the world, and God bless the United states of America”. Trump briefly winds down his speech to speak about the need to empower “women entrepreneurs,” earning applause, before becoming angry again to talk about the US contributions to the UN. He says the US carries an “unfair burden” with the resources it provides to the UN. Trump then attacks Cuba and the government of Venezuela. He says people need to do more to address the situation there. He begins the 34th minute of his speech with a critique of communism. Trump’s speaks loudly again as he discusses the threat of international terrorism. He says the US is working with its allies in the Middle East to “crush” terrorists. “Our country has achieved more against Isis in the last eight months,” says Trump, then it has in the years before combined. It’s unclear what measure he is using for achievement. He thanks Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon for hosting refugees. “The United States is a compassionate nation,” he says, before launching into a defense of his government’s efforts to reduce the refugee cap in the US. “Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for him and his regime,” says Trump, referring to Kim Jong-Un. He continues to say he hopes we don’t have to destroy North Korea. He has moved on to Iran, saying the nuclear deal is “an embarrassment to the United States”. Trump has been speaking for more than 20 minutes. He says the member states must work together to confront “rogue regimes”. “If the righteous many do not confront the wicked few, then evil will triumph,” he says 14 minutes into the speech, Trump mentions North Korea, speaking about the death of American student Otto Warmbier after being detained by the North Korean government. He says the “entire world” is threatened by the nuclear threat in North Korea. “If it [the US] forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea,” Trump says. Trump says the United States will no longer be taken advantage of in deals it makes with other countries. “Our citizens have paid the ultimate price to defend our freedom,” he says. They have also fought to defend other countries represented in the room, he says. “It is an eternal credit to the American character,” that we have fought wars abroad but have not “sought territorial expansion” and not imposed our way of life on other people. “We want harmony and friendship, not conflict and strife,” he says. Trump speaks about protecting the rights given by God, emphasizing the word “God” and pausing before he continues. “In America, we do not seek to impose our life on anyone,” he says but the US wants to shine as an example. He says he was elected to give power to the people “where it belongs”. “As president of the United States” he will always put America first, he says. He gets louder, saying that’s what all countries should do. He gets some claps for that remark. Trump talks about citizens needing to be able to achieve their dreams and for children to be able to live in a world without hate. “The success of the United Nations depends on the independent strength of its members,” he says. He acknowledges that all countries have different goals, but the “beautiful vision” that led to the creation of the UN allows people to work side-by-side. Trump has criticized the UN repeatedly in the past. Trump highlights breakthroughs in technology and medicine. Then says every day is filled with new threats. “Rogue regimes” support terrorists and threaten other countries. “Authority and authoritarian powers seek to collapse” systems and alliances that “tiled the war toward freedom” after the second world war, he says. “We meet at a time of both immense promise and great peril,” he says. Saying it’s up to “us” whether the world “is lifted to new heights” or “a valley of disrepair”. US president Donald Trump is making his debut speech to the general assembly, saying it is a “profound honor” to represent the American people from his home city. He expresses thanks to all the world leaders who have offered help and condolences in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma. Thankfully, he says, the US is doing well. The economy is at an “all-time high”. He says the country is experiencing job growth like it has not seen “in a very long time”. “Our military will soon be the strongest it has ever been,” he says. Temer speaks about international terrorism and organized crime. He speaks about the need for countries to commit to human rights. “We reject racism,” Temer says. “We reject xenophobia in all its forms”. He expresses concern about the crisis in Venezuela and says Brazil stands with the people of Venezuela. “There is no more room for alternatives to democracy,” he says. Temer has just wrapped up, which means Trump is next on stage. Brazil’s president Michel Temer is now addressing the general assembly. “Today we certainly need the UN more than before, and I’m talking about a UN that is increasingly effective,” he says. But, reform is still needed, Temer says. He wants the security council expanded. He says protectionist countries threaten progress and development. “We reject exacerbated forms of nationalism,” Temer says. He expresses support for the Paris climate agreement and says Brazil is at the forefront with its “low-carbon economy”. He touts a reduction in deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. Temer advocates for nuclear disarmament, saying Brazil has shown it could master nuclear weapons, but chooses not to have them. Lajčák speaks about migration, which he acknowledges is a “divisive issue” and says another UN priority should be addressing international terrorism. “The only way to succeed in both areas will be through choosing to focus on people, rather than rigidly sticking to our individual positions,” Lajčák says. “We need viable global frameworks, which can be implemented by people – and for people – in real time”. He says the UN member states must adhere to the Paris climate agreement and work to protect human rights. He highlights the need for women’s leadership and rights as well as reform in the UN, which “should be opening its doors wider,” he says. “We must strengthen our engagement with a wide variety of stakeholders, including regional and sub-regional organizations, civil society and the private sector,” Lajčák says. “We need to hear more young voices in this Hall”. The president of the72nd session of the general assembly, Miroslav Lajčák is on stage. He begins by offering his condolences for the people of Dominica, which was devastated by a category 5 hurricane overnight. Lajčák says his priorities are climate change, migration and inequality. He speaks about the UN’s role in addressing global conflict. “Unfortunately, we are spending too much time and money reacting to conflicts, not preventing them,” Lajčák says. The UN has the tools it needs to prevent conflict, Lajčák says, but “what we are missing are the conditions in which they can be properly used”. “Refugees, internally displaced persons and migrants are not the problem; the problem lies in conflict, persecution and hopeless poverty,” says Guterres. “Instead of closed doors and open hostility, we need to reestablish the integrity of the refugee protection regime and the simple decency of human compassion”. He thanks the audience. Guterres is now speaking at length about “human mobility”. “Let us be clear: we do not only face a refugee crisis, we also face a crisis of solidarity,” he says. He says every country has the right to protect its borders, but warns some countries are not being as friendly as they should be. “I commend those countries that have shown hospitality for millions of displaced people,” Guterres says. The line receives a round of applause from the room. “Migration should be an option, not a necessity,” he says. He says tragedies in the Mediterranean will not end with more strict migration policies. “Safe migration cannot be reserved for the global elite,” Guterres says. That line gets more fervent clapping. “No one is winning today’s wars,” says Guterres, listing crises in Syria, Yemen, South Sudan and Afghanistan. He advocates for specific responses to conflicts including the violence against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. He says the country’s government must provide “unhindered humanitarian access”. Guterres also endorses the two-state solution in Israel and Palestine, saying it “is the only way forward”. He highlights the threat of climate change, pointing to the devastating hurricanes in the Caribbean and US this month. The first priority Guterres lists is nuclear weapons. He cites North Korea’s nuclear missile tests: “I condemn those test unequivocally.” Guterres warns that the world “must not sleepwalk our way into war”. Aside from the threat from North Korea, Guterres said all countries must “show a greater commitment to a world without nuclear weapons”. The second priority he lists is terrorism. To confront this, nation’s must also address the underlying issues that cause people to radicalize, whether the perceived injustices of potential terrorists are real or not, Guterres said. United Nations secretary-general António Guterres is addressing the general assembly. “Our world is in trouble, people are hurting and angry,” said Guterres. He explains that the world’s population is most concerned with inequality and climate change. “Societies are fragmented, political discourse is polarized,” he says, continuing to highlight how divided society appears. “We are a world in pieces, we need to be a world at peace,” Guterres said. He is now outlining seven priorities for this UN general assembly. The general debate is being called to order. You can watch the UN’s live stream here. A reminder of the general debate rules: each nation’s representative is given 15 minutes to speak, though the lure of the international stage inspires many to extend their speeches beyond that allotment. The record for longest speech goes to Cuba’s former president Fidel Castro, who in 1960 held the podium for four hours and 29 minutes. So, while the morning session is scheduled to conclude at 1pm ET for a lunch break, it’s safe to assume that it will extend past that hour. The theme of this year’s general debate is: “Focusing on People: Striving for Peace and a Decent Life for All on a Sustainable Planet”. The schedule for the morning session: United Nations Secretary-general, António Guterres President of the72nd session of the general assembly, Miroslav Lajčák Brazil President Michel Temer US President Donald Trump Guinea President Alpha Condé Switzerland President Doris Leuthard Slovakia President Andrej Kiska Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari Czech Republic President Miloš Zeman France President Emmanuel Macron Liberia President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf Colombia President Juan Manuel Santos Calderón Tajikistan President Emomali Rahmon Zambia President Edgar Chagwa Lungu Lithuania President Dalia Grybauskaitė Qatar Amir Sheikh Tamim b in Hamad Al - Than Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan Israel Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu Welcome to our live coverage of the United Nations general assembly’s general debate, where world leaders will present their priorities to the international stage. The session will open at about 9am local time in New York (2pm in London) with remarks by secretary-general António Guterres, who is hosting his first general assembly since taking up the UN’s top post in January. As is customary, Brazil will be the first country to speak, followed immediately by US president Donald Trump, who has in the past called the UN “a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time”. He is expected to warn member states that they risk being “bystanders in history” if they do not mobilize to confront the threats of Iran and North Korea. The morning session will continue with 15 other countries, including France, whose president Emmanuel Macron is also making his UNGA debut, but is expected to pitch a very different worldview than Trump. The French delegation is warning the US this week that quitting the Iran nuclear deal risks “spiraling proliferation”. We’ll have live updates of today’s speeches here, with analysis from the Guardian’s team of experts, including world affairs editor, Julian Borger, who is reporting from the UN’s New York headquarters.

Why is it racist to say Asians are good at maths? Why is it racist to say black men have 24-inch penises? Guys, these are compliments! Your lot are never satisfied, are they? And so to some Manchester United fans’ chants about their striker Romelu Lukaku, which a totally encouraging number of people simply cannot see are racist. To be super-clear (and apologies to those who realised this in 1964 or whenever): any assumption about someone made solely on the basis of that person’s race is racist. It may also be banter – but it is racist banter. And if anyone’s still struggling with the logical underpinnings of that incredibly simple rule of thumb, we’ll be diving deeper into why in a minute. For now, Kick It Out has written to Manchester United asking them to act on the Lukaku chants, explaining: “Racist stereotypes are never acceptable in football or wider society, irrespective of showing support for a player.” In 2014, a YouGov analysis of Manchester United and Manchester City fans asked the two groups to describe themselves from a list of over 200 personality traits. With United fans, the one that came out top was “adaptable”. So do let’s hope they’ll swiftly adapt to not singing songs about Lukaku’s cock size. Hang on – before we continue, I should stress: not all Manchester United fans. An unquantified minority of Manchester United fans. A minority who have almost without doubt completely lost their shit in the past if anyone tried to stereotype them in some way. As troublemakers, say, or people who live in Surrey. Yes, it’s a particular irony that those voicing distaste about the Lukaku chant are now being accused of oversensitivity by a certain strand of quick-to-temper football fans, who absolutely cannot stand to be generalised about themselves in any way. I mean, they really wet their pants about it. If it relates to their own tribe, there are few more sensitive and chippy policers of language than some football fans. Fire up the internet and start anything other than the most positive sentence with the words “All fans of X club are” and you would be accused of appalling bias, hatred of the club, laziness, and a variety of unprintables besides. It is absolutely right that phrases like “a section of fans” and “a minority of fans” appear in news reports relating to the less savoury incidents that occasionally attend the game. But I sometimes feel they need to feature in special highlighted type in case arguably the most oversensitive group in society thinks someone’s accusing them, personally, of whatever it is. Not all United fans. Not all Chelsea fans. Not all England fans. Not all men. But back to Lukaku and this one-eyed notion that stereotyping someone in a manner perceived to be complimentary is somehow problem-free. As huge amounts of psychological research have found, the trouble with supposedly positive stereotypes is that they tend to be accompanied in the minds of those who hold them by distinctly less complimentary ones. Time and again research papers have showed you couldn’t have one without the other: people who saw Asians as great at maths also thought they were cold and remote, and terrible drivers. If we may boil down this tendency to a racist drama in three sentences: why is it racist to say Jews are careful with their money? It’s a compliment, for God’s sake. Bloody hell, trust the Jews to find something to complain about. And so with the Lukaku chant. I’m afraid we have to ask ourselves something about those Manchester United fans chanting their great big compliment at Lukaku: what’s the likelihood the only stereotype those people hold about black people is that they have enormous penises? Honestly, what are the chances? Zero, is the answer to that, whether or not they even realise it. As the aforementioned social psychologists repeatedly find, those who are positively stereotyped in one department are negatively stereotyped in others. For instance, you don’t get people to assume you have a superior penis without them also quietly assuming you have an inferior brain. This is why it is so unreasonable to expect people to laugh along with what may seem to those indulging in it to be “just banter” – be they the subject of the chant himself, or other black people who hear it or hear of it. Not all of them may declare they have a problem with it but the ones who do have a very real and serious problem with it. Why should they be expected to laugh gratefully as you tell them they have a huge penis, when inside they may be well aware you also probably think they’re lazy and more predisposed to criminal behaviour? Obviously, this questionably complimentary stereotyping isn’t restricted to race. It may come as a shock to the system for men given to paying a certain type of compliment but when women heard men praise them for conforming to one positive stereotype – being ladylike, for instance, or nurturing – they stated they were more likely to think the man also held negative stereotypes about them. And why wouldn’t he? He’s a stereotyper. Stands to reason he does it both ways. He may not be saying them out loud but they’re there. Just as they are with Lukaku. Prejudice masquerading as praise may appear superficially more appealing than prejudice without disguise. But only superficially."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/19/trolls-social-media-voting-bar-electoral-commission","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T12:12:00Z","webTitle":"Social media trolls may be vile – but they shouldn’t be barred from voting | Abi Wilkinson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/19/trolls-social-media-voting-bar-electoral-commission","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/19/trolls-social-media-voting-bar-electoral-commission","fields":{"headline":"Social media trolls may be vile – but they shouldn’t be barred from voting \r\n","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The British government’s claim to legitimacy rests entirely on the existence of universal suffrage. Theoretically, at least, we accept the state’s power to fine, imprison and otherwise penalise us not only because it happens to be the best at wielding power, but because all adult citizens have some input into the laws we are governed by. That’s pretty much the central principle of representative democracy. Voting rights are not a special privilege. They are not something the state should be able to take away as a form of petty discipline, like a parent deciding an obstinate child should go to bed without dessert. So it’s worrying to see the Electoral Commission recommend that “social media trolls” be punished in this manner, treating a core civil right as something that can be blithely withdrawn. It’s not that I don’t take online trolling seriously – I have experienced more than my fair share of it. Like most women with strong opinions and some sort of public profile, I’ve been sent rape threats, death threats and been called every name under the sun. Strangers have done bizarre and unsettling things to photographs of my face. I’ve felt scared for my physical safety because of communications I’ve received online. Many such messages are already illegal according to existing laws – probably rightly so. I’m generally wary of the creation of new criminal offences, but persistent, targeted, credible threats of violence aren’t acceptable in any other context, so why should the internet be any different? Others, though, were just unpleasant. I don’t enjoy being bombarded with sexist slurs but I don’t think anyone should be incarcerated for it. “Trolling” has become an incredibly nebulous term which incorporates everything from graphic rape fantasies and stalking to being called a “fat prick”. The UK already removes voting rights from people convicted of offences, of course, providing they are given a custodial sentence. The Electoral Commission’s recommendation appears to be that this should be extended to cover crimes too trivial to receive time in prison. The European court of human rights has condemned the UK’s blanket ban on voting for convicted prisoners, and there does seem to be something deeply wrong about barring people from participating in the very democracy they’re being punished by. (If you find it hard to get too worked up about the rights of murderers and child abusers, remember there are also many people in prison for non-violent offences. Remember also that it’s our legal system that determines who is, for example, the legitimate occupant of a home, and who is a squatter deserving of imprisonment.) Further extending the use of voting bans as a form of punishment would undermine the UK’s status as a functioning democracy. Given how widespread internet trolling is, it’s inevitable that questions will be asked about who is and isn’t targeted. The Electoral Commission’s recommendation was part of an inquiry into the intimidation of political candidates. But what makes trolling an MP qualitatively different from trolling a fellow citizen? The argument needs to be made, if one warrants the removal of a civil right and the other doesn’t. Before embarking on a measure such as this, it’s worth gathering evidence about who is most likely to be abusive or angry towards politicians online. I’d guess: people at the end of their tether. Individuals who have been failed by the state in some way and are lashing out as a result. Arguably, the people whose needs politicians should most take into account. People who have faced particular difficulties are already disproportionately likely to end up in prison and lose their voting rights on that basis. Poorer people and those in unstable living situations are also the most likely to be hit by Conservative plans to make photo ID a requirement for voting – even though the form of electoral fraud it’s ostensibly intended to prevent is basically non-existent in this country. However well-meaning the suggestion, what this recommendation seems to suggest is that our establishment takes voting rights rather lightly. It’s up to all of us to fight back against the pernicious, gradual erosion of our democracy. Poor people and those with chaotic lives shouldn’t be prevented from voting because of expensive photo ID requirements, designed to solve a problem it’s widely accepted does not actually exist. Prisoners should be granted voting rights. And, certainly, we must resist the expansion of voting bans as punishment for more trivial offences. It’s important not to let reasonable concern about the online abuse suffered by MPs blind us to the implications of such a move. Diane Abbott, Labour’s shadow home secretary, who received more abuse than any other MP during the last election, has opposed the suggestion. Politicians are elected to represent us. Their mandate derives from the democratic legitimacy our votes invest them with. Nobody deserves to receive abuse while carrying out their job, but meddling with the basic principles underpinning our political system is not an acceptable (or, in all likelihood, a particularly effective) solution. As they consider this proposal, I’d like to remind the government that it’s the electorate who grant them their power. For society to continue to function properly, there are certain rules they must not disregard. • Abi Wilkinson is a freelance journalist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/19/boris-johnson-tory-scheming-chaos-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T11:27:48Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson is an insult to the nation.

His plotting led to this horror show","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A Stephen King film set to the Benny Hill theme tune: that’s Britain’s current political plight. It feels like a horror show without end yet it is simultaneously preposterous and absurd. For the last two years, Britain has been held hostage by the Tories’ disastrous scheming, plotting and manoeuvring: the EU referendum campaign, the chaotic aftermath, the snap general election. Boris Johnson – and goodness knows what we all did in a past life to deserve him – opportunistically backed Brexit as a career move. Despite his demonstrable buffoonery, he is astute enough to realise that Tory Brexit is spiralling into disaster. He risks going down in the history books as one of the principal architects of a national catastrophe. So now he plots and schemes, helping to plunge an already politically crippled Tory administration into further turmoil as Britain navigates through its postwar greatest crisis. As Ken Clarke notes, in normal times Johnson would have been sacked. But these are not normal times, because the prime minister has no authority and heads a zombie administration united only by panic at the prospect of a Corbyn-led Labour government. It is speculated that Johnson wishes to be sacked, so then he can be a martyr rather than a deserter who can claim that Brexit went wrong because of May’s wrongheadedness, rather than by design. The Tory Brexiteers have already devised their alibis, the traditional “stab-in-the-back” myth of rightwing populists and nationalists, that betrayal and sabotage by opponents – “enemies of the people”, if you will – will be responsible for the process unravelling. The key Brexit strategist Dominic Cummings attempts to absolve himself of blame, too, claiming a premature triggering of Article 50 was like “putting a gun in mouth and kaboom” and the government was being “led like lambs to slaughter”. Tory lies and disastrous Tory scheming: that’s what has driven Britain into chaos. The only time the “£350m a week extra for the NHS” pledge should ever leave a Brexiteer’s lips is when they are grovelling for forgiveness. They knew the figure was a lie, a con, a deceit, a travesty, given Britain’s rebate, and given a portion of the money would still be spent on essential projects. According to Cummings, Britain would probably not have voted for Brexit without that figure. And still Johnson shamelessly parades this falsehood around, leading to a humiliating slapdown by the UK Statistics Authority. Indeed, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Brexit has led to a downgrading of the public finances by about £300m a week. Johnson is an insult to our collective intelligence, and his continued presence as foreign secretary is an insult to the nation. It is worth noting that the Tory acrimony is erupting so swiftly. That’s before Brexit negotiations really do start floundering. What then? The Tories know they are in a hole, but they are so delusional they are addicted to digging. They know that younger people are abandoning them, so Boris Johnson denounces them for having “split allegiances”, while the party toys with making party leader a caricature from the 18th century who opposes equal marriage and abortion in all cases, including for rape and incest. Tory plotting and scheming landed us in this mess. It stands to reason that more of it will not wrest the country from the mire. As their panic increases, so will the plots and the schemes. This is a party that has thrown one of the major western powers into turmoil because of repeated misjudged attempts at gaining partisan advantage. The longer this party is allowed to pretend to govern, the worse the country’s plight will be. • Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"global-development/2017/sep/20/un-deal-end-use-of-children-civilian-joint-task-force-nigeria-battle-with-boko-haram","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T13:07:02Z","webTitle":"UN brokers deal to end use of children in Nigeria's battle with Boko Haram","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/sep/20/un-deal-end-use-of-children-civilian-joint-task-force-nigeria-battle-with-boko-haram","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2017/sep/20/un-deal-end-use-of-children-civilian-joint-task-force-nigeria-battle-with-boko-haram","fields":{"headline":"UN brokers deal to end use of children in Nigeria's battle with Boko Haram","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A landmark agreement between the UN and the Civilian Joint Task Force will end the use of children in the conflict against Boko Haram in north-east Nigeria. According to the UN, between October 2015 and August 2017, more than 360 children were used by the 23,000-strong armed taskforce, some as young as nine. The concord, reached after a year of negotiations led by the UN, will draw a line under the enlistment of children by the group. Minors have been recruited by Boko Haram since its inception in 2013, often for search operations, to guard outposts and to perform night patrols. The Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) is formed largely from vigilante groups in response to the Boko Haram insurgency. The force protects communities in areas poorly guarded by the military, but has been accused of rape and human rights abuses by Human Rights Watch and other rights organisations. Mohamed Fall, a Unicef representative in Nigeria, said: “We have seen too many childhoods destroyed by the crisis in the north-east. Today’s agreement is an important milestone for child protection and paves the way for a brighter future for children caught up in the conflict.” Under an action plan, implemented as part of the agreement with the Borno state government and Nigerian state authorities, children will receive psycho-social support and undertake community reintegration programmes, and attempts will be made to reunite them with their families. Jibrin Gunda, the legal adviser for the CJTF, said the agreement was a vital step. “We’ve already started to carry out the action plan we signed with the UN,” he said. “Anyone under the age of 18 will no longer be a part of the CJTF. We are doing our best to make sure we are on the right side of human rights codes.” The special representative of the secretary-general for children and armed conflict, Virginia Gamba, said the deal was a source of hope for children affected by the fighting. “Now that the action plan has been signed, I urge the CJTF to fully implement it in order to end and prevent the recruitment and use of children once and for all.” A UN report has shown that, since the insurgency began in Nigeria in 2009, more than 8,000 children have been recruited by Boko Haram, with children – especially young girls – increasingly used as suicide bombers. The report also found that attacks by Boko Haram on communities and security forces had resulted in the deaths of more than 3,900 children. A further 7,300 have been injured. In the same period, suicide attacks became the second leading cause of child casualties, accounting for more than 1,000 deaths and 2,100 injuries. In December the Nigerian government claimed to have technically defeated Boko Haram. However, Nigeria’s president, Muhammadu Buhari, said in a state broadcast last month that the group remained a threat after a rise in attacks this year, including the bombing of a market in Maiduguri last month that claimed 27 lives."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/24/marry-waterson-david-jaycock-death-had-quicker-wings-than-love-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T07:00:38Z","webTitle":"Marry Waterson and David A Jaycock: Death Had Quicker Wings Than Love review – forlorn, dreamy folk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/24/marry-waterson-david-jaycock-death-had-quicker-wings-than-love-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/24/marry-waterson-david-jaycock-death-had-quicker-wings-than-love-review","fields":{"headline":"Marry Waterson and David A Jaycock: Death Had Quicker Wings Than Love review – forlorn, dreamy folk","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"A member of Yorkshire’s Waterson/Carthy folk dynasty, Marry sings in a style reminiscent of her late mother, Lal, and her aunt Norma; strong but plaintive, with a tendency to wistfulness that comes through on this set of originals around the theme of loss.

The 35-acre site is free to enter and home to thousands of plants, a butterfly farm and a peaceful lily pond. The dense shrubbery acts as a barrier to the thrum of the city, and turtles, sloths and iguanas also call these gardens home. The gardens, just north of downtown near the University of Antioquia, were opened in 1972, when the plot of land they occupy was rescued from development. They are named after a revered local geographer and botanist who died in 1935 and have developed into a popular, contemporary attraction, symbolic of Medellín’s own regeneration. In 2008, the city held a competition for local architects to redevelop the park. The winner, Plan B Architects, designed the centrepiece: the Orchideorama, a 20-metre-tall wooden mesh of modular structures that shelters an orchid collection. It consists of 10 supports (stems), each of which holds six hexagonal structures (petals). The petals slot together, forming a shelter. Underneath each stem the plants are sustained by rainwater collected by the petals, which drains down through the stem. The structure also hosts the butterfly farm and events from yoga classes to cinema screenings. The Orchideorama is a clever – and aesthetically pleasing – reminder of the structural similarities between nature and architecture. With lots to explore, and plenty of quiet green spaces, the gardens are a great place to catch your breath and chill out away from the sprawling mass of downtown Medellín.

The foreign secretary told reporters in New York he would not resign and denied the cabinet was split over Brexit policy, insisting: “We are a nest of singing birds.” But it is understood that Johnson considers it could be a resigning matter if May veers towards the kind of “soft Brexit” advocated by Philip Hammond, the chancellor, when she makes a key speech in Florence on Friday. The Telegraph reported on Tuesday that the foreign secretary could even quit the cabinet before the weekend if May signals that she will sign up the UK to paying for access to the single market permanently in an arrangement similar to staying in the European Economic Area (EEA). This option similar to the arrangements adopted by Switzerland is known by its critics as the “EEA-lite”, but would be a way of preserving the benefits of the single market. Friends of Johnson told the newspaper he “could not live with” the version of Brexit under consideration, which prompted the publication of his personal blueprint for Brexit in the Telegraph at the weekend. The foreign secretary – who appears to have the backing of other pro-leave ministers, including Michael Gove – was unhappy about some of the wording in early drafts of the speech. He was concerned the prime minister was preparing to send a public signal that she would like to see a close long-term relationship with the rest of the EU along the lines of Norway, or Switzerland – with more leeway over freedom of movement. Johnson and others fear that would limit the UK’s ability to do deals with other countries; and require the UK to mirror EU regulations too closely. Saturday’s controversial Daily Telegraph article was aimed at sending a signal he could not support such a relationship. One source close to Johnson said the Telegraph’s claims that a resignation could be imminent were nonsense and “totally made-up”. However, his article was widely regarded as a warning shot to the prime minister as she prepares to deliver her major Brexit speech on Friday. Johnson was piqued that a meeting of other senior ministers involved in Brexit was held last week when he was inspecting hurricane damage in the Caribbean. May is also in New York, attending the UN general assembly. Asked whether she still backed the foreign secretary, she told Sky: “Boris Johnson has been here at the United Nations doing important work yesterday in a meeting on Burma. “I will be seeing Boris at various stages during our time here, but of course we have got very busy programmes.” May will convene a special meeting of her cabinet on Thursday, to consult colleagues about her speech. A Number 10 source said: “The PM has said consistently that she values the contribution of people from across the cabinet, and clearly this is a significant moment in terms of our progress, and in terms of our relationship with Europe.” May’s spokesman also underlined the fact that May plans to use the speech to discuss not just transitional arrangements, but Britain’s ongoing partnership with the rest of the EU. “She will talk about the future relationship going forward, as well as the progress on the talks so far,” he said. Asked if she was confident of getting consensus on her Brexit strategy at Thursday’s meeting, May said: “Yes, the cabinet is absolutely clear about the destination we are aiming for in relation to our European negotiations. “We want to make sure we get the best possible deal for the United Kingdom as we leave the European Union. What we want to do is to ensure not just a good deal on trade, but also on our future security and relationship on law enforcement and criminal justice.” Asked what she wanted Johnson to do, in the light of reports he may resign, May said: “What I want the government to do is what the government is doing, Boris and others, all very clear about the destination we have as a country and that is getting that deep and special relationship with the EU when we leave, but a partnership that still leaves us as the UK free to make trade deals around the world. and free to take control of our laws, our borders and our money.” Asked if she had “got her mojo back”, May said: “I’m doing what I always do, which is getting on with the job and, you know what, I think that’s what the British people expect their prime minister to do.” Speculation about the foreign secretary’s future has been rife since the article was published, as some senior Conservatives believe he should have been sacked for departing from collective responsibility. Ken Clarke, the former chancellor, said he would undoubtedly have been dismissed if May was not in such a weak position. “Sounding off personally in this way is totally unhelpful and he shouldn’t exploit the fact that [Theresa May] hasn’t got a majority in parliament,” Clarke said on Tuesday. “And he knows perfectly well that, normally, a foreign secretary would be sacked instantly for doing that.” However, May could leave herself vulnerable to a leadership challenge if she sacked Johnson, whose intervention won the backing of hardline eurosceptics and former Vote Leave supporters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2017/sep/20/it-movie-film-exploring-stephen-king-maine-bangor-mount-hope-cemetery","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T05:30:38Z","webTitle":"The It factor: exploring Stephen King’s Maine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/sep/20/it-movie-film-exploring-stephen-king-maine-bangor-mount-hope-cemetery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/sep/20/it-movie-film-exploring-stephen-king-maine-bangor-mount-hope-cemetery","fields":{"headline":"The It factor: exploring Stephen King’s Maine","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It would be wrong to say the recent film release of Stephen King’s It has brought about a resurgence of interest in the writer. Because for the past 40 years the interest has rarely gone away. Sure, he shuns the literary spotlight but culturally, socially and politically, he has been ever present. Not least now, as he calls out Donald Trump on Twitter almost daily. Who could have predicted that a horror film with no stars in it, based on a 1986 doorstop of book that had already been filmed for a television miniseries in 1990, would prove to be the surprise hit of 2017 and have the highest-grossing and biggest opening ever for a horror movie? Born in Portland, Maine, King moved around a lot as a child, but he went to the University of Maine in 1966, and has been mostly settled in his home state. The fictional town of Derry, that appears in so many of his stories, is based on Bangor, a couple of hours up the interstate from Portland. “Derry is Bangor,” King has said. He moved his family there in 1979 for the schools and small-town community – and because it inspired him. The town has stories to tell. So when following in his footsteps – and chasing the metaphorical red balloon – it felt fitting to start there. Bangor Public Library This behemoth of a library was preserved after King and his wife Tabitha pledged $3m towards its restoration in 2013. Locals are keen to regale visitors with tales of King’s generosity. Although he does not like his philanthropy to be publicised, a website, stkfoundation.org, accepts requests. He had already contributed $2.5m towards the library’s new wing, in the 1990s. Built in 1913 after the old library burned down, this building, with a grand facade and entrance, was designed by Boston architects Peabody &amp; Stearns. In elegant pale stone, with large windows and lots of historic paintings and sculptures, it’s a writer’s dream (and where much of this article was written). • 145 Harlow St, bpl.lib.me.us Stephen King’s House King’s towering and delightfully eccentric gothic mansion sits on a leafy, tree-lined street just outside downtown Bangor. With its black wrought-iron fencing shaped into spiders and bats, it should look out of place but, like the man himself, it blends into its surroundings despite being characteristically dark. At the end of last month, a red balloon appeared in a front window, in reference to Pennywise the clown’s method of luring victims in It. King is known for coming out to greet fans, so it doesn’t feel weird to stand outside uninvited. If anything, the red balloon is an invitation. Fans have left packages, flowers and books for him and have even chalked on the pavement outside. • 47 West Broadway The Barrens, Bangor Members of the Losers Club in It, congregate at the isolated Barrens in Derry to lay their plots. Sure enough, the Barrens in Bangor is a walking trail through the woods by the Kenduskeag stream. There’s a viewpoint on Valley Avenue, north of town, but that felt a bit detached to me. I wanted to be ensconced in the Losers Club, so clambered down to walk on the rocks. After all, as is pointed out in the film: “Who doesn’t love splashing around in shitty water?” Despite the peaceful sound of trickling water and a wall of trees, it’s very overgrown and difficult to describe as picturesque: a large drain cover gave me the shudders, for obvious reasons. Gerald Winters and Son bookshop, Bangor Betts Books on Hammond Street used to specialise in King first editions, and the man himself was said to turn up unannounced to chat with fans, but it closed and went online-only in 2008.Bangor was crying out for a walk-in store of King memorabilia, and Gerald Winters stepped up. His staggering array of limited editions, manuscripts, proofs and screenplays makes this a definitive King museum. Even though he would obviously prefer buyers, he seemed more than happy for me to browse and admire these rare originals. • 48 Main Street, geraldwinters.com Thomas Hill Standpipe This water storage facility, which also controls Bangor’s water pressure, has been in constant use since 1897. And in It, it’s the inspiration for the Standpipe in Derry, where Stan first encounters Pennywise. There are no recorded drowning accidents in the standpipe, but for anyone who has read the book or seen either the film or the miniseries, this is an incredibly eerie place to be – even though you’re just staring at an old water tower. Which tells you everything you need to know about the power of King’s writing. Or, as Beverly Marsh states towards the end of It: “I want to run toward something, not away.” • Thomas Hill Road, bangorwater.org Mount Hope cemetery A 10-minute drive east of Bangor is the cemetery that appeared in the film version of Pet Sematary (in the scene King cameos in, no less). Despite being one of the oldest garden cemeteries in America, it’s well-kept and reminiscent of a National Trust garden with its trees, floral scents and fresh-cut grass. Granted, this is not what many King fans want to hear. • 1048 State Street University of Maine, Orono As well as writing for the university newspaper while studying here, King met his wife in the Raymond H Fogler Library, where they both worked. Housing more than a million volumes, it is a literary fan’s paradise. The vast open space is lit by hanging interrogation-style bulbs. Knowing that King found both his partner and vocation for life surrounded by these dusty books made this an important stop for me. The reason for his many personal appearances in schools is possibly thanks to a moment he had while studying here. “I remember the first time I saw a real-life writer,” he said. “I was a freshman at the University of Maine. And Joseph Heller came to town to talk about Catch-22 and I remember thinking, I’m breathing the same air as the guy who thought up Yossarian and Major Major. I was just in love with reading. I was flabbergasted with amazement that that guy was there. Then I realised he was just a guy. And I’m just a guy.” • go.umaine.edu, call +1 207 581 1561 to book a free campus tour Pet Sematary House, Orrington A 15-minute drive south of Bangor is Orrington, with a population of less than 4,000. Famously, it is where King discovered a pet cemetery (the sign for which was scrawled by a child: Pet Sematary) behind a house he and his family were renting. After their cat died and was buried there, he began conceiving the plot for the novel. Ellsworth, 30 miles east, is where much of the film was shot, and fans can also drive another 10 miles to Hancock to see the house where the 1989 movie Pet Sematary was filmed (303 Point Road). “It’s the scariest of all the books, there’s no question about it,” King told a class of kids at Sussex High School, New Brunswick in 2012. “It’s just horrifying. I just put it in a drawer because I didn’t think anyone would want to read it.” • 664 River Road, Orrington Portland Maine’s largest city, Portland, is where King was born and where Beverly is headed at the end of the film of It. An old port town with period architecture and a revamped waterfront, it’s a lively place. It also boasts one of the best comic book stores in the world, Casablanca Comics, and at least six record stores, the most comprehensive being Bull Moose, which is home to a discount bin of VHS videos at 30 cents each. I picked up King’s The Tommyknockers TV miniseries, and Carrie on VHS for 60 cents plus tax. • visitportland.com) Mainely Murders, Kennebunk Rather than stay overnight in Portland, I drove for 40 minutes – through tiny villages with outdoor flea markets and antique shops reminiscent of the store in King’s Needful Things, – to Kennebunk, a town so perfect and so quaint that darkness can only lie beneath. With its red bricks, white picket fences and old gas stations, it’s more reminiscent of the 1980s version of Derry that appears in the new It film than Bangor itself. I stayed at the Port Inn (doubles from $120 room only) a little way out of town, which is run by English ex-pat Angela Murphy and feels more like a British B&amp;B than a traditional motel. I wanted to visit the Mainely Murders bookshop because it seemed so intrinsically King. It’s stacked high with books and run by avid crime fiction fans Paula and Ann. Their sign of a knife dripping with blood, adorns the otherwise charming street. • 1 Bourne Street, Kennebunk, mainelymurders.com The Algonquin Resort, St Andrews by-the-Sea, New Brunswick, Canada Before you leave Bangor, head across the Canadian border at Saint Stephen, New Brunswick, and drive for 20 minutes to the Algonquin Resort in Saint Andrews. USA Today named this small seaside town the best destination in Canada earlier this year, so Water Street is not as quiet as it used to be. It’s lined with fish restaurants, seaside coffee shops (the best is Honeybeans, 157 Water Street; don’t miss its Nanaimo bar, a traditional creamy and chocolatey Canadian treat), shacks offering whale-watching trips and even a Video Shoppe. The Algonquin Resort, a 10-minute walk away, is one of a few across North America rumoured to have inspired The Shining. I could see why as soon as I arrived: the 19th-century Tudor-style building screams spookiness and is believed by many to be haunted. The hotel makes the most of this, offering ghost tours and telling stories about roaming spirits and nighttime sounds and jolts.

Three times the courts told her to return Samim Bigzad, a 23-year-old asylum seeker who was cowering in a hotel room in Kabul, threatened with beheading by the Taliban. Three times she refused, thinking she knew best and the courts had got it wrong. It displayed a disdainful arrogance for the courts and the law. Unless she has an explanation, she has to go as home secretary. And the person who has a duty to see that the home secretary operates within the rule of law is the lord chancellor, David Lidington. This is as much a test of him as it is of her. The story of Samim Bigzad is chilling. He came to the UK from Afghanistan in 2015. His father was already here, and suffers from severe post-traumatic stress disorder. Samim initially entered illegally, but then claimed asylum. He had worked on US construction projects in Kabul, hence the Taliban threat. The Home Office refused Samim’s application for asylum. It indicated it would remove him on a date to be fixed. Just after 8am last Tuesday Samim was told he would be deported to Kabul via Istanbul by a flight leaving later that morning. His lawyers made further representations to prevent removal. The Home Office rejected them. Samim then started judicial review proceedings including seeking an application to stop his removal pending the hearing for the full judicial review. Although the approach of the Home Office was typically harsh, up to this point it had not acted unlawfully. It was last Tuesday evening that it crossed the line into unlawfulness. At 9.53pm that night, the lawyers were notified that Mr Justice Morris had granted an injunction ordering the Home Office to take Samim off the flight to Kabul and to return him to London. The Home Office was told of the injunction immediately and had a copy of the order at 10pm that evening. At that point Samim was in transit. The plane had landed at Istanbul, and was due to take off on a connecting flight at 10.30pm for Kabul. The Home Office decided not to remove him from the plane, and Samim was flown on to Kabul. On the face of it, the Home Office broke the order by not taking him off the plane at Istanbul. Whatever the reason was for not doing so, it should have immediately made arrangements for his return to the UK when he arrived in Kabul later that night, in accordance with the judge’s order. But it did nothing. Any doubts it might have had about what its legal duty was were laid to rest later on Wednesday afternoon when Mr Justice Jay ordered that Samim be returned to the UK as quickly as possible. For good measure, he said that the Home Office was already “prima facie” in contempt, and that any thoughts it had of seeking to vary or discharge the earlier order were not a reason for disobeying it. Despite the absolute clarity of both orders, the Home Office again refused to obey. A third judge, Mrs Justice Lang, last Thursday, dismissed any attempt to vary the order and ordered the immediate return of Samim. She also made clear that immediate obedience was required. Still the Home Office thought it knew best. It did nothing, and on Saturday it went to the court of appeal. It said all the orders were wrong. The appeal court gave it short shrift, and finally, the Home Office made arrangements for Samim to be flown back to the UK where he eventually arrived on Sunday night. Who did Amber Rudd think she was? No special rules about court orders apply to her. She cannot ignore them and shop around the judges until she gets what she wants. She is like everybody else in this country. She has to obey the courts. And of all the people who have a critical duty to obey court orders, it is the executive. Without the means of holding the executive to account there is no means of ensuring that it is the rule of law that prevails, rather than rule by the decree of ministers or civil servants. We have been here before. In 1991 the Home Office gave an undertaking not to deport an asylum seeker to Zaire because he was in fear for his life. As in this case, he was in transit and the Home Office refused to remove him from the plane he was on, which had stopped in Paris. He flew on to Zaire and was never seen again, almost certainly meeting the fate he had feared. When proceedings were brought against the then home secretary, Kenneth Baker, he argued that ministers of the crown could not be the subject of contempt of contempt proceedings. The House of Lords shot that argument down. They said that if that was right it would mean the executive obeyed the law “as a matter of grace, not as a matter of necessity, a proposition which would reverse the result of the civil war”. Home secretaries all too often regard the courts as the enemy, standing in the way of what the minister knows to be best for the country. Maybe they do in some cases, but if home secretaries can override the courts, we are lost as a nation. Rudd’s attitude last week was exactly the same as that displayed by the Daily Mail to the Brexit judges – get out of our way, we know best. The horrific difference is that the home secretary actually has the power to send people to their death, whereas the Daily Mail simply shouts from the sidelines. Rudd has showed a stunning disregard for the law. When asked about the case on The Andrew Marr Show, there was not a hint of explanation or apology. In addition to her own duty, there is another figure in government charged with ensuring compliance with the rule of law – the lord chancellor. The test for former lord chancellor Liz Truss came when the Brexit judges were undermined by government ministers as seeking to thwart the will of the people. Instead of coming to the judges’ defence, which was her duty, irrespective of collective responsibility, she desperately sought instructions from the PM’s special advisers about what to do. They told her to keep quiet, and she lost her job as a result. The test for her successor, David Lidington, has come now. He is the defender of the rule of law in the executive. He must make it clear that this arrogant disdain for the law will not occur in the future, or ensure that Rudd does so. If he does not act, I cannot see him lasting much longer than Truss did. • Charles Falconer is a former lord chancellor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/24/why-we-are-hard-wired-to-watch-pornography","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T08:30:40Z","webTitle":"Why we are hard wired to watch pornography | Daniel Glaser","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/24/why-we-are-hard-wired-to-watch-pornography","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/24/why-we-are-hard-wired-to-watch-pornography","fields":{"headline":"Why we are hard wired to watch pornography","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The launch of David Simon’s new series The Deuce (starting on 26 September), has thrust pornography back into the spotlight. One of the most famous neuroscientific discoveries of the last decade probably plays a role. This is the finding of a ‘mirror neuron’ in the cortex of a macaque monkey, so named because it fires both when the monkey sees an action and when it performs it – ‘mirroring’ behaviour it witnesses. Cells in the human brain have been shown to exhibit similar behaviour. Dancers use their knowledge of movement to help them see it: to understand and enjoy it more. The implications for pornography are clear. Without such a system in the brain, explaining why people find watching sex arousing is difficult. There have been a few studies demonstrating a correlation between mirror-system activation and erections in men, but it’s largely escaped systematic study. It’s hard to believe that this use has evolutionary significance, although some studies have shown that male monkeys will give up a certain amount of fruit juice to look at pictures of female monkeys’ bottoms.

I liked him a lot, before he went all Hollywood. I particularly liked his thoughts on happiness, how, rather than being any kind of permanent state, it only ever comes in blasts. “Nobody’s happy,” he spat in his abrasive way. “It comes in small doses, folks: it’s a cigarette butt, or a chocolate-chip cookie, or a five-second orgasm. You come, you eat the cookie, you smoke the butt, you go to sleep, you wake up in the morning and you go to fucking work. That is it, end of fucking list.” I’m remembering this as I walk the back streets of Clerkenwell with the distinct mulchy tang of autumn in the air. A favourite part of a great city, my favourite season, en route to a favourite restaurant where I’ll be eating with a favourite person: that’s my cookie-cig-butt-orgasm right there. I could not be happier. For this, my last review for the Guardian, I’m taking the opportunity offered by an adjustment in ownership and kitchen rethink to retrace my steps of a few years ago to The Quality Chop House. Fortunately, the extraordinary, wood-pewed, tiled-floor interior from its days as a “Progressive Working Class Caterer” is listed and can’t change. If it were down to me, they should also slap a listing on Shaun Searley: that rarest of creatures, a supremely talented chef who appears to be ego-free. Any grandstanding he might feel like doing ends up on the plate, to the ultimate joy and benefit of the diner, not the glorification of the kitchen. His treatment of grouse – they’re big on seasonal game – is ravishing enough to render me temporarily speechless. The bird, British autumnal cookery at its most intense, is hardly ever tampered with in even the most ambitious establishments, but Searley is clever enough to tweak just a few shades away from the traditional, just enough to turn the often challenging little beast into something spectacular. He roasts it to burnished bronze, the flesh still carmine inside, then removes the legs and minces them with its offal and fine black pudding into a rich, cauled faggot served with velvety celeriac puree and sticky, reduced meat glaze. This is sybaritism in a little copper saucepan. Instead of rowan or redcurrant jelly, there’s a homemade greengage preserve: sharp, sweet, perfect. There’s a crouton, game chips, bread sauce and chicken liver parfait; I’ve spoken of this parfait before, but seriously, I’d happily apply it to my face nightly, as rich and luxurious as anything in Selfridges’ cosmetics hall. But I’m rushing ahead. Before this come the tiniest, most fragile tartlets filled with a jam of beetroot and savoury Devon Blue cheese custard dusted with a crunch of walnut; jet-black squid ink wafers plunged into almost foamy smoked cod’s roe, punctuated by the odd bracingly sour blast from lemon and petals of pickled onion; home-cured, smoky speck. And, afterwards, Salisbury honey tart, sweet and wobbly as an ingenue, and Capezzana ice-cream doused with what seems like too much of the eponymous olive oil until you taste it and sigh. It’s an almost pitch-perfect meal. Maybe I wouldn’t bother gilding the legendary confit potatoes by topping them with masses of salty Exmoor caviar, and I’d hesitate before adding a pruney puree (caramelised onion?) to grubby up the cleanliness of a slab of cod with crab, sweetcorn and chilli. But these are the most entitled of critic-y quibbles, and I scarfed them all with pleasure. Even butter – primrose-yellow, cultured, made in-house from raw Guernsey cream and served with superb sourdough – is a thing of enchantment. Descriptions of the many excellent wines on offer – “plum sap and dark chocolate”, “waxy lemon skins and honey”, “ferrous earth and meaty cherries” – read like poetry. If anything, my love for the place has intensified. Staff are always brilliant, professional, enthusiastic, with none of that robotic perfection or forced new-best-pal matiness. Searley’s increased confidence means dishes are better than ever. I’m still reluctant to squash my ample bahookie on to their significantly non-ample benches designed for the “working men” (clearly the working men were less devoted to hedonism) – so if you’re looking for me, I’ll be in the bar, happy as all the clams. • The Quality Chop House 88-94 Farringdon Road, London EC1, 020-7278 1452.

We know this because they have scheduled the next draw for a time when British people might be vaguely conscious, and will broadcast it on a channel with which British people might be vaguely familiar. But before that, some football. Highlights are almost too many to mention, but include some of those romantic meetings that only cup competitions can throw up. Crystal Palace host Huddersfield for the first time since last month, Aston Villa host Middlesbrough for the first time since last Tuesday, and Brighton head to Bournemouth for the first time since last Friday. Meanwhile, Leicester won’t get another chance to welcome Liverpool to the King Power Stadium for a televised match until this Saturday. These are occasions that quite literally don’t come along every day. Talking of the area where the football/television Venn diagram (basically one circle inside another circle these days) intersects, Burnley’s Sean Dyche admitted, before his side’s game against Championship pacesetters Nasty Leeds, that he has particularly fond memories of the competition because “you used to win a telly for being man of the match from Rumbelows. When you’re at Chesterfield and you’re earning what you’re earning and you win a telly, it’s a fantastic moment. I actually gave it to my mum and dad.” And to think, all Raheem Sterling’s mum got was an amazing house with a crystal-encrusted sink. This being the nation’s least-beloved major cup competition (until your team wins it, of course) there will inevitably be squad rotation. Chelsea’s Antonio Conte has relished “a good opportunity to give a chance to some players that in the moment didn’t play a lot”, which in his overprivileged case includes Eden Hazard. Elsewhere, the Nottingham Post has spotted that Forest have lost the last three games in which they were officiated by Chris Kavanagh, who will take charge of their tie on Wednesday. “Is this,” they ask, “a bad omen?” Perhaps, but not as bad an omen as conceding 16 goals in their last eight games, or having to play Chelsea. Relatively unfamiliar faces preparing for a rare run-out include Liverpool’s Danny Ward and Marko Grujic, Brighton’s Ezequiel Schelotto and Manchester United’s Scott McTominay. The game against Burton Albion is expected to be the lanky 20-year-old’s first competitive outing of the season, as he seeks to push his claims for a place in United’s first-choice midfield. “Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard are role models to me because they were late developers like I am,” he said in anticipation. “Not everybody is born at 16 years old physically ready to go straight into the Premier League.” The Fiver is no scientist, but as far as we know hardly anybody is born at 16 years old.

He is halfway through recalling how the lure of a trip to Madagascar, while in South Africa more than a decade ago, prompted him to swap football for film sets and led to him successfully auditioning for the role of Oliver Twist in the BBC’s adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel. Miller’s story is absorbing and he speaks candidly over an hour in which the unassuming Burton Albion midfielder makes fascinating company, as he discusses working alongside Tom Hardy, getting cold feet about a Martin Scorsese film, learning off Christian Eriksen and Harry Kane at Tottenham Hotspur, and looking forward to the next chapter of the Brewers’ “incredible” journey. Next up for Burton is a trip to Manchester United on Wednesday. The year these teams last met, in the FA Cup in 2006, Miller accrued his first television credit, as Pieter Beijerinck, in a documentary drama, Krakatoa, directed by his father, Sam, whose family were on location in Durban. “There was a part for a young boy and the young boy couldn’t do it for some reason, so my dad was like: ‘I need you to do it.’ I was like: ‘I can’t, no way. I don’t want to do that, I am not interested in that.’ But he said: ‘If you do it, you will get to go to Madagascar’, because they were shooting there for a week, so I was like: ‘Cool, I will do it.’” Miller’s mother, Janine Wood, is an actress who has starred in The Bill and The Inbetweeners. When Miller returned home to Hackney, a friend of hers encouraged him to go to an open audition for Oliver Twist. “I was not too conscious of myself or what could be,” Miller says. “I was not like: ‘I have got to get this part.’ It just happened and it was just a very natural process. I can’t really remember my feelings towards it but I remember I just had the decision that I could either do this or I do football. And I thought that opportunity was ridiculous. I never saw that, never envisaged it, and I never really even wanted it.” He got through seven auditions and beat off competition from around 700 others to land the role, in which he starred alongside Timothy Spall and Rob Brydon after three months of filming. “I remember meeting just the best people. I had some really good relationships and good times with people. Tom Hardy played Bill Sykes and I really looked up to him. But everyone in the crew was great. I was so fortunate to be involved in that experience – it was incredible.” Then an agent came along – and more roles followed: Runaway, a TV series and a film called The Kid – “a really interesting project to work on”. Then came more movie auditions, including Hugo and X-Men, but after two years of acting he sought a return to football. Miller, who attended Stoke Newington secondary school in north-east London, was missing a lot of lessons, as well as his friends. “I always thought to myself: ‘Obviously acting is always a possibility no matter what age you are but football’s not’, and I really want to pursue that. It was a big decision because I think I was actually getting to a point where I was becoming really quite established, and I was starting to get auditions for good roles and stuff. “I remember going up for the Martin Scorsese film Hugo. My dad was like: ‘This is a Martin Scorsese film, you have to do this.’ But my parents were so supportive, they did not try to stop me at all and if anything they probably pushed me harder to pursue what I really wanted to pursue. They come to every game they can.” Miller joined Tottenham’s development centre at the age of 14 and two years later signed a contract eight months into a year’s trial. “I think I got it because they were unsure on me basically,” he smiles. He was a regular fixture in the Spurs youth sides but his first real taste of senior football came on loan at Burton last season. A permanent return and linking back up with the manager, Nigel Clough, on deadline day this summer was a “no-brainer” but it is clear Miller loved every minute of his grounding at Tottenham. He speaks of his respect for Mauricio Pochettino – whose “morals and standards are so high” – and is choked at the mention of the “incredible” Ugo Ehiogu, the club’s former under-23s coach, who died in April. In terms of players, he cites Eriksen, Ben Davies and Kane as standout influences on his career. “How can you not learn from those kind of players in that situation?” Miller says. “I started the pre-season with the first team which was great, because their training was ridiculous and you are surrounded by incredible players. Of course in my head I said: ‘OK, I am going to give it everything, I need to make my mark, I’m 21 and it’s now or never.’ I thought I did well in pre-season and then went to America and didn’t play. That was disappointing and kind of from there I was like: ‘I need to start thinking about moving elsewhere because it’s probably not going to happen.’ “It was difficult [to leave] but I felt like it was the right thing to do. It’s strange because last season I was here [at Burton] but I was on loan so it was like: ‘I’ve got Tottenham to go back to’, almost as like a safety net. But now it’s stepping into the big boy world – this is it now. The under-23s especially; it’s like your university, and now I’m leaving that and stepping out. It’s a good feeling and it’s how you grow.” One of his favourite things about being a child actor was meeting so many colourful characters. He absolutely loathed, and still loathes, watching himself on screen, though. “I hated watching myself, I couldn’t do it,” he says. “It is cringy, it is cringy. It’s strange; it doesn’t feel like me. It was such a different lifestyle and time.” On the day of this interview, Liam Boyce, the striker Burton signed from Ross County for a club record £500,000 this summer (but is ruled out for the season with a knee injury), requested to see Oliver in action. Miller is used to getting some stick from team-mates, who poke fun at video clips. “I never really wanted people to find out,” he says. “I mean, obviously they were going to find out but I don’t want to be known as the boy that done acting, you know. When you come into a different profession, you want to be known for that, you want to be known as the football player. Not: ‘Oh yeah, he was Oliver Twist.’ I always felt that was a big thing for me. “ I definitely don’t want to be known as Oliver Twist but Will Miller who plays football. And in any profession, say if I was to go back into acting, I would want to be known as Will Miller the actor, not Will Miller who used to play football. I think that’s natural.” Some more acting? “I am not ruling it out,” Miller says, grinning, “But I really don’t know if I can still act.” Miller, 21, speaks glowingly of the personal touch at Burton, a family-run club whose average gate is 5,200 and who are punching above their weight in the Championship. The chairman, Ben Robinson, who turns 72 on Friday, has been involved for 33 years, across two spells, and has sacked only one manager, Paul Peschisolido. “This is a nice friendly, family club that cares about people,” Robinson, whose financial services business sits on Burton’s High Street, says. “And through it all we have smiled. When you have been involved a long time, you are able to cope with the highs and lows and that’s what you need to do in this game.” Robinson’s daughter, Fleur, is the commercial director. His son, Ben, doubles up as the bar manager and a sort of player liaison. And his partner of 25 years also helps on the corporate side on a match day. Sir Alex Ferguson opened the Brewers’ £7.4m Pirelli Stadium on 14 November 2005, alongside Clough’s mother, Barbara, and Dominic Sandivasci, the chairman of Pirelli, and Robinson is hoping to catch Ferguson on Wednesday. He plans to get him to sign a commemorative bottle of wine, from when United won the FA Cup in 1990, that was given to him by Barry Adcock, a financial director at Burton in the 70s. “I’m hoping to get Sir Alex to sign it and then auction it off,” Robinson says. As for Clough, his older brother, Simon, is the chief scout and unearthed Jackson Irvine, who left for Hull City for a club record fee of around £2m this summer. The squad, who include no fewer than six former Derby County players, train at nearby St George’s Park, the Football Association’s 330-acre national football site. Other notable quirks include the role of the assistant manager, Gary Crosby, who scarcely attends Burton games and instead assesses upcoming opposition, so the first-team coach, Andy Garner, is Clough’s sidekick in the dugout. Robinson insists his manager, not Antonio Conte, should have been – “without question” – voted the LMA manager of the year last season for keeping Burton afloat in the Championship, given his limited resources and the league’s smallest budget. The last time United and Burton met, in a tie which went to a replay, Robinson received emails from Cambodia and Argentina and says those two “phenomenal” matches really put Burton upon Trent and the town’s football club on the map. Rubbing shoulders against United again really will be David v Goliath stuff. “We would struggle to beat Manchester United’s second team – that’s the reality of it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/21/the-horrors-v-review-spindly-indie-survivors-hit-their-sweet-spot","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T11:00:32Z","webTitle":"The Horrors: V review – spindly indie survivors hit their sweet spot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/21/the-horrors-v-review-spindly-indie-survivors-hit-their-sweet-spot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/21/the-horrors-v-review-spindly-indie-survivors-hit-their-sweet-spot","fields":{"headline":"The Horrors: V review – spindly indie survivors hit their sweet spot","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Let us briefly take a detour down memory lane. It is 2007 and, as a contestant on the most recent series of Big Brother has so eloquently put it, “there’s a new music that’s taking over our country and it’s called … ‘indie’”. The Pigeon Detectives bestride the Top 20. The second Razorlight album has just been certified five times platinum. The pages of the Observer play host to a feature that wonders aloud how Bloc Party will cope with being propelled to superstardom as a result of their new album: “A zeitgeist-defining record that rips up the rock rulebook.” Strange days indeed, but imagine the consternation you could cause were you able to offer everyone a glimpse into the future, a world 10 years hence where Razorlight are headlining not Reading and Leeds but a VW campervan convention in Llangollen; where the lead singer of the Kaiser Chiefs is now best-known as a judge on a talent show, and where the frontman of the Arctic Monkeys has left Yorkshire, changed his accent and now favours the world not with gritty vignettes of provincial Britain, but updates from the frontline of life as a swashbuckling multi-millionaire cocksman, rampant amid the sun-bronzed lovelies of Hollywood. Perhaps the biggest shock you might deliver is the news that the Horrors are still going. Few new bands in 2007 seemed less likely to last: an amusing but wafer-thin confection of goth clothes, funny pseudonyms and chaotic garage rock, haplessly buffeted by a very knowing kind of music press hype. When they appeared on the NME’s cover, its editor offered the caveat “they look awful and sound terrible”, as if to underline that the quintet were not made of the same vital stuff as the Automatic or the Enemy. And yet, here we are, a decade on, considering their fifth album. Perhaps the fact that no one really expected them to do anything more than ignominiously split when the hype died down gave them a certain freedom. Certainly, they have proved capable of constantly shifting and mutating in a way most of their contemporaries haven’t. It’s a process that continues on V, an album that sees them teaming up with Paul Epworth: once the go-to producer for post-punkish alt rockers, but latterly more likely to be found working with Adele and U2. Inveterate record collectors with great taste and, increasingly, the ability to twist their influences to their own ends, the Horrors have sounded great since their second album, 2009’s psychedelic, krautrock-infused Primary Colours. But Epworth appears to have tightened up their songwriting until literally every track has a melody powerful enough to sing out over the thrilling noise the band make, from opener Hologram’s stew of Tubeway Army electronics, howling Robert Fripp guitar and churning, fizzing TB-303 acid lines, to the closing Something to Remember Me By, seven minutes of chattering, synthesised melancholy that may be the best thing the Horrors have ever done. In this task, Epworth is aided by vocalist Faris Badwan, whose transformation as a singer is possibly the most striking change to have taken place in the Horrors’ sound. A man whose vocal technique once involved hurling himself in the general direction of the tune and keeping his fingers crossed, here he sounds not just in key, but commanding. There’s a world-weary, experience-bitterly-won quality to his voice that deepens the songs, subtly shifting their temperature. World Below might have the most sparkling pop melody here: while an avalanche of ecstatic guitar noise pulls it in one direction emotionally, Badwan’s voice takes it in another, adding an affecting wistfulness. Amid the gauzy textures of Weighed Down, meanwhile, his refrain of “Don’t let love bring you down” hits a perfect emotional sweet spot, the kind of melancholy euphoria that induces stadium crowds to get their lighters out or switch on their smartphone flashlights. The latter point highlights the strangest thing about V. The Horrors’ last two albums briefly reached the Top 10, but they remained resolutely a cult concern. V, on the other hand, sounds, potentially at least, like a huge mainstream hit. It performs the not inconsiderable feat of sounding commercial without losing any of the Horrors’ essence or individuality. You might reasonably counter that the kind of British alt-rock that currently sells sticks close to a landfill indie blueprint, with none of the invention and imagination on display here. Equally, there’s something really powerful and undeniable about V’s songs that suggests it could provide the most unlikely twist in an unlikely story: the Horrors actually becoming as big as the overheated hype announced they would a decade ago. Whether that happens or not, it’s a triumph."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/21/isabelle-faust-mendelssohn-review-freiburger-barockorchester-heras-casado","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T15:01:21Z","webTitle":"Isabelle Faust: Mendelssohn CD review – raw-edged and compelling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/21/isabelle-faust-mendelssohn-review-freiburger-barockorchester-heras-casado","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/21/isabelle-faust-mendelssohn-review-freiburger-barockorchester-heras-casado","fields":{"headline":"Isabelle Faust: Mendelssohn CD review – raw-edged and compelling","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Isabelle Faust gives the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto a good shakedown with the help of the Freiburger Barockorchester and conductor Pablo Heras-Casado.

Her playing and that of the orchestra is long of line but short on vibrato, and the pursuit of an authentic Mendelssohnian style leads Faust to some choices that will have modern listeners doing an aural double take – notably some very swoopy slides: there are passages in the slow movement that sound as if played with just one finger. And yet the whole thing hangs together – it’s raw-edged, urgent and not always beautiful, but always compelling. Alongside this, Heras-Casado conducts a refreshingly transparent account of the Hebrides Overture in which you can almost feel the sea spray, and an exhilarating, ultimately jubilant performance of the Reformation Symphony, all high-church veneer stripped away."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"inequality/2017/sep/25/hipp-to-relaunch-croatian-baby-food-item-amid-row-over-inferior-products","type":"article","sectionId":"inequality","sectionName":"Inequality","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T08:00:08Z","webTitle":"HiPP to relaunch Croatian baby food item amid row over inferior products","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/sep/25/hipp-to-relaunch-croatian-baby-food-item-amid-row-over-inferior-products","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/inequality/2017/sep/25/hipp-to-relaunch-croatian-baby-food-item-amid-row-over-inferior-products","fields":{"headline":"HiPP to relaunch Croatian baby food item amid row over inferior products","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A leading baby food brand is to relaunch one of its products after jars sold in eastern Europe were found to contain a lower proportion of vegetables and an omega-3 source compared with the identically branded product sold in the west. The new study, supervised by the Croatian Food Agency, reports finding a “significant difference” in the composition between the jar of HiPP baby food on sale in Croatia and in Germany. About 38% of HiPP’s “bio-rice with carrot and turkey” product sold in Germany was made up of carrot and potato, with a further 15% rice. In the Croatian market, the study found the only vegetable present was carrot (24%), while rice accounted for 21% of the baby food. There was also a reported difference in colour, taste and aroma – and a differing amount of rapeseed oil (1.9% against 1.7%), a source of omega-3 fatty acids that are beneficial to a child’s growth. The test comes amid accusations by the European commission that multinational companies have “cheated and misled” shoppers in eastern Europe for years by selling them inferior products that bear the same branding as those found in the west. A spokesperson for HiPP baby food said the ingredients of the product were clearly marked on the jars, but added: “Due to the current public discussion about different recipes in European countries, we learned that this proceeding could lead to misinterpretations which we regret very much. In consequence, we assessed the recipe of HiPP Rice with Carrots and Turkey in terms of potential equalisations, and will relaunch it with an adapted recipe which is equal to the German one during the next few months.” The spokesperson explained the company had in recent years adapted its recipe in Germany “to meet local preferences”, but had not followed suit in Croatia. “Due to changes in the Germans’ consumer demands regarding its consistency, the article was adapted several years ago in Germany,” she said. “In Croatia, the original recipe was very popular because of its particularly simple composition, which is why it was not changed at that time.” The baby food test was part a wider report which follows similar surveys in Bulgaria, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia. The Croatian study, to be presented to the European parliament’s committee on internal market and consumer protection on Thursday, found that a series of brands were selling products of differing ingredients – and allegedly different quality – in the east and west, including Nutella and Ariel detergent. The Nutella in Croatia contained whey powder and a lower percentage of skimmed milk powder (6.6%), while the product from Germany contained only skimmed milk powder (7.5%). There was a significant difference in colour and in the spreadability of the product, “confirmed by physical and chemical analyses”, with the Croatian product being more difficult to spread at the same temperature. The study also found that an Ariel detergent on the German market was significantly more efficient in washing at low temperatures (40C) than a similar Croatian product. The difference was also present at 60C, although less pronounced. Biljana Borzan, the Croation MEP who instigated and funded the survey, said she had been particularly disappointed by the difference in the baby food product, which she claimed amounted to a breach of faith with the consumer. “This is a really sad example,” Borzan said. “We also found in Coca-Cola that the ingredients are cheaper in Croatia but the price is the same. But you can choose not to drink Coke. With baby food, parents trust in that brand. I was really disappointed.” Last week, without naming the companies, the European commission’s most senior official responsible for justice and consumer rights, Věra Jourová, told the Guardian she believed there had been “manifest cheating” of consumers for years by multinationals. The European commission will this week publish an interpretation of the current law on misleading customers to help national authorities prosecute those in breach. Many companies have responded by saying that where differences had been found in similarly branded products, they had been responding to local demand rather than deliberately misleading consumers. But Borzan was critical of HiPP’s suggestion that its recipe in Croatia was not changed because “the original recipe was very popular”. “Their explanation is ridiculous,” she said. “They said the product is made on the preference of local consumers. I tried to imagine what that survey looked like: did the babies spit it out? Is that how they knew? And I am not sure any baby tested the food and said they wanted less omega-3.” According to Borzan: “People see this issue in a very emotional way. When I walk my dog, people stop me in the street and say, ‘Please just don’t give up.’ It is not important that a product has more cocoa or what food looks like; it is simply that people don’t like to feel they are second grade. This is very important in a European Union that is very proud of equality.” A spokesperson for Ferrero, the manufacturer of Nutella, said: “We can reassure everyone that the Nutella sold in Croatia has the same high-quality standards as Nutella sold around the world. As a global company, we have many factories in different countries around the world, but we always guarantee the same care and quality everywhere.” Procter &amp; Gamble, the makers of Ariel, said its products were different to suit local preferences, but it disputed the Croatian findings. A statement said: “We disagree with the testing approach and reporting of the Ariel products published by the Croatian Food Agency on 1 September 2017. Specifically, the two Ariel powder products tested were designed against different needs, leading to very different formulations. “Putting different products in a comparative test violates the minimum standard of professional testing, which compares the same product from the same producer … Our commitment to consumers remains to provide them with products that meet and exceed their expectations in every country where we are present.” HiPP’s spokesperson added: “From our point of view, the German and Croatian recipes can be seen as equal in their composition. To achieve a sufficient amount of carbohydrates, the German one contains rice and potatoes (8%) [while] the Croatian one has a higher amount of rice instead of this. Since the characteristic product properties of the two products are not different, the product image and product name are similar.” Follow the Guardian’s Inequality Project on Twitter here, or email us at inequality.project@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/26/knife-crime-community-centres-beyond-the-blade","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T15:42:40Z","webTitle":"Knife crime is rising – and we're closing down the very places that could stop it | Ciaran Thapar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/26/knife-crime-community-centres-beyond-the-blade","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/26/knife-crime-community-centres-beyond-the-blade","fields":{"headline":"Knife crime is rising – and we're closing down the very places that could stop it","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As autumn draws in, we have started to look back wistfully at the joys of summer. Yet in some poorer pockets of Britain, those longer daylight hours, higher temperatures, shorter tempers and freedom from the classroom also made life more challenging for parents and youth workers. In August, four teenage boys were stabbed to death in the UK. Three of them were killed in London. For the past two years, I have volunteered at the Marcus Lipton community centre in Brixton, south London, which serves young people who live in a hotspot of poverty, neglect and family instability. Violence among teenagers is a common feature of local life, and postcode-defined gang wars between groups of disenfranchised male teenagers living in rival housing estates have cemented over decades. The psychological commitment to carrying a knife has been normalised, perceived as the most accessible means of survival. “For boys like these, picking up a knife before leaving the house is like putting on shoes,” Ira Campbell, managing director of Marcus Lipton, told me recently. “We have to come to terms with that if we are going to stop it.” So far this year, 26 children and teenagers have been fatally stabbed, a number charted by The Guardian’s ongoing Beyond The Blade project, which aims to better understand the extent of the problem and possible solutions. Countless other young people will have, or will know someone who has, been injured at the hands of a knife this year. While it is true that the epidemic of knife crime has been a cyclical concern for years, it is again on the rise, particularly in London. The London mayor Sadiq Khan’s new preventive strategy is a response to that; the MP for Croydon Central, Sarah Jones, is launching a new all-party parliamentary group on knife crime. I can’t speak for those working with young people outside London, although cuts to youth services appear to be hitting provision across Britain. But my experience working at Marcus Lipton has convinced me that community centres are also central to finding a solution. They should be seen as an opportunity to better understand young men and discourage them from picking up knives. An increase in the number of stop-and-searches might work for getting these weapons off the streets – as the Metropolitan police commissioner Cressida Dick has repeatedly proposed. But even aside from its problematic use, this strategy will not solve the deep-seated paranoia experienced daily by many of the young people I have worked with. This is not to suggest that those who carry knives should not be under surveillance or punished. But a greater emphasis should be placed on addressing the root causes of youth violence and its connection to the impoverished social context in which it tends to occur, rather than simplistically hammering the behaviour. “Why would a wealthy kid need to come here? They’re comfortable at home,” Ira Campbell noted, when I asked him why people went to community centres. “Kids that come to places like this, it’s their escape from everything else they’ve got going on in their household, in their school. It’s a place where they can be free for a bit.” All young people require safe spaces in their local area in the evenings, at weekends and during school holidays. Last year, I was among those who ran a weekly discussion group called “Hero’s Journey” for teenage boys at Marcus Lipton. Every Friday night we would sit around a coffee table and debate topics such as school, money and police. Our group became a consistent opportunity to expose the boys to new conversations and experiences, and a relaxed source of education outside school, in a space they felt comfortable. Community centres could deliver programmes that keep young men off the streets, encouraging them to think critically about their lives and the potential consequences of their actions. But this is difficult when public centres are in decline. According to research published this year, at least £22m has been cut from youth service budgets across London since 2011. More than 30 youth centres have closed, at least 12,700 places for young people have been lost, and council youth service employment has been reduced on average by 39%. There is no cruder example of how the government’s austerity project is placing a stranglehold on the lives of the most vulnerable. I have seen the extent to which Marcus Lipton struggles to sustain itself financially. At the worst of times, Campbell – a man with 30 years of community-work experience – finds it difficult to pay his staff properly. This is a direct result of the centre’s constantly tightening budget, and it renders the delivery of any comprehensive, well-staffed weekly programme impossible. Typically, every few months the centre is forced to write bids to compete for funding, rather than being encouraged and funded more sustainably. Ruthless market competition, rather than stable state provision, is tending to dictate how money is spent. This is neither fair nor effective. It means providing young people in inner cities with safe and purposeful space is becoming increasingly difficult. Boys and girls in the most neglected communities could be benefiting from critical thinking or conflict resolution or mentoring interventions, to name a few examples. Instead, they are pushed to spend idle time hanging out on their estate, or in heavily policed streets, where confrontation is a near inevitability. Youth violence is a complex issue and there is no quick fix. But the government could make bigger strides in preventing its prevalence and the possession of knives. More state-funded investment into the community centre model would allow us to understand and support young people on their own terms.

A little more drama in round four wouldn’t go amiss; perhaps Bristol City, Crystal Palace, Bournemouth and Middlesbrough can provide it. Failing that, those three big Premier League clashes look pretty tasty too. See you here for those! Nighty night! Bournemouth v Middlesbrough. And that completes the fourth-round draw, ties to be played the week commencing October 23. Leicester City v Leeds United. Manchester City v Wolverhampton Wanderers. Chelsea v Everton. Arsenal v Norwich City. Swansea City v Manchester United. Bristol City v Crystal Palace. Here we go, then! Charlie Nicholas and Phil Thompson will make the draw for the fourth round. And the first tie is: Tottenham Hotspur v West Ham United. Stay awhile, please, will you? Because the draw for the fourth round is coming up soon! But while we wait, here’s the results from a night of action high on goals, low on drama, that late flurry at the Hawthorns apart: Arsenal 1-0 Doncaster Rovers Chelsea 5-1 Nottingham Forest Everton 3-0 Sunderland Manchester United 4-1 Burton Albion West Bromwich Albion 1-2 Manchester City And so Leroy Sane is City’s two-goal hero. The 1970, 1976, 2014 and 2016 winners are in the hat for the fourth round, at the expense of the 1966 champs! What a chance for West Brom to equalise! McClean shoots from 25 yards out, down the inside-left channel. His effort is deflected, but drops to Robson-Kanu on the penalty spot! He’s just got to slot the ball past Bravo, but instead he crashes an effort off the outside of the left-hand post, and City survive! In the last minute of injury time! No clean sheet, then, but the holders are comfortably through to the fourth round. A consolation for Burton, and United finally concede this season at Old Trafford! Sub keeper Joel Pereira fumbles under a little pressure on his line, and Dyer smashes the loose ball home from a tight angle on the left! A free kick for City just outside the Baggies box. A poor decision to faff about, though, and Robson-Kanu is given half a chance to attack on the break. The move breaks down for West Brom, but they’ll have five additional minutes in which to save themselves. Just three minutes left on the clock at the Hawthorns, where the game is still in the balance. McClean threatens to break on goal but he’s disabused of that notion. Is there a surprise in this evening yet? The Gunners are through, but that was something of a misfire. Still, in the hat is in the hat. Arsenal haven’t won this trophy since 1993. Could this be their year? West Brom haven’t given this up by any means. Rondon flashes a header inches wide right of goal from six yards. Then Morrison threatens to break through, but can’t get anything meaningful away. A one-sided nonsense has suddenly exploded into life! The 1977 and 1984 finalists see off the 1985 and 2014 runners-up. Morrison is denied by a wonder save from Bravo. A second chance for West Brom to go ahead spurned. And then City fly up the other end, Sane sashaying down the right, gliding inside, dropping a shoulder, and floating a glorious effort into the top left! And that’s Chelsea into the fourth round. With the very last move of the match, Forest embark on some triangulation down the right wing. Finally the ball drops to Darikwa six yards out, and he sidefoots confidently into the bottom right for a consolation. At the Emirates, Mandeville dribbles in from the left and nearly Ricky Villas a goal out of nothing! Doncaster so nearly level against Arsenal! Meanwhile at the Hawthorns, the ball is slipped to the feet of Robson-Kanu, six yards out! He must score, but shanks an effort wide left of the target. Suddenly it’s Manchester City on the ropes! City are made to pay for their profligacy! A corner for the Baggies out on the right. The ball’s hooked into the mixer, where Jacob is on hand to sidefoot home from six yards! Where was the City defence? Not anywhere near Yacob. And we have drama! A match in the balance! TV set for Michy Batshuayi, please! Kenedy hammers a shot onto the Forest cross bar from a tight position on the left. His spectacular effort drops to Batshuayi, who taps home for his hat-trick! West Brom have been on the ropes all evening, but there’s only one goal in it at the Hawthorns. And suddenly Robson-Kanu flicks a ball down the inside-left channel to release Morrison into the City box! He threads a shot across Bravo and inches wide of the right-hand post. Then Sane romps up the other end, down the right. He’s clear, and should shoot, but squares it and the chance is gone. A delicate diagonal Davies pass looped forward to Niasse on the left-hand edge of the Sunderland box. Niasse chests down and extends a leg, lashing a fine finish into the top right. A one-two with Rashford sends Martial away, down the inside-right channel. Martial slots confidently, and powerfully, into the bottom right. Manchester United’s last two games have finished 3-0 and 4-0; there’s half an hour left for a pretty pattern to develop. Lookman very nearly makes it three for Everton against Sunderland. A couple of quick-fire snapshots towards the right-hand corner from close range. But he’s denied both times. “Ah, Nigel Jemson,” writes Andy Coupe. “A scorer of a hat-trick in this competition. The sponsors gave him a TV.” As mentioned earlier: Rumbelows, a class act. There’s not a lot going on. A lull. Despite the goals, this evening’s been one long lull. Drama, please! Doncaster are threatening to give Arsenal a game at the Emirates. May very nearly tore clear of the Arsenal back line, but Maitland-Niles zipped back to deal with the danger. Meanwhile Luke Shaw is on for Manchester United, for the first time this season, and he’s quickly into the action against Burton, seeing a goal chalked off for offside. The matches at Old Trafford and the Hawthorns have restarted, so we’re back up and running everywhere again. And Burton very nearly claw a goal back against Manchester United, a deep Palmer free kick from the right finding the head of Akpan, six yards out. He must work Romero at the very least, but the effort flies off target. Hazard’s first touch to set up that goal was lovely, though not quite in the Roberto Baggio class. But then what is? In case you missed it today ... Hazard brings a long ball down, dead, on the edge of the area. He drifts a little to the right, drawing half the Forest team with him. So he rolls it back towards the penalty spot, where Batshuayi hammers low. The League Cup glory days of Nigel Jemson seem a long time ago right now. Well, they are a long time ago, but you get the general point. ... and at the Emirates, it should be a brace for Walcott. But set free down the middle, he topples backwards and lifts a dreadful effort miles over the bar with only the keeper to beat. Doncaster aren’t out of this quite yet. Sandro turns on the pace down the left and slides a ball forward for Calvert-Lewin, who sends a fine rising smash into the roof of the net! Two for Calvert-Lewin ... A fast start to the second half by Chelsea, who don’t really need it, three up as they are against Forest. Hazard cuts in from the left and batters a powerful effort onto the right-hand post. And it’s half-time in the 8pm kick offs. Good news for both Manchester clubs, as they head to the changing rooms in control. United are 3-0 up at home against Burton; City a goal to the good at West Brom. Burton, to their immense credit, keep on keepin’ on. Palmer, out on the left, loops a fine cross to the far post, where Lund brings the ball down but leans back and sends his effort from the right-hand corner of the six-yard box, way off target. A real chance. Up the other end, Lingard races into the box from the right and is lightly clipped by Turner. It should be a penalty kick, but the referee shows Burton some sympathy. You’d probably hear more about that were it goalless, or were United playing City. But this is where we are. A testimonial feel at Old Trafford. And then suddenly it’s party time again, as Martial dribbles with extreme prejudice down the left, throws in a couple of pretty tricks, then finds Lingard on the edge of the box. He aims for the bottom right, but the ball takes a huge deflection off Turner and into the bottom left. Ripley in goal had no chance. The half-times in the 7.45pm kick-offs: Arsenal 1-0 Doncaster; Chelsea 3-0 Forest; Everton 1-0 Sunderland. A good chance for Doncaster towards the end of the first 45, incidentally, May lashing a shot into the side netting from a tight angle on the right. Burton have spurned a superb chance to get back into the match at Old Trafford. Mason was found free in the centre, on the penalty spot with the ball at his feet. He tried to lift it over the out-rushing Romero, but didn’t get any purchase on the ball and the keeper was able to smother with ease. Gabriel Jesus has just scooped a shot over the bar at the Hawthorns from eight yards. What a miss by the brilliant Brazilian! West Brom could easily be three down already. No shame in that against this ludicrously entertaining Manchester City side. This Pep-v-Jose thing is shaping up to be quite a story, isn’t it. Here’s hoping both teams can keep it up all season. It’s not going to come at Stamford Bridge. The young Belgian Charly Musonda romps into a bit of space down the inside-right and lashes an unstoppable shot into the net. Everton have been on top at Goodison from the get-go. Now Calvert-Lewin takes advantage of a game of penalty-area pinball, the ball finally falling at his feet. He scoops it into the net from the spot. We’ve now got a full house of matches going the way everyone expected. Anyone fancy drumming up a little drama? Manchester City continue to dominate at West Brom. Mangala has just had a header clawed off the line. “Penny for Oxlade-Chamberlain’s thoughts?” parrots Colin Mackay. “How about 40 mil for Klopp’s thoughts?” Blind glides in from the left and feeds Rashford, who turns and larrups a stunning shot from the left of the D onto the left-hand post and in. What a shot! “No chance of one or both of them scoring, I suppose, but Burton Albion has both Flanagan and Allen in their starting line-up,” notes Steven Hughes. The Milk Cup, the 1960 US election, now memories of the music hall. The internet kids love this sort of thing. They can’t get enough of it. No need to thank us. Sanchez, deep on the left, sprays a delicious diagonal ball into the box for Walcott, who kills it stone dead with an exquisite touch and flicks it into the net. Some pass, some finish. Arsenal are beginning to find a little form, just as Liverpool have misplaced theirs. Penny for poor Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s thoughts right now. So having said that, Dowell nearly gives Forest a foothold in the game, whipping a glorious free kick towards the top right. But it’s an inch too high, and clatters into the post. Chelsea clear. At Chelsea, Forest are hanging on. Kenedy races down the left and very nearly finds Batshuayi with a dribbler of a cross, but the striker’s a toenail shy of poking home. Then Fabregas releases Zappacosta, who finds the net but he’s offside. Anything City can do, their rivals can match. Carrick quarterbacks from a deep position down the inside left. Mata, just inside the area, cushions the pass into the path of Rashford, coming in from the right. No mistake! Drama may well be at a premium tonight, the way things are going across the board. Lovely twinkling toes on the edge of the D by Hazard. He slips the ball through the middle, Batshuayi sashaying into the area and clipping home. Although goal-crazy Manchester City don’t need too much of a chance. Gundogan sees a snapshot from close range parried well by Foster; Sane is on hand to latch onto the rebound and smack home. The matches at Old Trafford and the Hawthorns have kicked off, so all five matches are now underway. Just the one goal so far. Give them a chance. Rudiger hoicks one in from the right wing. Ghosting in at the far post is Kenedy, who sidefoots with great purpose into the bottom left. The 1965, 1998, 2005, 2007 and 2015 winners take the lead against the champions of 1978, 1979, 1989 and 1990! No goals yet in the three 7.45pm kick offs at Arsenal, Chelsea and Everton. Arsenal have gone closest, Olivier Giroud trying to out-spectacular his effort against Crystal Palace last season with a scissor kick against Doncaster. He’s clattered his effort onto the bar. “Great photo of the wholesome, nutritious beverage sponsor of yesteryear,” begins Peter Oh, child of the 80s. “In America in the 90s there was a popular advertisement campaign called Got Milk?, which featured images of celebrities sporting milk moustaches. Try that with a fizzy energy drink. It’s just not the same.” And here’s Burton boss Nigel Clough, doing his bit to defend his Dad’s record. “Our mood is buoyant, we’ve been in a good run. These lads have played at Oldham and Cardiff, and have got us here, so I thought I’d stick with them. We need Man U to have an off night, they’re capable of tearing Premier League defences apart. We’ll try to hang on in there, and see if we can get a goal. We’ll try to enjoy it, we never know if we’ll ever come back here again. So we’re going to enjoy it, and have a go!” Some hot Jose Mourinho pre-match chat. “We have to win tonight, and my experience in the English cups suggests that every match is a tricky one. Every opponent has a dream and every match can be very difficult. Let’s go step by step, and try to make the draw. Players are not happy when they don’t play, so I have to rotate. We have a good team, a team that respects the opponent, and a bench that gives me options should I need to meet changes.” Should Mourinho’s team retain their trophy this year, the manager becomes the most successful boss in League Cup history. He’s currently tied at the top with Brian Clough and Sir Alex Ferguson, having lifted the three-handled trophy on four occasions. He’s not worried about individual baubles, though, right? It’s all change for Arsenal! Nobody who started the goalless draw at Chelsea is in their starting XI tonight. Jack Wilshere is back, as is Alexis Sanchez. League One Doncaster lost at home to Scunthorpe on Sunday; they make two swaps, with on-loan Chelsea midfielder Jordan Houghton and striker Alfie May coming in. Chelsea make nine changes from that aforementioned goalless draw on Sunday. Gary Cahill and Cesc Fabregas are the only constants, while Willy Caballero makes his debut in goal, and Eden Hazard starts a match for the first time this season. Nottingham Forest make eight changes, with former Chelsea prospect Michael Mancienne the centrepiece of their defence. Everton make eight changes from the side battered at Old Trafford. Michael Keane, Ashley Williams and Tom Davies are the starters still standing. Sunderland make six changes to the team that drew at Hull last weekend: Jack Rodwell and Darron Gibson come into the midfield in exchange for Lee Cattermole and Callum McManaman. Manchester United make nine changes against Burton Albion. The Championship side, not willing to be outdone, make nine changes themselves. Marcus Rashford and Juan Mata hold onto their shirts from the thrashing of Everton; Ben Turner and Jamie Allen keep theirs from Burton’s weekend win over Fulham. West Brom keep it relatively constant, making just five changes. Hal Robson-Kanu will lead their line. Manchester City make eight changes from the side that thumped Watford, and welcome back Yaya Toure and Ilkay Gundogan.

Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson’s terrifically bold adaptation of TE Lawrence’s Seven Pillars of Wisdom is a movie with all the sweep and antique confidence of a cavalry charge. Lean demonstrated a mastery of storytelling structure, scale, perspective-shifting, the intense closeup moment, the colossal widescreen panorama – epitomised by the film’s most famous coup de cinéma: having accepted his commission to go out to the Middle East with the Arab bureau in the first world war, and allowed audiences to savour his marvellous profile, Peter O’Toole’s Lawrence blows out a match and the scene changes to the burning desert at sunrise. The screen is ablaze. The dunes undulate in the heat, and Maurice Jarre’s score ululates along with it. It is Lawrence’s destiny to unite warring Arab tribes to fight the Turks and the Ottoman empire in the British interest. But Lawrence’s own loyalties become divided, and he falls in love with the Arab nations and all their fondly (or condescendingly) imagined ascetic martial heroism, perhaps the way Byron did with Greeks during the war of independence a century before. Lawrence’s Seven Pillars became a key text of orientalism, and the movie intuits its romantic grandeur, while amplifying its absurdity and conceit. As for O’Toole, he made one of the most outrageously charismatic debuts in film history with his performance: a Valentino for the 1960s, one of the working-class young lions like Caine and Finney. He is physically beautiful, with mesmeric eyes of china blue. His long, handsome face was that of a seducer, a visionary, an anchorite, a sinner or a saint, and is entirely comfortable with the ambiguities of his sexual nature, about which the movie is reasonably frank. It is an oddity that there are no women characters: Lawrence’s love affair is with the desert, with the pan-Arab nations and, well, with Arabs themselves. Omar Sharif is superb as his ally Sherif Ali – he made almost as much of a career-defining splash as O’Toole – although it is uncomfortable now to see Alec Guinness cast in blackface as the wily Prince Feisal. An exhilarating, immersive experience."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/20/campers-in-israel-warned-after-series-of-wolf-attacks","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T11:29:27Z","webTitle":"Campers in Israel warned after series of wolf attacks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/20/campers-in-israel-warned-after-series-of-wolf-attacks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/20/campers-in-israel-warned-after-series-of-wolf-attacks","fields":{"headline":"Campers in Israel warned after series of wolf attacks","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Israeli authorities are warning families with young children to take extra care after a series of wolf attacks on campers in the Judean desert. Ten incidents involving wolf bites were reported over the summer around the historic site of Masada and the popular spring at Ein Gedi. A number of the incidents involved young children, leading to fears that an Arabian wolf or wolves may be exhibiting predatory behaviour. The incidents at campsites and attractions began in May, when a wolf entered the tent of a family holidaying near Masada. It later returned to bite one of the family’s young children a few steps from her tent. The attacks continued over the summer with the two most recent incidents occurring last weekend, when three children were bitten in two separate attacks near Ein Gedi. Local rangers have been accused of not doing enough to find and trap the animal, or animals, involved – a charge denied by the Israel Nature and Parks Authority. Shilhav Ben-David, whose daughter was bitten in the first reported incident, said the wolf had entered the family’s tent before being chased off, only to return and attack her child a few hours later. She told Haaretz she only became aware the wolf had returned when she saw it on top of her child. “I saw him move his nose over her,” she said. “I ran and grabbed her and saw blood and holes from fangs in her lower back. It wasn’t that he tried to attack her, he really tried to grab her and take her away.” Haim Berger, who did his doctoral research on wolf behaviour and guides visitors to see wild animals in the desert, told the Guardian his own family had also encountered a wolf at a campsite near Masada without being aware there had been attacks. “I had no idea there had been a problem because it had not been publicised,” Berger said. “In the middle of the night one of my girls woke me and said there is a wolf here. I didn’t know about recent attacks even though the park ranger had come round the the day before. Now they are warning people.” Before this summer, the last wolf attack reported occurred in 2008, Berger said. He believes that the animals have become increasingly habituated to humans attracted by litter bins and other food around the campsites. Unlike in countries such as the United States and Canada, there is little awareness among campers in Israel of how to holiday safely around wild animals. “I’ve been warning about the risk of this for almost 15 years – the risk of wolves getting gradually more used to humans and trying to convince people that we need to keep a greater distance,” said Berger. Berger said no recent research had been conducted into the wolves in the Judean desert. But he believes the spate of attacks probably involves a single individual or individuals from a pack of about 20 wolves, which would usually hunt over a far wider area. The number of younger children involved in the attacks has led Berger to believe the wolves were exhibiting predatory behaviour. “We need to educate people in behaviour that avoids attracting animals to campsites and also work to discourage wolves from coming near people,” he said. “It is a change in behaviour that happened because of people,” said Gilad Gabay, southern region director of the Israel nature and parks authority, discussing the attacks. “People need to understand that they are in the heart of nature and that every [time a wolf feeds on litter] that has significance. We won’t rest until we stop this, but we need the cooperation of the public.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/20/nigel-farage-ridiculed-for-video-of-him-delivering-a-letter-to-the-bbc","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T12:34:48Z","webTitle":"Nigel Farage ridiculed over video of him delivering letter to BBC","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/20/nigel-farage-ridiculed-for-video-of-him-delivering-a-letter-to-the-bbc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/20/nigel-farage-ridiculed-for-video-of-him-delivering-a-letter-to-the-bbc","fields":{"headline":"Nigel Farage ridiculed over video of him delivering letter to BBC","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Nigel Farage has been roundly derided on social media for posting a video of himself marching up to the doors of the BBC’s Broadcasting House in London brandishing a letter of complaint. Internet users were quick to see the funny side of the video. And posing holding a piece of paper always goes badly for politicians when social media users are armed with Photoshop. People repeated Farage’s phrase “Delivering my letter of complaint to the director-general of the BBC” on Tuesday, accompanying it with a range of different videos. Farage’s complaint to the BBC dates back to reporting in the aftermath of the death of Polish man Arkadiusz Jozwik in Harlow in 2016, which sparked fears of a wave of Brexit hate crime. In an interview with BBC reporter John Sweeney at the time, one local resident claimed that Farage had “blood on his hands”. The former Ukip leader has described this as a ‘slur’ that has caused his family misery. Speaking on his LBC radio show, Farage said: “I want an apology and if I don’t get one then I think I’ll be compelled next year to feel why should I pay the licence fee.” In response to Farage’s claim, a BBC Spokesperson said: “The BBC’s reporting reflected, like other media, that racial motivation was a line of inquiry the police were looking at and our coverage also featured vox-pops giving differing views including anti-social behaviour as a possibility.” Farage famously described the leave victory in the EU referendum as being achieved “without a single bullet being fired”, despite the murder of MP Jo Cox by far-right terrorist Thomas Mair taking place only days earlier."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/20/football-manager-excuses-supercoaches-blustergaffers-premier-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T11:37:39Z","webTitle":"‘Football manager excuses’ are for the supercoaches and the blustergaffers | Paul Wilson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/20/football-manager-excuses-supercoaches-blustergaffers-premier-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/20/football-manager-excuses-supercoaches-blustergaffers-premier-league","fields":{"headline":"‘Football manager excuses’ are for the supercoaches and the blustergaffers","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It is always appreciated when sport manages to offer colourful additions to the national lexicon – “squeaky bum time”, “I never said them things”, “do I not like that” etc – so it was pleasing to note that in criticising Ryanair’s handling of its self-made fiasco over flight cancellations this week the RBC investment bank accused the company of coming up with “football manager excuses”. Blaming everyone but themselves, in other words. It is an expression that deserves to stick, because just about every manager has been guilty of it at some point and there have been several noteworthy examples even this early in the present season. The otherwise admirable Marco Silva was aggrieved about a couple of marginal offsides at the weekend when neither would have made a scrap of difference to the outcome of Watford’s match against Manchester City, while Ronald Koeman ludicrously tried to blame José Mourinho for increasing the pressure on Everton after watching his side ship 12 goals without reply in their last four games. For the record, Arsène Wenger was not whingeing when he pondered whether the colour of Alexander Lacazette’s boots might have alerted the referee’s assistant to the fact that his toe was in an offside position before his disallowed goal at Stoke, he was merely passing on the views of a supporter who had pointed out the possibility. Of course football managers are caught between a rock and a hard place when results go against them. They are contractually obliged to speak to the cameras and press and perfectly aware that ill-chosen words – such as criticism of their own players or the club’s transfer business – would most likely make the situation worse. The safest option, saying nothing, is not generally available, so they can hardly be blamed for latching on to whatever positives they can grasp or pointing out a few bits of bad luck that might have turned a defeat into a thrashing. Yet this is precisely the deal managers accept when they take the jobs and for the most part they are paid very well for it. Even if the arrangement only lasts a few months it can be enormously rewarding. Harry Redknapp received a £250,000 bonus for keeping Birmingham up at the end of last season, and £1.75m in compensation eight games later after supervising just a single victory. Redknapp is 70, and is now letting it be known that the Birmingham gig may be his last in a managerial capacity. Perhaps he might have shared that information with his employers over summer, although really the club should have worked it out for themselves. No one actually imagines Redknapp will be offered another top‑line opportunity after the way his latest short-term pension booster worked out, though equally no one expects the manager to turn a position down should anyone be desperate enough to ask a few months on from now. Yet just because some managers have turned themselves into caricatures does not mean they are all figures of fun, and while everyone knows what is meant by “football manager excuses” it would be a mistake to view everyone in the profession as hapless hostages to fortune. Somewhere between the supercoaches at the major clubs and the blustergaffers operating several levels below is a collection of individuals offering fresh ideas, sound principles and solid application. Arguably the most admirable characters in modern football are the managers who embrace the basic unfairness of the sport, the sloping playing field caused by the huge financial disparities, and stoically set about obtaining results and points against theoretically superior sides. Don’t worry, this is not a plea for the return of Sam Allardyce, though he does tick most of the boxes for courage and competence and tends not to blame others for his shortcomings. The former Bolton Wanderers and briefly England manager, probably the best firefighter in the business, is far from the only underdog to have overachieved in the past 25 years of the Premier League. Others would certainly include Tony Pulis, Dave Bassett, Neil Warnock and Paul Jewell, with the baton being carried at the moment by the likes of Sean Dyche, Eddie Howe and David Wagner. Bassett said in the very early years of the Premier League that he had no respect for Alan Hansen’s opinions on Match of the Day, because however trenchant a critic the former Liverpool player had never tried his hand at management and therefore had no appreciation of how hard it might be to send out teams to obtain results against much stronger and wealthier opponents. That may be an extreme position but the inequalities within the Premier League have only increased in the past couple of decades. Football did not begin in 1992, though the hitherto alien notion of leagues within a league and an unbreakable elite at the top of the division certainly received a kickstart with the advent of the Premier League and the reformatting of the European Cup into a de facto European super league. Add to the mix the immense wealth and unbridled spending of clubs such as Chelsea and Manchester City over the past few years and there is now a top-end situation where teams of the stature of Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United have begun to feel the squeeze. It feels surreal at times that clubs the size of Bournemouth, Burnley and Huddersfield have to fight for enough points to survive among these behemoths, but Messrs Howe, Dyche and Wagner generally do so with a smile on their faces and so far this season Burnley and Huddersfield at least are giving a good account of themselves. So while “football manager excuses” might be a welcome addition to the language, it should be noted that relatively few team bosses are the sort of muppets who actually believe that referees, weather conditions or freak occurrences of some other kind are conspiring against their sides. Nor is it even true that underdog managers always have to be dour, defensive types, out to gain a point through stifling opponents and spoiling the game. Burnley and Huddersfield have been playing bright, attacking football, Pulis at Crystal Palace was nothing like Pulis at Stoke, and some of the performances Wigan produced under Roberto Martínez were excellent. “You don’t want to harp on, but the playing field is completely not level; that’s the madness of it,” Dyche said after taking a point from Anfield at the weekend. Despite having to defend for most of the game, Burnley nevertheless managed to score first. “Liverpool made seven changes today, for guys they have brought here for absolute fortunes,” the Burnley manager pointed out. “They’re bringing players off the bench at £30m a time. We can’t do that, but I actually believe in my players no matter how much they cost. Our job was to find a way of getting a point, and that’s what we did.” There you are, no excuses, just a realistic appraisal of what might be termed difficult trading conditions. Dyche has already been suggested as a possible future England manager, so if Ryanair wants a straight-talking problem-solver to sort out their current operational and communications woes, they could do a lot worse than putting FME behind them and making a bid for an FEM."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"news/2017/sep/21/why-we-need-the-welfare-state-more-than-ever","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T04:58:44Z","webTitle":"Why we need the welfare state more than ever","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/sep/21/why-we-need-the-welfare-state-more-than-ever","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/sep/21/why-we-need-the-welfare-state-more-than-ever","fields":{"headline":"Why we need the welfare state more than ever","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Tucked away behind York Minster – the grand cathedral adorned with medieval stained-glass windows that dominates the North Yorkshire city’s skyline – is a cobbled street that has become an informal labour exchange. Each day, just before lunch, couriers dressed in the distinctive mint green and black uniform of Deliveroo, the online food delivery company, arrive at the end of this street, park their bikes and scooters next to a bench, and talk among themselves. Clutching their smartphones, they wait for someone, somewhere in the city, to place an order with one of the nearby restaurants and cafes. When an order comes through, one of the couriers will pick it up and deliver it in exchange for a small fee. They will then return to the bench to wait. Plenty of people in early 21st-century Britain can identify with the experience of working for a company like Deliveroo. Drivers for the taxi firm Uber, for example, know only too well what it’s like for work to arrive in fits and starts via an app. But even more people are employed on zero-hour contracts in a wide variety of jobs, from stacking shelves to waiting tables to caring for the elderly. According to the Office for National Statistics, around 900,000 workers rely on a job with a zero-hour contract. These people start every week not knowing how much work they will get or how much money they will earn. Informal or casual employment of this kind helps explain why Britain’s unemployment rate has not sky-rocketed since the financial crash of 2008. By contrast, almost a century ago, during the struggles of the 1920s and the Great Depression of the 30s, unemployment regularly climbed above 10%; at the most difficult moments, it went above 20%, with the true level – including those who were out of work but not officially registered as unemployed – even higher. Unemployment was also a serious problem – and one that suffered from the same difficulties of measurement – during the 1980s, when it climbed steadily to more than 12% during the early Thatcher years and, despite a steady decline, ended the decade at almost 7%. Despite the past decade seeing one of the slowest economic recoveries in history, unemployment has not got out of hand for long periods. After peaking at 8.5% in 2011, the rate has recently dropped below 4.5%. The Conservative-led governments of the past seven years argued that declining unemployment rates are a sign that austerity is working. In the wake of the financial crash, in which banks collapsed and ATMs were hours away from refusing to dispense cash, David Cameron, George Osborne and their colleagues argued that there were too many skivers, sleeping off a life on benefits, while everyone else – the strivers, as they were labelled – trudged to work to support them. Cutting benefits would solve all manner of problems: it would get the skivers back to work, bring public spending down, and be good for the general health of the economy. Like the unemployment statistics, these claims are deceptive. Millions of people are “just about managing”, to use a phrase the prime minister, Theresa May, was once fond of, and many are faring much worse. In the 12 months before March 2017, the Trussell Trust, Britain’s largest food bank charity, gave out more than 1m three-day emergency food parcels to people in desperate need. At the same time, as the Guardian has reported this week, debt has ballooned in the UK, returning to pre-financial crash levels, with household debt at 150% of income in 2015. This debt has been fuelled by low-to-no wage growth, inflated house prices and, thanks to historically low interest rates, credit made available for items such as cars. But the main issue for the estimated 8.3 million people living with unmanageable debt is needing to borrow money to survive. According to some commentators, much of this economic insecurity – a major contributor to the discontent that made Vote Leave’s slogan “take back control” so powerful in the EU referendum last year – is rooted in a profound set of changes taking place across western economies. Traditional ways of working and archaic vested interests are being challenged by new and powerful forces. The gig economy epitomised by the likes of Deliveroo and Uber, for example, is often talked about as “disruption”, with digital technology a new and irresistible means of transforming business practices and satisfying their customers. Tremendous entrepreneurial individualism and flexibility is being unleashed, the world just needs to catch up. The difficulty with these arguments is that we’ve been here before. The sight of workers standing in large groups waiting for work would have been familiar to the residents of British cities such as York more than a century ago. Those workers were painfully aware that irregular and low-paid employment offered few guarantees. While they might be able to obtain enough work each day, week or month, they could be stopped in their tracks at any moment by injury or illness. For all their willingness to work, those casual labourers, like their successors now, might not be able to make ends meet – and while not troubling the unemployment figures, were at constant risk of falling into debt and destitution. Those earlier generations’ answer to their problems, however, was the welfare state – the very thing that successive governments have blamed for the country’s current situation. * * * Many of the issues at the heart of the current malaise in British politics can be traced back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when what we now call the welfare state was slowly being assembled. From a legislative perspective, the welfare state was initially focused on a specific problem that had grown since the early 1800s: that many workers struggled to earn regular and reliable wages throughout the entire year. But these labour market problems were believed to be bound up with other issues: squalor, ignorance, want, idleness and disease – the “five giant evils” William Beveridge identified in his famous report, published in 1942. Schools, hospitals, council houses and benefits for those out of work were just some of the threads woven together to create the tapestry of the modern welfare state. The unravelling of that settlement has seen a resurgence of the original problem governments tried to tackle more than a century ago. The country had grown wealthy during the industrial revolution, via the financial might of the City of London, the manufacturing power of the north of England, and an enthusiastic embrace of free trade. The poor, however, had not disappeared. The poor law, established in 1601, at the end of Elizabeth I’s reign, made Britain’s guarantee of help for the destitute unique among European nations. In the 1830s, an influential group of reformers, who later would be known as “modernisers”, changed the terms on which that help was offered. Assistance should amount to less than what the lowest-paid labourers could obtain with their wages, reformers insisted. Furthermore, help should only be available to people who were prepared to live in a workhouse – a dark, dank and miserable place where they were given an ill-fitting uniform and forced to carry out menial tasks in exchange for shelter and meagre rations of the most basic food. The theory was deterrence: make the poor law frightening and only the most desperate – those truly in need – would trouble the authorities and public purse. Yet theory had a difficult relationship with reality. By the closing decades of the 19th century, hundreds of thousands of people – a total close to the population of Liverpool – were still using the poor law every year. The number was so large that many local authorities could not accommodate them in workhouses and had to continue offering cash handouts or food, as had been the case before the 1830s. Who were these people and why were they still asking for help? Shipping magnate Charles Booth organised a survey of London in 1886, which collected information about what went on behind closed doors in the capital’s slums. Booth then divided London’s population into categories based on their economic means and – somewhat questionably to modern eyes – their habits and behaviour. The result was a shock for his middle-class readers: 30% of London’s population seemed unable or only just about able to meet the basic costs of living. Booth’s research threw light on dark corners of Britain and implied that the poor were a much bigger group than even the government’s statistics on the number of poor law claimants suggested. Many people wondered if he was right. One was Seebohm Rowntree – a member of a York-based Quaker family that manufactured confectionery and prided themselves on being responsible employers. They tried to know all their workers’ names and introduced welfare schemes, including an eight-hour day. But this approach became more difficult as business boomed and their company grew during the late 19th century. When Booth’s report came out, they worried they were not close enough to their employees to know if Booth’s conclusions applied to them too. Rowntree and his assistants went out on to the streets of York in 1897 to investigate. Armed with notebooks, they criss-crossed the city, frequently passing the place where Deliveroo couriers would congregate more than a century later. They visited more than 45,000 people in the following two years, asking how much they earned, what they paid in rent, what food they bought, and all manner of other questions about their lives. Rowntree made sure to compile information on wages from local employers and to consult the latest medical research on the number of calories men, women and children needed to consume every day. He used this information to draw a “poverty line” – a calculation of the goods and services an individual needed to survive in modern society and how much money they needed to acquire them – and figured out how many people fell below it. To Rowntree’s surprise, Booth’s findings applied to York as well as London. But Rowntree did not agree with his static description of the poor. Booth’s classification included numerous sub-divisions and distinctions: those he considered criminal, morally weak and semi-savage were separated from the poor who had not displayed an obvious – and unacceptable – flaw, such as a weakness for drink. Rowntree, however, believed there was much movement between these categories. The poor seemed always to be with us, he explained, but the poor were not always the same people. * * * Rowntree identified what he called the “poverty cycle”. Many people earned enough money to support themselves, he argued. From time to time, though, their circumstances changed – they got married, had a child or a relative died. These quite ordinary events stretched resources, sometimes for just a few weeks, but often much longer. But when they were over, the pressure on household finances was lifted, meaning people rose above the poverty line. Nevertheless, there was always something around the corner, waiting to drag people back down again; most obviously old age, when all those years of being stretched to the limit and unable to save would take their final toll. Social reformers and charity workers across the country observed similar patterns of interruptions to, and pressures on, people’s earnings throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. One of the most important vantage points was Toynbee Hall, a university settlement located between Whitechapel and Spitalfields in the East End of London, where a small group of Oxford graduates lived among the poor, doing voluntary work and social research, before taking up employment – often of a much more lucrative and prestigious kind – elsewhere. Among Toynbee Hall’s residents between 1903 and 1905 was William Beveridge. Beveridge spent time in the East End working with the unemployed, observing their daily routines, assisting with schemes that aimed to get them back into work, and following caseworkers from charities. In the process, Beveridge had come to a number of important conclusions. One was that unemployment was “at the root of most other social problems” because society “lays upon its members responsibilities which in the vast majority of cases can be met only from the reward of labour”. The other was that conventional wisdom about the causes of unemployment was wrong. For some commentators, unemployment was a question of character and motivation. An increasingly large part of mainstream opinion certainly accepted that a reality of modern industrial capitalism was periods when there would be no work available for some people – because trades were seasonal, or markets fluctuated. But Beveridge believed even this was a superficial understanding of the issue. The biggest contribution to unemployment outside the downward slopes of the trade cycle, Beveridge argued, was the inefficiency of industry when it came to hiring workers. He asked readers of his book Unemployment: A Problem of Industry (1909) to imagine a scene he had encountered on many occasions: 10 wharves that each employed between 50 and 100 men per day, half of whom were regular staff and half of whom were reserves. While each wharf would experience similar high and low points in trade throughout the year, they were also likely to have their own individual fluctuations within those patterns. Anyone looking at the 10 wharves as a whole would not see these smaller deviations. The problem was that those smaller deviations were all that mattered to the reserve labourers walking from wharf to wharf asking for work each morning, because they meant the difference between them and their families eating, or going hungry. If there was better communication and planning, Beveridge argued, almost all of those men would be able to find work each day. The problem was that business and industries were quite happy with the situation: they often had many more workers than vacancies, and did not need to pick up the costs of supporting those who couldn’t find work. Beveridge believed the state was the only institution with both the power to solve this problem and the interest in doing so. The political will to act on this conviction would have far-reaching implications for the millions of people who have found themselves out of work since. But we have slid backwards into a situation where precarious work paid by the hour is considered a sign of progress. * * * The Liberal party administrations that governed Britain before the first world war changed Britain for ever. They modernised the tax system, differentiating between earned and unearned incomes, and introduced graduated rates for the roughly 3% of the population who qualified to pay income tax. David Lloyd George, the Liberals’ charismatic chancellor of the exchequer, announced a “People’s Budget” in 1909 – one for “raising money to wage implacable warfare against poverty and squalidness”. The principal aim of the budget was to tackle interruptions to earnings among the working-age population. Following the example of similar schemes in Germany, national insurance involved weekly contributions from three groups: workers, their employers and the state. All wage earners aged 16 to 70 and earning less than £160 a year who paid weekly contributions of four pence a week (three in the case of women) could claim sick pay for up to 26 weeks a year, and treatment from a government-approved doctor. But another aspect of the Liberals’ plans had not been tried anywhere else before: 2.25 million men in a number of trades and industries, such as construction and shipbuilding, where work could be brought to a halt by something as unpredictable as the weather, were to be enrolled in a scheme of compulsory unemployment insurance, which offered benefits of seven shillings a week for up to 15 weeks a year in exchange for contributions of two and a half pence a week. These schemes had obvious limitations. Pensions were meagre; unemployment insurance was mainly for skilled men; health insurance excluded hospital care, and spouses and children. Almost everyone found something to be unhappy about. The British Medical Association complained about the prospect of doctors being forced to become government employees, while friendly societies, trade unions and private insurance companies thought the state was trying to force them out of business. Middle-class households resented being made to pay out to insure their domestic help. Moreover, Labour MPs complained about the contributory system. What about those who couldn’t pay in or who found themselves out of work for longer than 15 weeks? Why not follow the example of pensions and pay benefits to all out of general taxation? The Liberal government recognised that national insurance on its own would not tackle interruptions to earnings; interventions into the economy would be required, too. Beveridge was drafted in by Winston Churchill, president of the board of trade, to help roll out a system of labour exchanges – another idea borrowed from Germany. A forerunner of the modern jobcentre, labour exchanges were an important part of the government’s plans for administering national insurance, with employers offered incentives to advertise vacancies in the exchanges and the unemployed asked to visit them to demonstrate they had looked for a job. For Beveridge, this had the potential to create an “organised fluidity of labour” that eliminated the kinds of problems he had observed in east London. Labour exchanges certainly helped some people find jobs, but they were never the dynamic sites of free-flowing information and recruitment that Beveridge imagined. Pensions and national insurance proved much more successful and durable, though. After the first world war, a succession of governments extended and reformed the schemes in significant ways. The result, building on the centuries-old guarantee of help for the destitute, was an imperfect yet impressive system that offered assistance to many, though far from all, people in times of need. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, however, when the Labour prime minister Ramsay MacDonald was expelled from his own party after he pushed through a 10% cut to unemployment benefits, there was widespread concern that these schemes were unsustainable. Interruptions to earnings looked like a minor problem when many people feared the complete collapse of the global economic system. What Britain seemed to have, Beveridge later suggested, was a series of “patches” – things that could be sewn on to country’s tearing fabric, rather than solutions to its underlying problems. Perhaps capitalism – a system that treated unskilled workers without the fallback of insurance as dispensable – was the real problem. There had to be a way to manage the economy that would transform life for people in Britain and enable national insurance to offer genuine security to all. * * * The economist John Maynard Keynes was always clear about whose side he was on. “I can be influenced by what seems to me to be justice and good sense,” he explained, “but the class war will find me on the side of the educated bourgeoisie.” Although many of his contemporaries threw their lot in with Labour during the interwar years, believing they were the only realistic hope for progressive reform in an era of universal suffrage, Keynes stood firm. He was a Liberal and he intended to do everything he could to help the party – going so far as to help formulate its economic policy under Lloyd George’s leadership during the late 1920s and early 30s. Keynes was not alone. Beveridge might have kept his allegiance quiet in a bid to appear neutral, but in 1944 he won a byelection for the Liberals, and ran the party’s 1945 general election campaign. Keynes cemented his status as the most important economist of the 20th century during the mid-1930s, when he published The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money – the book that would serve as the set text for one side of the argument about how governments should respond to downturns and recessions. The world has revisited this argument regularly since the interwar years, including after the financial crash of 2008, when Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman urged governments not to forget the lessons that Keynes had once taught them. Thrashed out over five years of debate and discussion with his research students and colleagues at Cambridge, The General Theory is now widely known for a relatively small number of ideas and a simple message. Governments should resist the temptation to cut back during recessions, Keynes argued, because their root cause was a contraction in aggregate demand – the total amount of goods and services that are purchased in an economy – which collapsed when people and organisations, uncertain about the future, simultaneously chose to hold on to their money. Keynes explained how spending money had effects that rippled outwards in the economy, including the creation of employment, as the demand for goods and services increased. Governments should stop worrying about deficits and sound finance when times were bad – they could take care of them once everything was moving again. Unlike Keynes, Beveridge was not invited to help run the economy during the second world war, and was disappointed not to be fully involved. By the summer of 1941, the government had tired of his sniping from the sidelines, and gave him a job they thought would keep him out of sight and mind for some time to come: a review of national insurance. In November the following year, he delivered the result: his ground-breaking report, Social Insurance and Allied Services. The Beveridge report was not quite what people were expecting, or what people now think it is. The British people did not want a “Santa Claus state” that handed out gifts to everyone, he argued; they wanted a form of economic and social security that reflected a history of paying into the system. Benefits should cover a much wider range of risks, Beveridge explained, but they should be simple to understand: everyone – workers, employers and the state – should pay flat-rate contributions and get flat-rate benefits paid out in return. On the face of it, there was no reason for the government to be worried. Beveridge’s benefits scheme involved significant extensions and new responsibilities, but it also required people to pay hefty weekly contributions. However, Beveridge had made a number of recommendations, which he modestly called “assumptions”. The first two were an allowance for each child born (after the first) and a National Health Service, free for all people, both of which would be paid for out of general taxation. The other was that the government commit to a new way of running the economy: one in which they made sure that unemployment never went above 8.5%. Beveridge had called these recommendations assumptions because he believed a reformed system of national insurance could not work without them. Unemployment had to be kept below 8.5% so that people could build up a history of contributions and the system did not collapse under the weight of demand when they needed help. Indeed, the easiest system to administer was one in which authorities could safely assume there were jobs for the vast majority of people. Initially, the government was not as enthusiastic about committing to his recommendations as the public, who bought an astonishing 100,000 copies of Social Insurance and Allied Services during the month after it was published. The prime minister, Winston Churchill, refused to comment on the report for three months, and offered a vague endorsement when he eventually did. By the end of 1944, however, when victory over Germany looked certain, a series of white papers committed the British state not only to Beveridge’s plan, but also to a number of other new policies, such as a new secondary school system with a leaving age of 15. The roadmap for social reconstruction had been drawn. * * * The welfare state that came into being during the late 1940s underpinned a whole way of life that politicians only started to pull apart from the early 1980s onwards. The intention during the third quarter of the 20th century was to bring capitalism under control, specifically its tendency to interrupt and put downwards pressure on people’s earnings, rather than dispense with the system entirely. The Labour party, which won a historic landslide in the election of July 1945, put its mark on the whole project, in particular by nationalising whole swaths of industry. Yet, after half a century of debate and legislation, each political party had left fingerprints on the final product. These points matter for a number of reasons. One is that we often assume the welfare state was a collectivist venture. But even strident individualists found reasons to support it. Indeed, the era of social democracy helped create successive generations of individualists, including the working-class people who suddenly found themselves socially mobile during the 1950s, 60s and 70s. Looking back, and quite understandably, those generations can often give in to the temptation to imagine this progress was all down to their own hard work. Yet, as sociologists such as John Goldthorpe have shown, these generations rode the economic and social wave created by the policies adopted after 1945. Economic growth expanded the middle class by creating new management-level jobs into which working-class people could move, in both the public and private sectors, meaning there was “more room at the top”. Moreover, in an era of full employment, home ownership started to rise, not only because new houses were built, but also because it was perfectly reasonable for banks to assume that people would hold down a job for 25 continuous years and therefore pay back any money they borrowed. Could that strategy be repeated today? The answer that has been given repeatedly for the past decade – and in some cases longer – is no. We have come to see the welfare state simply as a cost to be kept down rather than part of an economic and social strategy that aims to deliver security for all and opportunities to obtain more for those who want to. The idea that these goals are no longer obtainable is clearly false. A good start would be to reconnect with the liberal idea, now more than a century old, that everyone sees returns when they pool risks, whether it’s the individuals who can stop worrying about what is around the corner, governments that might otherwise cut their headline costs but succeed only in shifting it somewhere else, or the companies that benefit from healthy and educated workers operating in a safe environment. A successful economy requires all these actors to understand that they need to give, not just take, in order to build an environment in which they and those that follow them are able to succeed. Are more radical measures required? In the long term, yes. The world has changed since the early 20th century: businesses and individuals behave differently and the “assumptions”, as Beveridge would have called them, that go with national insurance have evolved. The trend has been to pay for things by pushing the costs on to individuals, as has been done with university tuition fees. But there seems only so much mileage in this approach when debt is reaching dangerous levels, wages are stagnant and, as the economist Thomas Piketty has shown, income generated by wealth has increased rapidly for those lucky enough to have it. One appropriate response would be to breathe new life into the radical strand of liberalism that differentiated between earned and unearned incomes back at the start of the 20th century. Piketty has argued for a global tax on wealth. But there are domestic policies that would go some way to achieving similar ends. We could consider applying capital gains tax to property – recouping some of the considerable profits that those generations who benefited from the welfare state have acquired from the houses they were able to buy, in part because of it. Some commentators suggest what seem like even more radical ideas, such as universal basic income (UBI): a guaranteed regular payment for every citizen that would keep them above the poverty line, even if they chose not to work. UBI would deliver security, but faces numerous technical challenges, not least the significant differences in living costs across the country, which make a “universal” sum impossible to settle on, even before tackling the political problems of accusations that it would simply make everyone a benefit claimant. Yet versions of the idea have found support across the political spectrum, from neoliberals such as Milton Friedman to the leftwing economist and one-time Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis. For the left, a basic income would give people security and dignity. For the right, however, that basic security would be valuable because it would mean people would be free to take the kind of irregular work offered by the gig economy or zero-hours contracts. The lesson of these differences and convergences of opinion is that tackling economic insecurity need not be done at the expense of efficiency, competitiveness or innovation.

I am 84, for heaven’s sake. Which is not to say that I no longer write, simply that the concept of an ordered daily ritual is now out of reach. I look back – not with nostalgia, but with a kind of friendly interest – to those years when I would get to the desk by about half past nine and stay there till five or so, even if staring out of the window a good deal of the time. Not that my working days were always like that. There were many other commitments: organisations to which I gave time, much travelling for bookish reasons. The desk days were jealously guarded. Looking at old diaries, I see that I am always complaining that I can’t get to the book that I am writing – too many other demands. One year, I left Heathrow 12 times. Well, no more of that. One of the pleasures of old age is the thought that I shall never see Heathrow again. The writing day now is likely to be a couple of hours in the afternoon. The capacity for sustained concentration has gone. That said, ideas – a line or two, a note to myself for future reference – can pop up throughout the day, requiring quick resort to the Work in Progress file. My writing life has been like this for several years, the two hours sometimes stretching to another hour or two at some other point in the day, but are junked altogether if I simply can’t get on or more pressing matters have arisen. Rather surprisingly, I have managed a couple of books like this – a collection of short stories and, recently, a non‑fiction reflection on gardening. So, the late life shorter bursts of activity have been almost as productive as the days in the past that were dedicated to the desk, the novel-writing days. Writing a novel is like hacking at the rock face. Somewhere within the daunting but inviting mass of the general idea that you have had, the inspiration, is the careful, sculptured construction of the finished narrative. Two or three years of hacking, usually, for me. That burst of short stories was unexpected; I had not been writing stories for nearly 20 years, I thought they had left me, then they came back, not exactly flooding, but creeping up with stealth – the hint of a new one, not a rock face to hack at, but a suggestion to consider and manipulate. In fact, the desk was never a necessity. I could write anywhere; still can. In the too-busy years, I wrote in airports, in hotel rooms. Some of my most productive writing time has been spent in a Somerset garden, with people coming up to chat every now and then, which is fine – listen, respond, go on writing. I write in longhand, always have done, then type up later on, which is ideal, to my mind, because that way you make all sorts of corrections and additions in the process; it is an editorial stage. And I have no fancy preferences for style of notebook or breed of pen – anything will do. At the moment I am using a turquoise notebook with PENELOPE on the front in silver lettering that my daughter gave me for Christmas; into that is going what may – or may not – turn out to be a shortish novel. And then there is all the admin generated by a writing life. Since email, there is a blessed reduction in paper; deal with a few emails and the files on that brimming shelf are not fattened as they would have been in the ponderous pre-internet days. Admin is not, strictly speaking, part of the writing day, but it is an inevitable appendage. I am tidy by nature and I couldn’t get on with anything else if there was a stack of unanswered letters – or, today, an unchecked inbox. But it is all quicker nowadays – and more economical. In fact, I rather appreciate the old-age writing day. It is still essential to be writing something, at some point, but the pressure is off. Now that I am done with outside commitments, pretty well, all my time is my own. Back in the too-busy days, I felt guilty if a commitment-free day was not entirely devoted to writing. None of that guilt now. If I get in two or three hours at the turquoise notebook, that is great. If I decide to get out and about, or go gardening, or socialise, that is fine. Writers have to goad themselves throughout a writing life: you are your own employer; there is no one else to see that the job gets done. Equally, the late-life writer is entitled to claim some licence: no question of packing it in; you are just accepting that you can still do it, but there is no need to feel driven. Seize those fewer fruitful hours and be satisfied.

The species which exist on the Earth today are the tips of a very exclusive set of branches – the ones which happen to have representatives alive now, at the same time as human beings with the technology to divine their gene sequence. By comparing how similar their gene sequences are, we can classify living organisms according to their shared ancestry. This doesn’t help us one little bit in classifying the long dead branches with no modern survivors. Actually, that’s not completely fair, because we can combine the modern way of working out shared ancestry using molecular data with the way we did it before sequencing became commonplace: comparative morphology. If you have discovered an extinct organism, but have good evidence from fossils that its physical characteristics are sufficiently well understood for it to be placed within an established group, then all well and good. That’s basically our current best method for building a tree of life that incorporates both extinct and living organisms. But what if there was a third way? Biomolecules in the fossil record are a potentially rich source of information, if they are well enough preserved to be useful. While the consensus is that DNA degrades too readily to help us with anything more than a million years old (so of little use for most of our dead branches), a number of recent studies have shown that skin pigment molecules and even collagen may have been preserved in animal fossils for tens or even hundreds of millions of years. Similarly, long-lasting molecules in plant fossils could help to solve many of the mysteries in how extinct plant groups fit into the tree of life. Most plants have an outer waxy cuticle layer on their leaves. It’s there to prevent water loss and to protect the underlying epidermal cells. It is also incredibly resilient: fossil plant cuticle has been preserved from the earliest land plants more than 400 million years ago. This resilience means that the changes which occur in most fossils when buried and heated inside the Earth (collectively known as diagenesis) do not destroy the biochemical signatures of the original cuticle. Vivi Vajda and colleagues used this exceptional resilience of fossil leaf cuticle to address a big question in plant evolution: how do all the different seed plants known from the Mesozoic Era relate to each other? They used Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to find biomolecular signatures for modern cuticles from conifers from the monkey puzzle family, a cycad and Ginkgo. They also studied fossil cuticles from the same groups, along with leaves from other seed plant groups which are evolutionary ‘dead branches’. Bennettites are plants you may have seen illustrated in the background of a dinosaur reconstruction, looking a bit like a pineapple with flowers stuck on it. Although they have leaves similar to cycads (an ancient and threatened, but still surviving, group of seed plants) their reproductive biology is quite different. Czekanowskia is an even more obscure plant, with leaves bearing a similarity to living ginkgoes but, again, thought to belong to a group with distinctive reproductive structures which place them on their own dead branch. When the molecular signatures of modern cuticles were classified using hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) they fell into the expected arrangement established from genetic and morphology-based classifications. Cycads and Ginkgo cuticle signatures are more similar to each other than they are to Araucaria (Monkey Puzzle) conifers. Using the same clustering, signatures from the fossil cycad, ginkgoes and araucarian cuticles produced precisely the same pattern. When adding the ‘dead branch’ fossil cuticles into the analysis, Czekanowskia did indeed cluster most closely with Ginkgo cuticles. Bennettite cuticles formed their own grouping, distinct from the Ginkgo-cycad cluster. Interestingly, a leaf thought to be a conifer based on its cuticle morphology (Allocladus) ended up clustering with the Ginkgo-Czekanowskia group. And Nilssonia, a leaf which has been bounced like a tennis ball between the cycads and bennettites in other classifications, clusters with the bennettites. Despite the leaves being of different ages and undergoing different diagenetic processes, this study shows that a robust biomolecular signature can be recovered from fossil cuticles and used to help us understand how long extinct plant groups fit into the plant evolutionary tree. I expect we’ll see plenty more of this approach. I remember as a green PhD student being told a tale about a palaeobotanist who brewed their own tea from fossil leaves, for which they claimed dubious health benefits. If all these leaf biomolecules really can survive in deep time, maybe that wasn’t quite as ridiculous as I thought.* *Still fairly ridiculous though."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/21/labour-leadership-under-pressure-to-support-free-movement-after-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T23:27:05Z","webTitle":"Labour leadership under pressure to support free movement after Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/21/labour-leadership-under-pressure-to-support-free-movement-after-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/21/labour-leadership-under-pressure-to-support-free-movement-after-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Labour leadership under pressure to support free movement after Brexit","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Labour’s leadership will face renewed pressure at the party conference to support the continued free movement of people post-Brexit, after a report backed by MPs and unions warned that to do otherwise risked letting workers face exploitation. The report, put together by the remain group Another Europe is Possible, argues for what it calls “free movement-plus”, which would see the existing system augmented by better protections for workers’ rights. It has an introduction by Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA transport union, who is a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn. It is backed by Young Labour and MPs including Clive Lewis, formerly a frontbencher under Corbyn. At the Labour conference beginning on Sunday, delegates will decide whether to debate a parallel Young Labour motion committing the party to supporting continued free movement. If passed, it would be binding on the leadership. Official Labour policy is to back free movement during any Brexit transition deal, but the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, has stopped short of making any long-term commitment. The party is split on the issue, with the influence of instinctively pro-free movement frontbenchers such as Diane Abbott balanced by pressure from MPs in strongly leave areas in the Midlands and the north. But in his introduction to the report, Cortes writes that the fears of those seeking to limit new arrivals from the EU are misplaced, arguing that current net annual migration from the bloc amounts to just 0.19% of the UK population. “A failure to examine the facts surrounding free movement, and the vital contribution workers from across the EU make, has led some sections of the left to involve themselves in a debate which pitches worker against worker,” he writes. “Many of the people most concerned about immigration – those left behind by globalisation – are the first to be impacted by the absence of these workers from our public services and vital food industries.” The report, by a pair of academics, Luke Cooper and Zoe Gardner, highlights the significant economic risks of suddenly cutting down on the overseas workforce, with areas such as agriculture and the NHS likely to be especially affected. They argue that proposed alternatives to free movement would risk letting workers be exploited, particularly if people given time-limited employment visas for the UK were obliged to stay with a particular employer. Citing examples including the plight of foreign workers constructing the infrastructure for the 2022 Qatar football World Cup, and an existing UK visa scheme for non-EU overseas domestic staff, the report says such a plan would be risky. “Even though the contractual relationship between an employer and employee is still an unequal power relationship, the ability to move between different jobs is a fundamental right that makes a free labourer less exploitable than someone being forced to work against their will,” it says. The authors also point out that allowing EU nationals visa-free access to the UK for tourism, but imposing restrictions for work, would most likely bring “the unintended consequence of incentivising the rise of an undocumented economy for migrant labour”. The report’s idea of free movement-plus would involve using existing EU regulations to limit the ability of arrivals to indefinitely seek work, as well as new safeguards such as a ban on “foreign only” recruitment, and more inspections for sectors using lots of unskilled labour. Lewis, MP for Norwich South, said the motion at the conference in Brighton “provides an opportunity for the Labour movement to take a clear, principled position on immigration that makes sense and benefits everyone – after decades of retreating”. Caroline Hill, chair of Young Labour, said the group was determined to see its motion on free movement be adopted. “Like everyone else, young workers face exploitation, poverty pay and a housing crisis,” she said. “We need real solutions – a union in every workplace, massive investment and higher minimum wages – not restrictive border controls that attack the rights of ordinary working people and limit our potential.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/21/handel-goes-wild-cd-review-rial-sabadus-pluhar","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T14:30:36Z","webTitle":"Handel Goes Wild CD review – baroque collides with jazz and world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/21/handel-goes-wild-cd-review-rial-sabadus-pluhar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/21/handel-goes-wild-cd-review-rial-sabadus-pluhar","fields":{"headline":"Handel Goes Wild CD review – baroque collides with jazz and world","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I wouldn’t say wild exactly, but Handel does go a bit off-road on this polished jam session from L’Arpeggiata, in which the ensemble’s baroque players collide with a handful of jazz and world musicians, all led from the theorbo by Christina Pluhar.

A sinfonia from the opera Alcina, starts off like a jazz number, the strings revealing its “true” origins only a couple of minutes in; a louche clarinet solo over busy baroque violins and vaguely Latin percussion introduces Venti Turbini, sung with full operatic flair by countertenor Valer Sabadus.

One of the most celebrated early recordings of the three Brahms piano trios was made in the 1940s by the “million-dollar trio” of violinist Jascha Heifetz, pianist Artur Rubinstein and cellist Emanuel Feuermann (later replaced by Gregor Piatigorsky), and the latest set comes from three of today’s star instrumentalists. Yo-Yo Ma and Emanuel Ax regularly give cello-and-piano recitals together, and Leonidas Kavakos fits well into their slightly larger-than-life music making. The quality of their playing is never in doubt, and the ensemble is faultless. There’s tremendous authority in the assertive movements – the scherzo of the B major Trio Op 8 (which they play in its final revised version), or the opening Allegro of the C major Trio Op 87 – but there could be something more personal in the more wistfully introspective ones, such as the theme and variations of Op 87, and in the almost Mendelssohnian fleetness of the Presto in the C minor Trio Op 101. It’s hard to escape the feeling sometimes that these three superb musicians are each doing their own thing musically, rather than contributing to a collective whole."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/25/guardian-public-service-awards-2017-vote-public-servant-of-the-year","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T09:39:40Z","webTitle":"Guardian Public Service Awards 2017: vote now for Public Servant of the Year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/25/guardian-public-service-awards-2017-vote-public-servant-of-the-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/25/guardian-public-service-awards-2017-vote-public-servant-of-the-year","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Public Service Awards 2017: vote now for Public Servant of the Year","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Five public servants have been shortlisted for this year’s prestigious Public Servant of the Year award, which is now open online for public voting. We’re looking for a public servant who has contributed outstanding work and made a real difference. We asked those making a nomination to explain: How does this person embody the very spirit and ethos of public service? In what ways have they gone the extra mile for service users and made a real difference to outcomes? What challenges have they had to overcome in their public service role? You can submit your vote for the winner via the form at the bottom of the page. Voting closes at midnight on 9 October 2017. You may only vote once. The winner will be announced at the Public Service Awards ceremony on 28 November 2017 and a special supplement will be published online and in the paper on 29 November 2017. The shortlisted nominees, in alphabetical order by surname, are: Olena Batista New Horizons officer, Making Money Count, Clarion Futures, Clarion Housing Group Since moving to work in social housing four years ago, Olena Batista has supported an estimated 1,400 vulnerable people with practical and personal money issues. Many are reluctant to share their financial challenges, because they feel ashamed or guilty, lack motivation or confidence to address the underlying problems, or live in fear of being judged. But, according to her nomination, Batista’s approachable, knowledgeable and considerate demeanour helps her break down those barriers. Originally from the Ukraine, Batista is fluent in several European languages. She deals with up to eight or 10 new tenants a week, each with a long list of challenges, but she is described as always taking the extra time to visit them in their homes, and fights hard to get them the help they need. In the past year alone, she has obtained 94 grants for basic household goods, distributed 52 food bank vouchers, provided benefits advice to 135 people, guidance on 181 utility bills and supported 71 people with access to employment or digital support. At a time when inequalities faced by people living in social housing have increased, and there are seldom simple solutions, Batista has been nominated for maintaining her humanity and compassion, and being a role model to her colleagues. Paula Farson Chief executive officer, London Accessible Psychotherapy Independent Service Paula Farson officially established the London Accessible Psychotherapy Independent Service (Lapis) as a community service in 2016, to bring mental health services to disabled people in the community. After the closure of an agency she had worked for previously, her nomination says she took the initiative to continue the service at her own expense, to continue to support her vulnerable clients. Farson also spent a considerable time fundraising, building a team of professionals and volunteers, and publicising Lapis’s mission by speaking at conferences. She is described as determined to keep the service accessible, supplying a suitable clinic space in a similar location so long-term clients could continue with their therapy, and operating a sliding pricing scale, rather than the more typical fees usually charged for private clients. According to her nomination, Farson has shown unwavering commitment to the needs of her clients (which would otherwise go unmet), despite contending with her own disability and more than one major surgical procedure over the past year. Julie Hunt Leader of special needs youth club, Riverside Youth Centre, run by Canterbury Academy for Kent county council Julie Hunt has been nominated by the parent of a child who attends the special needs youth club, who says Hunt’s centre is the only exception to their experience of being constantly excluded from school, clubs, shops and social services’ facilities due to her child’s behavioural difficulties. Hunt is described as a vibrant, positive person who is always optimistic, sensitive and understanding, determined to make the club as inclusive a service as possible. To that end, youngsters who attend the mainstream youth group mix with, and mentor, the special needs youngsters every week. A number of mainstream users have subsequently gone on to work in the care system, making use of their knowledge and understanding of disability. The youth club has been threatened with closure a number of times over the past five years, but her nomination says Hunt manages to make a lot happen with very little budget, such as introducing free meals and cooking lessons, and running regular events. She has been described as fighting tooth and nail for the service and, despite a family illness, has given disabled youngsters a reliable and enjoyable place to call a second home. Sara Jones Head of commissioning, Sussex Police and Crime Commissioner’s Office While recognition often goes to those more visible on the frontline of policing, Sara Jones has been nominated for her creative approach to supporting victims of crime, proving it’s possible to balance efficiency and value for money, with providing quality services. Jones has driven improvements to victim services across Sussex, challenging the status quo and breaking down the geographical boundaries that meant support was fragmented and inefficient. This has included bringing three local authorities together that were each conducting separate domestic homicide reviews, working with local clinical commissioning groups to add domestic abuse outreach workers to GP surgeries, and improving support for older people who have fallen victim to financial fraud. Jones has been credited with leading the development of the first online directory of victim support services, which gives people confidential access to help regardless of whether or not they choose to report a crime to the police. In 2017 so far, nearly 3,000 people have used the site. She has also helped find seed funding for local projects that have supported child victims of sexual violence, elderly victims, and provided workshops on sexual consent for nearly 600 young people. Stephen Smith Project worker, Caritas Care REACT Stephen Smith has worked and volunteered with learning disability self-advocacy groups for more than 25 years, and is currently the director of self advocacy in Lancashire. He is said to go above and beyond his role as a project worker to promote and improve the quality of services for people with a learning disability, and brings real insight to the job, helped by his own experiences of having a learning disability. He is involved with training events with leaders of services, medical staff and social work students; community initiatives and health events; national campaigns such as right to vote and boosting awareness of cancer screening; and regularly works with other organisations to promote quality, including Lancashire county council. Smith is described as an active member of the Lancashire learning disability board, which he has co-chaired. His work has already been recognised with a leadership award, and a health champion award from the East Lancashire clinical care group. According to his nomination, he goes the extra mile in whatever he is involved in and is passionate about learning about disability and social care issues. He motivates and inspires others to get involved, drives ideas and campaigns tirelessly for change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/20/tech-giants-disown-responsibility-terrorist-attacks-internet","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T10:38:40Z","webTitle":"It isn’t just tech giants that disown responsibility for terrorist attacks | Jonathan Freedland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/20/tech-giants-disown-responsibility-terrorist-attacks-internet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/20/tech-giants-disown-responsibility-terrorist-attacks-internet","fields":{"headline":"It isn’t just tech giants that disown responsibility for terrorist attacks","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It was nearly a decade ago now, when social media – and indeed my children – were in their infancy. My eldest son, then six, had a favourite toy, a remote-control car that could navigate water as well as land. He filmed it in the park, as it ploughed through muddy puddles, and wanted to post the video on YouTube. To add to what was then a novel experience, he added a soundtrack. To reinforce the watery theme, he chose Neil Young’s Down by the River. We posted it and he was delighted with the handful of views it generated. But then came disappointment. Suddenly, the short video was rendered mute. YouTube had discovered the unauthorised use of Young’s music and removed the song, due to a “copyright infringement”. My son was dismayed, but I was intrigued. With what all-seeing genius was this tech giant blessed, that it could spot a commercial violation in a video that almost no one will have watched? Truly, nothing eluded its gaze. So I have some sympathy with Theresa May, who sits down with the internet’s biggest players in New York today. She is surely right to tell the likes of Facebook, Twitter and Google that they need to do more to remove material that enables terrorists to wreak havoc, whether by motivating followers to kill or demonstrating the technical means to do so. The British prime minister will be right to be sceptical of the tech corporations’ claims that there is little they can do, that there is simply too much content on their platforms for them to supervise it properly. After all, if they had the capacity to strip a song off a child’s homemade toy movie back in 2008, they can surely weed out a “how to make a bomb” video now. May would also be justified in giving short shrift to the kind of answers Google’s general counsel Kent Walker served up to BBC Radio 4’s Gordon Corera this morning. Why, Corera asked, was it the job of the police or others to flag up online material that violated the tech companies’ guidelines? Shouldn’t the companies be doing that themselves? “It’s a shared responsibility,” said Walker smoothly. Imagine if the editor of this or any other newspaper said that weeding out murderous content from our site was not our duty, but a “shared responsibility”? This, I know, is the oldest of old chestnuts: the insistence by Facebook, Twitter and the like that they are mere platforms rather than publishers. May would have every right to challenge that self-serving distinction, even to recall the words of her long-ago predecessor, Stanley Baldwin, who accused the press barons of that age of exercising “the prerogative of the harlot”: power without responsibility. Today’s mighty corporations of the internet have enormous power. It’s about time they took responsibility. And yet, for all that, it will be hard to cheer the PM more than halfheartedly. For this has been a refrain of hers for at least seven years, stretching back to the start of her tenure as home secretary in 2010. Bashing the tech giants for their dissemination of extremist words and pictures has long been the government’s default reaction to any terrorist attack. And it is suspiciously convenient. Just last week, the response to the failed bomb attack at Parsons Green underground station included a fully briefed Daily Mail front-page story headlined, “Web giants with blood on their hands”. How much easier to make that the topic of debate rather than, say, the cutting of 20,000 police officers since 2010? The big beasts of the internet are a handy, perennial receptacle for blame. The fury and angst that, understandably, follows any act of terrifying violence can be reliably diverted from those whose prime task is the protection of the country’s citizens, namely the government, to the mammoth corporations who now control the bulk of the world’s information. Don’t get me wrong, those companies can and should do much more. But they are not the only ones with power seeking to shake off responsibility. • Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/21/columbine-destroyed-my-entire-career-marilyn-manson-on-the-perils-of-being-the-lord-of-darkness","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T11:52:13Z","webTitle":"'Columbine destroyed my entire career': Marilyn Manson on the perils of being the lord of darkness","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/21/columbine-destroyed-my-entire-career-marilyn-manson-on-the-perils-of-being-the-lord-of-darkness","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/21/columbine-destroyed-my-entire-career-marilyn-manson-on-the-perils-of-being-the-lord-of-darkness","fields":{"headline":"'Columbine destroyed my entire career': Marilyn Manson on the perils of being the lord of darkness","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It is while discussing the difference between his stage persona and his day-to-day life that Marilyn Manson leans over and flicks me in the testicles. This comes as quite a surprise: I have encountered a lot of unusual things as a journalist, but have thus far managed to get by without an interviewee touching my genitals. More surprising still is that leaning over and flicking my testicles appears to form part of his answer to a question about whether he has ever felt consumed by the character he created a quarter of a century ago, in the same way that Bowie struggled to separate himself from Ziggy Stardust or the Thin White Duke. Certainly, the way he says: “That’s the difference!” immediately afterwards suggests it is, but I’m not sure. For one thing, I am distracted by my sore testicles, and, for another, I wasn’t really following his line of argument at the time. First, he took my notepad, wrote “person” on it and added an “a” at the end. “I’m this and I’m this,” he said. “A person and a persona. But I can’t really divide the two. There’s a difference on the stage; people I don’t know I just seduce, in a lot of ways. You go offstage and people … even me and you now, talking …” His voice trailed off and, while I was trying to work out whether he had just said that he did inhabit a different persona on stage he flicked me in the testicles. It’s all a bit peculiar, but then the interview has been peculiar from the minute I stepped into the Berlin hotel suite where Manson is receiving the press. He is midway through a European festival tour and promoting his forthcoming eighth album, Heaven Upside Down, a work he describes as “hard, punk rock, Killing Joke, Joy Division, Bauhaus, Scary Monsters”, and which reunites him with Tyler Bates, a guitarist, producer and soundtrack composer best known for his work on Guardians of the Galaxy. Manson seems surprised that Bates agreed to work with him again after 2015’s The Pale Emperor, or rather its ensuing tour, during which relations between the two deteriorated to such an extent that Manson pulled a box-cutter knife on Bates. Heaven Upside Down was announced the day before the US presidential election, in typically understated Marilyn Manson style, with a short video that was widely reported as showing the singer decapitating Donald Trump. “Well, there was no actual decapitation shown,” he demurs. “It was implied. And no Trump. There was just a guy in a red tie. Could have been a preacher. It’s funny that people see what they want to see.” I have been warned that, as per Manson’s usual requirements for meeting journalists, the room will be both dark and cold, which it certainly is: air conditioning up full, curtains drawn against the afternoon sun, the only light coming from a television tuned to one of those ambient channels that broadcasts endless footage of landscapes and animals. But I have not been warned that Manson will be hiding behind his hotel room door, from where he will jump out – black-clad, in full slap – pointing a gun at the back of my neck. Not, it transpires, a real gun, but a realistic enough replica for me to greet him with a startled bark of, “What the fuck do you think you’re doing?” rather than the more traditional “hello”. Manson laughs, shakes my hand and asks if I’d like a beer. Thus begins an extremely diverting hour during which Manson will offer to wrestle me to demonstrate his physical and mental wellbeing; inquire, in the middle of discussing the difficulty of meeting your childhood idols and, apropos of nothing as far as I can gather, whether I am “a poop man, a scat guy”; suggest his partner, photographer and model Lindsay Usich – who wanders into the room in search of a drink – expose herself to me on the grounds that “the Guardian is an important periodical”; and flick me in the testicles. It is difficult to work out whether all of this is done in a kind of spirit of collaboration – perhaps he is keen to ensure a journalist goes home with an incident-packed story, the better to promote the new album – or simply because Manson has, entirely understandably, chosen to enliven a long day of interviews with the European media by having a few drinks along the way. Certainly, something about his speech and gait strongly suggests the tumbler of neat vodka in his hand may not be his first of the day. If it’s the former, then he really needn’t have bothered. Manson is a fascinating man even without the accompanying theatrics. Over the course of my time with him, he is variously funny, insightful, frank and preposterously self-mythologising: “I wake up in the morning and I just realise that I am chaos. That’s my job – I am a goddamn tornado,” he announces at one juncture. “You look at it, behold it, you get caught up in it, it tears off your roof – and I’m from Ohio, so I know about tornadoes”. He is also, on occasion, wildly contradictory and incomprehensible, his answers veering so wildly off-road that I have no idea what he is talking about. Indeed, after one particularly unfathomable response, I find myself asking him if he’s OK. “I don’t know – check my pulse,” he laughs, but it’s a genuine query. His father, a Vietnam veteran, died days before this tour began. They were close – his dad would come on tour with him and the pair posed together for an amazing Paper magazine shoot, both in full Marilyn Manson drag. No one would have blamed him for cancelling his shows and promotional schedule to grieve. He looks aghast at the idea. “My dad would have hated me for that. He’d have kicked me in the dick. He would want me to be the best I could be right now. That’s what he raised me to be. Dad was a fucking fighter, a killer in Vietnam, but he was not a quitter; he just didn’t want to be here any more. He didn’t give up, he just wanted to be with my mom, and I respected him for that. So I wouldn’t miss a gig. It was not easy – I had to go see him a week before we went on tour. It was tough, but it made me stronger.” Besides, he is bullishly proud of his new album, which he says “is about confidence, of fucking believing in yourself more than ever, which is something I may have lost along the road”. He is also theatrically furious at his record label for suggesting he put out a censored version for sale in the US’s Walmart stores. “It denies the legitimacy of it. If your parents give you money to buy a clean version of my record at Walmart, you might as well go there, buy a gun instead, take it into your own hands, do whatever you want.” Listening to him talk, it’s tempting to wonder if he hankers after the era when he was American rock’s public enemy No 1, the primary source of outrage for conservative watchdog organisations. It’s easy to forget how much controversy Manson managed to cause in the late 90s, when his name was linked to the 1999 massacre at Columbine high school in Colorado, whose perpetrators were alleged – erroneously as it turned out – to have been fans. He warms to his previous point. “Give them the money and let them make their own choice: guns or records. If [the Columbine killers] had just bought my records, they would be better off. Certain people blame me for the shootings at schools – I think my numbers are low, and hopefully they go up on this record.” It’s unclear whether he means numbers of shootings or people blaming him, but it’s provocation either way. “That’s going to be a great pull-quote for you. But, honestly, the Columbine era destroyed my entire career at the time.” He was raising hackles long before Columbine, though. In Britain, his 1996 breakthrough album Antichrist Superstar was largely viewed as hugely entertaining glam metal in the grand gothic tradition of Alice Cooper. In the US, however, religious conservatives seemed to think he really was some kind of emissary of Satan. A succession of demented sworn testimonies on the American Family Association’s website claimed his concerts involved bestiality, satanic altars, ritual rapes and the distribution of free drugs. Some towns threatened to pass legislation banning him from performing on state property; schools in Florida threatened to expel students who attended his shows; the state of South Carolina ended up giving him money – $40,000 – not to play there. “Well, I asked for it,” he nods. “You don’t make a record called Antichrist Superstar and not expect people to hate you. But I wanted to do something that made a difference. I wanted to put a fucking dent in the world, like my heroes: [Salvador] Dalí, Jim Morrison. I knew that there were people who would take it at face value, and that there were people who would see into it more deeply, and it would be that dichotomy that would cause chaos.” After Columbine, the chaos ratcheted up even more. His concerts weren’t just being protested or picketed: during the 2001 Ozzfest tour, he says, he received daily death threats; “hundreds” when he played in Colorado. “I would just get on stage and smash beer bottles and cut myself and go, ‘Fuck you, bring it,’ – I’ve got scars all over my chest – I can show you. I would jump into the crowd and punch people. It wasn’t even those people who were at fault. But my dad gave me the best advice: ‘If people are going to kill you, son, they wouldn’t tell you in advance.’ No, I don’t miss that at all. It made everyone around me upset. And I discovered that police bomb dogs are also drug dogs. So when there were bomb threats, I had a very difficult time hiding my narcotics.” It didn’t destroy his career as he claims – he still fills arenas around the world and has parlayed his notoriety into an acting career in the US TV series Salem and Sons of Anarchy, playing “a murdering barber and a paedophile white supremacist. Typecast.” He has also found his fanbase extending into some unlikely places, not least the world of hip-hop. Gucci Mane and Rick Ross are fans; Lil Uzi Vert wears a diamond-encrusted pendant of Manson’s face. “I don’t know why rappers like me, other than what Gucci Mane told me,” he says. “He said I was ‘the only shit that’s real in rock’n’roll’. Rappers are hardcore and they’re real; rock’n’roll is so pussy and so lame. But I’m not saying I’m the realest thing in the world.” He sighs. “People say: ‘You’re the last rock star.’ Don’t say that to me – shut the fuck up, man! I don’t need that shit on my shoulders. But I’ll take it. I’ll own it.” Perhaps they mean you’re the last rock star who could create the kind of controversy you created in the 90s? It’s hard to imagine anyone being shocked by a rock band now, in a world when you can see anything, no matter how gruesome or offensive, with a click of a mouse. He nods. “I know. Fair enough. You just have to say what you’re saying with certainty, and look good when you’re saying it – that’s how you do your job.” But if times have changed, he says he has changed, too. He used to be “angry, confused and upset”, he says. “Now, I think I feel more happy. Not like, Shiny Happy People. I think I’m just happy being myself. I think now, I’m much more charming and likable. I notice you’re enjoying yourself.” Well, I am. He’s hugely entertaining company. “And I’m sure in a moment you’ll take your pants off and I’ll smash you in the nuts with a beer bottle.” No, I say, you’re OK. So instead, Manson opts for taking a selfie of us, showing me his ringtone (it’s Hot Love by T Rex), shaking my hand and asking me to write nice things about him. Of course, I say. “Good,” he smiles, ushering me out into the corridor. “Or I’ll find out where you fucking live.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/20/foo-fighters-review-o2-arena-london-dave-grohl-rick-astley","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T12:48:40Z","webTitle":"Foo Fighters review – rip-roaring rock riffs and Rick-rolling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/20/foo-fighters-review-o2-arena-london-dave-grohl-rick-astley","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/20/foo-fighters-review-o2-arena-london-dave-grohl-rick-astley","fields":{"headline":"Foo Fighters review – rip-roaring rock riffs and Rick-rolling","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“Rick fuckin’ Astley,” says Dave Grohl as his special guest skips offstage having just done his biggest hit in the style of Smells Like Teen Spirit. “What a bad-ass motherfucker.” You couldn’t imagine Bono or Axl Rose ever Rick-rolling themselves, but that’s the point. Recreating his recent impromptu Astley collaboration in Japan on a grungecore Never Gonna Give You Up perfectly encapsulates Grohl’s appeal. He’s the embodiment of garage-punk spirit who surfed Nirvana’s trajectory to icon status and became, by necessity, a wry pastiche of a guitar rock god. He was given an entire HBO series in 2014, Sonic Highways, to fanboy over the studios where, for example, Pigface recorded Gub. When he broke his leg in 2015, his punk principles required that he keep touring in a throne made of guitar necks. Tonight he arrives riffing and screaming through I’ll Stick Around like an arena metal hellion, but treats the O2 like any Seattle dive bar, mocking his band’s superfluous solos (“that was enlightening,” he tells guitarist Chris Shiflett), promising everyone a drink if they can out-sing him and, as always, repeatedly insisting the band will “keep playing all night”. If Grohl actually played all night every time he said he would, it would trigger a global crisis in babysitting debt, but he has a good go. Over almost three hours, Foo Fighters tear through reams of pop-metal hits as savage as they are accessible, all capturing a melodic grunge euphoria – a little like Nirvana ski jumping. Despite even Lemonhead-like ditties Learn to Fly and Monkey Wrench being stretched into seven-minute crowd-teasers full of breakdowns and sing-for-your-beer sections, the pace remains fervent. The material from their new album, Concrete and Gold (Grohl’s attempt at a blues-metal Sgt Pepper’s), suggests the Foos are developing a subtle artistry and political bite in their third decade. Make It Right and The Sky Is a Neighbourhood turn the Beatles’ I Want You (She’s So Heavy) into bombastic diatribes on poverty and global warming.

The blind Lebanese singer and musician Barakat Jabbour takes the lead role in this interesting and distinctive if undeveloped feature debut, a kind of road-movie mystery. It is written and directed by Vatche Boulghourjian, the Lebanese film-maker whose career developed through the Cinéfondation at Cannes, and who was selected for Critics’ Week with this film. Jabbour plays Rabih, a young man who is – like the actor himself – blind and a talented musician. He is the adopted son of Samar (Julia Kassar) and by that token the nephew of Julia’s brother Hisham (Toufic Barakat), a shady businessman. When Rabih is invited to tour Europe with his group, he needs a passport; the authorities tell him his ID is fake, and Rabih realises everything he has been told about how he was found as a baby is a lie. He goes on a slightly improbable road trip, to ask questions of Hisham’s suspicious, resentful friends and relatives, and discovers his identity can be found only by dredging up painful memories of the Lebanese civil war. It is an intriguing process, although we are not given any twist-in-the-tail revelation. Eventually, perhaps inevitably, it is music itself which is the supposed revelation. Music is the philosophical solvent and the emollient, and the only personal truth that will ultimately make sense to Rabih and those who love him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/25/guardian-public-service-awards-2017-shortlist-categories","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T09:42:00Z","webTitle":"Guardian Public Service Awards 2017: the shortlist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/25/guardian-public-service-awards-2017-shortlist-categories","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/25/guardian-public-service-awards-2017-shortlist-categories","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Public Service Awards 2017: the shortlist","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The judges have met and deliberated and we are delighted to now announce the shortlisted projects and teams in each of the eight categories of this year’s Guardian Public Service Awards.

Starring as himself, the head of the Catholic church has a cameo role in Beyond the Sun, an evangelical story about children searching for God. He is expected to attend the screening. A copy of the film has already been sent to him. All the film’s proceeds will go to charities for disadvantaged children in Argentina, the country of the 80-year-old pontiff’s birth. The film’s producers include Andrea Iervolino, an Italian-born Hollywood film-maker. He told the Guardian that, for devout Catholics like himself, the pope is “God on Earth” and filming him was an overwhelming experience. He said: “We make eight to 10 movies every year with big movie stars … This is not just a movie. This is something special.” Iervolino made his first film aged 15 with the help of his local church, which lent him costumes, a horse and a filming location. “Now I have the opportunity to do a movie with a special appearance of the pope for charity. For me, this is the most important thing that I can do with my life,” he said. The pope is on screen, in the middle of the film and again at the end, for about six minutes. The film shows him as a “man of the people”, Iervolino said. He appears in a scene with the children, urging them to talk to Jesus and to read the gospels. He tells them: “Don’t think of [the gospels] as a huge book … The gospels are small. But you have to read them slowly, bit by bit. And you should be with someone who can explain whatever you don’t understand. “I recommend people who are adults to always carry a small gospel with them in their pockets, in the woman’s purse, because – on the subway or on the bus, or waiting at the doctor’s, who knows – you can read a little. Or you keep it at home.” He continues: “Speak to Jesus … Tell him what’s happening to you. What happened today. Tell him the things you saw and you disliked, or in the school or out in the streets, or in your family … Jesus is waiting for you, and he is looking for you, and you don’t realise … Look for him, and that’s how you will find each other. Dare to do it.” The footage was shot in a single take, and the pope’s part was unscripted. “He did his own speech,” Iervolino said. “We only explained to him the story and the compass. He’s not an actor. He’s himself. So he’s real, which is important.” Setting up the shoot, including arranging the cameras within the Vatican amid extensive security, took about a day. But filming the footage of the pope was done quickly. Afterwards, the pope’s parting words to Iervolino and the crew were: “Please pray for me.” Iervolino said: “We’re doing this for charity. He’s doing this to help. This is very special thing. He’s an amazing man. This is another way to help the world.” Iervolino has produced, funded and distributed more than 60 feature films, including The Merchant of Venice, starring Al Pacino. In partnership with Monika Bacardi, he founded AMBI Group, which develops, produces and distributes films worldwide, from comedies to thrillers. Forthcoming productions include an animated family epic, Arctic Justice: Thunder Squad, with John Cleese and Alec Baldwin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/sep/20/dna-editing-in-human-embryos-reveals-role-of-fertility-master-gene","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T17:02:36Z","webTitle":"DNA editing in human embryos reveals role of fertility 'master gene'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/sep/20/dna-editing-in-human-embryos-reveals-role-of-fertility-master-gene","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/sep/20/dna-editing-in-human-embryos-reveals-role-of-fertility-master-gene","fields":{"headline":"DNA editing in human embryos reveals role of fertility 'master gene'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Scientists in Britain have revealed the role of a fertility “master gene” in one of the world’s first demonstrations of DNA editing in human embryos. The study, which marks a first for the UK, could help uncover the cause of recurrent miscarriages and lead to more effective fertility treatments. It also raises ethical questions about the prospect of controversial gene editing techniques being used clinically to correct defects in, or even enhance, human embryos in the future. Kathy Niakan, who led the work at the Francis Crick Institute in London, said: “Our research is the first time that genome editing has been used to understand the role of a gene in early embryonic development. This knowledge can be used to improve IVF treatment and improve our understanding of how some pregnancies fail.” Niakan’s team is the first in Britain to have edited the DNA of human embryos, with just a handful of such experiments having been performed in China and the US. These focused on how editing might be used to prevent inherited diseases being passed from one generation to the next. The latest work switches the spotlight to the basic biological sequence that plays out as a fertilised egg turns into a ball of cells, known as a blastocyst, during the first seven days of development. Only when an embryo successfully reaches the blastocyst stage does it stand any chance of implanting in the womb. Using 41 human embryos donated by couples with a surplus after IVF treatment, the scientists applied the gene-editing tool Crispr/Cas9 to make precise cuts in DNA and deactivate a gene called OCT4, which was believed to be important in the earliest stages of development. The study, published in Nature, showed this gene is critical for the embryo to make the transition from a uniform blob of cells to a blastocyst, which comprises three cell types that will go on to be the embryo, the placenta and the yolk sac. Under a microscope, the edited embryos started by dividing and expanding normally, but then underwent repeated cycles of expansion and collapse without ever progressing to the next stage. Scientists believe that lower than normal OCT4 activity could be why embryos fail to implant successfully, leading to miscarriage. Treating this would not necessarily require gene editing – it might be possible to coax more activity from the gene by changing the way embryos are cultured in the IVF process, for instance. Kay Elder, study co-author from the Bourn Hall fertility clinic in Cambridge said that the technique could help improve IVF success rates, which remain frustratingly low. “Many embryos arrest in culture, or fail to continue developing after implantation,” she said. “This research will significantly help treatment for infertile couples, by helping us to identify the factors that are essential for ensuring that human embryos can develop into healthy babies.” The failures of fertility treatments could be down, in part, to a reliance on mouse studies, which until now have been seen as the best way to work out the role of genes during embryonic development – and why things sometimes go wrong. The latest work highlights the shortcomings with this approach, showing that the OCT4 gene appears to play a different role in early human embryos than in mice. “This is in a way unexpected, because of the dogma that the earliest stages of development are common for all mammalian and even some non-mammalian species,” said Dusko Ilic, reader in stem cell science at King’s College London. “The study is another proof that the findings from experimental animal models cannot be always extrapolated to humans.” The latest work comes as an increasing number of researchers are applying the powerful genome editing procedure called Crispr-Cas9. The technique was invented only four years ago, but is already revolutionising biomedical research. It allows scientists to make precise edits to the genome – snipping through strands of DNA to deactivate genes and potentially correcting genetic flaws. The technique could hold huge clinical potential, but it is also controversial because it involves altering the “germline”, meaning that any changes would be passed down to future generations. Karen Yeung, professor of law at Kings College London, said: “The work demonstrates the invaluable role played by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority in the British context in monitoring and ensuring that limits of responsible research on human embryos are respected, in order to maintain public trust in research of this kind.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/21/marry-waterson-and-david-a-jaycock-death-had-quicker-wings-than-love-review-darkly-magical-folk","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T17:30:24Z","webTitle":"Marry Waterson and David A Jaycock: Death Had Quicker Wings Than Love review – darkly magical folk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/21/marry-waterson-and-david-a-jaycock-death-had-quicker-wings-than-love-review-darkly-magical-folk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/21/marry-waterson-and-david-a-jaycock-death-had-quicker-wings-than-love-review-darkly-magical-folk","fields":{"headline":"Marry Waterson and David A Jaycock: Death Had Quicker Wings Than Love review – darkly magical folk","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This album begins with a woman on a rooftop alone, singing to the birds, her voice gutsy, darkly magical.

Mark Johnston’s filly did not start out on her three-year-old season until June, when she won a 0-70 handicap at Hamilton off 70 by four lengths. She moved smoothly through the weights with subsequent victories off 76, 82 and 86 and finally 93, showing a battling attitude in the finish whenever challenged, and while she went down by a short-head off 97 on her latest start at York in late August, the strength of the opposition was such that it could be marked down as yet another step forward in the level of her form. Wednesday’s assignment is another rung up the ladder, but Titi Makfi has stopped the clock in an excellent time on her last two outings, goes well with some cut in the ground and may not have quite as many opponents to worry about as the numbers might suggest. Jessica Harrington’s Beautiful Morning, for instance, is an interesting contender from Ireland having finished second in a Group Two last time out, but she has not won since her maiden in August 2015 and has been beaten at Listed level three times in the past. Equitation (5.55) won with something to spare at Doncaster last time out and starts out handicapping on what look like a very fair mark, while his stable companion at the Roger Varian yard, Zabeel Prince (4.55) is another handicap debutant with plenty to recommend him. D’Bai (3.05) does not need to improve to take the day’s other Listed event, the Fortune Stakes at Sandown Park, while the lightly-raced Makkadangdang (4.15) could outrun his double-figure price on the same card and Dirchill (4.00) and Bohernagore (5.30) look best at Beverley and Kelso respectively.

The UN children’s agency has warned in a report that the cognitive development of millions of under-fives is being undermined because parents are receiving neither the right guidance nor basic support, such as maternity leave. “Time and money constraints mean that parents are forced to focus on putting food on the table, rather than play with their children, particularly in challenging circumstances where conflict, violence, extreme poverty and disease are rife,” said Dr Pia Britto, chief of early childhood development at Unicef. A survey covering 64 developing countries asked parents if they had spent any time telling stories, reading, naming, counting, drawing, playing or singing songs with their child over a three-dayperiod. A quarter of children had not been engaged in any of these activities, which are crucial to promoting their cognitive, emotional and social development. Britto said the findings were likely to be indicative of a wider pattern. “We are not caring for children’s brains the way we care for their bodies – especially in early childhood, when the science shows that children’s brains and children’s futures are rapidly being shaped,” said Anthony Lake, Unicef’s executive director. “We need to do more to give parents and caregivers of young children the support they need during this most critical period.” While a strong body of research has shown the benefits of interaction between children and their parents, this is not always communicated to families, said Britto. “Some parents may not realise the unique window of opportunity that early childhood presents, where brain growth is somewhat reliant on a child’s environment and experiences.” Unicef researchers also found that more than 20% of children under five are regularly left on their own with no adult supervision, according to data collected across more than 70 countries, while 80% are regularly subjected to violent discipline by their caregivers. The report identified three policies essential to supporting families with young children: two years of free pre-primary education, paid breastfeeding breaks during the first six months of a child’s life, and adequate paid parental leave. In 32 countries, home to one in eight of the world’s under-fives, families do not receive any of these basic entitlements, the study found. The nurturing and care given to young children is not recognised as a priority, said Britto. “When it comes to young children, most governments are thinking around survival and keeping the children disease-free, and then they are thinking about education in the form of primary school,” she said. “Between survival and school we’re missing this early part of development.” On average, governments worldwide spend less than 2% of their education budgets on early childhood programmes. Unicef has suggested that average spending should increase to 10%, and has urged governments to make family-friendly policies. “There needs to be an urgent investment and political prioritisation of this agenda. In countries where it has been prioritised, for example, Chile, we’ve seen it is possible [to make progress],” said Britto. In Chile, a holistic early years program, Chile Grows with You, has reached more than 80% of children, providing education and healthcare. Britto added that health workers should expand the services they offer to families, and “broaden the lens beyond health to include all of the different factors that together help shape and define young brains”. Britto said families needed to demand services that will help them create an enriching environment for their children. “Young children who grow up in an enriching environment where they feel loved, care for, protected and stimulated, and where they received good nutrition, have the best possible chance of optimal development,” said Britto."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/20/uk-shoppers-spend-prices-retail-sales","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T12:58:06Z","webTitle":"UK shoppers continue to spend despite rising prices","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/20/uk-shoppers-spend-prices-retail-sales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/20/uk-shoppers-spend-prices-retail-sales","fields":{"headline":"UK shoppers continue to spend despite rising prices","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Britain’s consumers continued spending after the summer sales, despite the steepest annual growth in non-food store prices in almost three decades. Growth in retail sales volumes rose by 1% in August after the Office for National Statistics revised the figure for July up to 0.6%, beating analysts’ expectations for an increase of 0.2%. The pound leapt against the dollar on the figures, which add weight to a potential rate hike by the Bank of England for the first time in a decade. Spending in clothing stores continued, the ONS said, despite price increases after the end of the busy summer period, likely to be as a result of sales promotions ending. Footwear stores also fared well in the back-to-school shopping season. Kate Davies, a senior statistician at the ONS, said: “We are seeing strong price increases across all store types compared with a year ago, reflecting wider inflationary pressures. However, we are still seeing underlying growth in sales volumes, and with strong growth in non-essential purchases as consumers continued to buy more from non-food stores.” British households are coming under sustained pressure from rising prices, putting a squeeze on living standards. The consumer price index measure of inflation rose to 2.9% in August, from 2.6% in July. Wages are failing to keep pace, with a cut of 0.4% for real average earnings. Prices have soared as the pound dropped to its lowest levels since the mid-1980s in the aftermath of the Brexit vote last year, pushing up the cost of imports. The jump is particularly sharp in some areas, such as petrol, textiles, clothing and footwear. Non-food stores and online shops recorded their highest year-on-year price growth since March 1992, at 3.2% and 3.3% respectively. Still, consumers are continuing to spend, with these sectors driving the growth in retail sales in August, both in terms of value and volume. While wages are failing to keep pace with inflation, more people are in work than at any time since the mid 1970s. But there are fears households are using debt to keep on spending amid the squeeze. Stephen Boyle, chief economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, said: “While rising employment means more people are earning and can spend, that can’t account for the growth in retail sales. Either we dipped into our savings or we borrowed more last month.” The quantity bought within food stores remained flat on the month, whereas petrol stations showed increases in both the amount spent and quantity bought, at 0.2% and 0.1% respectively. Shoppers are increasingly heading online. Average weekly spending via the internet in August was £1.1bn, an increase of 15.6% compared with the same month a year ago. Excluding automotive fuel, the amount bought by value accounted for 16.4% of all retail spending, up from 15% a year ago. However, economic and political conditions ahead for shoppers are far from ideal, which some economists expect will lead to a slowdown in spending. “We still expect growth in retail sales volumes to disappoint over the coming months,” said Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at the Pantheon Macroeconomics consultancy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2017/sep/22/five-bells-inn-brabourne-ashford-kent-hotel-review","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T05:30:39Z","webTitle":"The Five Bells Inn, Brabourne (near Ashford), Kent: hotel review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/sep/22/five-bells-inn-brabourne-ashford-kent-hotel-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/sep/22/five-bells-inn-brabourne-ashford-kent-hotel-review","fields":{"headline":"The Five Bells Inn, Brabourne (near Ashford), Kent: hotel review","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This must be the most eccentric room I’ve slept in: everything’s oversized, slightly mad or both. One side of the fireplace is taken up by a framed floor-to-ceiling black-and-white photo of sculpted Renaissance bottoms, while on the other a leopard-print chair almost reaches the ceiling. There are toiletries on a huge brass tray by the freestanding bath, a sunburst mirror, some modern wallpaper and lots of exposed brick, all reflected in another mirror – gilt-framed and two metres high. Only the loo, behind a door in the corner, is reassuringly normal. Bonkers it may be but it makes a refreshing change from the ultra-tasteful, safe decor of many contemporary hotel rooms, with their muted colours and genteelly distressed wood. And the offbeat style does not get in the way of comfort: on a cool autumn evening, a log fire is crackling in my fireplace, and the bed and bedding are sumptuous. This is the Five Bells, one of a group of three pubs in the Romney Marsh area that architect John Rogers has been building up since 2013; the others are the Globe in Rye and the Woolpack in Warehorne, both of which had previously lain empty for some years. All are in lovely walking country – particularly around the 1805 Royal Military Canal, dug to stop Napoleon marching across the marsh. John promotes them under the (rather cringey) Ramblinns brand, with a minibus service so that guests can walk the 10 or so miles between the inns, perhaps with a picnic dropped off on the way. Silver-haired, blue-eyed John is a larger-than-life figure, and his ideas about pub interiors are as idiosyncratic as his rooms. His pet hate is the way a bar can be a barrier, particularly if buttressed by the backsides of a row of locals on bar stools. So all his pubs have a low bar, or just a table piled generously with nuts, olives and other nibbles. The idea is to offer an instant, friendly welcome, and at all three pubs it seems to work. My son and I arrive at the Five Bells as the light is fading, having done quite a pub crawl: lunch at the Woolpack, a nine-mile hike to the Globe, then a minibus ride here. So I’m ready for some downtime in my room, Bacchus. (Son’s room is Fuggle, after a famous Kentish hop.) All the rooms – four here, five at the Woolpack – have freestanding baths, which is OK for couples, less good for sharing friends. There are also no in-room televisions, which I’m fine with, and no kettle or tea things, which I’m not. Nevertheless, soaking in the bath watching the fire flicker feels quite special, as does dinner downstairs. John may have a thing about bars, but he’s passionate about his pubs. His public spaces are welcoming and intriguing – garlands of fresh hops, lots of reclaimed wood, lobster pots, sheepskins and shelves of local wines, jams and juices – and with no tables formally laid for meals, they’re as welcoming to drinkers as diners The three pubs share a core menu, but each chef adds their own “Daily Doings” list, from which I pick a main of Dungeness plaice (£15) with samphire and spinach. It’s deliciously fresh, but the standout dish is our witty shared starter of “mini ham, egg and chips” (£7) – little ham hock patties, crushed peas, thread-like “chips” and a glorious soft-yolked scotch egg. Son’s plum and apple crumble is delightfully tart but enormous – big enough to feed an entire family. Like much else here, it’s bonkers and oversized – but then generosity is an endearing fault. • Accommodation was provided by the Five Bells (doubles from £90 B&amp;B) Ask a local Jo Dorey, co-founder Ethel Loves Me gallery, Rye • Walk A circular walk round Brockhill country park near Hythe, takes around an hour, so is great for a family outing.

It was a momentous decision to pick up the flyer for the Trainspotting audition. “Destined” is a bit of a poncy word for it, but I do think I was headed in that direction. Swearing never came naturally to me. I got bullied in school for it. I was pinned up against the girls’ cloakroom wall while everyone chanted at me to swear. All I could come up with was “bloody”. What looks good on a Texan film set doesn’t look good on Sauchiehall Street in Glasgow. I spent pretty much all my wages from No Country For Old Men on a pair of cowboy boots. They’re ridiculous. It’s like wearing two Christmas trees on my legs. I’ve never fought for anything in my life. The story that I had to fight my agent to be considered for a part in No Country For Old Men is bullshit. I just audition for parts and get them or I don’t. I’m not champing at the bit. Watching films I’m in is always a bit odd, especially when I’m watching them for the first time with other people. It’s hard not to see my faults. On-screen birth is laborious. I’ve had two babies in real life, and loads on screen. I had twins in some silly film that wanted to be The Girl in the Pearl Earring. It was more like The Girl in the Blue Shellsuit. But I was worried about having to do it again recently. It’s as if I have to prove myself. I don’t know if my boys [Freddie, 9, and Theo, 4] like any films I’ve done. I took them to the Swallows and Amazons premiere in the Lake District last year. Theo didn’t understand what was happening. Whenever I was holding the baby in the film, he kept shouting: “Who’s that baby?” Then: “Where am I?” He was freaked out by the whole thing. Everybody was super fit and healthy on T2 Trainspotting, which is remarkable, considering. Jonny [Lee Miller] and Ewan [McGregor] were running up Arthur’s Seat in Edinburgh almost daily during filming. It was very different from making the first one. Never mind hangovers on set, people were still drunk. I’ve always been pretty self-sufficient. I never had to borrow money from my mum, even in the early days. Boardwalk Empire was a total leap in the dark. It worked out quite well – five years is a nice amount of time. But I was in an American/HBO bubble for a wee while and I wasn’t plugged in to what was happening back here. Because of my Celtic brogue, I do get cast as “staff” quite often. But I span the decades. I’m not always in a corset, you know.

The format was a live debate with Abdul Qavi, a 50-year-old mullah frequently on television. Qavi joined via video link from Multan, the city in southern Punjab where he runs a religious school. Baloch, a 26-year-old social media celebrity dubbed “Pakistan’s Kim Kardashian”, sat in a studio in Karachi. It was a match made for controversy. The mullah was known for his Islamic erudition; Baloch for her revealing outfits, Instagram poses and pouting Facebook videos. Over the past two years, she had in turn amused and scandalised Pakistani society. She had also inspired thousands of young people, particularly women, who admired this “simple girl’s” transformation into one of the country’s biggest celebrities. Ajeeb Saa’s presenter just needed to light the touchpaper and stand back. He asked Qavi what he thought of Baloch’s recent promise to perform a striptease, dedicated to the Pakistan cricket captain Shahid Afridi, if his team beat India in the World Twenty20 Cup. Would it help the effort to deradicalise Islamist militants, the presenter asked with deadpan seriousness? And might she also dedicate a striptease to Mullah Qavi? The cleric stuck to his role of sober Islamic scholar, batting away the mischievous questions. He did, however, announce his desire to meet Baloch the next time he was in Karachi. It seemed a throwaway remark, but later, each would accuse the other of actively pursuing a meeting. Baloch said Qavi was in love with her. Qavi said she wanted to milk him for publicity. Then, in June last year, Baloch published images of the pair meeting in a Karachi hotel room. In one, she poses with Qavi while wearing his lamb’s wool cap, her mouth gaping open in mock horror. In a short video shot by Baloch using a selfie stick, the mullah says he is happy to have been visited by the model, and hopes to offer her “guidance on issues related to religion”. “I will be guiding Qandeel Baloch and I am hopeful she will listen to me,” Qavi declares. The media storm that erupted was unlike anything Baloch had triggered before. Television stations obsessively reported the famous mullah and his flirtatious meeting with this “notorious model”. Qavi was sacked from his job on a prestigious “moonsighting” committee charged with calling the start of major Islamic holidays. “She didn’t realise she was crossing the line,” says Shehryar Mufti, frontman of Pakistani rock group Bumbu Sauce, who became so fascinated by Baloch that he wrote a song about her. “It is one thing to challenge an abstract notion like society or patriarchy. It is another thing entirely to call a state-endorsed cleric out on being a complete sleaze.” Baloch would later accuse Qavi of behaving even more inappropriately off camera, sharing a soft drink and cigarette with her, even though it was Ramadan. “He is a blot on the name of Islam,” she told AFP journalist Issam Ahmed. “Who is he to claim to be a guardian of the faith?” The furore prompted the press to uncover the “real Baloch” (she had always worked hard to conceal her identity, changing her name and lying about where she came from in interviews). In their filmed meeting, Qavi repeatedly alluded to the fact that they were both from Multan; a journalist there soon worked out who she was and revealed her true name to be Fauzia Azeem. Now her entire family was exposed to the full weight of disapproval of their conservative rural community. Relatives are said to have started haranguing Waseem Azeem, the youngest of Baloch’s six brothers. “No one knew [who] Qandeel Baloch [was] before the Mullah Qavi scandal,” Safdar Shah, her parents’ lawyer, says. “When she was revealed, the people of the area started tormenting her brother: ‘Your sister has violated our cultural and religious norms.’ They told him he had to do something.” On 16 July, 18 days after her real name hit the press, Baloch was found dead by her mother in the family home. The following day, her brother Waseem was arrested for her murder. Qandeel Baloch’s home town of Shah Sadar Din is little more than an outbreak of roadside shops on a nondescript bit of highway. Women are rarely seen; when they do venture outside the high walls of their family compounds, they cover up completely. Baloch’s father, Muhammad Azeem, was always staunchly conservative, and only reluctantly agreed to his wife’s demand that his daughters should receive an education. Born in March 1990, Baloch was a high-spirited girl who loved climbing trees in the dusty back yard where chickens roamed. She would tease her brothers for not being able to keep up with her and, says one sister who wishes to remain anonymous, she bristled at the prospect of getting married or having to wear a burqa outside the house. “She would say, ‘I’m not covering myself like that.’ She was always brave – she never feared anyone.” Baloch’s sister says her interest in fame really blossomed once they acquired a TV set. “Our father said there would be no TV in our house. But our mother sneaked some money to our brother and he bought one for us. She would watch and say, ‘One day, I will act and sing, too. I’ll be like those city girls on TV dramas.’” Baloch’s father, a frail, grey-haired man in his 70s who has walked on crutches since smashing his leg in an accident, recalls his daughter demanding to be allowed to ride a motorbike after seeing the boys doing it. “She dreamed of becoming an independent girl and a model,” he says. Baloch’s mother, Anwar Bibi, stares blankly at the concrete walls of her grimy room as we discuss her daughter. It is a windowless space filled by a bed, a few photographs and some trunks holding the family’s possessions. Baloch “said she wanted to become a model for this village”, Anwar says forlornly. It must have seemed a wild dream. A young girl from a poor village escaping to a glamorous world dominated by the sophisticates of Karachi and Lahore – especially after she was married off, aged 18, to a cousin, Aashiq Hussain. The couple had a son, Mishal, in 2009. Baloch would later describe her husband as a “savage man” and claim he had beaten her. He denies this. “She resisted marrying Aashiq, but her father forced her to,” her mother says. “She was always angry, and I thought she would never forgive us.” Hussain, now 32 and a small-time farmer, describes his former wife as a “very simple girl, just like all the others in the village”, but one who became increasingly obsessed with television dramas. “I was a poor man who could hardly afford two meals a day,” he says, “and she had big dreams. She was thirsty for fame, and wanted me to get her a house in a city. When I couldn’t, she decided to make her own way.” One night in 2009, Baloch and her son went missing. Hussain later discovered she had moved to a women’s shelter in Multan, where residents lived in decrepit, overcrowded rooms, on appalling food rations. It was a time of extreme hardship, and Mishal was often unwell. With her parents refusing to support her, Baloch eventually concluded she had no choice but to return her son to her husband. She hoped one day to earn enough to take him back, but Hussain never let her see the boy again. Baloch’s actions were seen as a grievous wound to her family’s honour. Had she been murdered at that point, her case might even have been regarded as unremarkable: in Pakistan, hundreds of so-called “honour” killings of women by male relatives take place each year. Women have been killed for doing no more than looking at another, unrelated man. According to Shah, one of Baloch’s brothers did threaten to kill her at that time. Disowned by her family, what Baloch did next isn’t clear. Her father says he occasionally talked to her in secret on the telephone, but is otherwise unforthcoming. For a while, she is said to have been a hostess on one of the coaches that ply Pakistan’s highways, handing out snacks to passengers. Baloch herself usually dodged journalists’ questions about her past, or claimed she had lived a middle-class life in Islamabad – all the while insisting she had nothing to hide. “Everyone knows me,” she told the BBC Urdu TV channel shortly before she was killed. “I’m not a fake person.” What is clear is that in 2012, aged 22, Baloch found herself in Karachi, Pakistan’s commercial and media capital. She was about to pull off an extraordinary reinvention. *** At first, Baloch looked to traditional media for her big break. Determined to make her soap opera dreams come true, she landed a series of minor parts in dramas produced by state broadcaster PTV. “She had some small roles in television,” her mother recalls. “I would tell her that I only get public television in my house: ‘Do something for public TV, so I can see you. Also, make sure it airs at 8pm – that’s when I have power in my house.’” In December 2014, Baloch auditioned in Lahore for a place on Pakistan Idol, the TV talent contest, but suffered a mocking rejection by judges unimpressed by her high-pitched warbling. She later claimed the episode was a “planted and fake audition, just a publicity stunt”. By now Baloch, like the rest of the country, was discovering social media, where she could reach a huge audience without worrying about pleasing the TV establishment. More than 60% of Pakistan’s 180 million population are under 30 and, courtesy of cheap smartphones, they were flooding online. Baloch realised she could make an impact presenting whatever image of herself she liked. Her Facebook posts and videos were an extreme subversion of her country’s cultural norms. She twerked for the camera, filmed herself taking a bath, and danced in a bikini. For every delighted fan, there were 100 furious trolls calling her a whore who deserved to die, but still Baloch attracted followers in droves, and it wasn’t all about sex. Many female fans were charmed by the comic goofiness of her videos. An early viral hit, the How I’m Looking? selfie, was a 20-second clip in which Baloch, standing in a crowded place, fishes for compliments from a man standing behind her: “How I’m looking?” she asks. “Marvellous,” the man assures her. “Just marvellous?” she snaps back. The videos look slapdash, but were carefully contrived. According to Junaid Qasi, a digital branding consultant who worked with Baloch in the last months of her life, she would write scripts, discuss ideas and keep filming retakes until she was completely happy she had created something that would go viral. And she was always looking out for news events and “hot trends” to exploit. Her growing social media profile presented modest money-making opportunities. In 2014, a cooking oil company and a film distributor started paying her to plug their products on her Facebook page. She appeared in pop videos. But it was nothing like enough to support her increasingly expensive lifestyle, which included a rented flat in an upmarket area of Karachi, a maid and a car. In Pakistan’s male-dominated media circles, it was widely assumed Baloch must also be working as an escort. Baloch was never confronted with these claims, but in the BBC Urdu interview she said she had deliberately focused on social media to avoid the sleaze of modelling. “I think you know what type of people are sitting in showbiz and how they misuse the girls, making indirect offers and asking to join them at parties,” she said. Qasi says Baloch received help managing her Facebook page from a group of bloggers based in India, a country she dreamed of conquering. These mysterious bloggers allegedly posted some material on her behalf, including feminist calls to arms that never sounded convincing to long-time Baloch watchers. “She knew nothing about feminism,” says the rock singer Mufti. “She was an innocent, and clueless of the cultural significance of what she was doing by posting a lot of sleaze.” *** By the end of 2015, Baloch’s dreams appeared to be coming true. Named one of the 10 most Googled people in Pakistan, she now had hundreds of thousands of Facebook followers – boosted by stunts such as a televised visit to the house of Imran Khan, the country’s former cricket captain turned opposition party leader. When Khan announced the end of his short-lived second marriage in October 2015, Baloch launched a campaign to become the third Mrs Khan. She turned up in front of his house – and the broadcast vans parked outside – to beg Khan to marry her. Every TV station in the country cut live to this impromptu press conference, held by a strange figure wearing aviator sunglasses and asking for help to climb into the politician’s home. “I truly love Imran Khan,” she told reporters. “I am ready to do anything if you’ll help me over this wall.” Baloch’s matrimonial efforts proved unsuccessful, but she was fast establishing herself as a mainstream media personality, appearing on chatshows and even high-profile news programmes. Meanwhile, her social media pronouncements became more controversial. In February 2016, she published a Valentine’s video message that denounced “idiot and moron politicians” for trying to block the day’s festivities. “She was a Pakistani woman who genuinely did not give a shit and called the rest of society out on its hypocrisy,” Mufti says. “Every time someone called her shameful, she demanded to know: ‘Then why are you watching my videos?’” Abid Khan, the events organiser who appeared in her How I’m Looking? selfie, says Baloch set out to emulate two other women, Mathira Mohammad and Veena Malik, who also became famous by defying cultural expectations. “She watched them on YouTube and started copying them,” Khan says. “They were her role models.” Mohammad, a Karachi-based model, first got noticed presenting a late-night phone show called Love Indicator. Though tame by western standards, her revealing tops and flirtatious banter were enough for her to be accused of vulgarity. Malik, an actor, scandalised the country when she posed nude on the front cover of Indian FHM in 2011, one arm painted with the letters “ISI” – the acronym of Pakistan’s infamous military spy agency. “But those other girls had the support of their families,” Qasi says. “It wasn’t the general public that killed Qandeel, it was her own family.” When Baloch made the striptease offer to the national cricket team in March 2016, Qasi and his colleagues warned her she was going too far. “But she never listened. She only wanted fame.” Some of Baloch’s rivals were unimpressed, too. When Mathira called her “cheap” during a joint appearance on daytime TV, Baloch hit back with what might have been her personal manifesto. “For popularity, you need to take off clothes,” she said. “For popularity, strip dance is necessary. Everything is necessary. To become popular and famous, you need to act strange.” *** The money Baloch was making hastened a family reconciliation. She offered her parents a chance to escape Shah Sadar Din, renting them a house in Multan and paying their living expenses. Then she revealed her hotel meeting with Qavi and interest in her exploded. Her former husband told the media she had walked out on him and their son. She responded that she had left an unhappy, forced marriage in which she was beaten. With the clamour around her at fever pitch, her situation was becoming dangerous. On 28 June, she appealed to Pakistan’s interior minister for police protection. There was no response. The Islamic festival of Eid al-Fitr was fast approaching, but Baloch was lying low. She decided not to join her parents at home in Multan, then changed her mind at the last minute, concluding it had become too unsafe to remain in Karachi. She was tense when she arrived in early July, for once fully concealed in a niqab rather than wearing her normal jeans. “She stayed in the house, but was very frightened and asked us to keep the lights off,” her mother recalls. “I kept on asking her, ‘Are you in danger?’ She said, ‘No, Ma, I’m not.’” Shah claims the family were aware of the risk posed by Baloch’s brother Waseem, who is said to have been particularly outraged by her behaviour. The pair had previously had a good relationship, the lawyer suggests, talking regularly on the phone. But a few days after Baloch returned home, Waseem is said to have turned up at her parents’ house in Multan and threatened to kill her. His mother says she gave him the money to return to Shah Sadar Din, only for Baloch to call and ask him to come back. In an attempt to win him round, Baloch told him she would help him find a wife – and the ploy seemed to work. When Waseem returned, he was apparently no longer angry, and prepared sweet milk for all to enjoy after dinner. It was, he later said, laced with sleeping pills; soon, the whole family had turned in for an early night. The following morning, Baloch’s lifeless body was discovered by her mother. “When I woke up, I was sweating a lot,” Anwar says. “I stood up, but my head was heavy and my vision blurry. I walked supported by these walls, calling Qandeel to wake her up for breakfast… I lifted the blanket from her face, but she was no more in this world. I was terrified. I screamed in horror.” *** As often happens in “honour” killing cases, the alleged killer appeared unrepentant. After he was arrested and paraded in front of news cameras, Waseem said, “Yes, I killed her last night. Strangled her to death… I am not ashamed of killing her.” By way of explanation, he told the assembled press: “She was doing videos on Facebook and dishonouring the family name… [And there was] that cleric’s issue; our house was sieged by the media. Before, it wasn’t like that.” Waseem may have been hoping to receive forgiveness from his family. Under “blood money” laws derived from sharia, murderers can be absolved of their crimes if their victim’s relatives forgive them. The provision has helped fuel the epidemic of “honour” killings in Pakistan. But in an unusual move, the local police ruled this particular crime was “non-compoundable”, making it harder for a forgiveness deal to be agreed. The publicity surrounding the case has since led to a change in the law, toughening the punishment for “honour” crimes. Now, even if a killer is forgiven, he will have to serve a life sentence – although he can be spared execution. The preliminaries for Waseem Azeem’s trial began in January, but it is likely to grind forward only slowly. His cousin, Haq Nawaz, was also charged with murder, while two other men were charged with conspiracy to murder and “facilitation”. All four have pleaded not guilty to the charges, according to their defence counsel, Sardar Zafar Ahmed. Baloch’s parents would later change their story to exonerate another son, Aslam Shaheen, who they had initially claimed was an accomplice to the murder. In January, police filed charges against them, too, claiming they had been bribed to change their testimony. But they remain adamant that Waseem is guilty of killing their daughter. Mullah Qavi, meanwhile, has expressed no regret over Baloch’s death. While he insists he is a liberal who supports the reform of “honour” killing laws, he suggested her murder was a sign of God’s displeasure – and a message to others. “She made fun of Imran Khan, Shahid Afridi and the Pakistan cricket team, and no one said anything,” he told me last year, sitting on the floor of a grubby classroom in his seminary in Multan. “But when you insult a scholar, you see the reaction. [Baloch] said she had 700,000 followers, but when she died hardly 100 people attended her funeral prayer. This is because people respect muftis [scholars], and she disrespected me.” Pakistan’s liberal-minded press, and several leading politicians, did express horror at Baloch’s death. The Friday Times devoted its front page to the country’s “candle in the wind”: “A talented, self-made artiste who tested the limits of our sensibilities, and who came to embody, in her colourful life and terrible death, the lingering chasm between our social media and our social reality.” On the internet, the ugliness of that social reality was plain: “Qandeel Baloch was a disgrace tbh, brother did well,” read one of the thousands of disparaging tweets after her death. Even some leading activists were not quite sure what to make of Baloch. While condemning the killing, Tahira Abdullah, a veteran human rights campaigner, said her provocations were a sign that she was “a very disturbed young woman”. As for Baloch’s parents, their life in Multan came to an abrupt end after her death. Their daughter’s killing has thrown them back into the poverty of Shah Sadar Din, and the dusty compound they share with 25 members of their extended family. Her father says he has no intention of pardoning his son: “I cannot forgive him. I want him to be shot dead in front of my eyes.” Now he claims he was never upset by or ashamed of Qandeel’s videos: “She was a very brave girl, and it was her bravery that made her famous. If she had not taken risks, she would not have become famous.” • Additional reporting by Saad Khan.

But only briefly before drawing new battle lines that see him switching sides back to the woman who promises him unconditional loyalty, no matter what he’s done. Simon’s pivot from selfishly wanting his family under one roof to casting Tom out into the night is jaw-dropping and a clear sign that his interest in his son was political and not at all heartfelt. What a bastard. Simon sinks lower every episode until the point where it’s just his head sticking out of the ground. Diagnosis “You told him something and now he won’t even look at me,” Gemma tells Simon at their tense cafe summit after Poor Tom’s suspension from school. Simon waggles his eyebrows in an infuriating gesture of “wouldn’t you like to know”. Despite his promises to work WITH Gemma rather than against her on this, the unrepentant shit is still looking after number one, of that there is no doubt. Back at home, neighbour Anna is contemplating 5pm wine as Neil packs his possessions into a transit and prepares to begin his single life. Before Gemma has even taken off her shoes, she is straight to the cupboard where she keeps the XL wine glasses and pouring a Pinot which she downs in one. Doctor Foster is brought to you by Jacob’s Creek. Poor Tom, now a ticking time bomb of rage, shame and abandonment, sits at Gemma’s kitchen counter, looking to her for refuge now he has quarrelled with his dad. Of course, Simon isn’t far behind him, still at this point keen to claim his son back because … “I don’t want to hurt him, just you,” he sneers at Gemma when he arrives. Gemma’s dinner invitation is a curve ball and Simon looks suitably flummoxed. “Is this a trick?” he asks, quite wisely. Of course she has a plan to seduce him and film it, merely to score a point against bitchy Kate, the virtual child who stole her husband. When Simon spots the camera with those ever beadier eyes, her plan is thwarted – which makes what happens next another shocker, but not entirely unexpected. Having sexual power over Simon still makes Gemma feel in control. They both use sex to taunt each other and are as bad as each other, frankly. It’s only later that Anna tells Gemma about Poor Tom overhearing their hate-sex through the paper-thin walls. “Gemma, I hate you,” says Simon, eyes burning with lust. She agrees that she loathes him too and they retire to the lounge to press themselves up against the glass doors. What follows is a sex scene that will long be talked about. It’s a carnival of face-shoving, finger-biting, wall-grabbing and at times, all-out wrestling. I love that shot of them at the end, together, apart, nude, at opposite sides of the dining room. Pure theatre. “I hate women sometimes,” says Anna, bitter that Gemma went back to her faithless bastard ex. She heard them through the front door. I wouldn’t be surprised if the whole cul-de-sac caught an earful. When Anna announces that she’s moving to Edinburgh for a fresh start, Gemma replies with the astonishingly egocentric, “He broke up your marriage to isolate me”. Swallowing down her fury, Anna rightly points out, “Every time it happens you are breaking your son a little bit more. Totally destroying him.” Poor Tom is not a chess piece. When will they both see this? The fallout from Tom’s meltdown in the cafe at his dad’s new office development is most telling of all. Gemma is distraught and gets to the bottom of Poor Tom’s latest problem by speaking to Isabel. Her reaction to her son’s behaviour at the wedding party, which amounts to sexual assault, is dismay but also understanding. Simon’s reaction is immediate embarrassment that his son has so publicly lost his cool and in his workplace too. The self-preservation impulse in this man overrides everything else. One word from Kate and Poor Tom is yesterday’s news. Gemma’s attempts to speak to Poor Tom ultimately end in him storming off, but not before he’s informed James, the world’s most patient teacher, that his new girlfriend (sort of) has already cheated on him with her ex. “They had sex again. Don’t trust her,” he hurls over his shoulder as James just stands there, gutted. Prognosis As son breaks with father and mother reunites with son, the episode ends with all parties back in their respective corners. Simon’s reaction to Gemma’s farewell message is muted. “You win. We’re gone,” it says, simply. But with two episodes to come, this is most certainly not the end of the story. Notes • Simon lies on the phone to Kate about where he is when “dining” with Gemma. And don’t forget, Kate still has Gemma’s mystery present, unbeknown to Simon. • Loved Gemma’s use of the water glass to take Simon back to their old family life. Her emotional digs are way more subtle and effective than his. • How long does it take to pack a transit, Neil? He seems to be there all day, loitering outside his marital home. Perhaps he’s doing several loads? Why not just book a bigger van? • I now realise I should have started a wine bottle count at the outset of episode one. The recycling budget on this series alone must be most of the license fee. • Poor Ros was very good about Gemma ditching her hen night. But then, Ros is the world’s least loyal friend so she had it coming."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"social-care-network/2017/sep/19/adult-social-care-crisis-political-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"social-care-network","sectionName":"Social Care Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T10:57:32Z","webTitle":"Adult social care is in crisis mode.

We need a clear long-term plan","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"This party conference season, all political parties will use their platforms to set out a post-election vision. Adult social care was one of the big general election issues, and the government has indicated that an adult social care green paper is likely next year. The next few months are critical for capturing the views of the public, the health and care sectors and charities working to support older people. At Future Care Capital, we have launched a new policy report about the challenges facing our ageing society and the implications for every generation. Addressing three key themes – intergenerational fairness and the economics of ageing, health and care futures, and planning ahead – we invited leaders from the public, private and third sectors to contribute. They considered how policies and spending decisions that impact health and care outcomes could better reflect the challenges and opportunities we can expect in the next five, 10 and 15 years. Our report also calls for a more concerted effort to in the short-term to adapt homes and public spaces for age and mobility, as well as recognition of the contribution of carers to the economy and measures to improve their work-life-care balance. What’s striking is the consensus that there is no long-term plan for health and adult social care and that the result is a growing care deficit. Our health and care services are facing a perfect storm; the country’s population is getting older and the number of care workers is insufficient to meet future demand. At the same time, 10% of people already identify as unpaid carers, which has implications for their work-life-care balance and the wider economy. Tackling the problem in isolation is not an option. The government needs to collaborate with communities, service commissioners and providers, and charities and innovators to forge a way forward. A new settlement for health and care or a “care covenant”, underpinned by our future care guarantees, could offer greater security to everyone. These guarantees call on the government to introduce a new funding formula for health and care services, to champion independent living by investing in pre-care measures and education to build a bigger care workforce. One key issue is a general lack of understanding among the public about the scope of state-funded adult social care services and who should pay for them. Some 67% of 16 to 75-year-olds agree that people should be required to plan and prepare financially for later life, while 49% agree they should have to plan and prepare financially for adult social care services they might need, according to a survey we conducted with Ipsos Mori. In addition, it found many people support a range of income tax rises to increase the amount of funding available for adult social care. Raising the additional rate from 45p to 50p was supported by 58% of those surveyed, increasing the higher rate from 40p to 43p by 57%, and half backed a raise in 1p of the basic rate. What’s more, 76% of those surveyed said increasing the number of health and social care workers would ease pressure on the system, and 71% thought that providing greater support for unpaid carers would be effective. Our ageing society represents one of the biggest human challenges of our time – every family is affected. We need political consensus on our direction of travel – a long-term plan to guide the policies of successive governments to improve health and care outcomes and enable people to plan ahead. Otherwise, we will remain in fire-fighting or crisis mode. The government’s forthcoming green paper affords it a prime opportunity to act now and build health and care provision fit for everyone in our society.

The truth shifts and eludes us. Reality is under assault. Even fiction is in a state of bewildering flux. In a fascinating interview last week, the novelist Attica Locke said: “When Trump was elected, I remember feeling: oh my God, overnight my book changed, and I didn’t alter a word.” Her book about murders carried out by the Aryan Brotherhood, she explained, had suddenly taken on new resonance. Meanwhile, dystopian science fiction has come to seem like a pale imitation of the Technicolor horrors of the new US regime. Classic novels, too, have taken on unexpected new shapes; I recently read Barnaby Rudge and was surprised to realise that this novel purporting to be about the Gordon riots of 1780 was actually a Brexit parable, warning against the dangers of demagogues and scapegoating outsiders. It even had stirring passages about the need for brave parliamentarians to stand up to the fury of the mob. It’s similarly hard to read Shame without thinking about our current situation. After all, it is a book about a corrupt class of billionaires and “badmashes” hellbent on distorting reality and attacking the rule of law: The legal system was dismantled, because the lawyers had demonstrated the fundamentally profane nature of their profession by objecting to divers activities of the state. Impossible to read that and not think of all the recent nonsense on both sides of the Atlantic about enemies of the people. And alongside such stark parallels, Shame even contains a play within a play about the way authoritarianism disrupts both fiction and truth. In a chapter titled Stability (yes, it’s ironic), the narrator tells us he has been visited by three people who have been enjoying the freedom of productions on the London stage and are prompted to compare that to theatre in their own country, Pakistan: They told me the story of a recent attempt to stage Julius Caesar … It seems that the authorities became very agitated when they heard that the script called for the assassination of a Head of State. What was more the production was to be in full modern dress … Extreme pressure was brought to bear on the University to scrap the production. But for the fact that this production wasn’t staged in Central Park and that the visitors weren’t from the US, it could be an almost direct account of the controversial production of the play this June, which sparked protests against the suited, Trump-like businessman in the role of the assassinated Roman politician. Reading that passage last week, I felt almost frightened; partly because of Rushdie’s prescience, but also because of the troubling thought that he may have been enjoying a flight of fancy, having fun with the self-evident silliness of anyone taking Shakespeare with such malicious literalism. Did part of the joke come from the presumption that that kind of absurdity could never really happen? Shame may be set in “not quite Pakistan” and Rushdie may call the novel a fairytale, but it has solid roots in reality. “If you’re going to use non-naturalistic elements in the novel, they have to grow out of a real vision,” he says, and in Shame, he gazes directly at the regimes of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Muhammad Zia ul-Haq (with an admixture of Iskander Mirza for good measure, not least in the characters Iskander Harrapa and Little Mir Harrapa). Back in 1983, the New York Times warned “many of the allusions to recent Pakistani history will be lost upon the average westerner”. Thirty-odd years later, I also spent plenty of my reading time worrying how much I was missing – and how much I might have missed even without the obscuring shadow of my own solipsism. But on the other hand, it didn’t feel as if that ignorance hindered my enjoyment. You don’t always have to get the point of the allegory to appreciate its power. Or indeed to be entertained and charmed by its cheerfully meandering narrator: Listen: you could have taken the whole quantity of sisterly love inside Good News Hyder, sealed it in an envelope and posted it anywhere in the world for one rupee airmail, that’s how much it weighed … where was I? But the really clever trick that Rushdie pulls off is to be both specific and universal. The more he talks about the specific problems of Pakistan, the more he talks about the particularities of human nature. It is easy to discern ourselves, now, as well as a distant country in the 1970s. Shame may be about a definite historical moment, but it still changes with the times – no matter how crazy they may be."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/19/julie-bishop-says-rohingya-must-be-protected-despite-cash-for-return-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T10:19:13Z","webTitle":"Julie Bishop says Rohingya must be protected despite 'cash for return’ policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/19/julie-bishop-says-rohingya-must-be-protected-despite-cash-for-return-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/19/julie-bishop-says-rohingya-must-be-protected-despite-cash-for-return-policy","fields":{"headline":"Julie Bishop says Rohingya must be protected despite 'cash for return’ policy","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australia’s foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, has insisted the international community must act to stop the lives of more Rohingya Muslims being put at risk in Myanmar but Australia is still encouraging Rohingya refugees held on Manus Island to return to the country, offering tens of thousands of dollars in inducements. In New York, where she is attending the United Nations general assembly, Bishop said at a multinational meeting of ministers there “was unanimity in the view that the violence must end and that there be a ceasefire”. “And we emphasised the need for humanitarian support to get through and also that the Rohingya must be able to return home.” Meanwhile the former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd has defended Aung San Suu Kyi’s failure to denounce ethnic cleansing, telling the ABC’s 7.30 on Tuesday that she was in a “total dilemma” because she could not control the military. Rudd said that Suu Kyi’s speech was being monitored by the Burmese military, which was “looking for any pretext to return to full military rule” and noted that she did not reject the allegation of ethnic cleansing. “I interpret the speech with a degree of more subtlety than perhaps others may read it,” he said. “[In effect she said] ‘I’m not repudiating what the Human Rights Commission said at all. I want to get to the bottom of this.’ The coded language is the military have run amok.” Rudd accepted that Suu Kyi “could’ve handled [the situation in Rakhine state] better”. “The bottom line is this, moral authority is one thing. He who controls the barrel of the gun in Myanmar is another.” Australia has pledged a further $15m in humanitarian support, particularly to Bangladesh, which is hosting those who are fleeing. More than 400,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar for neighbouring Bangladesh over the past month, fleeing a scorched earth campaign of violence by the Myanmarese army that has reportedly included summary executions, children being stabbed to death, homes torched with families locked inside and landmines laid ahead and behind of fleeing civilians. The Myanmarese military has described its actions as a “clearance operation” seeking out terrorists and Suu Kyi did not specifically condemn the military’s actions in a speech to diplomats in the capital Naypyidaw. “We too are concerned,” she said of the violence. “We want to find out what the real problems are. There have been allegations and counter-allegations. We have to listen to all of them.” Over the Naf river, which separates Myanmar from Bangladesh, a new humanitarian crisis looms in the country of refuge as hundreds of thousands live in makeshift camps without sufficient food, water and sanitation. But the Guardian revealed on Tuesday that – in the midst of Myanmar’s crisis –Australia was continuing to offer up to $25,000 to Rohingya refugees currently held in Papua New Guinea under Australia’s offshore processing asylum policy, as an inducement to abandon their protection claims and return home. Up to seven Rohingya men – some of whom have been recognised as refugees – have agreed to return. Australia’s immigration detention regime in PNG has been marked by violence, including murder, medical neglect leading to death, systemic mental health issues and suicide, harsh conditions and privation. “I don’t want to die in PNG. I prefer to die in Myanmar,” one of the men, Yahya Tabani, told the Guardian. “Probably Buddhist people are going to kill me as soon as I arrive in Myanmar … Australia doesn’t care if we live or we die.” He has been promised $25,000 by the Australian Border Force if he agrees to return to Myanmar. Australia’s encouragement of Rohingya repatriation has been condemned by human rights groups and aid agencies. “The Australian government is currently offering a financial incentive to Rohingya refugees imprisoned on Manus Island to return to Myanmar. We need to show compassion, halt this process and give them the right to settle here,” Marc Purcell, the head of the Australian Council for International Development, said. “Historically, the number of refugees Australia has resettled from Myanmar has been extremely low. We urge the Australian government to look at an increase to Australia’s humanitarian intake, with specific consideration to vulnerable people who have fled violence and persecution in Myanmar.” Amnesty International called on Australia bring an emergency intake of Rohingyan refugees into Australia. “The Australian government should end its hypocritical ‘cash for return’ policy for Rohingya people on Manus Island and Nauru,” Michael Hayworth, campaigns manager at Amnesty International Australia, said. “Offering Rohingyas money to return to a country where there is a current campaign of ethnic cleansing against them is unconscionable. “Despite strong statements against the violence of the Rohingya people by foreign minister Bishop, the recent record of Australia resettling Rohingyas has been nothing short of shameful, with only 37 resettled since 2013.” The director of the Edmund Rice Centre and president of the Refugee Council of Australia, Phil Glendenning, said the Australian government had a responsibility to ensure that people who had sought sanctuary in Australia were not returned to harm. “No reasonable person could claim that Myanmar is a safe place for Rohingya people at present,” he said. “The situation in Myanmar is absolutely appalling and has been described by the United Nations as ‘textbook ethnic cleansing’. “For the Australian government to even be contemplating deporting or removing Rohingya people back to Myanmar is not only a complete abrogation of our international obligations but also a complete denial of basic human decency. “Make no mistake, if these people are sent back to Myanmar at this point in history, the Australian government is playing fast and loose with their lives.” Bishop told Reuters earlier on Tuesday that she wanted to hear Suu Kyi offer a solution “to what is a tragedy of enormous proportions”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/20/turnbull-offers-queensland-power-station-funding-if-it-votes-lnp-in-state-poll","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T21:48:16Z","webTitle":"Turnbull offers Queensland power station funding if it votes LNP in state poll","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/20/turnbull-offers-queensland-power-station-funding-if-it-votes-lnp-in-state-poll","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/20/turnbull-offers-queensland-power-station-funding-if-it-votes-lnp-in-state-poll","fields":{"headline":"Turnbull offers Queensland power station funding if it votes LNP in state poll","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Malcolm Turnbull has added fuel to the electoral arms race for Queensland, hoping to woo the state with the promise of a new coal-fired power station – but only if it votes his way in the upcoming state election. With speculation in Canberra mounting that the Labor premier will shortly call an election in Queensland, the prime minister will head to the state on Wednesday, missing his rival Bill Shorten by just hours. The opposition leader just wrapped up a two-day visit to the sunshine state selling Labor’s $1bn tourism plan, flying out as Turnbull flies in. But where the opposition leader sought to better promote one of the state’s best features – its endless sunshine – Turnbull is focused on energy, vowing north Queensland will receive a new power station under his government, if the LNP leader, Tim Nicholls, pulls off an election win. “I’ve been talking to Tim Nicholls, who I hope will be the next premier of Queensland, about the potential for a new advanced high-efficient low-emission power station,” Turnbull told 4BC radio on Tuesday. “If Tim becomes premier, and the state decides to build one. “Obviously there is a substantial amount of funds in our northern Australia infrastructure fund, that is available for infrastructure. A power station ticks that box. It is definitely infrastructure. “It would be completely depend on an LNP state government, because Annastacia Palaszczuk, for reasons she could perhaps explain, is absolutely opposed to any further investment in coal-fired energy in Queensland, despite the fact Queensland has enormous coal resources it is exporting to the world.” The NAIF, the jewel in Tony Abbott’s plan to see northern Australia become an “economic powerhouse”, is administered by an independent body which has access to $5bn in concessional loans. The structure of the fund keeps the $5bn off the government’s books, with the government only accountable for monies lent. So far, the fund has approved no projects, prompting a rethink on how it is used. The focus on Queensland by both federal leaders underscores the importance of the state where at least 11 federal electorates are considered to be in play. Turnbull, making sure to mention it was his 11th visit to the state this year, plans on spending his time with some of his more popular MPs, including Brisbane’s Trevor Evans, who bucked the trend in the last election and increased the party’s margin, despite replacing a retiring member. Shorten, who has made more than 15 visits to the state this year, headed north, where he discussed infrastructure, jobs and investment in new industries, concentrating on areas that continue to exceed the nation’s unemployment average as the resources slowdown continues to bite. Pauline Hanson also took advantage of the break in Canberra proceedings to head straight to her home state, selling her message in the south-east before a $995 a-head fundraiser – which lands just under the state’s $1,000 donation disclosure law. All eyes are on George Street, where Palaszczuk will make the decision on when to hold the election, widely tipped for either November or February. But a boundary redistribution, an additional four seats, the introduction of compulsory preferential voting and the resurgence of One Nation have complicated matters. Neither major party is seen as guaranteed to win the now-necessary 47 seats needed for power in the unicameral parliament. Queensland is considered the state to win at the next federal election. Both major parties are convinced a victory in the north will pave the way to Canberra."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/19/beyonce-vinyl-lemonade-canada-punk-band-zex-manufacturing-error","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T08:31:41Z","webTitle":"Vinyl version of Beyoncé's Lemonade filled with punk songs after factory error","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/19/beyonce-vinyl-lemonade-canada-punk-band-zex-manufacturing-error","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/19/beyonce-vinyl-lemonade-canada-punk-band-zex-manufacturing-error","fields":{"headline":"Vinyl version of Beyoncé's Lemonade filled with punk songs after factory error","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Beyoncé fans have waited months for her 2016 album Lemonade to be available on vinyl – but some were dismayed to find a Canadian punk band playing on their copies instead of her.

Not pretty to look at, but gratifyingly reassuring to eat. It’s not hard to remove the skin from a clutch of chicken thighs, and you can fry it to make chicken crackling to be crunched as it is, or splintered into a salad. Do not even think about using boneless thigh fillets. Serves four to six. 300g leeks (trimmed weight), cut into approximately 3cm logs 300g carrots, peeled and cut into chunky batons 300g parsnips, peeled and cut into very chunky batons 175g pearl barley 6 chicken thighs, bone in and skin off 1.5 litres hot chicken stock 4 tsp English mustard 1 small (approximately 25g) bunch flat-leaf parsley, picked and roughly chopped Tip the prepared vegetables into a heavy-based casserole for which you have a lid, then add the barley and chicken. Pour the stock into a jug, stir in the mustard, then pour this over the contents of the pan. Bring to a boil – this is when better-behaved cooks would tell you to skim off the frothy bits that rise to the top but, frankly, I’m too lazy to – then turn down the heat, partially cover and let simmer for an hour, though check every now and again to make sure it’s not bubbling away too much or dolefully not enough, giving a stir as you do so. If it looks as if it’s boiling dry, pour in a little boiling water. Once the hour’s up, the barley, vegetables and chicken should be tender and the juices all but absorbed. Not that a little soupiness would be the end of the world. Remove from the heat and let stand with the lid off for 10 minutes. If you haven’t used skinless thighs, remove and discard the chicken skin. Using a couple of forks, pull the meat off the bones, and discard the bones (my particular treat is to chew the cartilage off them before chucking them away, but it’s not to everyone’s taste). Throw in some of the parsley and stir it through the stew, and put the rest on the table for people to sprinkle over their own bowls as they eat. It probably goes without saying that if you’re feeding small children, predisposed to be pernickety about Green Bits, you would be ill-advised to stir any parsley into the stew. Golden egg curry This magnificent addition to my eating life comes courtesy of Yasmin Othman, and I glow with gratitude every time I eat it. Called masak lemak telur in Malaysian, it’s very far removed from the egg curries of my early youth. What we have here are eggs poached in a rich, aromatic, turmeric-tinted, tamarind-sharp, coconutty sauce or soup. It has definite heat, but not eye-wateringly so. If you’d like it a bit milder, do not pierce the three whole chillies. And if you’d like it a lot milder, deseed the finger chilli for the paste, and dispense with the whole ones in the soup. But even if, like me, you love fiery food, I don’t advise eating the whole chillies. I won’t stop you, but you have been warned. Serves two. 2 green chillies, deseeded and roughly chopped 4 green finger chillies, 1 roughly chopped, 3 left whole 150g shallots (about 5 small round ones), peeled and roughly chopped 2 fat cloves garlic, peeled and roughly chopped 25g fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped 15g fresh turmeric, peeled and roughly chopped (or 1 tsp ground) 2 tbsp vegetable oil 1 stalk lemongrass, trimmed and bruised 400ml coconut milk (ie 1 tin) 100ml water from a freshly boiled kettle 2 tsp sea salt flakes 2 tsp tamarind paste 4 large eggs, at room temperature To serve Rice or flatbreads (or both) With a stick blender, blitz the two green chillies, roughly chopped whole finger chilli, shallots, garlic, ginger and turmeric to a paste. Heat the oil in a heavy-based wok, or a pan of similarly wide diameter, that has a lid. Add the paste and lemongrass, and fry gently, stirring frequently, for five minutes, by which time the paste will be cooked and softened. Don’t use a wooden spoon here, or use one you don’t mind being stained by the turmeric. Add the coconut milk, water, salt and tamarind. Make a couple of little incisions in each of the whole finger chillies with the point of a small, sharp knife and drop them in, too. Turn the heat up to bring to a near boil, then reduce the heat again and simmer gently for about seven minutes, stirring frequently, until the sauce has reduced to a thick, golden soup. Crack the eggs into the sauce (if you’re cautious, crack each of them into a cup first), cover with a lid and leave to simmer very gently for about four minutes, until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny; cook for longer if you want well-cooked yolks. You’ll have to lift the lid to monitor how the eggs are doing. Divide between two bowls, trying to spoon out most of the sauce from the pan first. Serve with rice, dippable flatbreads or both. Carrots and fennel with harissa This has perfectly balanced oomph: the sweetness of carrots, the herbal freshness of fennel, the mellow citrus tang of satsuma (though the zest of half an orange and two tablespoons of juice would do) and the aromatic heat of harissa. Serves four to six. 500g carrots, peeled and cut into approximately 4cm-long batons 500g fennel, trimmed, cut in half from top to bottom, then into approximately 1cm-thick slices 2 tbsp harissa 2 tbsp regular olive oil 1 satsuma, zest finely grated, and juiced to get 2 tbsp 1 tsp sea salt flakes, or to taste Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Put the carrots and fennel in a large bowl. Add the harissa, oil, satsuma zest and juice, and a teaspoon of sea salt flakes, and toss to combine. Tip everything into a shallow roasting tin, scraping out the bowl well, and give it a final toss to mix. Spread out in the tin and roast for 40-50 minutes, giving it a stir after 30, until the carrot is just cooked through and the fennel soft. Taste, and add more salt (or not) as desired. Slow-roast five-spice lamb with Chinese pancakes Some friends told me about a year ago that they’d gone to a Chinese restaurant and, rather than having duck in pancakes, they’d had soft, shredded lamb instead. I became obsessed. I thought about it constantly. I endlessly imagined what it had tasted like. I dreamt of it. Enough! I just I had to cook it. I did. And then I didn’t stop. I think by now I could stir up the five-spice mixture and get this in the oven in my sleep. But then, it is very, very easy. Of course, I don’t make my own Chinese pancakes. For that matter, I’m told Chinese restaurants don’t either. Though please don’t feel confined to eating the lamb this way; it’s good bundled into lettuce wraps, too. And I wouldn’t rest easy in myself if I didn’t tell you as well that the spiced, sweet and tangy meat – consider it pulled lamb – is also divine squished warm into bread rolls. Last of all, any leftovers are great with rice, along with the cooking juices I’ve kept expressly for this purpose. Serves four to six. About 1.5kg lamb shoulder, bone-in 1 tbsp finely grated fresh ginger 4 tsp Chinese five-spice 3 tbsp rice-wine vinegar 2 tbsp soy sauce 3 tbsp honey To serve (see recipe introduction, too) About 20 Chinese rice pancakes or iceberg lettuce, separated into leaves to use as wraps Hoisin sauce Spring onions, cut into thin strips Cucumber, cut into thin strips Take the lamb out of the fridge for about an hour to come to room temperature, and heat the oven to 170C/335F/gas mark 3. Line a roasting tin in which the lamb will sit snugly with a large piece of foil big enough to wrap around it. Place another large piece of foil on top, but in the opposite way to the first, giving you four ends of foil ready to make a parcel for your lamb. Mix together the ginger, five-spice, vinegar, soy sauce and two tablespoons of the honey. Lay the lamb skin-side down on the foil-lined tin, and slash into the flesh with a sharp knife. Pour about half the spice mixture over it, and massage it in well (you might want to think of wearing CSI gloves for this), then turn over the lamb, slash the skin side and pour the rest of the spice mixture over, again massaging a little to get into the meat. Bring up the sides of the foil, to make a loose parcel, scrunch together to seal tightly, then roast for three and a half hours. Remove the tin from the oven, unwrap the foil, pulling down the sides, so you can spoon or ladle the juices into a bowl or jug; this is quite a boring job, but not a hard one. (Set the juices aside. Once they’re cold, refrigerate, then remove the fat. You can warm up the juices to reheat any leftover meat to eat with rice later.) Pour the remaining honey over the lamb, and put back in the oven, uncovered, for 20 minutes, by which time it will have a barbecue-blackened, soft crust. Let it stand out of the oven for 10 minutes. Shred the meat – I use a couple of serving forks – and transfer to a warmed wide bowl or platter. Eat in Chinese pancakes or lettuce wraps, with some hoisin sauce and strips of spring onion and cucumber. Ginger and walnut carrot cake This is very different from the richly sweet, loftily layered and aerated American original. While it is in some senses far more reminiscent of an old-fashioned, slightly rustic English teatime treat, it is, with its ginger-spiked cream cheese icing (only on top, not running through the middle as well) just right to bring to the table, in pudding guise, at the end of dinner, too. Before you chop the amber dice of crystallised ginger, rub the cubes between your fingers to remove excess sugar. Then chop them finely, though not obsessively: you want small nuggets, not a jammy clump. And, for what it’s worth, I find it easier to crumble up the walnuts with my fingers, rather than chopping them on a board. You’ll need a 20cm springform cake tin. Cuts into eight to 12 slices. For the cake 200g plain flour 1 tsp baking powder ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda 2 tsp ground ginger ¼ tsp fine sea salt 175g soft light brown sugar 2 large eggs, at room temperature 200ml vegetable oil, plus more for greasing 200g carrots, peeled and coarsely grated 100g walnut pieces, roughly chopped or crumbled 75g crystallised ginger, finely chopped For the icing 100g soft unsalted butter 100g icing sugar, sieved if lumpy 1 tsp corn flour 100g full-fat cream cheese, fridge-cold 1 tbsp coarsely grated fresh ginger To decorate 25g walnut pieces, roughly chopped or crumbled 25g crystallised ginger, finely chopped Heat the oven to 170c/335F/gas mark 3. Grease the sides and line the base of a 20cm springform cake tin with baking parchment. Put the flour, baking powder, bicarb, ground ginger and salt into a large bowl and mix with a fork. Beat the sugar, eggs and oil in another large bowl until completely mixed together, then gradually add the flour mixture, scraping the bowl to rescue and incorporate any flour clinging to the edges. At this stage, the mixture may seem alarmingly stiff, but the carrots will loosen it up. So, beat in the carrots, then fold in 100g prepared walnuts and 75g crystallised ginger, until everything is evenly combined. Spoon and scrape into the prepared cake tin. Don’t worry if it looks as if you haven’t got nearly enough batter, because the cake will rise well as it bakes. Smooth the top and pop in the oven (this is when to make the icing: see the next step) for 45–55 minutes. When it’s ready, the cake will be set and golden brown on top, beginning to shrink away from the edges of the tin, and a cake tester will come out with just a few crumbs stuck to it. Transfer to a wire rack and leave to cool in its tin. As soon as the cake’s in the oven, get on with the icing. Beat together the butter and icing sugar and, when creamily combined, beat in the corn flour, followed by half the cream cheese. Once that’s incorporated, beat in the remaining half. Be careful at all times not to over-beat or the icing will get too runny. Starting with the grated ginger on a plate, get out a piece of kitchen roll and, moving quickly, spoon the grated ginger into the centre, bring up the edges of the paper, holding them together to form a little swag bag, and press on it over the bowl to squeeze out the intense ginger juice. Beat this into the frosting bowl. Cover with cling-film and refrigerate. When the cake is completely cold, take the icing out of the fridge for about 20 minutes, by which time it will have softened to a still thick but spreadable consistency. Beat briefly to help this along and make sure it’s smooth. Unclip and release the cake from its tin, unmoulding it, and sit it on a cake stand or plate. Spread the frosting on top, swirling it a little, then sprinkle the chopped walnuts and ginger on top. • These recipes are an edited extract from At My Table: A Celebration Of Home Cooking, by Nigella Lawson, published this week by Chatto &amp; Windus at £26.

She has fibromyalgia, and has made a Netflix documentary, Gaga: Five Foot Two, to raise awareness about this long-term condition. A statement says: “She plans to spend the next seven weeks proactively working with her doctors to heal from this and past traumas that still affect her daily life and result in severe physical pain in her body. She wants to give her fans the best version of the show she built for them when the tour resumes.” We’ve all heard of Lady Gaga, but fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) may be more of a mystery. It is a condition that is hard to diagnose, explain or treat. And many people with the condition say they struggle to get medical professionals to take their symptoms seriously. FMS is a long-term condition that causes widespread pain. Its debilitating symptoms include extreme tiredness, muscle aches, difficulty sleeping and concentrating; headaches and bloating are also common. In Lady Gaga’s case, it is easy to see how she may have initially put these problems down to touring and performing. But the fatigue and pains persist even when you rest, and can be far more draining than normal tiredness. People with FMS often notice that a fairly innocuous injury, such as stubbing a toe, hurts more intensely and for longer than it should. And even a light touch that shouldn’t hurt at all can be experienced as an unpleasantly painful sensation. The fatigue means you need to sleep a lot but wake up feeling groggy, stiff and achy. Even mental processes feel sluggish, so it becomes a huge effort to concentrate or learn anything new, and your speech may sound slow and a bit muddled. Patients call this “fibro-fog”, and it is not clear whether Lady Gaga experiences it or not. FMS is typically diagnosed in people just like Lady Gaga: female and aged 30-50 (she is 31). It may affect as many as one in 20 people, but there is no definitive test, so it is hard to estimate numbers. There may also be a genetic component alongside environmental factors. FMS is certainly diagnosed more often now than when it was first recognised as a cause of chronic and disabling pain in 1976. It can coexist with other conditions that cause joint pain, including rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. And although you may think that, since there is no cure, there is no point in receiving the diagnosis, people who live with pain and multiple unexplained symptoms over many years often find that being told they have FMS is helpful. Diagnosis rests on a history of widespread pain and pressure points. An examiner prods you in 18 places (with enough pressure to blanche the examiner’s fingernail). If 11 out of the 18 points are unusually tender, it supports the diagnosis. No one knows what causes FMS. There is probably some disorder in the way pain is processed in the brain in people with the condition. And there is a cycle in which pain makes you depressed and anxious and this makes the experience of pain worse. Sceptics may say “it’s all in the mind” but all pain is processed in the brain, so that sort of disparaging and dismissive remark makes no sense. There is some suggestion that FMS is more common among people who have suffered from physical, emotional and sexual abuse in childhood; the evidence is weak, but this is an area that needs more study. Lady Gaga has been very open about being raped at the age of 19 and her anti-rape song, Swine, hints at the trauma she experienced. As there is no specific cure, living with FMS means being aware of triggers (stress, bereavement, other illnesses or surgery, weather changes, travel and sleep deprivation, for instance) that can cause a flare-up, and finding a way of living, working, exercising and eating that works for you. Exercise, physiotherapy, adjustments in the workplace, counselling and stress management techniques can help. Drug treatment with anti-inflammatories, antidepressants and drugs used in the treatment of epilepsy have all been tried, but there is no single easy fix. But Lady Gaga – and her millions of fans – may take heart from the fact that, however bad the symptoms are, FMS does not cause long-term joint damage and many people do get better over time. However, you cannot predict how long recovery may take, or whether symptoms will recur, so it is hard to know when she might feel ready to commit to touring again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/21/how-to-make-the-perfect-no-bake-cheesecake","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T08:00:28Z","webTitle":"How to make the perfect no-bake cheesecake","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/21/how-to-make-the-perfect-no-bake-cheesecake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/21/how-to-make-the-perfect-no-bake-cheesecake","fields":{"headline":"How to make the perfect no-bake cheesecake","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When I was growing up in the 80s, cheesecake came in two varieties: half defrosted from a Sara Lee packet – for special occasions – or served (not quite often enough) in enormous refrigerated slabs at school. Both were topped with a vividly gloopy fruits-of-the-forest mix, but, where Sara’s was dense and painfully sweet, even to my eight-year-old palate, the redoubtable school meals supervisors, with their customary deft hands in the pudding department, always nailed the dish. I have no idea what they put in it (although the biscuit base may have been cobbled together from staffroom scraps), but, to this day, I have a fatal weakness for the set cheesecake over the far older baked variety. If I’m never allowed into the baked cheesecake’s spiritual home of New York again, in consequence, it will be well worth it. Even though the silky fridge cake is certainly quicker and easier to make than its fluffy cousin, it’s surprisingly hard to achieve the perfect combination of rich-but-not-overly-so topping, while keeping the base satisfyingly crunchy. And, believe me, I have tried. What is the secret to this cheat’s cheesecake? The base Let’s start at the bottom. Most set cheesecakes, whether made by Sara Lee or school cooks, have a base made from crushed biscuits – usually graham crackers in the US and digestive biscuits here. But the pastry chef Stella Parks disagrees, on the basis that “an unbaked graham cracker crust tastes a little blah”. Even without the “nutty, toasty flavours that develop in the oven, Biscoff cookies add a welcome depth of flavour”. Biscoff (the intensely sweet, spiced Belgian biscuits often handed out with a cup of coffee) are considerably easier to get hold of in this country than graham crackers, but testers find them too sugary and, once reduced to crumbs, deficient in the crisp-snap department. In place of the elusive grahams in Martha Stewart’s recipe, I try a mixture of malted milk (for flavour) and rich tea (for texture). The consistency of the base is good – better, in fact, than the digestive used by Sophie Grigson, which feel slightly bland and soft in comparison – but the panel’s faith in cheesecake convention is swayed by Yotam Ottolenghi’s hazelnut and black sesame crumble (which he scatters on top of the cheese and fruit rather than underneath) and the crunchy nests of kadaif pastry used by Sarit Packer and Itamar Srulovich in the book Honey &amp; Co. Kadaif (if, like me, you’d never heard of it) is like shredded filo; mixed with butter and a little sugar and then baked, it becomes incredibly crisp and light, almost like a bird’s nest. It’s the perfect counterpoint to rich dairy and sweet fruit. The problem is that these two maverick bases have to go on top, rather than beneath, the filling, and I’m not bold enough to advocate a deconstructed cheesecake as the perfect version. Also, kadaif is not the easiest ingredient to get hold of. I ponder the problem for some time before hitting on a perfect, if less glamorous, substitute: cornflakes. Crisper and lighter than biscuits, as any five-year-old baker will attest, they remain aggressively crunchy when mixed with butter and sugar (or golden syrup for interest’s sake) – and become pretty damn delicious, too. Following advice online (cornflake crusts were once all the rage in the US) I experiment with whizzing them to smithereens before use, but the overwhelming preference is for larger, crunchier flakes which feel less dense than biscuit crumbs, while still providing solid foundations for the entire enterprise. After some experimentation I can confirm that, although you can make a decent base without heat, a brief blast in an oven gives a more robust result that’s easier to lift out of the tin without crumbling – either way, make sure you press the flakes well into the tin to bind them together as much as possible. The cheese Cream cheese is the classic topping, mixed with double cream by Parks, Ottolenghi and Honey &amp; Co, single and whipping cream by Grigson and condensed milk by Stewart. Ottolenghi also whips in some mascarpone, and the Honeys use the kind of soft, salty feta style cheese sold in tins in Middle Eastern food shops. The condensed milk is disqualified because it makes the topping cloyingly sweet – and cream in all its forms feels ridiculously rich. Mascarpone is beautifully smooth and silky, but, again, makes the topping a bit too dense and buttery. The feta wins hearts for the subtle saline quality it brings to the party, but loses technical points for its slight graininess and lack of general availability. We decide that something lighter would be a better balance. Mild, milky ricotta proves happy to take on the best-supporting role to the cream cheese: the resulting filling won’t be as smooth as the cream variety, but neither will it be as heavy or cloying – a trade-off I’m willing to make for the sake of being able to enjoy a larger slice. On the subject of cream cheese, after this week’s experimentation I would stress that not all varieties are created equal, so, if you can, seek out some that’ is less sloppy and more interesting than the Kraft sort. There are some excellent Breton varieties available in some supermarkets, and no doubt some lovely local ones being made around the country. The better it tastes, the better your cheesecake will. Flavouring and setting Because cream cheeses vary in flavour, it’s impossible to be precise about the level of seasoning required, but it may be useful to know that honey is more popular than sugar, and lemon wins more fans than vanilla. There’s no reason you can’t use both if you so desire (or indeed any other essence, spice or sweetener that springs to mind). That said, I’d be careful of chopped fresh fruit because the strawberries in Grigson’s recipe leak quite a lot of juice into the filling. Save that for the top. If you’re looking to transport the cheesecake any distance, then consider setting it with gelatine as Grigson suggests, but otherwise a fridge should do the trick while keeping it vegetarian-friendly. (The slightly wobbly jellied texture that gelatine brings isn’t to everyone’s taste, so if you do use it, consider adding a beaten egg white as Grigson does, to create a moussey effect.) Topping Again, the blank creamy canvas allows a certain amount of latitude when it comes to topping – you can go fancy and make a greengage compote and an infused olive oil to drizzle on top, as Ottolenghi recommends; or a honey syrup and roasted almond and herb sprinkle, as the Honeys do. You can, like Grigson, even make a strawberry sauce but I’m with Parks: all you need here is a generous scattering of fruit. Plums, figs and berries are all good at the moment – and of course, frozen fruits of the forest mix is always in season. Perfect no-bake cheesecake 60g butter 3 tbsp golden syrup or caster sugar 1/4 tsp salt 100g cornflakes 500g ricotta, drained 225g good cream cheese 4 tbsp honey, or to taste, or 50g caster sugar 1 unwaxed lemon Fresh fruit, to top Heat the oven to 180C and lightly grease a roughly 23cm loose-bottomed tart tin. Melt the butter and stir in the syrup or sugar and salt. Roughly bash the cornflakes to break them up slightly and then stir in the butter and syrup and press the cornflakes firmly into the base of the tin with a glass or similar. Bake for six minutes until golden and then allow to cool completely. Meanwhile, drain the ricotta and then beat into the cream cheese until smooth (this is most easily done with a food processor if you have one). Add honey, plus the finely grated zest of the lemon and the juice of half of it, then taste and adjust as necessary. (I also like to add another pinch of salt, but you may not.) Spoon on top of the cooled base and chill for at least two hours until firm, then top with fruit to serve. Set cheesecakes: the poor relation of the baked variety, or an underrated dessert in their own right? What’s your favourite flavour, which cream cheese gives the best results – and is it really true that Ritz crackers make the best graham cracker substitute?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/20/not-even-des-haslers-successes-at-bulldogs-insulated-him-from-his-failings","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T18:00:24Z","webTitle":"Not even Des Hasler’s successes with Bulldogs insulated him from his failings | Nick Tedeschi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/20/not-even-des-haslers-successes-at-bulldogs-insulated-him-from-his-failings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/20/not-even-des-haslers-successes-at-bulldogs-insulated-him-from-his-failings","fields":{"headline":"Not even Des Hasler’s successes at Bulldogs insulated him from his failings","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"He arrived in 2011 hot off a premiership win at Manly and hailed as a white knight but six years later Des Hasler leaves Belmore as one of the most unpopular figures in club history. After dillying and dallying for a year – even extending his contract for two seasons just five months back – the Bulldogs finally moved on Hasler, axing him on Tuesday night. Hasler’s sacking follows a virtual revolt at Belmore where former players and fans alike were outraged by his conservative and outdated attacking style, his belligerent refusal to accept the notion that change was necessary, his refusal to even attempt to recognise the unique cultural norms, his questionable return on some pricey recruitment decisions, his allowing popular players Josh Reynolds and James Graham to leave and his steadfast dismissal of players from NSW Cup down as potential first grade products. With board elections just around the corner, the timing of Hasler’s sacking comes as no surprise. With CEO Raelene Castle forced out mid-season, chairman Ray Dib had no other sacrificial lamb. The winds turned on Hasler late in 2016 and by mid-2017 his popularity at Belmore had fallen through the floor. With each ugly loss – and while the losses were numerous the ugliness in style engulfed nearly the entire season – anger turned to outrage and outrage turned to mutiny. Even his relative success couldn’t save him – from the mob, or the board. In six seasons Hasler took Canterbury to two grand finals and five finals campaigns. His win rate of 56.6% was good. He is the only coach in the last six seasons to have a winning record over Craig Bellamy, arguably the greatest coach in premiership history. Expectations are high at Belmore. They are higher for outsiders and Hasler is the first mentor the Bulldogs have hired who didn’t play in the blue and white since Warren Ryan three decades back. Alas, even Hasler’s successes could not insulate him from his self-wrought failings. Even his most ardent supporters struggled to defend some of his recruitment and retention calls. Tony Williams will go down as one of the most expensive flops in Canterbury history. Michael Ennis went on to win a premiership at Cronulla two years after he was forced out of the Bulldogs while his replacement Michael Lichaa is set to be released after being unable to hold his top grade spot this year. Will Hopoate was signed and allowed to avoid playing on Sundays. Aaron Woods and Kieran Foran were signed to huge deals when the Bulldogs were firstly in salary cap trouble and secondly in the running to sign James Tedesco, a player with the upside to be the best in the premiership. A club that has long been reliant on local juniors and pathways for early talent identification, under Hasler the Bulldogs became a buy first, buy second and buy third club. Very few youngsters got a chance. Even those who did break through, such as Dale Finucane, were forced to leave, not fitting into Hasler’s system. Hasler’s system, of course, was very much at the crux of where it all went wrong. What worked in 2012 no longer worked in 2016 and 2017 but Hasler refused to change, offering an attack that was as conservative as it was predictable, as confusing to his own players to grasp as it was simple for opponents to shut down. His stubborn refusal to adapt infuriated those forced to endure the methodical ugliness week in and week out. At the end of the day though, it was Hasler’s inability to recognise Canterbury’s history or value the importance of culture that undid him. The Bulldogs expect success but more importantly they expect values of toughness, professionalism and pride to be displayed. They saw very little of any over the last two seasons as a once-proud club disintegrated. Getting arguably the club’s two biggest legends – and perhaps two most amiable blokes – in Terry Lamb and Steve Mortimer offside only highlighted Hasler’s modus operandi that it was his way or the high way and to hell with the collateral damage. He simply didn’t seem to value the culture of Belmore, built by Lamb and Mortimer and Peter Moore and Chris Anderson and Steve Price and the Hughes boys and Hazem El Masri and so many more. The search begins now for both the Bulldogs and Hasler. Former Souths coach Michael Maguire and Canberra assistant Dean Pay have both been strongly linked, as has Manly coach Trent Barrett. Pay is the only former Canterbury player among the trio and after the failed Hasler experiment the Bulldogs will almost certainly revert to type and bring in one of their own. For Hasler, the Titans remain a chance but after a healthy payout, a year on the sidelines and being linked to every potential job is probably his best prospect. He might be gone but the bitterness will still remain at Belmore as long as the Bulldogs are lumped with salary cap problems and languishing in the bottom half of the table. The Hasler years will not be remembered with any great fanfare at Canterbury, that’s for sure and certain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/19/ringo-starr-great-drummer-the-beatles-genius","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T11:20:17Z","webTitle":"In defence of Ringo Starr – a masterful drummer and the Beatles' unsung genius","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/19/ringo-starr-great-drummer-the-beatles-genius","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/19/ringo-starr-great-drummer-the-beatles-genius","fields":{"headline":"In defence of Ringo Starr – a masterful drummer and the Beatles' unsung genius","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In 1983, the British comedian Jasper Carrott made an unhelpful contribution to Beatles legend when he coined a joke that would go down in history: “Ringo isn’t the best drummer in the world,” he quipped. “He isn’t even the best drummer in the Beatles.” It resonated, to the extent that it entered into Beatles lore as the wisdom of John Lennon. That was eventually debunked by Beatles expert Mark Lewisohn – but the misrepresentation says a great deal about the public’s perception of Ringo Starr: a non-musician who got lucky, a journeyman alongside three musical geniuses. This is total nonsense. Ringo, whose new album Give More Love has just come out, wasn’t just the funniest Beatle, the life and soul of those early press conferences; and he wasn’t just the best drummer in the Beatles. He was the best drummer for the Beatles. This is a vital distinction to make. His beats may not have had the furious technical clarity of Led Zeppelin’s John Bonham, say, or the phenomenal precision of James Brown’s drummer, Clyde Stubblefield. But what he had was perfect for the Beatles, where Bonham would have been too showy and Stubblefield too tight. Most drummers recognise this. “Define ‘best drummer in the world’,” Dave Grohl said in a tribute video for Starr’s Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame presentation. “Is it someone that’s technically proficient? Or is it someone that sits in the song with their own feel? Ringo was the king of feel.” What this means is that many of Ringo’s best performances go unnoticed. These are beats designed to enhance the song rather than show off the drummer’s abilities. Take She Loves You, the song that kicked off Beatlemania. Ringo’s brief introductory tom roll is the shot of adrenaline that gets the heart of the song thumping; it is teen mania in sound, and one of the most important drum rolls in recorded music history. On Can’t Buy Me Love, Ringo’s drumming is the primal force that drives the song’s hormonal energy, all whipcrack snare and floor-tom bombast, wrapped up in Ringo’s signature sound: a wall-of-sound hi-hat thrash that sounds like five drummers at once. His drumming here is not complicated but – as numerous live versions of the song attest – it is lethally exact with not a note out of place, giving the lie to the notion, repeated by John Lennon in a 1980 Playboy interview, that Ringo was “not technically good” as a drummer. Another criticism of Ringo is that he wasn’t a creative god like the other Beatles. He didn’t write the songs and he wasn’t a studio genius like producer George Martin, who helped to mould Lennon, McCartney and Harrison’s tunes into something spectacular. Again, this is nonsense. Octopus’s Garden may not put Ringo into the songwriters hall of fame, but his drumming helped to shape countless Beatles classics, bringing personality and life to them. Consider Tomorrow Never Knows, one of the most influential Beatles songs. How would it sound without Ringo’s beautifully lopsided breakbeat, his unexpected twitching snare pattern emphasising the song’s feel of psychedelic discombobulation? How would Strawberry Fields Forever feel without Ringo’s fantastically weary tom fills, which seems to drag the listener down into Lennon’s nostalgia? Some people consider Ringo to be a terrible drummer because he doesn’t play solos. But who, apart from other drummers, really enjoys a solo? Ringo knew this and for years resisted all attempts to get him to play them, eventually giving in for the 15-second break on Abbey Road’s The End. It’s not flashy or difficult, but it has an understated funky charm and when it turned up on Beastie Boys’ The Sounds of Science 20 years later, it was hard to resist a smile. In fact The Sounds of Science, which also borrows Ringo’s strident drum beat from Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Heart’s Club Band (Reprise), shows just how funky Ringo’s drums could be when recontextualised. One producer who understood this well was Danger Mouse, whose 2004 release The Grey Album married Jay-Z’s The Black Album to the Beatles’ LP The Beatles to wonderful effect. Ringo’s breakbeats are a key tool in making the album fly, whether chopped up for their unique timbre or used straight for their head-down funk. The Chemical Brothers also borrowed the shape of the Tomorrow Never Knows beat for both Setting Sun and Let Forever Be, while J Dilla sampled Starr’s 1974 solo song Occapella on In the Streets. Other Ringo solo songs that prove the funk didn’t end when the Beatles split include the lolling glam funk of Back Off Boogaloo, the irresistible disco-ish stomp of Oh My My and the rolling percussive waves of It Don’t Come Easy, which has the added bonus of supporting an absolutely fantastic tune.

The eyewall of the hurricane barrelled into Dominica’s eastern coast on Monday evening, crossing towards the former British colony’s capital, Roseau, on the south-west side. The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said the “major hurricane” was producing maximum sustained winds of 155 miles per hour and would strengthen further over the next two days, remaining “extremely dangerous” as it approaches the British Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. The NHC warned Hurricane Maria could produce a “dangerous storm surge accompanied by large and destructive waves” that would raise water levels by as much as 9ft (2.7 metres) as it approached approached the French territory of Guadeloupe, the base for relief operations for several islands devastated by Irma this month.

Ken Clarke warned Johnson to stop taking advantage of the party’s situation after the foreign secretary wrote a newspaper article that some have interpreted as a leadership bid. He used the article to repeat his discredited claim that Britain will claw back £350m a week after leaving the EU. “Sounding off personally in this way is totally unhelpful and he shouldn’t exploit the fact that [Theresa May] hasn’t got a majority in parliament,” Clarke said on Tuesday. “And he knows perfectly well that, normally, a foreign secretary would be sacked instantly for doing that.” He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the prime minister was not in a position to sack Johnson, but said the foreign secretary should keep his views on the Brexit negotiations to the confines of private discussions with cabinet colleagues, rather than airing them in public. Johnson, a prominent figure in the leave campaign during the referendum, set off a fresh row over the government’s approach to Brexit by claiming at the weekend that, “once we have settled our accounts, we will take back control of roughly £350m per week”. Vote Leave made the claim central to its campaign last year, despite it being discredited then and since. The repeated invocation of it led to a public argument between Johnson and the head of the UK Statistics Authority, Sir David Norgrove, who accused the foreign secretary of a “clear misuse of official statistics”. Johnson in turn accused Norgrove of a “wilful distortion of the text of my article”. A Labour member of the public administration and constitutional affairs committee has since asked that the committee summon Johnson and Norgrove to give evidence over their dispute. Johnson was accused of making life more difficult for the UK’s Brexit negotiating team with his 4,000-word article, which was not cleared by Downing Street. During a visit to Canada on Monday, May dismissed Johnson’s claim and said: “This government is driven from the front, and we’re all going to the same destination.” The home secretary, Amber Rudd, had earlier accused Johnson of “backseat driving”. Clarke, a prominent remain supporter, accused Johnson of “repeating one of the more simplistic and dishonest arguments of the hardline leavers during the referendum campaign”. “Personal publicity and campaigning by the foreign secretary is actually just an irrelevant nuisance.” He said his Tory colleagues had already said enough about Johnson, who published the article less than a week before May’s planned speech on Brexit in Florence on Friday. Clarke suggested Johnson’s colleagues should encourage him to “make some more serious contributions on wider foreign policy” and to keep his views on Brexit within the privacy of cabinet meetings and conversations with the prime minister. Referring to claims that Johnson had set out a vision for Brexit in his article, Clarke said: “All this ‘if you jump off the cliff and spread out your arms, you’ll find you’re flying up to the broad blue yonder’, that’s not a policy. “When you’re foreign secretary, you’re a leading member of a government. The foreign policy you propound is the policy of the government, which you’ve agreed with your colleagues. It’s the only sensible, grownup way to run a government.” William Hague, the former Tory leader, wrote in the Daily Telegraph on Tuesday that senior ministers lacked coordination on Brexit and it was time they settled on an agreed plan. If May’s speech in Florence failed to unite the cabinet, Jeremy Corbyn would be prime minister, Lord Hague said. Johnson said on Monday afternoon that he accepted May was in charge of the negotiations and played down suggestions he was at odds with cabinet colleagues. He said his article had been intended as an “opening drum roll” to May’s speech. “There is one driver in this car. It’s Theresa. What I am trying to do is sketch out what I think is the incredible exciting landscape of the destination ahead. Let’s not try and find rows when there really aren’t rows,” he said. Johnson made clear, however, that he stood by his arguments over the transition period for Britain to leave the EU. “It is pretty important that it shouldn’t be too long. We certainly don’t want to be paying in extortionate sums for access to the single market. They wouldn’t pay for access to our market.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/20/ndis-rollout-targets-in-doubt-because-of-lack-of-resourcing-allan-fels-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T18:00:24Z","webTitle":"NDIS rollout targets in doubt because of lack of resourcing, Allan Fels says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/20/ndis-rollout-targets-in-doubt-because-of-lack-of-resourcing-allan-fels-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/20/ndis-rollout-targets-in-doubt-because-of-lack-of-resourcing-allan-fels-says","fields":{"headline":"NDIS rollout targets in doubt because of lack of resourcing, Allan Fels says","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The chairman of the National Mental Health Commission, Allan Fels, has warned that the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) lacks the resourcing to properly consider claims for psychosocial disability, potentially putting its rollout targets in jeopardy. Fels has also criticised the increasing use of phone calls to determine whether those with severe mental illness are eligible for the national disability insurance scheme. “The commission shares concerns across the mental health sector on the adequacy of the NDIA’s resources, and the timeframes the agency has been asked to work within to implement the scheme,” Fels said in a statement to Guardian Australia. On Monday Guardian Australia published a list of individuals with severe, long-term mental illness, who had been rejected for psychosocial disability support under the NDIS. It included an individual with a 40-year diagnosed history of paranoid schizophrenia, who had been admitted to hospital at least five times, and given regular depot injections. The mental health sector has expressed alarm at recent access decisions by the NDIS, saying they were inconsistent, ignored expert evidence from psychiatrists or GPs, and appeared to be compromised by a lack of resources coupled with tight deadline pressures. The use of phone interviews to make decisions about the eligibility of those with mental health issues drew particular concern. A communique of an NDIS mental health sector stakeholder group meeting in March suggested 70% of planning conversations were being conducted over the phone. “The agency’s increasing reliance on telephone processes for eligibility assessment is also an obvious concern for people with severe mental health issues,” Fels said. He also warned that projections of those who would be covered by the NDIS – 64,000 to 90,000 people – were only the tip of the iceberg in terms of mental health need. Fels pointed to government modelling, using the national mental health services planning framework, which suggested more than 280,000 people with some level of psychosocial disability needed support to deal with their condition. He said it appeared the lower projections were now being treated as targets. “This risks the agency being distracted from implementing the scheme in a consistent and sustained manner for this highly vulnerable cohort,” Fels said. Labor and the Greens are pressuring the federal government to respond to 24 recommendations on mental health made by the joint standing committee on the NDIS. The shadow disability services minister, Jenny Macklin, said the concerns held by the mental health sector were legitimate. Macklin said the NDIS’s requirement to prove permanency of disability, which runs contrary to the recovery-oriented approach of modern mental health treatment, must be resolved. “The government must consider reviewing the NDIS Act to assess the permanency provisions and the appropriateness and effectiveness of including the principle of recovery-oriented practice for psychosocial disability,” Macklin said. “This is a very complex issue, but one that would benefit from a very carefully considered review.” Fels aired similar concerns about the NDIS’s use of the notion of permanent disability. “While the NDIA has sought to reconcile permanence with the recovery model, there continues to be an underlying tension, and for many people with mental illness, having their condition ‘labelled’ as permanent can be confronting and may undermine their willingness to undergo the NDIS access and eligibility process,” he said. “There may therefore need to be some adjustments to the NDIS eligibility criteria to address this issue.” A spokesman for the social services minister, Christian Porter, said the government was considering the report’s recommendations and would respond “in due course”. An earlier statement from the NDIA said the mainstream mental health system would continue to be responsible for the broader group of people requiring psychosocial support outside of the NDIS. It was developing specialist resources in the national access team, and was reviewing pathways to the NDIS for participants and considering the joint standing committee report. The government has made a commitment to provide support for people in existing programs, who are not found eligible for the NDIS. But Fels is concerned that the “the scope and nature of that continued support is still not clear”. “It also does not extend to people who would, in the future, have been eligible for those programs but who will have nowhere to go if they are not able to access the NDIS,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/19/vince-cable-lib-dems-saviour-convinced-conference-speech","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T16:46:15Z","webTitle":"If Vince Cable is the Lib Dems' saviour, they don't seem entirely convinced | John Crace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/19/vince-cable-lib-dems-saviour-convinced-conference-speech","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/19/vince-cable-lib-dems-saviour-convinced-conference-speech","fields":{"headline":"If Vince Cable is the Lib Dems' saviour, they don't seem entirely convinced","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Four days at a Liberal Democrat conference can feel like three days too many. There aren’t many heavyweights to go round and by the time the conference reaches its final day, most of them have already said most of what they came to say several times over at different events. Stay for long enough and you can feel as if you are in an echo chamber, and not just because there aren’t that many people in the audience. Come the buildup to the leader’s closing speech, even the most committed Lib Dems were beginning to look a bit vacant. Sarah Olney was given a special consolation prize for losing her seat to Zac Goldsmith in the general election, while Layla Moran, who unseated the Tory Nicola Blackwood, was dragged on stage during the annual whip-round – hear the sound of one coin clapping – to share her love of Disney theme parks with a Lib Dem strategist called Sean. Then came Vince Cable. Not just the star of the show, but pretty much the whole show itself. He’d hoped to come on stage to the soundtrack of Skyfall until someone had told him the first words of that were “This is the end”, so he had to settle for the theme music to Ski Sunday. Most people’s thoughts immediately turned to Eddie the Eagle. The plucky British underdog who took on the world. And failed. Declaring that you are going to be the next prime minister when your party only has 12 MPs is an exercise in hubris. Or self-delusion. A polite ripple of applause greeted his arrival. Both Nick Clegg and Tim Farron used to get ovations. If Vince is to be the Lib Dems’ saviour, his party is yet to be wholly convinced. Vince may have gravitas, but he doesn’t have much charisma. He most closely resembles a moderately threatening bank manager. “It’s good, today, to be amongst friends,” he began, looking around a hall with so many empty seats they might even have been close friends, before going on to list the things the Lib Dems couldn’t be blamed for. The Iraq war, the financial crisis and Brexit. When you are struggling to work out what exactly your purpose is, it sometimes helps to define yourself by what you are not. Not that Vince was going to duck the difficult questions. He’d been part of the coalition and he was proud of the Lib Dems’ record in government. It was just a shame that almost none of the electorate had felt the same way. Win some, lose some. After a brief sideswipe at Boris Johnson – his sister Rachel, who had spoken at a fringe meeting, was meant to have been given a front row seat but she wisely chose to remain more anonymous – Vince went for Donald Trump. Or the Giant Tweeter as he called him. It was sod’s law that it was just at this moment that the BBC and Sky decided they’d had more than enough of Vince and switched to the Donald’s warmongering speech to the UN. Undeterred, Vince carried on with his greatest hits, sounding more and more like his own tribute act. The delegates wanted to believe he could lead them to the Promised Land but they just couldn’t manage to stay awake to make the journey. He didn’t want a second referendum, he wanted a first referendum on the facts. Boom, boom. After slagging off both Labour and the Tories, he called for an end to tribal party politics. Boom, boom. “Hope counters despair,” he said in a depressed monotone. “Hope can inspire. Hope can achieve change.” Vince is the only politician who can make the word hope sound so hopeless. The audience willed him on to the finish. Vince had only been party leader for nine weeks so they could afford to cut him some slack. It would have been nice if he could have come up with something like a properly costed policy rather than a fantasy wish-list, but it was what it was. “But I am optimistic too for our party,” Vince paused. Something about that sentence felt wrong. It should have read: “But I am too optimistic for our party.” At the end, the applause was polite. Nothing more. Many delegates had headed for the exits long before Vince left the hall himself. There again, it was possible they had also switched to the Trump speech and were heading for their nuclear bunkers while there was still time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/19/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-category-five-storm","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T17:16:02Z","webTitle":"Puerto Rico braces itself for 'worst atmospheric event in a century'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/19/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-category-five-storm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/19/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-category-five-storm","fields":{"headline":"Puerto Rico braces itself for 'worst atmospheric event in a century'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Puerto Rico is bracing itself for the “catastrophic” impact of Hurricane Maria, which has already caused severe damage to the island of Dominica as it tears through the Caribbean. The US National Hurricane Center warned of an “extreme” threat to life and property across Puerto Rico with gusts of wind that could reach 155mph on Wednesday. The center said the winds will threaten lives, cause power outages and make many roads and bridges impassable. Puerto Rico’s governor, Ricardo Rosselló Nevares, who has declared a state of emergency, said the island was expecting “sustained category 4 or 5 winds” on Wednesday. Hurricane Irma, which brushed the north coast of Puerto Rico earlier this month, caused more than a million homes and businesses to lose power but the US territory has not taken a direct hit from the most severe level of hurricane in more than 80 years. “This is an event that will be damaging to the infrastructure, that will be catastrophic,” Rosselló said. “Never before has an event like this happened. It is projected to be the worst atmospheric event in a century in Puerto Rico and if we do not take precautions we will have life loss situations that we could avoid. Our only focus right now should be to make sure we save lives.” Hurricane Maria, which rapidly strengthened from a tropical storm into a category 5 event within a single day, is expected to bring up to 18in of rain to Puerto Rico and whip up a storm surge that could reach nine feet. Residents have been urged to flee to the 500 shelters that are set up across Puerto Rico. Donald Trump has issued an emergency declaration to provide the island with federal assistance. In Carolina, a municipality on the island’s north-east coast, residents were rushing to stock up on supplies before the storm hit. Large queues had formed at grocery stores throughout the area as people attempted to fill their cars with fuel and stock up on food. “There are no more generators available, and some places have run out of water and batteries,” said resident Antero Rivera, who had just returned from a local supermarket. The island has begun rationing basic supplies, including water and baby formula as well as wooden panels to protect homes. By Tuesday afternoon the weather had already begun to deteriorate on the outer Puerto Rican islands of Culebra and Vieques, with the storm expected to hit the mainland around 8am on Wednesday morning. The French island of Guadeloupe reported the first fatality attributed to the hurricane on Tuesday afternoon. The individual was killed by a falling tree after failing to comply with an order to stay indoors on Tuesday morning. Two others were reported missing after their boat sank off the island’s east coast. About 40% of the island has been left without power and major flooding has been reported around the south coast. The hurricane is expected to start curving away from the Caribbean and the US on Thursday but not before thundering past several other islands that will also be battered by strong winds and potential flooding. The National Hurricane Center has issued hurricane warnings for Guadeloupe, Dominica, St Kitts and Nevis, Montserrat, the US Virgin Islands, the British Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. St Kitts and Nevis, celebrating its 34th independence day on Tuesday, closed all schools and government buildings before the expected impact in the afternoon. “I’ve already heard reports of the winds picking up, but we’ve lost contact at the moment,” Kevin Isaac, St Kitts and Nevis’s high commissioner to the UK, told the Guardian. “I’m keeping my fingers crossed.” Isaac said St Kitts and Nevis is suffering from more frequent severe hurricanes, prompting a debate over the impact of climate change. Climate scientists have warned that warming temperatures may increase the ferocity of hurricanes in the future. “There is a natural inclination to ask ‘What is going on?’” Isaac said. “Our fishing stock is migrating south because the water is getting warmer. And the scientists tell us that hurricanes pick up strength in warm waters.” Hurricane Maria is forecast to dump 20in of rain in some areas of the US and British Virgin Islands, as well as trigger a hefty storm surge. Benito Wheatley, a British Virgin Islands representative to the UK and the European Union, said that the islands were particularly vulnerable because of the impact of Hurricane Irma. “As you can imagine, people are very concerned because the shelters that they have, many of them have been weakened, many of the homes don’t have roofs,” he told the Guardian. Wheatley said Irma had torn through trees and vegetation leaving little to bind the soils together, raising fears that Maria could cause mudslides. “Even if it’s not a direct hit, you can imagine that just a storm of that size coming anywhere near the BVI in its current condition could be very damaging,” he said. The British government has advised against all travel to the British Virgin Islands and said it will extend the deployment of more than 1,300 military personnel already in the region to help with the Irma recovery effort. Dominica has borne the brunt of the hurricane so far. The prime minister, Roosevelt Skerrit, used Facebook to describe his own harrowing experience in real time, posting updates to say that his roof was gone, that his home was flooded and that he was “at the complete mercy of the hurricane”. He added that most people he had spoken to had a similar experience. Only once before in recorded history have two category 5 hurricanes made landfall in the Atlantic in the same hurricane season. Hurricane conditions have been aided by warmer than normal sea water and a lack of wind shear or dust blowing off the Sahara desert – conditions that can disrupt the formation of hurricanes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
