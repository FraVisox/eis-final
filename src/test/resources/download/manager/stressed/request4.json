It’s official, the Guardian morning briefing is one year old today, can you Adam and believe it? I’m your host Warren Murray – please help yourself to a celebratory slice of the news. Financial markets in the UK and Europe are braced for further turmoil today after Asia-Pacific markets continued the global plunge overnight – following the lead of New York’s Dow, which dropped 1,175 points on Monday in its largest one-day points fall on record. Here is our latest wrap-up of the situation – and you can find our continuing live coverage here. The FTSE 100 is predicted to be around 3.5% down as it opens this morning. Overnight UK time there’s been a 4.7% drop in Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index and a 3.3% fall on Australia’s ASX200. Markets in Hong Kong, South Korea and China also recorded losses. Maki Sawada, from Nomura Securities, said stocks were being sold in panic after the Wall Street losses. “The sell-off accelerated in a chain reaction.” Perversely, this seems to be happening in large part because the global economy is faring better. Investors are fearing that central banks will start raising interest rates to curb inflation – the era of “cheap money” looks to be coming to an end. As Bankrate analyst Greg McBride put it: “Markets have been addicted to low interest rates and global central banks pumping money into the financial system. As economies around the world are improving, this means higher interest rates and less stimulus from central banks. That’s why investors are throwing a hissy-fit.” * * * Bit brisk – Rain, sleet and snow are expected to create treacherous rush-hour travel conditions this morning. You’re starting the day with a yellow weather warning for snow and ice in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, northern England, the south-west and East Anglia. Temperatures fell to -6C in parts of Scotland and northern England last night, and tonight it could get down to -11C. Similar conditions could last into the weekend, followed by unusually cold weather possibly stretching into March, the Met says. * * * Frasier actor dies – John Mahoney, the British actor best known for playing Marty Crane on the long-running 1990s sitcom Frasier, has died in a Chicago hospital at the age of 77. Mahoney played the father of Kelsey Grammer’s Frasier. He was born in Blackpool but moved to Chicago. Beginning his acting career in theatre in the 1970s, at the relatively mature age of 37, he joined Steppenwolf Theatre on the suggestion of John Malkovich. Across a varied career he received a Tony award, a Screen Actors Guild award, and two nominations each for the Emmys and the Golden Globes. * * * Off the rails – We may not have to wait for Jeremy Corbyn to get in before the government starts renationalising railways. The East Coast franchise might come back into public hands because of a contractual tangle involving the operator Virgin Trains, admits the transport secretary, Chris Grayling. The government is being accused of handing a bailout to Virgin, which lost money after bidding an over-the-odds £3.3bn for the route. At the same time, Virgin has been given a further contract, without competition, to run the lucrative InterCity West Coast service, potentially until 2020. “Virgin games the system. It’s done it before and it’s doing it again,” said Labour’s transport spokesman, Andy McDonald. * * * Burns going down – If a workplace busybody dips his or her finger in your morning cup of tea today … well, still shove said person away, but you might expect the following by way of sputtered excuse. Drinking very hot tea can raise your risk throat cancer fivefold – mostly if you also happen to smoke, and drink too much alcohol. A nine-year study in China found that those who drank scalding tea and 15g or more of alcohol daily had the greatest risk. UK experts rightly point out tea should not be suddenly regarded as an unhealthy habit — the scalding hot cuppa is not, after all, a British tradition. “That said, there may be individuals out there who do drink very hot tea with excessive alcohol and tobacco consumption as well, and hence might be more at risk of developing this cancer,” said Professor Andrew Sharrocks, from the University of Manchester. * * * And now on Radio 4 … June Spencer, the last original member of the cast of The Archers, has called for actors to be credited at the end of each show. Or, at least, episodes that are especially significant “such as Peggy’s goodbye to Jack”. “I worked a lot on the line where Peggy says: ‘Goodbye, my darling.’ And at the end they read out who it’s been written by and who the editor is, but there’s no mention of the actress.” The show’s agricultural story adviser also gets a regular name-check. In a Radio Times interview, Spencer has also spoken of her desire to still be on the radio play when she turns 100. Lunchtime read: ‘Who are these appalling people?’ It’s apparently an industry trope that the companies and politicians who commission focus groups tend to hate their subjects. “They resent the obligation to listen to ordinary, non-expert people, and often feel humiliated by their judgments.” Likewise, writes Liza Featherstone, “the public resents the mediocre outcomes of a focus-grouped world – feeling that the culture of consultation dumbs down our politics, entertainment and just about everything else … But since they remain a hugely popular way of understanding consumer tastes and voter opinions, why do we hate them so much?” Sport The clock is ticking on Antonio Conte after Chelsea’s 4-1 defeat at Watford surely signalled the end for the Italian manager, who admitted afterwards that his team had been undermined by fear and cast doubt over whether some of the players have the strength of character to thrive at a big club. Today marks the 60th anniversary of the Munich air crash; while there have been worse tragedies involving football teams, none have been perceived as more poignant than the one involving Manchester United in 1958, writes Paul Wilson. England will continue their pursuit of a record-breaking third consecutive Six Nations title without Ben Youngs after the scrum-half was ruled out for the rest of the season with a knee injury. And Jon Moss was “misguided” in asking for TV assistance when awarding Tottenham their first penalty at Liverpool but called the decision correctly, Professional Game Match Officials Limited has said. Business The big story, of course, is the chaos on global markets, which we have covered above. As far as the pound in your pocket goes, it has been trading at $1.396 and €1.128 overnight. The papers “You’re sick Mr President” is the headline in the Mirror which calls Donald Trump blundering and clueless for his tweets about the NHS. The Times says Trump has been rebuked by the head of NHS for his intervention. The Guardian leads with the news that the East Coast rail line may be returned to the public sector. The FT has the same story and says the franchise running the service at the moment is near to collapse. The Telegraph splash is news that campaigners are calling for those Suffragettes who were jailed while fighting to win the vote to be pardoned. Meanwhile the Mail is not happy that the company that provides taxpayer-funded vehicles for disabled people is paying its boss £1.7m a year. The i has a picture of Jacob Rees-Mogg on the front and calls him the “rebel-in-chief” who is attacking both his own prime minister and chancellor. Lastly the Sun says the “prime suspect” in the 1982 IRA Hyde Park bomb attack will face a civil action after legal aid was granted for a suit to proceed.

The referees’ group took the unusual step of explaining the process behind Harry Kane’s missed penalty at Anfield on Sunday after Moss and his assistant, Edward Smart, were recorded debating the legitimacy of the 85th-minute spot-kick. Kane was in an offside position when collecting Dele Alli’s pass but the Liverpool defender Dejan Lovren sliced the ball into the striker’s path before he was brought down by Loris Karius. Moss was heard on a pitch-side microphone saying: “I have no idea whether Lovren touched the ball to be honest with you. Martin, have you got anything from TV?” He then added: “I’m giving the penalty.” The TV question was to Martin Atkinson but, with VAR not in use in the Premier League, Moss has accepted he was wrong to request outside help via the fourth official. In a statement, however, PGMOL insists the referee ultimately made the right decision. It read: “Jon Moss was in a good position to see that a Liverpool player deliberately played the ball before it fell to Harry Kane in the penalty area. He then correctly judged that Kane was fouled by Lorius [sic] Karius. However, given the speed of the attack he was uncertain of the identity of the Liverpool player who kicked the ball. Eddie Smart, having identified that Kane was in an offside position, correctly sought clarification on whether Dejan Lovren had deliberately played the ball. His question created some momentary confusion when Eddie asked if “Lovren” had touched the ball. Moss knew a Liverpool player had touched the ball but not that it was Lovren. “He then asked a question to his fourth official Martin Atkinson and acknowledges referencing ‘TV’ was misguided. Atkinson did not reply to the question and so had no involvement in the decision. Having properly reflected on the questions asked, Jon knew a Liverpool player, now identified as Lovren, had played the ball and that no offside offence had occurred. He then awarded the penalty. For the avoidance of doubt, Atkinson did not view a television monitor and did not relay any information to the on‑field officials. “In real time this was a difficult series of decisions which the match officials judged correctly in recognising that Kane was not offside, as Lovren had deliberately played the ball, and he was fouled for the award of the penalty kick. The interpretation of “deliberately” kicking a ball considers whether a player has intentionally tried to kick a ball – it does not consider whether the ball ends up where a player may have wanted to kick it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/06/british-justice-collapse-moj-prisons-probation-legal-aid-lord-chancellor-charles-falconer","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-06T09:16:51Z","webTitle":"British justice is in flames.

The MoJ’s fiddling is criminal","bodyText":"No one who knows anything about the justice system doubts it is in crisis, that the crisis is unprecedented, that it is rendering the system unable to perform its most basic functions. And that the victims of this are poor people. It is no longer reliably convicting only the guilty. The disclosure problems in serious sex cases have almost certainly resulted in innocent people being convicted. The system for releasing prisoners on parole is letting out those who are unsafe (John Worboys) and keeping inside those who are safe (see the relentlessly unfair incarceration under the IPP (indeterminate sentences for public protection) system. The prisons are as dangerous as they have ever been in modern times to prison officers and prisoners alike. The probation service has ceased to function in the face of a misconceived privatisation. Legal aid has been so restricted as a result of the terrible reforms contained in Laspo – the Legal Aid and Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2011 – that the government has maintained massively flawed decision-making systems for welfare, homelessness, and immigration decisions, safe in the knowledge that most of those who are the victims of wrong rulings have no effective means of redress. The civil non-family courts are only open to rich people (there is in effect no legal aid for civil claims now); and the family courts are filled with local authorities seeking to remove children from their parents, and disputes between couples in the middle of the pain – to them and their children – of partnership breakdown, and unable to obtain legal help to resolve these disputes. The cause of this crisis is pretty clear – the justice system has endured austerity cuts from 2011 onwards more punishing than any other domestic delivery department. And the cuts are continuing pretty well unabated for the next two years. There will, by 2020, have been a 40% reduction in real terms of public expenditure by the Ministry of Justice – £10bn down to £6bn, with £600m still to go. And all this on the basis that the system expects the same standards as before – the same level of justice, the same numbers of people in jail or more, and the same non-custodial alternatives. The government has offered no leadership on how this is to be achieved. The consequences of the crisis are profound. As Lord Judge, the former lord chief justice said, juries will increasingly not convict in serious cases. The public will have no confidence in the ability of the justice system to distinguish between the guilty and the innocent, and between the dangerous and the safe. The government will not be held to the law. Rights given to individuals by parliament are worthless to all save rich people who rarely need them to avoid injustice. Employers, the state, debtors – they can increasingly break the law unchallenged. Nothing meaningful is going on within government to address this. There are internal Ministry of Justice (MoJ) reviews of Laspo, and the working of the Parole Board; and an internal Crown Prosecution Service review of whether the disclosure in all recent sex cases was adequate: but absolutely nothing to address the evident collapse of almost all parts of the system, and the underlying reasons. There is the much vaunted £1bn capital fund to transform justice by improving buildings and technology. The example the MoJ points to as the exemplar outcome of this fund is a new online court to deal with civil claims under £25k. If this example shows the MoJ’s priorities, it is clear it has no comprehension of the scale of the current collapse. Fiddling while Rome burns. Some extra money was obtained, after much effort, from the Treasury to employ more prison officers to make up for a portion of those lost in the austerity cuts. This was well over a year ago, yet the prison service cannot fill all the places they have the money for. The retention rate for prison officers is plummeting both among long-service officers, and new ones who frequently leave quickly when they see the horror the job has become. Leadership, extra resources and reform to ensure that the justice system is never again allowed to fall below minimum standards are the solution. The new lord chancellor is not to blame for the crisis. David Gauke has to acknowledge the existence of it, rather than suggest the system is functioning properly with a few wrinkles. He will find support across all parties and in all walks of life for doing so. He needs to craft a plan that he can demonstrate has widespread support, not just from the lawyers but from those who depend on the justice system. He won’t get all that the system needs, but he won’t get anything unless he develops a series of solutions. He needs to work with a much wider group than just his department, and would find so much support if he embarked urgently on that process. Other government departments are actively campaigning for more resources for developed solutions. The MoJ’s failure to do so suggests either it does not understand the extent of the crisis, or is too defensive of its past errors to convey accurately within government the damage being done. The three priority areas for extra spending and reform are prison and probation, legal aid and the Crown Prosecution Service (the ministerial responsibility of the attorney-general). That extra expenditure is inevitable. The sooner it is acknowledged the less will be required. As the Thatcher government discovered, the failure to do anything about appalling prison conditions until the 1990 Strangeways prison riots cost a lot more than if it had addressed the problem earlier. But the solution is not just cash. It is also reform to provide long-term confidence that the system, which has so much less political support than health or education, should never be allowed to slip below minimum standards again. The Bach report, published last autumn, made the well-received recommendation that there should be an independent body within government to set minimum standards for justice. That would provide a strategic overview of expenditure, and protect those who need legal help with a degree of security that comes from there being insulation against legal expenditure always being the first to be cut in a crisis. A collapsing legal system damages not just those who suffer immediate injustice. It leaves us all vulnerable to the consequences of living in a society, where the law is unreliable and only enforceable by the rich. • Charles Falconer is a former lord chancellor and justice secretary"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2018/feb/13/a-national-disgrace-australias-extinction-crisis-is-unfolding-in-plain-sight","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-12T17:00:57Z","webTitle":"'A national disgrace': Australia's extinction crisis is unfolding in plain sight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/13/a-national-disgrace-australias-extinction-crisis-is-unfolding-in-plain-sight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/feb/13/a-national-disgrace-australias-extinction-crisis-is-unfolding-in-plain-sight","fields":{"headline":"'A national disgrace': Australia's extinction crisis is unfolding in plain sight","bodyText":"Global warming wiped out the Bramble Cay melomys – the first mammalian extinction in the world to be caused by climate change – but a straightforward plan that could have rescued the little rodent was thwarted by red tape and political indifference. “It could have been saved. That’s the most important part,” says John Woinarski, a professor of conservation biology who was on the threatened species scientific committee that approved a 2008 national recovery plan for the species, endemic to a tiny island in the Torres Strait. The fate of the melomys is symptomatic of the failures in Australia’s management of threatened species, which has seen the country lose more than 50 animal and 60 plant species in the past 200 years and record the highest rate of mammalian extinction in the world over that period. The mammal at the centre of this story was an uncharismatic rodent in a remote part of the country. The key factor for the species’ extinction was almost certainly ocean inundation of the low-lying cay, but recovery efforts were insufficient and hampered by disagreement within government agencies over approaches – in this case captive breeding. And while it was clear urgent action should be taken – and that action was likely to be successful, straightforward and inexpensive – the plan was implemented too late. While the researchers hypothesised the melomys or a close relative might occur in Papua New Guinea, Australia’s only mammal endemic to the Great Barrier Reef has been declared extinct. In the past decade alone, the country has lost two mammal species – the Christmas Island pipistrelle as well as the Bramble Cay melomys – and one reptile, the Christmas Island forest skink. More than 1,800 plant and animal species and ecological communities (woodlands, forests and wetlands are examples of ecological communities) are currently at risk of extinction, a number that is increasing but which is also likely to be an underestimate of how many are truly vulnerable. “We should have learnt the lessons,” Woinarski says of Australia’s failure to arrest its rate of species decline. “As a society, we should be caring more for our nature, and we’re not. The legal protections we’ve got and the funding mechanisms are simply insufficient, as is the extent to which we care.”There is another feature of the Bramble Cay melomys that is typical of many species in peril across the country. It is likely most Australians were not even aware of the animal’s existence. For scientists, conservationists, researchers and those in the broader environment community, the challenge of securing stronger protection and more funding for Australia’s threatened flora and fauna is made tougher by the fact that much of the population does not realise that the wildlife the country prides itself on is in trouble. The federal government’s most recent State of the Environment report concluded that Australia’s biodiversity had declined further since 2011 and new approaches were needed to address this downward trajectory for many species. The same report found there had been no decrease in the main pressures faced by native plants and animals, namely habitat loss and degradation, climate change, land use practices and invasive plant and animal species. Guardian Australia interviewed scientists, researchers, conservationists and policy analysts whose work across threatened species research and protection spans decades. They described the situation confronting Australia’s threatened plants and animals as a “national disgrace” and the systems that are supposed to protect them as “broken”. Interviews were requested with both federal environment and energy minister Josh Frydenberg and the government’s new threatened species commissioner, Dr Sally Box, and both were declined. Euan Ritchie, an associate professor in wildlife ecology and conservation at Deakin University, says the plight of Australia’s threatened species is an “environmental crisis”, with more and more species edging closer to extinction “despite our capacity to prevent such a tragedy from occurring”. “What’s occurring is akin to allowing the art of Namitjira, Olley, Preston, Nolan, Whiteley and others to disappear from our most treasured museums, through neglect, and much of society being unaware or responding with a collective shrug of shoulders,” he says. James Trezise, policy analyst at the Australian Conservation Foundation, says Australia has an extinction crisis and governments are failing to implement the reforms and investment necessary to turn the situation around. “Extinction is entirely avoidable. We can turn the trend around but it needs meaningful government intervention. From a conservation standpoint we know what needs to happen, but it seems there isn’t the political will to get us there,” he says. According to the Department of Environment and Energy, Australia is home to more than one million species and 85%of the country’s flora, 84% of its mammals, 45% of its birds and 89% of inshore, temperate-zone fish are found nowhere else on earth. The conservation community says Australia has an obligation to protect these unique species but, despite this, the country is having trouble reversing the trends of the past 150 years. Among mammals alone, Australia is losing one to two species per decade. By comparison, the continental United States, whose Endangered Species Act imposes tougher enforcement of threatened species protection and recovery, has lost only one mammal species since colonisation – the sea mink. The experts who spoke to Guardian point to a range of complex and intertwined issues affecting the decline of threatened species in Australia, which have occurred under governments on both sides of the political aisle over many years and will be explored throughout the series. Among them are: massive rates of land clearing, urbanisation, weakening of protections under the EPBC Act, cuts to environment budgets, poor monitoring of species, poor coordination between federal and state governments, a lack of legislation compelling governments to actually fund recovery actions for listed species once they’ve been identified, and a lack of accountability measures to ensure actions that are being taken are working or assess what processes have failed when a species goes extinct. “I think the whole system is completely broken,” says Prof Lesley Hughes from the department of biological sciences at Macquarie University. “The fact that our threatened species lists continue to grow and very few if any species have ever come off those lists due to conservation action is evidence that what is being done thus far is not effective.” Humane Society International Australia participates in an annual federal nomination process to list new threatened species as either vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered under the EPBC Act. For an animal, plant or ecological community to qualify for assessment by the government’s Threatened Species Scientific Committee, it must first make a priority list that is drafted by the committee and signed off by the minister. The HSI Australia head of campaigns, Nicola Beynon, says this process of requiring a priority listing from the government before the final scientific assessment stage could enable “politically difficult nominations to be de-prioritised.” “The priority list is necessitated by a lack of resources; it sees threatened species drip-fed for protection rather than a concerted effort into ensuring that everything that deserves protections is receiving it,” she says. “There’s so many little things in the system that all add up to failure.” In the past, species listed as vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered under the EPBC Act required the drafting of what is known as a recovery plan for their management. But changes to the Act in 2006 made the making of recovery plans optional and at the discretion of the minister. The changes also introduced an alternative document known as a conservation advice, which a minister only has to consider – as opposed to being bound to specific actions or protections for a species – when making approvals under the EPBC Act. This was seen in 2015 when approval of Adani’s Carmichael coalmine in Queensland was overturned because the then environment minister Greg Hunt failed to consider the conservation advices for the yakka skink and ornamental snake. The mine was re-approved two months later after the minister went back and considered the advice for both species and signed off on the development. Dr Bruce Lindsay, a lawyer with Environmental Justice Australia, says “part of the issue we’ve got is the environment laws within the EPBC Act have really become more about facilitating development than protecting threatened species.” “It’s about development with conditions. The purpose of the laws is not really about arresting and reversing the decline of threatened species,” he says. Since the Coalition took power in 2013, it has taken steps to invest in the eradication of predators such as feral cats and has established a threatened species commissioner to raise the profile of threatened species. Its threatened species prospectus includes commitments to improve the trajectories of 20 mammals, 20 birds and 30 plants by 2020, but this is a small portion of the mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, plants and other species that have threatened species listings, and the process by which the mammals and birds were selected has been a source of conjecture. “With 503 animal and 1,308 plant species listed as nationally threatened, there is a big task ahead,” Frydenberg has said. “The Coalition government, however, is strongly committed to threatened species protection and recovery – that’s why we appointed Australia’s first threatened species commissioner. We also launched Australia’s first threatened species strategy and have mobilised $255m for more than 1,200 projects with threatened species outcomes.” But scientists say these measures will be insufficient as long as factors such as vegetation destruction remain unaddressed and that Australia is flying in the dark on a whole range of other management and monitoring concerns for threatened species. “Habitat loss and modification remains the elephant in the room in terms of the total number of threatened species it affects, and because the loss of vegetation can compound other serious threats, for example by making it easier for feral cats and foxes to find and kill native animals” Prof Ritchie says. In a recent paper on Australia’s three known vertebrate extinctions of the past decade, Woinarski and fellow scientists Stephen Garnett, Sarah Legge and David Lindenmayer recommended Australian governments establish an inquest after any extinction to better understand the factors that led to it and to reduce the likelihood that they will occur again – similar to what coronial inquiries do in unexplained deaths of humans. Darren Grover, head of living ecosystems for WWF Australia, says another part of the challenge is simply making Australians understand what is at stake. He says the current plight of threatened species is made more difficult by the fact that many of the plants and animals under threat are species Australians “have never heard of, they’ve never been to where the animal lives and it doesn’t affect them in any way”. “But what we will see starting to happen in the next couple of years, if we can’t turn things around, is that it will be things that people know,” he says. “We need to connect Australians with their wildlife again.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/feb/06/journalism-inquiry-recommends-tax-deductions-for-news-media-subscriptions","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-06T03:44:39Z","webTitle":"Journalism inquiry recommends tax deductions for news media subscriptions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/feb/06/journalism-inquiry-recommends-tax-deductions-for-news-media-subscriptions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/feb/06/journalism-inquiry-recommends-tax-deductions-for-news-media-subscriptions","fields":{"headline":"Journalism inquiry recommends tax deductions for news media subscriptions","bodyText":"Tax deductions for news media subscriptions and adequate funding for public and community broadcasting are among the recommendations made by a parliamentary inquiry into public interest journalism. In May last year, the inquiry was formed to look into the current state of public interest journalism and whether government should play a role in keeping it healthy. The Senate committee heard evidence that more than 2,500 editorial jobs had been cut from media organisations in Australia since 2011 and Coalition funding cuts to the ABC and SBS had resulted in a significant loss of local content and the closure of foreign reporting bureaux. The report recommends a review of Australian defamation laws and an audit of any “unjustifiably harsh or draconian laws” that make the reporting of national security and border protection difficult. That recommendation flies in the face of the Turnbull government’s overhaul of secrecy laws in Australia, which has been criticised as having a “chilling” effect on public interest journalism. But the select committee on the future of public interest journalism report has few backers left in parliament since the committee lost its dominant Labor and Greens members before its work was complete because senators Sam Dastyari, Scott Ludlam, Nick Xenophon and Jacqui Lambie were forced to resign due to dual citizenship issues. It was left up to the current chair, the Labor senator Catryna Bilyk, to release the report. Dastyari and Xenophon were accused by Coalition senators of using the public hearings to grandstand. The committee hearings attracted a lot of attention early on when an appearance by the Fairfax Media chief executive, Greg Hywood, saw the senators grill him about his reported pay of up to $7.2m in 2016. Tabled in parliament on Monday, the report also called for an expansion of whistleblower and shield law protections for journalists. Another one of the eight recommendations was that schools include media literacy in the curriculum so young people can be educated about the difference between fake news and news from reputable outlets. While they did not put out a dissenting report, the committee’s Coalition senators, James Paterson and Jonathon Duniam, made it clear they were “sceptical” about the value of another media inquiry when Labor and the Greens had “obstructed and opposed” the government’s own media reform legislation. Coalition senators said the government had put in place several measures to support public interest journalism in Australia including the media reform package, the $60.4m regional and small publishers jobs package, funding the ABC and SBS to the tune of $1.3bn a year and the provision of $6.1m in funding for the community radio broadcasters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/06/jacinda-ardern-waitangi-day-changes-new-zealand","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-06T09:08:16Z","webTitle":"Jacinda Ardern defuses tensions on New Zealand's sacred Waitangi Day","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/06/jacinda-ardern-waitangi-day-changes-new-zealand","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/06/jacinda-ardern-waitangi-day-changes-new-zealand","fields":{"headline":"Jacinda Ardern defuses tensions on New Zealand's sacred Waitangi Day","bodyText":"It is a place New Zealand prime ministers and politicians have feared to tread. The commemorative ceremony at Waitangi on New Zealand’s national day – which marks the signing of the treaty between the British crown and the country’s largest tribe, Ngāpuhi, in 1840 – has become synonymous with protest and acrimony. In 2016 the prime minister at the time, John Key, was a no-show due to security concerns over protesters. His successor, Bill English, followed suit in 2017, after the government minister Steven Joyce was hit with a sex toy the year before. As far back as 1990, Queen Elizabeth was greeted with a mixture of cheering and boos, as well as having a black T-shirt thrown at her by a young Māori woman. But this year, with Labour’s Jacinda Ardern at the helm, change is afoot in Northland, with an altogether different scene unfolding. Ardern, who announced she was pregnant to a surprised nation three weeks ago, was greeted by a staunch Māori activist, Titewhai Harawira, dressed in white. Harawira reached from her wheelchair for the prime minister’s hand to escort her on to treaty grounds; the same woman who reduced the then Labour leader, Helen Clark to tears with harsh words on Waitangi Day in 1998. Ardern has already shaken things up at the most sacred site in New Zealand, staying for an unprecedented five days in the far north – the longest visit of any prime minister. She has spent the time talking with tribal leaders and community groups, as well as eating a picnic lunch with local schoolchildren. She also donned an apron to fry eggs and bacon for close to 1,000 people alongside her ministers – in stark contrast to the usual formal breakfast for dignitaries only, held in a hotel. Ngāpuhi have shown respect to Ardern by allowing her to speak on the marae (meeting ground) – the first female prime minister to be granted that right – and also invited her to bury the placenta of her baby on tribal grounds, an offer the PM and her partner, Clarke Gayford, are considering. The couple were also given wahakura – a type of baby basket – by local weavers to cocoon their baby safely while it sleeps. “Something has changed,” declared the New Zealand Herald on its front page. “Protest was absent from Waitangi yesterday, and you don’t need to have a view on the rights or wrongs of the protests there, year after year, to recognise that history is alive and progressing,” wrote the Herald’s Simon Wilson. Assistant commissioner Wally Haumaha, New Zealand’s police deputy chief executive of Māori, Pasifika and ethnic services, told the Herald it was the best Waitangi commemorations he had attended in more than a decade. “I was here in the days of protest around the pole, cops everywhere, and today I am so overjoyed. I can retire gracefully and know that we saw this day where the government was treated with respect and dignity,” he said. An estimated 1,500 people attended the celebrations on treaty grounds, thought to be the largest crowd in decades, with some travelling from as far afield as the South Island and Australia to attend. Despite the prime minister’s youth, her government’s commitment to improving the relationship with Māori hit the right note at Waitangi, and the coalition’s fleet of Māori ministers helped pave the way for a peaceful visit, with both the deputy prime minister, Winston Peters, and Labour’s deputy leader, Kelvin Davis, Māori men who hail from Northland. “We’ve got a very, very young country and a very, very young leader and that combination ... is going to be dynamite for this country,” said the Ngāpuhi leader, Sonny Tau. Despite the lack of protest, Ardern said she was not afraid of robust meetings or disagreement, and asked the people gathered to hold her government to account, particularly regarding their commitments to lift Māori children out of poverty, create more jobs and reduce the high incarceration rate of Māoris. The first 49 seconds of her speech were delivered in te reo, the Māori language, a skill she said she would like to improve. “One day I want to be able to tell my child that I earned the right to stand here, and only you can tell me when I have done that,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/06/sweden-condemns-chinas-brutal-detention-of-bookseller-gui-minhai","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-06T02:25:02Z","webTitle":"Sweden condemns China's 'brutal' detention of bookseller Gui Minhai","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/06/sweden-condemns-chinas-brutal-detention-of-bookseller-gui-minhai","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/06/sweden-condemns-chinas-brutal-detention-of-bookseller-gui-minhai","fields":{"headline":"Sweden condemns China's 'brutal' detention of bookseller Gui Minhai","bodyText":"Sweden’s foreign minister has condemned China’s “brutal” detention of a Hong Kong bookseller who irked Beijing with his tabloid-style stories about the Communist party elite. Gui Minhai, a China-born Swedish citizen, was picked up by plainclothes agents on 20 January as he travelled on a train to Beijing with two Swedish diplomats. Supporters said he had been traveling to the Chinese capital for a medical examination. Gui had spent much of the previous two years in custody in east China after his suspected rendition from his holiday home in Thailand. Until his second disappearance, hopes had been rising among supporters for his release. In a statement Sweden’s foreign minister, Margot Wallstrom, said: “The continued detention of the Swedish citizen Gui Minhai in China is a very serious matter.” Wallstrom labelled the action against Gui and the two diplomats as a “brutal intervention”: “China’s actions were in contravention of basic international rules on consular support. “We demand that our citizen be given the opportunity to meet Swedish diplomatic and medical staff, and that he be released so that he can be reunited with his daughter and family.” The statement signals a marked escalation from Sweden which has been publicly cautious over the case ever since Gui first went missing in October 2015. On Sunday the publisher’s daughter, Angela Gui, told the Guardian that her father’s whereabouts remained a mystery."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/feb/05/antonio-costa-running-out-of-time-chelsea-watford-tiemoue-bakayoko","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-05T23:57:54Z","webTitle":"Antonio Conte running out of time as Tiémoué Bakayoko plays the fall guy | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/feb/05/antonio-costa-running-out-of-time-chelsea-watford-tiemoue-bakayoko","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/feb/05/antonio-costa-running-out-of-time-chelsea-watford-tiemoue-bakayoko","fields":{"headline":"Antonio Conte running out of time as Tiémoué Bakayoko plays the fall guy","bodyText":"Antonioooo. Antonio. Antonio, Antonio, Antonio. And repeat to fade. Chelsea’s travelling support had made their own loyalties clear from the first whistle, kicking off this fun, slightly hysterical game with a sustained chant in support of a manager who has always found that connection with the stands, who at times seems as fevered, passionate and all-round mad-as-bats as even the most committed fan. Chelsea produced a performance that was like a 90-minute Viking funeral for the Conte era. Albeit with the sense of entropy, of something profoundly off below the surface pushed right to the front. February has always been the cruellest month for Chelsea managers, from the baffled autocrat Luiz Felipe Scolari to the hip young baffled gunslinger André Villas-Boas. And now for Conte, whose time in west London is surely coming to an end one way or another. This is a team that simply seems, once again, to have run its course with startling speed, at a club that eats its own season after season. Dying managerial reigns are often captured in a single image. There may have been worse half-hours from a £40m midfielder than Tiémoué Bakayoko’s frenetic, moribund misadventures here on Monday but not many and not within easy reach of the short-term memory. Poor Bakayoko. He was terrible. Although he was at least consistently terrible, predictably terrible, terrible in a way his manager would surely have been able to predict and pre-empt, a picture of awkwardness once again in his basic struggles to manoeuvre himself into the right part of the pitch, to control and pass the ball, to try and face the right way. The opening 25 minutes brought 12 passes, five of them misplaced, capped by a strange foul on Étienne Capoue in which Bakayoko collapsed on to the Frenchman’s ankle, unable to adjust his feet in time to make a more football-style challenge. Five minutes later Bakayoko was off, picking up his second yellow card for a lunge at Richarlison . As he wandered off Bakayoko waved at the away support, who did not return the favour in any obvious numbers, and then seemingly at the home fans, too, as they chanted “cheerio”. It was that kind of night for a Chelsea team still with plenty to play for but which seems to be on the verge once again of entering that familiar parabola of decline. Bakayoko has been an easy whipping boy in the middle of all this, harshly so for a player in his first season at the club, and struggling to adjust not just to a new league but a new role and a team in a state of angst. Really, though, Conte must take some blame for the way Chelsea have begun to curl at the edges, a manager who took the plaudits last year for his passionate reimagining of this team but who has become increasingly splenetic and petty as events have refused to bend to his will. He has been a fascinating presence in the Premier League, from his emergence as a rampaging title-bound tactical innovator to the sudden loss of energy at the start of this season, a man already looking towards the exit from that first title-defence home game against Burnley, when Conte and his assistants slouched out in Protest Tracksuits at Stamford Bridge, like a picket line of angry middle-aged PE teachers. The players loved Conte last season, almost as much as the fans still do. But there has been talk this year of his drainingly intense personality, of the relentlessness of training. In public, at least, Bakayoko, and Ross Barkley, have been treated to the stick, without any obvious sign of the sugar lump, the word in the ear. This is more than simply Conte, though. As Chelsea have continued to hoover up major trophies it has been tempting to spot some method in their managerial churn, the idea of the disposable high-grade coach. But things are a little different now. The squad has star quality but little depth, with a new policy of billionaire-level austerity faced with the state-funded financial incontinence elsewhere in Europe. It has been Conte’s task to wrestle with these constraints. At times he has given the impression he may simply be plotting his exit, facing the cold fact that Roman Abramovich has sacked eight managers, many still on the downslope of a trophy-winning high. Only Chelsea could reach a dead end with half a season to play and a Champions League knockout stage to come but there has always been a peculiar, debilitating touch of death about this relentlessly successful machine, which seems once again to be cranking up the exit music. • This article was amended on 8 February 2018 because Étienne Capoue is French, not Brazilian as an earlier version said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/feb/26/ceridwen-dovey-when-you-take-up-your-pen-youre-taking-up-a-position-of-power","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T19:29:56Z","webTitle":"Ceridwen Dovey: 'When you take up your pen, you’re taking up a position of power'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/26/ceridwen-dovey-when-you-take-up-your-pen-youre-taking-up-a-position-of-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/feb/26/ceridwen-dovey-when-you-take-up-your-pen-youre-taking-up-a-position-of-power","fields":{"headline":"Ceridwen Dovey: 'When you take up your pen, you’re taking up a position of power'","bodyText":"Twenty years ago, Vita forbade Royce to contact her ever again. But now he is dying and wants a final audience; they enter into an antagonistic email correspondence, revealing personal history and lifelong dark obsessions. Ceridwen Dovey’s In the Garden of the Fugitives dives into the murky depths of the past and what surfaces is a complex meditation on the guilt of privilege. A benefactor to zealous young women, Royce offered university student Vita a lucrative scholarship – while simultaneously courting her. Her reasons for meeting him in gilded restaurants and accepting expensive gifts are complicated, illustrating the uncertainty of consent in the face of power. “I worried,” Vita writes, “that if I offended you I would ruin my chances of being given a scholarship.” Written with a touch of melodrama, In the Garden of the Fugitives finds rich settings in South African farms, American college dorms and Italian archaeology digs. Royce’s emails recount his time in Pompeii and a doomed, unrequited love, while Vita focuses on her struggle with her place as a white woman in post-apartheid South Africa. Speaking from her home in Sydney, South African-born Dovey muses on the nature of privilege and narratives of complicity. “I really struggle to find a position to write from as an author,” she says. “It’s shaded by being a white South African who grew up in apartheid. Can I speak from the class of the perpetrator?” Dovey has been considering this from different angles for a decade. Her earlier books, Blood Kin (2007) and Only the Animals (2014), were written when she lived in Cape Town and grapple with the politics of claiming an identity in post-apartheid South Africa. How does one relate to a culture in which your inheritance is violence and theft? Dovey’s precise and cool prose is concerned with questions about privilege. At the tail end of her university years, Vita arrives in Cape Town with a camera and a vague hope to capture a country that weighs heavily on her heart. She appeals in desperation to Magdalene, a black psychotherapist who uses narrative therapy to treat “white South Africans struggling with extreme feelings of guilt”. Dovey, too, grapples with the complexities of creating art in an unfair world. “When you take up your pen as an author, you’re taking up a position of power,” she says. “So you have to be extremely careful how you use it.” Her perspective is inspired by confessional South African literature, such as André Brink’s States of Emergency and Nadine Gordimer’s Burger’s Daughter, as well as JM Coetzee’s response to the genre (her own book on Coetzee will be published by Black Inc later this year). She still has no clear answers about contending with privilege, but is comfortable with the ambiguity. “The worst advice you can give a young writer is to write what you know. The Irish author Colum McCann always said to me, ‘It’s much more important to write towards what you want to know’.” Dovey, who now lives in Australia with her husband and two children, also refuses to draw neat comparisons between apartheid and local colonial history. But Australian readers will benefit from this deep discussion of white privilege and shame: in a country built on the genocide and oppression of the first peoples, guilt is woven into the white psyche. For the author, writing is a way of processing these complex feelings. “When I’m writing fiction, I’m writing to and from myself.” She chuckles. “Imagine you were in therapy for two years and at the end the transcripts were made public.” Dovey mirrors this practice in the novel – Vita’s emails to Royce act as self-administered therapy. This manner of processing isn’t the only similarity between Dovey and her protagonist. They were both born in South Africa and migrated to Australia; both won scholarships to prestigious American universities and then travelled to South Africa to film documentaries; and both struggled with the anxious weight of history. So it’s impossible not to ask: to what extent is this novel autobiographical? “Coetzee thinks, ‘Is your work autobiographical?’ is the wrong question to be asking of fiction,” she answers. “The therapeutic process of psychotherapy is to free the autobiographical imagination.” This idea – of shaping the past and also the person who tells it – is inspired by The Good Story, a dialogue between Coetzee and psychotherapist Arabella Kurtz about the relationship psychoanalysis has to writing fiction. Like Vita and Royce’s emails, it’s not just about the narrative being told, but the act of interpreting our experiences. Herein lies the power of storytelling. “You’re not just narrating your own past, you’re authoring it. You’re crafting it.” • In the Garden of the Fugitives by Ceridwen Dovey is out now through Penguin"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/06/kevin-rudd-was-advised-against-opening-parliament-with-apology-to-stolen-generations","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-06T17:00:29Z","webTitle":"Kevin Rudd was advised against opening parliament with apology to stolen generations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/06/kevin-rudd-was-advised-against-opening-parliament-with-apology-to-stolen-generations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/06/kevin-rudd-was-advised-against-opening-parliament-with-apology-to-stolen-generations","fields":{"headline":"Kevin Rudd was advised against opening parliament with apology to stolen generations","bodyText":"Kevin Rudd was advised against making the apology to the stolen generations at the opening of the new parliament after his election in 2007 and was “worried something could go wrong”, according to Jenny Macklin, then minister for Indigenous affairs. In a long piece for Meanjin to be published Wednesday telling the inside story of how the Rudd government prepared the landmark apology to the stolen generations a decade ago, Macklin reveals Rudd was counselled internally against delivering the apology as the opening parliamentary gesture of his prime ministership. Macklin said both she and Rudd were aware that in the heavily contested political context of the time, delivering the apology first up was risky. “I realised what a big risk we were taking, and what a big decision it was to have the apology on the first day of the new parliament,” she said. “Kevin was understandably worried something could go wrong ... He was also receiving advice from others against the apology occurring on the first day of his prime ministership in the parliament. “This was not shared with me, though I found out about it much later.” While Rudd went on to deliver the apology at the opening of the new parliament on 13 February 2008 – a gesture which is one of his most significant legacies as prime minister – Macklin said the politics of the apology were always fraught. In executing the internal policy work leading up the milestone, Macklin said there “was a concern – which I came up against regularly – that the prevailing politics of the time did not lend itself to generous symbolic gestures to Aboriginal people”. She said the apology “had to be fought for every step of the way”. Macklin said the concern about the political implications of symbolic gestures lingered. “This argument reappeared every year throughout our time in government as I argued for the prime minister’s Closing the Gap address to the parliament to be on the anniversary of the apology. “I didn’t always win this debate. This was a regular reminder that it was not inevitable that the apology would take place, or that it would be on the first day of the parliament.” Macklin – who led the consultations with Indigenous leaders which informed the scope of the apology, and the discussions with other key figures, like the former high court judge and governor general William Deane, the former Liberal Indigenous affairs minister Fred Chaney, and Mark Leibler, then co-chair of Reconciliation Australia – said the strong advice to Labor at the time was if the apology was to be a bipartisan parliamentary gesture, which is ultimately was, compensation could not be part of it. Labor’s legal advice at the time of the apology was the sorry gesture in the parliament would not expose the commonwealth to financial claims. But she said the issue of compensation for the stolen generations remains unfinished business. Macklin said stolen generations organisations are continuing to press for the full implementation of the Bringing Them Home report recommendations, including compensation, and she endorses that call. The Bringing Them Home report in 1997 followed a national inquiry into the separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families. Macklin said some state governments had introduced reparation schemes over the past decade, and she said the commonwealth “will also need to take its share of responsibility”. “Reparation and compensation should be paid,” Macklin said. Macklin’s contribution for Meanjin was prepared to mark the 10th anniversary of the apology, which is next week. There will be a number of public events to mark the milestone."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/grogonomics/2018/feb/06/is-private-health-insurance-a-con-the-answer-is-in-the-graphs","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-05T22:40:16Z","webTitle":"Is private health insurance a con?

The answer is in the graphs","bodyText":"The Labor party has deftly put pressure on the government at the start of this political year by offering to limit private health insurance premium increases to 2%. It’s a pitch that will appeal to many given wide dissatisfaction with private health insurance. But as expected, it has also brought about complaints from the CEOs of this very protected industry that fly in the face of evidence. Among the more humorous statements made after Bill Shorten’s announcement of the premium limit was from the chief executive of health fund nib, Mark Fitzgibbon, who suggested it was “absurd” that “a future government would seek to set prices in any highly competitive market.” He said that it “may be politically popular but it’s an affront to how the free market operates. What next? Food, clothing, car insurance, school fees and petrol?” In reality, what is absurd is not the ALP’s policy but the suggestion the private health insurance industry is an example of a free market. Far from being free, the industry is absolutely dependent upon governments doing all they can to encourage people to join it and penalise those who don’t. Since the first step into universal healthcare with Medibank in 1975, the percentage of the population in private health insurance has steadily fallen. When the Hawke government introduced Medicare in 1984, 54% of the population held private health insurance; by 1997 it was down to 33%. Then the Howard government came to the rescue. It introduced the Medicare levy surcharge for everyone earning over $100,000, and in 1999 the 30% private health insurance rebate. And then came the doozy – in 1999 the Howard government came up with a plan to blackmail people into joining private health insurance. The introduction of “Life Time Health Cover” in July 2000, which penalised people 2% of the premium for every year over 30 they weren’t in private health, saw the percentage of those in the private health system rise to 46% – around where it has remained ever since. The big reason for the jump was people in their 30s – people who had previously shown limited desire to be in private health – realised they needed to join, or face much higher premiums when they joined in their 50s and 60s when they might actually use it: Take away that government-mandated penalty, and people would leave private health in their droves. The free market at play without that government blackmail would likely see many of the 60% of those with health insurance who say it does not deliver value for money leave the system. And you can understand why nearly two-thirds of private health insurance holders think that, given with the latest increase in premiums of 3.95%, the cost of health coverage has far outstripped both overall inflation and wages growth: And yet the industry remains extremely profitable for the 13 of the 37 private health insurance companies that are for-profit. As the AMA told a Senate committee on the value and affordability of private health insurance and out-of-pocket medical costs last year, “the shift to a full-profit industry has created the need to ensure that there are sufficient profits to allow a return to shareholders. This is driving much of the growth in increased premiums.” When announcing the policy, Shorten noted that in the last financial year Australians paid $4bn more in private health insurance premiums than they got back in benefits, and the industry made pre-tax profits of $1.8bn. But it is not just the cost of the premiums – it is what you get for your money that is a concern. Increasingly policies contain exclusions – exclusions which add to the complexity of the system and leave people unaware of what they are precisely covered for: Similarly there has been a large increase in the number of policies that contain excess or co-payments – a trend that began with the introduction of lifetime health cover as people sought to take out the cheapest policy they could find to avoid the over-30 penalty: But where once it was a small number, now, over 80% of policies have excesses and co-payments. Private health insurance is no longer what it used to be. Little wonder people are dissatisfied – government policy in effect forced them to join, and yet they get a policy that offers less than in the past and the cost of which increases well above income growth year on year. Not surprisingly, people the their 20s have stopped taking out private health insurance: But this is a worry for private health insurance companies, because they need those healthy young people paying for the insurance and not using it – unlike the elderly who do. And this is the problem with all private health, and why a public health system that uses taxation is a much better way of operating. We have a system that attempts to force young people to take out a private insurance policy they don’t want or particularly need in order to fund the use of it by older people. As the Centre for Policy Development research fellow Ian McAuley told Melissa Davey last year, it is essentially “transferring funds from the young to the old”. We have a public and private health mix in Australia, but consistently over the past 40 years people have revealed through their spending choices they prefer the public system. And yet rather than pick the winner, governments of both persuasion have attempted to prop up the private sector. And as ever the private system has taken advantage – offering less coverage while complaining about needing ever more government assistance. If limiting the amount they are propped up each year to 2% is an affront to the free market, let the private health sector make their case without all the other legislated measures and see how people would vote with their wallets – history tells us what will happen.

The Falcon Heavy rocket was years in the making, costing about half a billion dollars, but its maiden success has galvanised scientists, engineers and businessmen, seemingly overnight. “He’s being Elon again. I’d call it competition, and competition is the American way of life,” said John Logsdon, professor emeritus at George Washington University and founder of the Space Policy Institute. “SpaceX has challenged the traditional launch industry in the United States and in Europe and in China and in Russia.” In just over 15 years, SpaceX has muscled its way into spaceflight, a realm long dominated by space agencies like Nasa and their main contractors, Lockheed Martin and Boeing. Nor was Musk alone: Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos beat him to landing a reusable rocket through his own company, Blue Origin, and Richard Branson and a slew of other entrepreneurs have followed with lighter-lift rockets. “The space age was born out of a race between governments, starting with the Sputnik moment,” said Phil Larson, a senior science adviser in Barack Obama’s White House and a former SpaceX official, referring to the first satellite launch into orbit, in 1957 by the Soviet Union. “What we’re seeing in the last five to 10 years is this fomented competition between companies,” Larson said, “and sometimes between governments and companies.” “The Falcon Heavy shows how far we’ve come,” he said. “There are many new rockets being developed, some light, some superheavy, some in between. That’s the new paradigm we’re in.” The new space race is something stranger than the cold war contest between the US and the Soviet Union. Government agencies, like Nasa, Roscosmos and the European Space Agency, have been collaborating with each other for decades – and now face friendly competition and partnerships with corporations, which have their own long-term goals. “What’s new is that the companies themselves have ambitions beyond government contracts,” said Casey Dreier, director of space policy at the Planetary Society, an advocacy group. He compared it to the Gilded Age, when billionaires sought to single-handedly reshape the future, or at least the marketplace, for good or ill. “There’s really no downside for Nasa,” he said. “They’ve got this new capability at their disposal, and will be wiping away the drool thinking about all the opportunities they have for that rocket to reach out to other planets.” Both SpaceX and Blue Origin are at work on rockets fit for human travel, on very different tracks. Bezos’s company is working on its “New Glenn” rocket, larger than its current reusable New Shepard rocket, which is smaller than the Falcon 9 vehicles that SpaceX has turned into reliable shuttles for Nasa cargo. Musk has set his sets on a device even bigger than the Falcon Heavy: a rocket SpaceX calls the BFR (Big Falcon Rocket), which would take humans deep into space. “Musk’s style is to brag about things and then do them,” Logsdon said. “Bezos’ style is to do things and then brag about them.” Nasa is working on its own super rocket, called the SLS, which would be the most powerful ever designed, and its likely tool for a new space station or deep-space exploration. The agency faces its own hurdles, however: it has gone a year without a confirmed administrator, due to Senate inaction around Donald Trump’s controversial nominee, and for decades Congress has kept Nasa’s funding around only 0.5% of federal spending, a tiny amount compared with social security, defense, or the infusion of money Nasa received during the Apollo era. But the success of the Falcon Heavy, experts said, was one more device in the toolbox for Nasa’s many missions – all the more attractive for its low cost. SpaceX and Blue Origin have made reusable rockets a reliable business for Nasa and telecom companies, and are advertising at a fraction of the price of government rockets. SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rockets operate at an average cost of about $60m per flight, and its Falcon Heavy at a cost of $90m to $160m, depending on modifications. Nasa estimates that its SLS will cost about $1bn or more per flight – the price of reliability and safety over reusability. “We’re finally reaching the point where there’s a robust marketplace,” said Jeff Manber, CEO of the space company Nanoracks. “It won’t just be on the one pillar of government-organized or government-funded.” Manber stressed that in this new market, competitors have to work together, and with governments – their biggest customers – meaning that this new space race, between nations, corporations and billionaires, was about risk, reward and ambition among many diverse players. His own goal is ultimately a private space station, and his company has contracts with Blue Origin and government agencies. “There are races but it’s not a monolithic race,” he said. “It’s not to get the first human to the moon or back. We want to be part of a society moving to space.” And while SpaceX has managed to turn reusable rockets into a routine business within a few years, it has yet to live up to some of Musk’s middling ambitions, never mind his ultimate goal of colonizing Mars. In 2016 SpaceX had a rocket explode on the launchpad, destroying its expensive satellite payload and causing severe damage to the Nasa base. Earlier this year, something mysterious went awry with a US government payload SpaceX launched into orbit. And last year the company announced that two private citizens had booked a trip to travel round the moon, presumably on the Falcon Heavy – a goal Musk walked back dramatically this week. Marcia Smith, an editor at the journal Space Policy, called the Falcon Heavy launch “amazing” but quickly added a caveat to Musk’s goals. “He has a track record of overselling on promises,” she wrote in an email. “And he has never launched a person yet (mannequins don’t count!). The commercial crew flights will be a bellwether for whatever comes next for SpaceX in human spaceflight.” Nasa has set strict safety requirements for human spaceflight, but Congress and the Obama and Trump administrations have taken a light touch to regulating the private space industry. Logsdon, the professor, said that in due time those regulators will face a problem: “whether somebody with enough discretionary money to take a joyride around the moon cares about Nasa’s human safety requirements”. For the moment, however, the experts mostly enjoyed the moment. “SpaceX is pushing the boundaries on what is possible, and upping the ante for others,” Dreier said. “You couldn’t have had a better day for SpaceX.” “Honestly it was just a really exciting day to be a human,” he added. “It’s a reminder of excitement and success, but also a little bit of strangeness to what’s possible. Something kind of weird and fun, because that’s what makes us human.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/05/leeds-paul-heckingbottom-new-manager-barnsley","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-06T11:39:03Z","webTitle":"Leeds leave Barnsley reeling after appointing Paul Heckingbottom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/05/leeds-paul-heckingbottom-new-manager-barnsley","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/05/leeds-paul-heckingbottom-new-manager-barnsley","fields":{"headline":"Leeds leave Barnsley reeling after appointing Paul Heckingbottom","bodyText":"Leeds United have named the Barnsley manager, Paul Heckingbottom, as Thomas Christiansen’s successor at Elland Road. After sacking the Dane on Sunday the club were keen on a swift appointment, with Heckingbottom at the top of the three-man wishlist of chairman Andrea Radrizzani. Heckingbottom signed a new rolling contract with Barnsley on Friday but Leeds activated the release clause and the 40-year-old was confirmed in his new role on Tuesday morning. “The club are shocked at Paul Heckingbottom’s desire to leave, having agreed a new contract last week,” read a Barnsley statement. Chief executive Gauthier Ganaye added: “Yes, it was unexpected. Yes, it has come during an already complicated period. Yes, it will make things more difficult short term, but our club is full of resources and it is certainly not dependent on one man alone.” Christiansen was sacked after a chastening 4-1 home defeat by Cardiff that extended their winless run to seven matches, including an embarrassing third-round FA Cup exit at the hands of Newport County. It is hoped Heckingbottom can rescue Leeds’s assault on the play-offs, a pre-season remit for Christiansen. They are seven points adrift of Bristol City in sixth place and last recorded a league victory on Boxing Day, at Burton Albion. Barnsley are fighting relegation in the second tier and have won one of their past 16 matches but Heckingbottom has established himself as one of the most exciting coaches in the country since taking on the role of head coach on the permanent basis in June 2016. That followed two stints in caretaker charge. He has worked on a modest budget and was influential in the development of the former Barnsley players Alfie Mawson, Mason Holgate and Conor Hourihane. Heckingbottom was of interest to Sunderland before Chris Coleman’s appointment last year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"global-development/2018/feb/07/un-inquiry-alleged-sexual-assault-campaigners","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T07:00:54Z","webTitle":"UN 'grossly mishandled' inquiry into alleged sexual assault, say campaigners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/feb/07/un-inquiry-alleged-sexual-assault-campaigners","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/feb/07/un-inquiry-alleged-sexual-assault-campaigners","fields":{"headline":"UN 'grossly mishandled' inquiry into alleged sexual assault, say campaigners","bodyText":"A UN agency has “grossly mishandled” an investigation into claims of sexual harassment and assault by a high-ranking official, claims the campaign group Code Blue in an open letter to António Guterres, the UN’s secretary general. Last week, UNAids concluded that allegations against Luiz Loures, an assistant secretary general of the UN, and deputy executive director of programme at UNAids, were not substantiated. It is understood that the complainant alleged Loures sexually harassed her, and sexually assaulted her in a lift while away on work travel. In a letter addressed to Guterres, Code Blue alleged that the investigation was undermined by a conflict of interest, with the executive director of UNAids, Michel Sidibé, acting both as a witness and as the “final decision-maker” in the case. The group called for Guterres to review the allegations and hand the investigation over to an “external, neutral and independent body”. A recent Guardian investigation found that many UN employees who have experienced sexual harassment or a sexual assault do not trust the UN’s internal investigations process, which is perceived as biased and ineffective. Many also fear that if they report a complaint they will face retaliation for speaking out, especially if the alleged perpetrator is a senior member of staff. Following the investigation, the Guardian has been contacted by dozens of current and former UN employees, including at UNAids, who allege that they experienced sexual harassment or assault but did not receive justice. The UN said it has a zero tolerance approach to sexual harassment and that it is taking steps to increase the support given to victims. Code Blue called the investigation at UNAids a “gross miscarriage of justice”. Complaints made by UNAids employees are dealt with by the Office of Internal Oversight Services, the UN’s investigations team, which produces a report to be reviewed by a three-person panel within the agency. The panel then presents recommendations to the agency’s executive director, to make a final decision. Code Blue said that Sidibé acted as a witness in the case and that the allegations should have been handled by an external body. In the letter, it said that Sidibé stepped down from his role in convening the panel after he was challenged by the complainant’s lawyer. Instead, he appointed a subordinate to the role, while maintaining his position as “the final decision-maker”. It added that Sidibé was also “questioned by investigators regarding allegations of his intrusion in the case”. The letter described a climate of fear within the agency, where employees are scared to speak out because they fear losing their jobs. In a recent letter to the Guardian Jan Beagle, under secretary general for management who is leading the organisation’s new taskforce on sexual harassment, said that the UN does not “prevent staff from speaking to the media”. Last month, UNAids sent an email to staff advising that they should not respond directly to media enquires, or “circulate emails, web links, tweets, social media links or any other material containing information that is not authenticated by UNAids”. The warning, seen by the Guardian, told staff: “This will protect yourself and the organisation from any possible claims of defamation or libel.” It also provided employees with suggested responses to queries relating to sexual harassment, in case they are approached by partners or stakeholders. Code Blue said the UN’s response to sexual harassment allegations was inadequate. “Every other institution called to account through the movement sparked by #MeToo is rushing to give survivors the benefit of the doubt; only in the United Nations are the victims hounded into resignation and despair.” In a statement, UNAids said that it has a zero tolerance policy for sexual harassment, with clear guidelines and procedures to address allegations and complaints. “The executive director of UNAids has established a special task force entrusted with ensuring an enabling environment for all people to work with dignity and integrity,” it said. All staff and managers undertake a course on preventing and addressing harassment, including sexual harassment, while additional sessions have recently been introduced. It added that UNAids operates a 24-hour, confidential integrity hotline, and that support is also available through the human resources department, the ethics office, staff health and wellbeing services and the office of the ombudsman. UNAids said that staff are not restricted from speaking to the media. It added in a statement: “Guidance to staff was sent while the case was ongoing to avoid compromising the independent investigation and to reinforce the message that UNAids has a zero tolerance policy for sexual harassment and that all formal complaints are thoroughly investigated.” In a statement, the deputy spokesman for the secretary general added that the concerns raised by Code Blue were being taken seriously. Guterres, however, is not directly involved in the case. “The investigation of the alleged conduct and relevant steps to be taken to address such conduct are being handled by the World Health Organization (WHO). This is because employees of UNAids involved in this matter are appointed by the WHO.” The statement added that the secretary general had engaged the heads of UN organisations and had taken steps to prevent and deal with sexual harassment. “These include the launch of a helpline for staff within the secretariat to seek confidential advice, strengthening the protection of whistleblowers, providing more information to staff about how to report sexual harassment, and undertaking a survey among staff to obtain a better information on prevalence and reporting rates.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/feb/06/margaret-atwood-modern-men-need-etiquette-books","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-06T13:17:51Z","webTitle":"Margaret Atwood: modern men need 'etiquette books on how to behave'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/06/margaret-atwood-modern-men-need-etiquette-books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/feb/06/margaret-atwood-modern-men-need-etiquette-books","fields":{"headline":"Margaret Atwood: modern men need 'etiquette books on how to behave'","bodyText":"Margaret Atwood has suggested that men need etiquette books to help them understand what may be expected of them “in the behaviour department”. Speaking to the BBC, the author of The Handmaid’s Tale was asked about her views on the #MeToo movement – having previously caused controversy by writing in January that it was the “symptom of a broken legal system”, and warning that “understandable and temporary vigilante justice can morph into a culturally solidified lynch-mob habit”. Atwood told the BBC that changes needed to be made in three areas: “One of them being courts of law. One of them being large institutions and corporations. And one of them being personal behaviour.” “There used to be a lot of etiquette books on how to behave,” she said. “Those seem to have gone out of the window. We used to be bombarded with them in the 50s. So where is the Mr Manners? There should be a Mr Manners column – like ‘What do you do when ...?’. I think it can help men to understand what may possibly be expected of them in the behaviour department.” Atwood said that these guides could be aimed at “ordinary people who think they’re on a date”, but she steered clear of suggesting what they might contain. “I think we should let younger people deal with that. I’m 78.” She went on to describe the #MeToo movement as a “symptom of something being wrong” rather than an end goal, saying that it works “as a tool or as a weapon, under certain circumstances”. Atwood was one of many writers to sign an open letter in 2016 calling for the University of British Columbia to be investigated over its dismissal of professor and author Steven Galloway, after allegations of sexual misconduct. Signing the letter was one of the reasons she has been vilified as a “misogynistic, rape-enabling Bad Feminist”, she wrote in Canada’s Globe and Mail. Atwood told the BBC that the backlash she experienced was “fairly standard” for “anyone who says anything except ‘I believe anything that a woman says’. But she was clear that “it’s quite dangerous to accord infallibility to any group – including men, popes and women”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/feb/11/give-your-eyes-a-whoosh-colour-beauty","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-11T06:00:38Z","webTitle":"Give your eyes a whoosh | Eva Wiseman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/11/give-your-eyes-a-whoosh-colour-beauty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/11/give-your-eyes-a-whoosh-colour-beauty","fields":{"headline":"Give your eyes a whoosh","bodyText":"Eye gloss is a thing this season.

It was 100 years to the day since some women and all men in Britain got the vote. The office workers, curious tourists and those passing through this key site in central London where many key suffragette rallies took place, were being encouraged to “take a selfie with a Suffragette” and remember the campaigners who helped usher in the passing of the Representation of the People Act. The act gave the vote to all men over 21, and women over 30 who had a degree, owned a house or were married to a householder, and paved the way to universal suffrage 10 years later. The Make A Stand pop-up exhibition in the shadow of Nelson’s Column features 59 life-sized images of campaigners, along with famous rallying cries such as “deeds not words”. These will be etched on the plinth of the new statue of Millicent Fawcett, created by Gillian Wearing, which, when it is unveiled in spring, will be the first statue of a woman in Parliament Square – and the first to be made by a woman. The image – and statue – feature well-known individuals such as Emily Wilding Davison, who died after throwing herself under the king’s horse at the Epsom Derby in 1913, and Emmeline, Christabel, Sylvia and Adela Pankhurst. It also features Annie Kenney, a northern working-class mill worker who was a celebrity suffragette in her time, disabled campaigner Charlotte Despard who faced police violence in WSPU demonstrations, Henrietta Franklin of the Jewish League for Women’s Suffrage, Laurence Housman of the Men’s League for Women’s Suffrage and Sophia Duleep Singh, a princess of the Indian Raj and the goddaughter of Queen Victoria. The images and exhibition hoped to highlight the breadth and depth of the women’s suffrage movement, said the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. One of the 52 tiles which feature the images and will go along the base of Wearing’s statue of Fawcett is blank, but honours working-class suffrage speaker Jessie Craigen. “We all know the famous suffragists and suffragettes, but they’re all from a certain background,” he said. “Actually, the working classes were involved in this campaign as well.” Khan, a self-declared “proud feminist”, added that the centenary year should be seized as an opportunity to further women’s rights, pointing out that the gender pay gap in London remains at 14.6%, down only half a percentage point from 15.1% 20 years ago. “It’s a fact that life chances, career prospects, pay – these are all affected by your gender. That can’t be right in 2018 in the most progressive city in the world,” he said. Historian Lucy Worsley, dressed in full suffragette regalia, said it was a moment to commemorate as well as honour those who fought for the vote. “A lot of these women paid a very heavy price, with their health, in their family life – this isn’t just a celebration it’s also about remembering the sacrifices they made,” she said. “I’m sure that some of these women would be looking at the world today and thinking there hasn’t been as much progress made as they would have hoped.” Justine Simons, deputy mayor for culture and the creative industries, said she felt “very emotional” looking at the images of some of the key people involved in the fight for universal suffrage. “I’m struck by just how long it took – half a century of campaigning for women to get the vote, you can barely believe it,” she said. “And the job is not done yet. We are incredulous that women couldn’t vote 100 years ago, but we have to be equally incredulous that there is still not gender equality. Achieving that cannot take another 100 years.” One hundred years after some women won the right to vote, the fight for political equality had to continue, said Frances Scott, founder of the 50:50 Parliament group, which has launched the #AskHerToStand campaign to get more women into parliament. “Men still dominate the corridors of power, outnumbering women by more than 2:1 in parliament,” she said. “At this rate it will take over 50 years for women to have equal seats and equal say in parliament. That is too long to wait.” What today means to me Emma Thomas, 26, office worker from Norwich It reminds you in the current climate with Trump and Brexit that this is what progress looks like. It’s good to celebrate what they did, but it’s also a call to arms. It’s like they are saying to you: “if we managed to get votes in our time, you can make a difference in yours”. John Subbiah, 67, lay chaplain at St Martin in the fields I admire these women hugely – they played a very important role in politics and in gaining rights for women around the world. I wanted to come down here today because I wanted to honour them. Alison Manning, 63, charity worker for the MND Association I was part of the feminist movement in the 70s and I thought we’d be a lot further on than this. We’ve always lived in a patriarchy and we still do. Seeing these images makes me remember that these women were willing to put their lives on the line and paved the way for us, but too many of us take that for granted. Robert Spicer, 70, retired lawyer My mum was born in 1928 – the year all women got the vote – but in her day a letter from the bank would be addressed to her father. It seems totally ridiculous now. Lucy Spouncer, 16, student I think it’s great that all the people who worked so hard for women’s rights are being remembered. I’m so grateful to them, and looking at their images it actually makes me feel more confident. I think even today they inspire us to speak out – don’t be silent, because standing up for what you think is right is the only way things are going to change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/feb/06/stock-markets-dow-jones-five-key-factors","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-06T19:12:32Z","webTitle":"Stock market sell-off: five factors that explain the global plunge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/06/stock-markets-dow-jones-five-key-factors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/feb/06/stock-markets-dow-jones-five-key-factors","fields":{"headline":"Stock market sell-off: five factors that explain the global plunge","bodyText":"After three days of volatility and sell-offs in the global equity markets, analysts are still attempting to explain the mood swing. It is inexplicable, on the face of it, that an optimistic US jobs report on Friday would trigger a strong negative reaction. But in her final interview after four years as Fed chair, Janet Yellen noted that stock market valuations were high – even though she could not say if they represented a bubble. But there are also other factors at play: 1 Rising wages Over the past four years, the US economy has added 10 million jobs, bringing the overall unemployment rate to its lowest level since 2000. Now wages are beginning to rise: more than half of US states have recorded growth of 3% or more. In his State of the Union address last week, Trump said Americans were “finally seeing rising wages” after “years and years” of stagnation. Sensing new inflationary pressure, investors became spooked. 2 Interest rates Rates have been kept low for two decades, flushing economies with liquidity and causing bubbles to inflate, pop and form again. There’s nothing economists like more than bubble-hunting, and nothing pops bubbles faster that interest rates rises. The Fed has signaled three rate increases this year, and maybe a fourth – posing a continuing risk to the years-long rally in stocks. 3 Government deficit The yearly US deficit could hit $1tn in 2018, and that’s before Trump’s radical tax-cutting agenda is felt. According to the joint committee on taxation, government revenues will drop by $135bn this year, will be down $280bn in 2019. But spending is set to increase, including billions on disaster aid for California wildfires and Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. Trump says he is not worried: he believes the repatriation of corporate profits will help correct the imbalance. 4 Profit taking It is puzzling to analysts that the money coming out of the markets is not necessarily going into government treasuries or other safe havens. That suggests investors are also simply taking out profit after an intense market rally at the beginning of this year. Despite recording its biggest-ever one-day points drop on Monday, the Dow was less than 5% off its record highs in late January. That suggests there is still money on the table. “While the fall in global equity markets looks dramatic, it is no more dramatic than the record rises we have seen since the end of November,” said Jacob Deppe of the online trading platform Infinox. 5 The machines The excitable traders of previous eras have been largely replaced by computers running complex mathematical algorithms. Just after 3pm on Monday the Dow recorded a 900-point drop in 10 minutes, a pace of sell orders that took the index from 700 down to 1,600 points down. That acceleration looks like the work of automated quant strategies, or possibly a “fat finger” – someone making a mistake."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/feb/10/saturdays-best-tv-hard-sun-modus","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-10T06:00:51Z","webTitle":"Saturday’s best TV: Hard Sun; Modus","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/10/saturdays-best-tv-hard-sun-modus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/10/saturdays-best-tv-hard-sun-modus","fields":{"headline":"Saturday’s best TV: Hard Sun; Modus","bodyText":"Hard Sun 9.30pm, BBC One Neil Cross’s end-times thriller concludes its first season (the writer has said he’d like to do five) with all the frantic helping of showdowns, revelations and double-crosses that a finale demands.

Age: 89. Appearance: Somewhat two-dimensional. Is that just your opinion? No, absolutely everyone was saying it. And who is absolutely everyone? Everyone who met her at the annual Oscar nominees lunch. I would have thought the guest list at the annual Oscar nominees lunch was traditionally restricted to that year’s Oscar nominees. Agnès Varda was among them: the 89-year-old French film-maker received her first nomination, in the best documentary feature category, for her short film Faces Places (Visages Villages), chronicling a road trip she made round France with street artist and co-director JR. Huh. She doesn’t sound that two-dimensional. Forgive me. By “two-dimensional” I did not mean shallow or lacking the depth born of considered thought and long experience. What did you mean? I meant no more than a few millimetres thick when viewed side-on. So she’s dangerously thin? To be clear: Varda was unable to attend the Oscar lunch, and sent along several life-size cardboard cutouts of herself instead. Why several? To include a range of varied, photo-friendly poses. Created by her 34-year-old collaborator JR, the cutouts included one with her holding a cat, and one where she appeared to adjust JR’s hat as they stood together. You know what? I like the sound of Agnès Varda. Indeed, she was arguably the most popular person at the event, hanging out with Meryl Streep and Greta Gerwig. But 89 is a bit old for your first nomination, isn’t it? Did she come to film-making late? If she wins, Varda will be the oldest Oscar-holder ever (James Ivory, also nominated this year for writing Call Me By Your Name, is eight days younger), but she’s no newcomer. She was a central figure in the French New Wave, alongside Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut, and made her first feature-length film, La Pointe Courte, in 1955. Perversely, the actual, 3D Agnès Varda sounds like the most interesting lunch companion ever. Indeed, among other things, she is said to be one of only six people to attend Jim Morrison’s burial.

The absolute fastest way down.” If you hit it, he said, you destroy the track record. “The catch is that you never do.” Holcomb was the best bobsled pilot of his generation. He measured his success by inches and regretted every little error. For Holcomb, bob racing was about making quick fixes, corrections to get the sled back where he wanted it to be. “You only hit that perfect line the whole way down once or twice in your entire career. But it’s there and it’s what everybody’s striving for.” Holcomb always said anyone could drive a sled. I never really believed him. Bobsledding seemed to me a lesson in the inadequacy of language. It’s only once you have ridden in one that you realise how little words can tell you about what it’s really like. A four-man bob shakes like a tin of paint in the mixer by the backdoor of the hardware store, pulls more G-force than a drag racer, and travels so fast that by the time your mind has mapped one curve your body is already through the next. “Really,” Holcomb promised, “it’s pretty simple. The curve goes right, you pull right, the curve goes left, you pull left.” So, yes, he said, anyone can drive a sled. The hard part is learning to race one. The closest thing to it, Holcomb thought, was flying a stunt plane in an airshow. Because in a bob, all the driver sees are the great white walls of the track, just as a pilot only catches glimpses of the ground and sky. There are few visual cues to tell you what to do and when to do it. Which is why Holcomb was able to become one of the best sled racers in the US even though his eyesight was so bad he was not legally allowed to drive. He suffered from keratoconus, which causes progressive blindness. His vision was 20/600, so bad that the strongest contacts couldn’t help him see clearly. When he finally found a cure for the disease, he became one of the best bobsled racers on the planet, the world and an Olympic champion. He won the Olympic gold at Vancouver in 2010 and two bronze medals at Sochi in 2014. He should have been a contender at Pyeongchang, too. Holcomb died last May in his bed at the Olympic training facility in Lake Placid. He was 37. The coroner’s report said the likely cause was pulmonary congestion and that he had high quantities of alcohol and sleeping pills in his system. His family want to keep the details of his death private. In his autobiography, But Now I See, Holcomb wrote at length about his struggle with clinical depression and revealed how he had once tried to take his own life by overdosing on whisky and prescription pills. I met Holcomb when I was researching a book on another great American bobsledder, Billy Fiske. Holcomb was happy to give up his time to a stranger, even one who knew nothing about his sport. Early on, I wanted to summon up a little technical knowledge to impress him so asked if it was right that a sled should run “high in, low out” of a curve. He smiled and told me to stop quoting Cool Runnings. “John Candy couldn’t have given any worse advice. You would crash on the first curve.” There are no rules for how to race a sled, Holcomb said, because “every track is different, each has its own personality”. But there were principles, qualities a pilot needed. The first, he said, was speed, specifically “an understanding of how to generate it using G-forces”, where to turn and when to wait, how long and how late. This was something “some guys pick up really quickly, some develop over years, and some never do figure out.” He learned it as a kid on the ski slopes in Park City, Utah. In baseball, Holcomb would always try to steal bases, in soccer he’d want to skin the winger. Whatever he was doing, he wanted to know how fast he could go. On skis, the answer was not fast enough. He was good, but not good enough to compete in the Olympics. He was 17 when he realised. It was then, he wrote later, he “felt the first pangs of depression, like a yoke on my shoulders, pushing me down.” Bobsledding became his way to keep chasing the Olympic dream. Of course Holcomb was not the only quick kid on the bob circuit but then speed is not all you need to succeed. “There are a lot of great drivers, they are passionate, they love the sport, they know what they are doing, but they don’t want to take the risk. They don’t want to push it. They’re more worried about getting down safely than they are about winning.” The best are the ones who push the sled right to the very edge and hold it there, riding the line. An inch one way and the sled goes over, an inch the other and it slows. On the start line Holcomb’s attitude was: “I’m not holding back. We are going to win this, and if not, we are going to crash. Because I am not here to finish fifth.” In his 20s he doubled up his bobsledding with a career in the National Guard. He was a combat engineer, specialising in demolition. So he had what he described as “a healthy working relationship with fear”. But fear comes in different forms. And Holcomb learned there are kinds you can’t master, kinds that creep irresistibly into your life. Like the coming of blindness. It started when a botched laser eye surgery exacerbated his undiagnosed keratoconus. His vision grew worse week by week. For years, Holcomb felt he could not tell his team-mates or coaches what was happening to him, worried they would kick him off the team. He taught himself to use his other senses to drive the sled. He learned to feel his way down a run, “as gravity and speed pulled us in and out of turns”. Away from the track, he shut himself in his room. He suffered “pangs of something strange and heavy and dark”. He miraculously survived an attempt to take his own life. Soon after, Holcomb did finally open up to his coach, who helped him find a doctor offering a new, experimental procedure. It worked. Now he could see. But it was the skills he learned racing blind, the sense of touch and feel, that made him so good. So in the end he found a way to beat that fear, too. But the depression was not so easy to cure. It became “a familiar old friend that I simultaneously dreaded and welcomed”. Getting his eyesight back did not drive it away, nor did winning gold. Life is not an easy steer. And, right to the end, Steve Holcomb was still searching for that perfect line, the one that is so hard to find. In the UK Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

He loops the wrap over my thumb and across the back of my hand, wrapping it around my wrist three times before wrapping it around my knuckles three times. He looks at me and says: “You do the other hand.” I stare at his handiwork and panic. I can’t remember anything he’s done. I already feel intimidated being here. He laughs and wraps my other hand for me. “You’ll get it eventually,” he says. “But you should learn to do it. Protect your wrists.” He points at a wall of gloves and I pick some that look about right. They stink. They smell of the sweat of many boxers. I place one hand in one and then immediately take it out to scratch my nose. Now my nostrils stink of the sweat of many other boxers. The trainer begins by getting us to shadow box. He tells us we’ll feel stupid doing it to begin with, but the sooner we treat it as part of the process, the better. “Remember,” he says, “the first person you box is yourself.” Which sounds vaguely as if it makes sense, but it doesn’t really. Either way I show willing and attempt to box myself. I am rooted to the spot, staring at myself in the mirror. I feel self-conscious. I jab and I throw a cross, jab and cross, jab and cross, repeated, with no variation. I watch as more seasoned boxers glide around the whole gym, throwing multiple combos, forwards, backwards, hooks and uppercuts, their footwork light, their shoulders pivoting to bring force to each blow. The trainer asks me if I’m planning to be hit. I ask what he means. “Well, you’re simulating a fight. Did you think you’re gonna have all the shots?” “I suppose not,” I say. “You also planning on staying still?” he asks. I shake my head. “You need to move around…” I try again, this time slipping side to side, dodging imaginary punches. But still, as I watch myself in the mirror, I’m stiff. Then I feel something sting as it wrenches down my back. I turn around and realise, through my moving about, that I’ve backed into someone skipping rope. When we split into pairs, to go through the combinations the trainer demonstrates, I end up being paired with a man who is around 7ft tall. We are preposterously mismatched. “Feel free to hit me hard,” he says. “It’s my first time,” I say. “I’m not sure I know how to.” “Just hit me as hard as you can,” he says. The instructor reminds us all that this is a technique class so light taps, not actual punches. My partner says I can ignore the instructor. He asks why I’m here and I say it’s partly self-defence, partly exercise. He laughs and says: “You’d better hit me hard then.” As I attempt the combination the trainer has called out, my partner pushes me. It causes me to mis-hit him – on his nose. I drop my gloves and ask if he’s OK. He tells me he’s fine. He pushes me again and I land some shots on target, not powerful, but on target at least. He tells me to be harder. I don’t like this. I think, this isn’t for me. Before I started boxing, I’d had many conversations with friends and family about my fears. Will the gyms be oozing with toxic masculinity? How much do I have to change my entire lifestyle? Can I even do this without sparring? I don’t want to spar. Entering the gym, I’d been buoyed by how diverse it was – lots of men and women, lots of people from different backgrounds, J Hus was pumping out of the stereo. I felt comfortable. Until this guy demanded I hit him harder. He pushes me again. I trip and fall to the ground. He takes a glove off and pulls me up. I question whether I should have come. I’m not sure this is for me.

About a week later, calling to apologise, he told me he’d had an overdose, accidentally injecting a lethal cocktail of venom from three snakes. A lot has been written about Steve Ludwin, widely known as the man who injects snake venom, and lately his life has turned into a non-stop frenzy of international journalists and film crews revelling in the seeming sheer insanity of it. Steve was once my great love; an animal lover, vegan and musician who wrote songs for Placebo and Ash, and played the Reading festival with Nirvana. In between tours and recordings he dabbled with snake venom. In his latest incarnation as a self-taught snake expert, moulding himself into the role of a lifetime, he appears as a kind of living specimen and star in a short film at the Natural History Museum’s new exhibition, Venom: Killer and Cure. “How cool is that? You normally have to be dead or a fossil to be in a museum,” says Steve, now 51, as we sit in his in Kennington flat, with its roof terrace offering glimmers of the London Eye and Parliament. He lives there with his Australian banker girlfriend Suzy, Russian blue cat Pushkin, a rare iguana and several snakes. He’s been shooting, swallowing and scratching venom into his skin from some of the world’s deadliest snakes for 30 years. “Snakes are fucking everywhere. The symbol for medicine is two snakes. They’re ingrained in our brain and DNA,” he tells me, proudly insisting that he hasn’t been ill for decades and has developed “a superhuman immune system”. And it’s tempting to believe him. He does look undeniably fit. The first time he did it was in October 1988 and he showed me his swollen wrist. I refused to indulge him and thought he was stoned. Today, Steve laughs at the memory. “Not really… well maybe,” he says. “But you know I’ve always loved snakes. I had no idea what it would do to me, but I knew it’d been done before and was curious to see if it was possible to become immune to snake venom.” Now, ironically, Steve is on the cusp of something monumental, the development of a human-derived anti-venom that could potentially save many thousands of human and animal lives. “When I was 17,” he says, “I knew I was going to inject snake venom in the future. I felt like Richard Dreyfuss in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, when he had that feeling ‘this means something’. It took many years and accidents of messing around with it to finally make sense.” He looks down at his arms, showing the maze of track marks. “I look like a junkie. You can see all the incisions.” After university, Steve and I lived in Islington with our cream-tabby cat Tad and a couple of friends. Our house was a zoo, with our potbellied pig Lou who loved the Velvet Underground, a ginger-and-white rat Moo-Moo whom I saved from the fangs of a copperhead, a pair of rescued iguanas, a vicious baby caiman crocodile and a terrifying assortment of snakes and scorpions. But for us, to live among wild animals was all we ever wanted. While pursing his music career, Steve had his dream day job, handling reptiles at the Vivarium in Walthamstow. The pet shop had a back room with venomous snakes. And it wasn’t long before he began bringing home rattlesnakes, copperheads and vipers with enough venom to kill our entire street. I started an indie-music glossy called Lime Lizard and everyone and their mates showed up at our Victorian terrace, turning it into a den for drugs, debauched rockers and deadly snakes. Inevitably there were accidents: a fugitive snake that reappeared through the floorboards eight months later; diamondback rattlers left carelessly beneath a baseball cap on our bed that our flatmate nearly sat on. I got bitten by a tarantula that left me swollen, bruised and hallucinating for days, and almost crushed by a boa constrictor after Steve draped it around me for a photo. Steve and I met in February 1986 at Eckerd College, a small liberal-arts school on a sun-struck sliver of Florida coast. I was there as a transfer student from UC Berkeley for my one and only semester. I lived in the same co-ed dorm as Steve. One evening, walking back from dinner, I heard New Order’s Temptation blaring from his room and started dancing outside his window. We took one look at each other and that was it. He looked like the all-American boy – tall, lithe, chiselled, with a floppy fringe and faint dusting of freckles – except he was anything but. Steve was born on an air force base in Los Angeles. His father, Ray, was a pilot for Pan Am, who met his beautiful Canadian mother, Jacqueline, when she was a stewardess. Growing up with two sisters in New Milford, a sleepy Connecticut town, he lived next door to Eartha Kitt, the original Catwoman in the 60s Batman TV show. I knew Steve was a stoner, but he was funny and engaging, had a cool New-Romantics haircut and great taste in music. I remember being struck by his handsome face, his quirkiness and intensity: he believed in aliens, the deep state and punk as a philosophy. That night we went to a smoky indie club, dancing to the Violent Femmes and Psychedelic Furs until 4am and skipping morning classes. That was the start of our love affair and deep and enduring friendship. Neither of us realised it then, but it was a really romantic time. On our second date, sitting on his bed, I felt something brush against my ankle and thought: “Perfect, he has a cat.” Glancing down, an 8ft boa, thick as a motorbike tire, slithered from under the bed. I screamed and shot out of his room. When Steve calmed me down, taking my hand like a small child and showing me the satiny-softness of the boa, I lost my fear of an animal that had previously terrified me, and eventually fell in love with lizards, too, even naming my magazine after them. At the end of term, Steve was keen to show me Costa Rica, where he’d lived as a student. Soon enough, we found ourselves alone among iguanas, parrots and howler-monkeys on the deserted beaches of Manuel Antonio, traipsing bare-legged through remote rainforests filled with ultra-territorial predators like jaguars and pumas, and the baddest killers on earth: toxic frogs, spiders and snakes like the deadly bushmaster, which I nearly tread on, and crossing into Nicaragua to see the sea turtles in Tortuguero during the Sandinista-Contra conflict that was terrifying to everyone but us. Before we even got on the dodgy fisherman’s boat from Limón, we could hear gunfire and mortars exploding in the distance. Steve, unfazed, said, “Fuck it, we have to die sometime,” and I went along for the adventure. Steve bought a T-shirt off the back of a Sandinista rebel for $50. Like many college kids steeped in left-wing politics in Reagan’s America, we were rebelling against the pervasive conservatism and generation that ran our lives, searching for something authentic. Our arrival in London happened to coincide with the late-80s underground scene exploding with bands like the Stone Roses, which for our generation felt like the 60s. Steve and I stayed together for seven mostly happy years and I remember it vividly – the gigs, stage-diving to Mudhoney and the Pixies and dancing at the Syndrome, an after-hours club on Oxford Street, hanging out with bands like Ride and Blur. When Steve was “unsure what to do with the rest of his life” at 20, I encouraged him to pick up a guitar and write music. Months later, he auditioned for My Bloody Valentine. Inspired by the Beatles, REM and Black Flag, he started several semi-successful indie groups before landing a million-pound deal with Island Records with his band Carrie. When an unscrupulous music-industry figure stole my magazine Lime Lizard, I was so crushed I couldn’t get out of bed for a month. Steve, in his laid-back way, said: “You have three choices: either you rot in bed like Brian Wilson; we can pay Bradley [one of his rough East End gangster mates] to break his legs; or you forget about it and create something else. Why don’t you write a book about your favourite band Nirvana, you know they’ll be huge?” I knocked out a proposal and asked my best friend Victoria Clarke, who was a little lost at the time, to write it with me. We instantly found an agent and a big publishing deal in 1991, before Nevermind was released. As Steve and I were finding our way into adulthood – between the daily grind, drugs and groupies (he had crazed Japanese fans showing up on our doorstep at all hours, leaving love notes and giant teddy bears that terrified our cat) – our relationship ran its course. But we remained friends long after breaking up. Steve was always insanely restless and curious and, in some ways, wilfully destructive. So I was hardly surprised when he had his venom overdose. He initially refused to go to hospital, fearing his snakes would be taken away. Instead, he sat down to watch David Attenborough’s series Life in Cold Blood about reptiles, over a Chinese takeaway, while his hand blew up into the size of baseball mitt. “I started thinking: ‘Wow, this is crazy. I could easily die here,’” he says, remembering feeling a pain with the intensity of “being stung by a thousand bees”. “But I was happy and didn’t care,” he adds. “I’d had such a great life. When they say your life flashes by, I saw all the good bits and felt them, all the rock’n’roll moments, every great gig I went to or played. This is what intrigues me about snake venom, that scientists say there are compounds in certain venoms that help its victims accept and relax into death. I felt that first-hand.” The next morning the swelling had worsened. “My arm was all red and doughy with a sack of liquid hanging from it and I could see the blood vessels appear. It was like something out of Evil Dead. It’s evolution telling you to stay away. Why do you think monkeys, dogs and everyone is instinctively scared of snakes?” When he finally went to hospital, the NHS doctors had never treated a snakebite victim, let alone someone with the venom of three different snakes coursing through their bloodstream. “They didn’t know what to do,” Steve says, when he had to tell the stunned A&amp;E nurses he deliberately injected himself. The doctors put him on the phone to a renowned snake expert, who Steve recalls telling: “‘I used a Northern Pacific rattlesnake, an eyelash viper and a green tree viper from Asia.’ And he just said: ‘Well, you’re screwed. There isn’t an anti-venom because you used three different species.’ Then he said: ‘You’re probably going to die or, at best, lose your arm.’” The doctors suggested “cutting his arm wide open in a fasciotomy” to release the pressure. “I said: ‘Fuck that, I’d rather die.’ The snakes that I used had a hemotoxin, which destroys red blood cells, and that’s why people’s legs and limbs fall off in Central America.” They gave him the anti-venom CroFab to target the rattlesnake venom that most likely caused all the problems. After three days in intensive care with no improvement Steve, pulling out his IV, discharged himself. Contrary to all their dire predictions, his hand, aside from the bruising, was back to normal a week later. “The doctors were shocked when I went back. They’d never seen a recovery like it. I thought: ‘Cool, this shit’s working.’” Convinced his miraculous recovery was down to his self-immunisation, Steve became more fervent. He cheerfully admits mixing black mamba, cobra and puff-adder venom like the ingredients of an exotic cocktail and then, dizzied on pain and adrenaline, skateboarding through London traffic. “It made me feel invincible,” he says. “I was living like a madman. It got to the point where I was injecting almost daily, my legs, all over my body because you don’t want to do a lot of damage in one area as it could destroy nerves.” He had literally turned himself into a science experiment, but there was a point to his madness. “For the past four years, I’ve been flying to Copenhagen to give blood and last year I had a bone-marrow operation. They drilled into my lower spine to take out bone marrow. It took me two months to recover.” Researchers at the University of Copenhagen have recently created an artificial library of antibodies, the Ludwin Library, generated by Steve’s immune system in response to the toxic injections, to develop the first human-derived anti-venom. “What most people don’t realise is that anti-venom has been taken from horses’ blood for more than 100 years and sometimes snakebite victims die anyway, because their bodies reject it. When I walked into one of those blood farms and saw about 60 horses with holes in their necks being injected with venom, and with massive bags draining out blood, I was very emotional, knowing what they were going through.” The World Health Organization considers venomous snakebites among the most neglected tropical diseases, killing more 125,000 people a year. “Anti-venom is very expensive. Pharmaceutical companies see it as a developing-world problem and have slowed the production, so snake fatalities are rising. These Danish scientists will solve that problem quickly by using technology and having found an idiot like me who spent decades injecting himself.” His audacity and inventiveness is part of Steve’s appeal. “You could ask me why I’m continuing to inject. But my drive now is to come up with other ideas. People don’t self-experiment enough. Scientists are now saying using toxins, if you get it right, can have beneficial side effects to your body that slow ageing. It’s like a Jane Fonda workout video for my immune system.” “I’m the happiest I’ve ever been,” he reflects, cranking up Adam Ant’s Puss ’n Boots and grabbing Pushkin, who’s high on catnip. He wanders out on to the terrace, lifting the cat over his head to show him London. “If those scientists win the Nobel Prize for medicine and I get recognition, that would be sweet.” Venom: Killer and Cure is at the National History Museum until 13 May.

And frankly it’s hard to disagree, even though she must realise that a weakened Theresa May is unlikely to step in where John Major and David Cameron failed. Soubry isn’t alone among grassroots Tories in feeling she couldn’t stay in a party led by Jacob Rees-Mogg nor in tearing her hair out at the prospect of what once seemed a joke candidacy being taken seriously. She may well be a Tory Cassandra, a prophet of electoral doom whose fate is to be both right and ignored. But when she described her internal opponents as “not proper Tories”, alarm bells began to ring. There is absolutely nothing conservative, at least with a small “c”, about the hard Brexiters’ wrecking-ball tactics and precious little “one nation” about pressing on regardless of economic pain. But if Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson are not “proper” Tories, then who is? They may not be Soubry’s kind of Tories. They may not be to the electorate’s taste either, given the response May got for campaigning on their hard Brexit vision. But Rees-Mogg is a grassroots darling now. It is hard to dismiss his camp as a fringe when parliament holds 35 of them while diehard pro-Europeans are barely into double figures. This may well not be the party Soubry joined, as a moderate and pragmatic politician, or the party many want to vote for in marginal constituencies like hers. But it’s what the Conservative party has become, over many years of constituency associations favouring Eurosceptic candidates – and that’s why Soubry and those who sympathise with her have reached a fork in the road. It is not for any one MP to start defining who is and isn’t a “proper” believer, or demand the expulsion of fellow elected politicians – no matter how wrong, infuriating or reckless – for anything but gross misconduct. And besides, raising the prospect of MPs being expelled on ideological grounds merely invites her enemies to return the favour; to call for the Ken Clarkes and Nicky Morgans and Anna Soubrys to be booted out instead, on the grounds that they’re no longer mainstream. At this rate, fears of a “blue Momentum” movement emerging, with former Ukip voters returning to the Tory grassroots fold only to start aggressively agitating for deselections, could soon be reality. And she’s smart enough to know it, so perhaps this was simply a last cry for help from an MP who feels herself being pushed inexorably towards the door and hates it. Those mocking her for getting emotional about it need to understand that feeling forced out of one’s political home is an emotional business, not to be taken lightly on either side. But the mythical cavalry many centrists long for, a new party emerging and forging a winning coalition of the sensible, isn’t coming over the hill – and the only useful lesson from Labour’s experience is that ducking the choice for too long before eventually triggering a half-cocked revolt doesn’t work. So it’s back to the choice that always faces the politically marginalised in the end: stay and fight, probably unsuccessfully, or leave everything to what you regard as the wolves. Stick, or twist. There may no longer be any better choices. • Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/2018/feb/12/weatherwatch-extreme-flooding-on-rise-in-europe-over-past-20-years","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-12T21:30:25Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: Extreme flooding on rise in Europe over past 20 years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/feb/12/weatherwatch-extreme-flooding-on-rise-in-europe-over-past-20-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/feb/12/weatherwatch-extreme-flooding-on-rise-in-europe-over-past-20-years","fields":{"headline":"Weatherwatch: Extreme flooding on rise in Europe over past 20 years","bodyText":"For the inhabitants of the Cumbrian village of Glenridding, the winter of 2015/16 was a miserable one. Storm Desmond brought the first deluge in December, turning the river into a raging torrent, sweeping through many properties, and cutting the village off from the outside world for a full two days. Storm Eva barrelled in a few weeks later, and Glenridding ended up awash three times in the space of four weeks. So what is going on? Are extreme climate events becoming more frequent, or were the residents of Glenridding suffering a series of unlucky rolls of the dice? To answer this question, Wouter Berghuijs, from ETH Zurich, and colleagues have been analysing streamflow statistics from all over the world, and totting up the number of extreme events in each catchment. They have found that European rivers have experienced a 44% increase in extreme floods since 1995, suggesting that global warming has played a role. Writing in the journal Environmental Research Letters, the scientists conclude that flood history is not a reliable predictor for future flood risk, and climate change needs to be taken into account too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/feb/11/are-you-self-disciplined-or-impulsive-personality-quiz","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-11T06:00:37Z","webTitle":"Are you self-disciplined or impulsive?

The network aims to promote cross-collaboration between Jeremy Corbyn-supporting councils such as Haringey, as well as Salford and Preston, before local council elections take place in May. It will also offer female councillors peer mentoring to overcome the specific barriers women face in becoming councillors. Momentum will hold councillor training days in Manchester, Birmingham and London in March when it will train council candidates on community-based campaigning and organising. It hopes to establish a network where Corbyn-supporting councillors can share experience and policy ideas that have worked in their local areas to counter drastic cuts from central government. The group has pointed to the work of Labour councils in Salford, where councillors are increasing the wages of care workers by 10% and planning to build nearly 1,000 new homes, and in Preston, where they have nearly tripled the amount of money spent by government services in the area. “In Preston and Salford Labour councils are forging a new gold standard in local governance, putting residents and ordinary workers ahead of those multinational corporations who see cash strapped councils as another opportunity to turn a quick profit at the expense of local residents,” said Momentum’s national coordinator, Laura Parker. “Our councillor network is a unique initiative that will help councillors communicate and collaborate more easily, so they can come up with creative, radical solutions to the savage cuts to local government inflicted by this Conservative government.” In a speech last weekend, Corbyn urged Labour to welcome “young energy” into the party after the Haringey council leader, Claire Kober, announced she was quitting after a campaign of “sexism and bullying” by Corbyn’s supporters over the Haringey Development Vehicle, a controversial £2bn deal with a private property developer. Rows within the local party escalated and Kober was ordered by Labour’s national executive committee (NEC) to pause plans after an outcry among many residents in the borough. The NEC was criticised for getting too involved in local policy, but Corbyn suggested the intervention was a one-off in exceptional circumstances. “It has been a unique situation, which is why the NEC unanimously asked the council leadership to put their plans on hold and take part in a mediation process – to bring everyone together,” he said. “Because when we bring people together and listen to everyone’s voices, we make better decisions. Democracy creates better outcomes for communities … Regeneration must put local people first, not property speculators.” The training programme harks back to the 2017 general election, when Momentum trained activists in marginal constituencies to campaign for Labour. “What’s happening is that local Labour members across the country are choosing candidates for the upcoming council elections they feel best represent their communities,” Parker told the Guardian on Tuesday. “In Haringey, this has meant candidates from across the party who want to do better than another outsourced, privately run redevelopment project that will see family homes demolished, libraries and schools privatised and no social housing built in their place. “We’re seeing the beginning of the end of this toxic outsourcing culture, and the driving force behind this change is ordinary people who care deeply about their local community.” Data shows that only 36.7% of Labour councillors are women (29.1% of Conservative councillors). According to the IPPR, only 17% of council leaders are women, and to achieve equal numbers of male and female councillors more women will need to be elected – an increase of over 50%. Beth Foster-Ogg, Momentum’s training coordinator, said: “It is shameful that only 17% of council leaders are women and our council network will play its part in changing that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/06/i-miss-the-nhs-every-day-trump-is-wrong-to-demonise-british-healthcare","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-06T13:39:14Z","webTitle":"I miss the NHS every day – Trump is wrong to demonise British healthcare | Arwa Mahdawi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/06/i-miss-the-nhs-every-day-trump-is-wrong-to-demonise-british-healthcare","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/06/i-miss-the-nhs-every-day-trump-is-wrong-to-demonise-british-healthcare","fields":{"headline":"I miss the NHS every day – Trump is wrong to demonise British healthcare","bodyText":"What is the first thing you would do if you won the lottery? For Donald Savastano, a 51-year-old carpenter who won $1m in the New York lottery a few weeks ago, it was to go to the doctor. Savastano had been feeling ill for ages but, as he didn’t have health insurance, he hadn’t been able to afford a doctor’s appointment. Following his win, however, he could splurge on luxuries such as healthcare! So, Savastano went for a checkup. It turned out he had stage four cancer and he died shortly after. If there is a moral to this bleak story it is that the US health “care” system is morally bankrupt. There are 28 million uninsured people in the US. It is one of the richest countries in the world and yet a significant proportion of its population cannot afford access to basic health services; even Americans with health insurance are crippled by the costs of medical coverage. Even if you don’t have any medical issues, healthcare can be a constant source of worry. I am middle-class and healthy, but, as a freelancer, I can barely afford health insurance in the US. I spend $480 (£345) a month on one of the cheapest healthcare options available. There is a $7,350 (£5,825) deductible, which means that I must pay all my medical expenses until I have spent that amount. If I actually had any health problems, my premiums would be much higher. I do not exaggerate when I say I miss the NHS every day. Despite the sick state of their health system, many Americans seem to labour under the delusion think that privatised medicine is inherently superior to publicly funded health care. For years, the NHS has been used by conservative Americans as a cautionary tale of “socialised” medicine. When Obama was attempting to widen access to healthcare via the Affordable Care Act (colloquially known as Obamacare) in 2009, rightwing US groups spent millions of dollars on ads that painted Brits as “trapped” by an evil NHS. Today, with Trump in the White House, rightwing Americans are seizing upon the current NHS crisis as propaganda to try to reverse Obamacare. Earlier this year, for example, the New York Times published a story about the strain the NHS was under; Bret Stephens, a conservative columnist for the paper, swiftly tweeted the story out with the commentary “What single-payer looks like in Britain.” (Single-payer is a phrase frequently used by Americans to mean government-provided healthcare.) The NHS crisis, of course, is an example of what austerity and a Conservative government look like in the UK, but many American opportunists are ignoring those inconvenient facts. The latest example of ill-informed American NHS-bashing came on Monday, when Trump sent out a tweet that implied Brits had been marching to protest against the NHS at the weekend. The president stated Britain’s broken health system should serve as an example to Democrats looking to push Universal Health Care in the US. As large numbers of people promptly informed Trump over Twitter, the reason people were marching over the weekend was to try and save the NHS, not to axe it. Even in crisis the NHS is vastly superior to the US’s inefficient, inequitable system. As Bernie Sanders pointed out in an op-ed for the Guardian last year, the US spends almost $10,000 (£7,200) per capita each year on healthcare; Canadians spend $4,533 (£3,262); the French $4,530; and the British $4,125 (£2,970). And yet, despite this enormous spending, Americans pay the highest prices around the world for prescription drugs and have lower life expectancy than people in most industrialised countries. For the life of me, I cannot understand why Americans aren’t out on the streets marching every weekend, and demanding a system like the NHS. An office of one’s own: do women really need women-only workplaces? The past year has seen a rapid rise in women-only co-working spaces and social clubs – a trend that has made me somewhat uneasy. It seems to be a lot more about elitism than feminism. Most prominent among this wave of women-only spaces is the Wing, whose mission is “to create space for women to advance their pursuits and build community together”. It recently received $32m (£23m) in funding, much of it from a global office space network, WeWork. According to the Wing’s pale-pink website, the business was “born out of the belief that women need and deserve a multi-purpose space designed to make their lives easier, and that magic is created when women gather together”. But that magic is expensive: all-access membership to the Wing is $2,700 (£1,945) a year. “No woman left behind!” the Wing’s website proclaims. Except, you know, for the women who don’t have a spare $2,700 to hand. Not content with just providing a magical space for women, the Wing also sells branded swag on its website – including $40 T-shirts and $20 shower caps. Where do they source this swag, I wondered? I reached out to the Wing to ask and they informed me that, “we are in the process of revamping our vendor list to work with more women-owned local businesses and hope to be able to share more information soon :)”. I shall refrain from speculating about what that means :-) Meanwhile, over in the UK, Allbright, a female-focused funding network, is opening a members’ club for working women in central London this year. Founder membership is priced at £600, plus a joining fee of £250. Feminism comes at a price, you know. Hello? Fashion police? I’d like to report a crime I regret to inform you that the Unravel Project, a streetwear brand worn by the likes of Kim Kardashian, has unveiled a range of legless, crotchless jeans which it is selling for $405 (£290). Worryingly, this sartorial monstrosity, which describes itself as a “waist belt” but looks more like an adult denim diaper, is just the latest in a series of troubling crimes against denim. Last year, for example, Topshop unleashed clear plastic jeans on the world and one-legged jeans were all over Instagram. It’s enough to leave a denim lover very distressed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2018/feb/11/mermaid-mrs-hancock-imogen-hermes-gowar-asymmetry-lisa-halliday-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-11T10:00:00Z","webTitle":"The Mermaid and Mrs Hancock by Imogen Hermes Gowar; Asymmetry by Lisa Halliday – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/11/mermaid-mrs-hancock-imogen-hermes-gowar-asymmetry-lisa-halliday-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/feb/11/mermaid-mrs-hancock-imogen-hermes-gowar-asymmetry-lisa-halliday-review","fields":{"headline":"The Mermaid and Mrs Hancock by Imogen Hermes Gowar; Asymmetry by Lisa Halliday – review","bodyText":"“I’m a rich man. I have a right to rare things.” In The Mermaid and Mrs Hancock, merchant Jonah Hancock is thinking of Angelica, the most splendid courtesan in Georgian London, but his sentiment could also serve as the tacit motto of Ezra Blazer, the renowned author in Asymmetry, as he sets his sights on youthful editor Alice in early 00s New York. While poles apart in style – one enchants, the other eviscerates – both of these much-heralded debuts delve into power imbalances with an implacability fit for our time. If the supernatural siren in The Mermaid and Mrs Hancock seems to suggest twee fantasy, Imogen Hermes Gowar brings a lustrous realism to her panorama of London’s stinking docks and chintzy bordellos. Our leading lady is the irresistible Angelica Neal, a “haughty whore of the first water” who draws glances from other women’s husbands wherever she turns. After falling for a handsome aristocrat, Angelica is too moonstruck to notice he is insolvent and her bill for luxury bonbons has gone unpaid. When her naive foray into monogamous romance almost leads to ruin, her exasperated assistant insists she strike a clearer bargain with suitors in future. Angelica finds an unlikely rescuer in a besotted Deptford merchant who made his fortune by exhibiting a dubious “mermaid” carcass brought back on one of his ships. With an eye for the calculations and compromises economic necessity thrusts upon women, Gowar ensures that comfortable matrimony provides no fairytale ending. Bowing to Angelica’s droll and swiftly forgotten condition for marriage, Hancock dispatches a ship to find her another mermaid and the captain unexpectedly returns months later with a living one in the hold. Trapped within an underground grotto at their new Greenwich mansion, the creature radiates an unbearable melancholy. Scarcely glimpsed, this mermaid drifts as a metaphor for the sorrow that douses the vitality of the captured female, courtesan or mermaid. Gowar’s prose shimmers like the titular temptress, but her magnificent stagecraft cannot hide one or two soggy patches in the storytelling. Polly, a mixed-race prostitute, escapes from the “Temple of Venus” after bridling at being treated like a curio. Promising to broaden the theme of disparity beyond gender, it is a shame her storyline trickles out too soon. Lisa Halliday’s wonderfully terse Asymmetry portrays a sexual transaction in more opaque terms. Alice is reading novels in a Manhattan park when Ezra Blazer sits down beside her. A half-century older than Alice, Ezra exerts his seniority during their subsequent affair by doling out wads of cash, sending her on errands and correcting her pronunciation. A literary lion of the interwar generation, Ezra’s real-life counterpart might be Philip Roth, who tended to depict age-gap sexual liaisons from a lusty male perspective (most notably in The Dying Animal). Markedly less enchanted by the imbalances of power within such relationships, Halliday zeroes in on Ezra tightening his grip on Alice, even while he hobbles into a twilight of physical decrepitude. Asymmetry is constructed like a puzzle box, with three parts that slot together only at the end. Halliday abruptly leaves the muddled Alice behind in favour of a seemingly unrelated second protagonist: Amar Jaafari is an Iraqi-American detained by immigration officials at a London airport. While the Iraq war unfolded on TV screens for Ezra and Alice, Amar contends with harrowing memories of the violence and upheaval that gripped Baghdad after Saddam. Here, Halliday is ingenious at tracing a wider world of disparities nevertheless still dominated by powerful white men. The final part returns to Ezra for a Desert Island Discs interview in the wake of his winning the Nobel prize. The structural originality of Asymmetry may be startling – divulging the key to how the parts fit together would be remiss – but the story arcs towards a gratifying catharsis. Suffice to say, a fictional Kirsty Young tricks the lascivious Ezra into a more revealing interview than he probably anticipated. Though it is a kick to watch Angelica bamboozle men who treat women like prey or plaything, here we are left with an even more rousing inference that their time could be almost up. • The Mermaid and Mrs Hancock by Imogen Hermes Gowar is published by Harvill Secker (£12.74).

He had a mask made of her face. A couple of times he threw himself on top of her and assaulted her. When they were making The Birds, he told her mechanical birds would not work and she would have to be attacked by live ones. They were attached to her body with elastic bands. One almost pecked out her eyes. Unsurprisingly, she broke down. She is still spoken of as his muse. Woody Allen gave a speech at the American Film Institute last year, presenting Diane Keaton with a lifetime achievement award. He talked of her work as “a fellatrix” (someone who gives blowjobs). She had, he said, been out with several charismatic men. They all dumped her. The audience thought this was hilarious. A roast, as they call it. Keaton was Allen’s muse for years. Before you nip down the jobcentre with your CV, to apply for some freelance musing, perhaps think about some further complications of the job. Uma Thurman has been talking about how she was assaulted by Harvey Weinstein. It has been obvious from the moment, some months ago, when Thurman first intimated this, that Quentin Tarantino would be involved. Thurman is, of course, Tarantino’s muse. Women don’t get to be collaborators you see. She was injured in a car crash on set while filming Tarantino’s Kill Bill. She had asked for a stunt double. She claims he made her do it. She has been left with permanent injuries to her neck and knee. At various times, Tarantino spat on her and choked her with a chain. He wanted to get the sadism just right in Kill Bill. He is a perfectionist. When filming Inglourious Basterds, the auteur claimed that the actor who was playing alongside Diane Kruger, and had to choke her, would not be able to do it to his satisfaction. So it’s Tarantino’s hands in shot, instead. Kruger recalls him saying: “‘I know exactly what I need and I think I should just do it.’ I have to say, it was very strange being strangled by the director.” So in this world of grand illusion, great female actors are put on pedestals as muses by great directors, and then what? Systematically abused. The idea of a muse as firing creativity is a romantic one, echoing through the arts. Picasso and his mistresses, for instance. This is, straightforwardly, a power relationship. The tortured male genius, the reclining woman, broken, fragmented, terrorised so often in imagery. Female fear is apparently arousing: think of Hitchcock and Roman Polanski. Female vengeance can be too: Kill Bill and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. But when a muse wants rights, as Thurman did when she challenged Tarantino and Weinstein by asking for footage of that crash, it ended in rows. Weinstein remains, in his bathrobe, at his Arizona spa, but still has a spokesman who pops up with pictures of him and Thurman as friends in the past, and a statement saying there “was no physical contact during Mr Weinstein’s awkward pass”. Incredible. What the #MeToo movement is showing is that this is not about individual men but about systems where abuse is tolerated. A lot of people still can’t listen to what women are telling them because they too are embedded in systems of power where they always side with the powerful. Maureen Dowd, the New York Times journalist who did the interview with Thurman, has form on this. She was relentlessly cruel about Monica Lewinsky for years. She, suggesting she was a silly, plump, valley girl who had had her head turned. Some day there will be a reckoning about Bill Clinton, but it’s still being avoided. The discussion has been, until recently, about sorting out the deserving victims from the undeserving ones. But that no longer works. Some of the most successful women in the world are telling us they were assaulted and abused by men who professed to adore them. One only has to go to a women’s refuge to hear that story in more mundane ways. Some men get their kicks by pulling women off pedestals and debasing them. It turns out the muse is a woman with a steering wheel in her ribs, carried out of a car because she can’t walk. The man who put her at risk looks on. This is not art. It’s a record of abuse. Theresa May, the face of a nation: uncertain, miserable, friendless I often think Theresa May is the perfect person to lead Brexit, do Brexit, simulate Brexit or whatever is going on this week. Brexit is either the most pressing subject in the entire world or actually insanely boring. I have never had a single conversation about it where any one changed their mind. I regard it in the same way as I regard an asteroid hitting the planet. It will probably happen, but not for years, so best not to dwell ... I watch Theresa May, stooped and socially awkward, and I think about why, for some unknown reason, she has taken it upon herself to lead us through this change. No one likes her. Not even in her own party. She is devoid of social skills. Often alone. She doesn’t do warmth or ever answer questions. Spontaneity is out of the question. The bar is set so low that, though the room at Davos was half empty for her speech, at least bits of the stage didn’t fall down, so it was considered a success. She went to China, had a cup of tea, managed to reveal she has tea at home. She didn’t appear to hustle up any business contracts. As she never goes off script, Sky News ran a headline “Theresa May says absolutely nothing at all”. No one believes she believes in what she’s doing, but she believes she has to go on. Apart from occasional strange, inappropriate grimaces, there is no signs of interior life. This is why she is so absolutely right for the job of defining our place in the new world order. Uncertain, uncomfortable, out of her depth, miserable and friendless. It’s written all over her. It doesn’t really matter what she says, does it? Her hinterland, one assumes, is purgatory. If, as the saying goes, “Nature gives you the face you have at 20. Life shapes the face you have at 30. But at 50, you get the face you deserve”, I see May’s face, the face of Brexit, as that of someone who has not slept soundly for around 15 years. Seeing The Ferryman explained the Brexit vote A rare trip to the theatre to see the much-hyped The Ferryman put me in a very bad mood. (And not just because the loos and bars are always so crowded that the theatre experience is spent queueing.) The play was the full paddywhackery of Irish dancing, priests, banshees, 1916 and bringing in the harvest. But it explained something to me as a middle-class audience lapped it up. They are as ignorant of Ireland and the Troubles as those who never considered what would happen to the border when we voted for Brexit. Ireland remains the last colony of the English imagination."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/feb/05/carillion-ignored-warnings-about-pensions-documents-reveal","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-05T19:21:40Z","webTitle":"Carillion ignored warnings about pensions, documents reveal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/05/carillion-ignored-warnings-about-pensions-documents-reveal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/feb/05/carillion-ignored-warnings-about-pensions-documents-reveal","fields":{"headline":"Carillion ignored warnings about pensions, documents reveal","bodyText":"Pensions advisers repeatedly warned that Carillion was prioritising shareholder dividends over the funding of its pension scheme years before the government contractor’s collapse, according to documents released by the work and pensions committee. The committee, whose members will question former Carillion directors at a hearing on Tuesday, released new evidence hours after the number of confirmed job losses at Carillion hit 829, with uncertainty persisting over a further 17,500. The MPs published documents that they said indicated “long-term indifference” by former directors towards the company’s pension obligations, leading to “chronic underfunding” of a scheme relied on by 27,000 members. The reports, written by a company advising Carillion’s pension trustees, contain multiple warnings that its plan to plug its deficit stretched over too many years and that the firm diverted money to dividends and debt interest rather than into its retirement schemes. Labour MP Frank Field, who chairs the work and pensions select committee, said: “Clear warning signs were evident several years ago in the assessments of the company’s commitment to its pension schemes. Yet as late as 2015, [former finance director] Richard Adam, one of the directors appearing before us tomorrow, gave a farcically optimistic report to the pension trustees.” The committee published a series of documents written by Gazelle Pension Advisory Services, which was advising trustees of a Carillion pension scheme estimated to have a £990m deficit. A report produced by Gazelle for the trustees in 2012 warns that “historically, Carillion has subordinated the pension schemes to other demands on cashflow, in particular repaying acquisition debt, a progressive dividend policy and equity payments into PPP [public-private partnership] projects”. The following year, Gazelle flagged up a “relative disparity” between the assessment of the company’s health it was giving to City shareholders and what it was telling pensioners. It said this meant that an increase in pension payments was spread over too many years, leaving retirees bearing “a disproportionate share of risk in the business”. In an April 2016 report for the trustees of one of Carillion’s 13 pension schemes, Gazelle highlighted that City speculators were betting that the company was in trouble by short-selling their shares. A final report in May 2017 warned that Carillion’s debts had reached a level that meant it could not “counter material financial shocks or disappointments” and pointed out that its pension deficit was now equivalent to the company’s entire stock market value. Gazelle advised that only if Carillion “cuts the dividends or produces an alternative plan to reduce debt will the [pension] sponsor constraints be eased”. Former Carillion directors are expected to face lengthy questioning at evidence sessions on Tuesday, at the beginning of a joint inquiry by the work and pensions select committee and the business, energy and industrial strategy committee, chaired by Labour’s Rachel Reeves."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/06/morning-mail-trump-attacks-intelligence-figures","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-05T20:11:45Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Trump attacks intelligence figures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/06/morning-mail-trump-attacks-intelligence-figures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/06/morning-mail-trump-attacks-intelligence-figures","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Trump attacks intelligence figures","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 6 February. Top stories Donald Trump has attacked senior figures in the intelligence community as “liars and leakers”, chief among them the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, Adam Schiff. “Little Adam Schiff,” the president tweeted, “who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington, right up there with Comey, Warner, Brennan and Clapper! Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped!” Schiff responded, tweeting: “Mr President, I see you’ve had a busy morning of ‘Executive Time’. Instead of tweeting false smears, the American people would appreciate it if you turned off the TV and helped solve the funding crisis, protected Dreamers or … really anything else.” The other figures who Trump derided as “liars and leakers” have all either taken part in the investigation or criticised Trump regarding his conduct toward the intelligence community. They were James Comey, the FBI director fired by Trump in May 2017, Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee; John Brennan, the former CIA director under Barack Obama; and James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence. Environmental lawyers and academics have called for a comprehensive rethink on how Australia’s natural landscapes are protected, warning short-term politics is infecting decision-making and suggesting the public be given a greater say on development plans, writes Adam Morton. The expert panel found the current system of different tiers of government working together hadn’t succeeded in protecting the environment. Instead the body of expert opinion was strongly in favour of the commonwealth taking responsibility for the environment. Meanwhile, investors in the mining giant Rio Tinto are being recruited to demand the company quit the Minerals Council of Australia. Labor’s factional divisions have intensified after leftwing frontbencher Pat Conroy took public aim at party rightwingers for opposing party democratisation. Conroy said some on the right see efforts to hand more power to the rank and file as “a threat to their power base”. ALP president mark Butler has led the calls in recent weeks, which has stirred suggestions that former federal treasurer Wayne Swan could try to win the presidency for the right. Seven people in New South Wales have been charged with a total of 127 offences relating to the historical alleged child sexual and physical abuse of three boys under the age of eight. Four women, two men, and a teenage girl were arrested on Monday evening by detectives from the child abuse and sex crimes squad operating under Strike Force Baillieu. Police allege the group participated in the ongoing sexual and physical abuse of the three boys, who were known to them, between 2014 and 2016 in the Blue Mountains. Australia’s Nobel peace laureate has spoken out about Donald Trump’s aggressive new nuclear policy, calling it “a blueprint for nuclear war” that returns the world to a cold war mentality. Tilman Ruff, the founding chair of the Melbourne-founded International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons said the newly released US nuclear posture review was “a chilling document”. Speaking in Sydney on Monday he said the document “clearly flags that great power confrontation with Russia is back on again”.

Acclaimed Canadian director Robert Lepage sits down with Van Badham to discuss war, theatre and sibling rivalry as his acclaimed play The Far Side of the Moon arrives on Australian shores. “As a performer, designer, director and writer, he has created profound theatrical explorations of history and the tiny humans swept up within it,” writes Badham. “Puppets and dolls, transforming sets, models, cameras and projection and moving parts synergise with moments of stage naturalism, filmic drama, kabuki, dance, poetry or anything else in service to Lepage’s unique dramatic vision.” News of “mind-blowing” Prince music on the way isn’t the first time rumors of posthumous unheard songs have been teased from beyond the grave.

Donald Trump has enraged people in the UK by criticising its much loved public healthcare system, the NHS, tweeting: “The Democrats are pushing for Universal HealthCare while thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working. Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care. No thanks!” British Prime Minister Theresa May rebuked Trump for his comment, saying via a spokesperson: “The prime minister is proud of having an NHS which is free at the point of delivery.” Media roundup “Bloody oath, it’s booming”.

The lucky winner this time is Alphabet, the holding company of Google. Alphabet has many subsidiaries (though only Google makes substantial profits) and one of them, Sidewalk Labs, has signed an agreement in principle to develop 800 acres of prime waterfront land in Toronto as a hypermodern wired city where the roads and the buildings themselves will become as flexible and responsive to their users’ whims as if they were made of pure software. Sensors and cameras everywhere will record the physical world – pollution levels, traffic flow, weather and so on – and of course the behaviour of its human inhabitants. Online we are already tracked everywhere by cookies and recording scripts, while our behaviour and emotions are constantly analysed for the benefit of advertisers. In the “smart city” of the future, this would be true of our physical existence, too. The combination of fixed physical sensors with the mobile ones we carry around with us all the time in the shape of our phones would yield an unimaginable richness of data. The result would be nearly as complete as the surveillance state that the Chinese are building in Xinjiang, but without the secret police. It’s obvious what Alphabet/Google would get from such a deal. Much as it is presently a gatekeeper for almost all of the internet that is not on Facebook, and so able to extract rents from any company that wants to be seen there, it would become the gatekeeper for those parts of the physical world that it controlled. Anyone who wanted to do business in the shiny new parts of cities that Alphabet controlled and built would end up paying for the privilege. The benefits on the other side of the bargain are less attractive. For the cities there is the promise of money now in exchange for power and income foregone in the future – a bargain like a payday loan – but the humiliating scramble of North American cities to house Amazon’s second headquarters shows that some at least will offer almost any incentive to be associated with high technology. Newark, New Jersey, has offered tax breaks worth $7bn to attract Amazon and even that may not be enough. The prestige gained now will be paid off for years in foregone revenues. For the citizens, there’s nothing much in these deals. There is no guarantee that they will benefit from the further refinement and processing of the data they produce, and Google collects, any more than they do at present. Nor will many of them benefit from the new developments: how much have Londoners who do not work there benefited from Canary Wharf? Cities are at their best living expressions of a raucous and conflicted democracy. They are not mausoleums to ideologies of complete control, whether these are political or commercial. This point is wider than just Google or Amazon. Silicon Valley itself is a physical area as well as an ideology, and the phenomenal sums of money that have accumulated there have made life worse for those not at the top of the heap; housing becomes unaffordable, public transport and schooling are neglected; the city becomes a playground for the few and not the many."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/05/liverpool-virgil-van-dijk-pressure-75m-price-tag","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-05T22:30:15Z","webTitle":"Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk: I can handle the pressure of £75m price tag","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/05/liverpool-virgil-van-dijk-pressure-75m-price-tag","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/05/liverpool-virgil-van-dijk-pressure-75m-price-tag","fields":{"headline":"Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk: I can handle the pressure of £75m price tag","bodyText":"Virgil van Dijk has said he can handle the scrutiny of being the world’s most expensive defender and his £75m price-tag should not detract from Liverpool’s fine defensive display against Tottenham Hotspur. The Netherlands international has made an eventful start to his Liverpool career: scoring a late FA Cup winner against Everton on his debut, conceding a 95th-minute penalty against Spurs on Sunday and being told to lose weight by an Anfield predecessor in Jamie Carragher. “He needs to come into the dressing room and see if I need to lose some weight because I don’t think I need to,” Van Dijk responded, jokingly, to Carragher’s comment. Van Dijk accepts he is under the spotlight after Liverpool broke their transfer record and the world record for a defender last month to sign him from Southampton, who Jürgen Klopp’s team face on Sunday. The 26-year-old insists he can cope with the pressure, although he believes Liverpool’s overall defending should not be judged purely on the basis of his transfer fee. “I know because I made such a big step, for a lot of money, everything is going to be analysed,” the Liverpool centre-half said. “No one is going to look at the good things you do. Everybody is going to watch the bad things and that is how it is. But I will discuss it with the people who want to make me better, who can make me better, and that is the manager and the players around me. If they think it is right then that is the way forward. “It is a strength of mine to not really bother too much when people have their opinions, especially negative opinions. I know when I am doing it well and exactly when I am doing it wrong. No one will talk about my performance [against Spurs] in general. We defended very well, had two penalties against us with a lot of question marks around them, but no one is going to talk about that. But I know that as a team we did very well against one of the best strikers in Europe [Harry Kane].” Klopp has claimed it will be next season before Liverpool see the best of Van Dijk given he missed much of last year with an ankle injury. The Liverpool manager, who also kept the defender on the bench for last week’s win at Huddersfield, also believes the Dutchman will need time to adapt to a different playing style. Van Dijk concurred: “I have been out for eight months – last January until September really – and I didn’t play at Premier League level. It is not easy to come back and especially when I have made such a big step as now with all the eyes on me and they look at every small detail. I am just focusing on the team and myself. “The football we play, the pressing, the different options with players, it is totally different. So you need time to get used to everything but I am working on it every day together with the team. I am talking with the manager and everyone who can help me out.” The defender also insisted he has no concern over the reception that potentially awaits him at St Mary’s this weekend. “Maybe they can boo the whole game. What can you do about it? You can’t do anything. I made the decision, I have enjoyed every bit of it and I am very grateful for everything that they [Southampton] did for me. I have moved on, they have moved on.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/05/the-guardian-view-on-eu-trade-first-britain-must-make-more","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-05T18:15:29Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on EU trade: first, Britain must make more | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/05/the-guardian-view-on-eu-trade-first-britain-must-make-more","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/05/the-guardian-view-on-eu-trade-first-britain-must-make-more","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on EU trade: first, Britain must make more","bodyText":"This time last week, the government seemed to be leaving the door open to a soft Brexit in which the UK remained within a customs union with the EU. That door now seems slammed firmly shut by Downing Street on the grounds that such a move would prevent Britain from negotiating its own trade deals. However foolish the notion of a global Britain enjoying faster growth as a result of being granted access to consumers in China, Brazil, India and the US once agreements have been struck by the Department for International Trade, it is dear to the hearts of many Conservative Brexiters. The idea that unshackling Britain from a protectionist EU represents a miracle cure for the economy is wrongheaded. The key to exporting more is not an array of trade deals – always assuming they are possible – but having products and services that overseas customers want at a price they are prepared to pay. So much is obvious from the UK’s own trade performance for the latest full year, 2016, when a deficit of £135bn in goods was partly offset by a surplus of £95bn in services. That’s despite the fact that trade liberalisation is far more advanced for goods than it is for services, and that the EU single market for services is more of an aspiration than a reality. The explanation is simple. For decades there has been a hollowing out of industry; now manufacturing accounts for only 10% of national output – a smaller share than for any member of the G7. There are some sectors in which the UK retains a global presence – pharmaceuticals, for example – but they are few and far between. By contrast, Britain has a critical mass of lawyers, architects, management consultants and software designers, which is why it is globally competitive in these fields. Likewise, world-class universities mean the UK can sell education to the Chinese. No doubt UK exporters would welcome any new deal that the Department for International Trade can negotiate for them. They certainly wouldn’t want barriers to go up as a result of Brexit. But before they start globetrotting in search of new trade deals, ministers should look a bit closer to home to see how a really successful exporting nation does it. There are three reasons why Germany has a trade surplus worth 8% of GDP and exports almost five times as much to China as the UK does. The first is the exchange rate: while Britain’s manufacturers have been hobbled for years by an over-valued pound, Germany joined the euro at an extremely advantageous rate. Its trade surplus with other EU countries has soared since the single currency was launched almost two decades ago. Secondly, German industry has made itself more competitive through protracted cost-cutting, especially wage restraint. Finally, and most importantly, Germany has got its industrial strategy right: it has a skilled, well-educated workforce; it has a financial system that eschews short-termism; it has worked on all parts of the manufacturing process from initial design through to after-sales service. All this without a murmur from German business about the need for Berlin to run an independent trade strategy. While Brexit has fully exposed the weaknesses of the UK economy, unflattering comparisons between British and German manufacturing are not new. Ironically, the sense that the UK had a whole lot to learn from Germany was one reason for applying for membership of what was then the European Economic Community in 1973. But the lesson is clear. Trade deals matter, but they matter a whole lot less than getting the economic fundamentals right."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2018/feb/05/waitrose-to-close-part-of-loyalty-scheme-at-end-of-february-pick-your-own-offers","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-05T19:08:42Z","webTitle":"Waitrose to close part of its loyalty scheme at end of February","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/05/waitrose-to-close-part-of-loyalty-scheme-at-end-of-february-pick-your-own-offers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/feb/05/waitrose-to-close-part-of-loyalty-scheme-at-end-of-february-pick-your-own-offers","fields":{"headline":"Waitrose to close part of its loyalty scheme at end of February","bodyText":"Waitrose is to close part of its loyalty scheme at the end of February after customers complained they found it too confusing, the Guardian has learned. Pick your own offers gave shoppers 20% off on 10 chosen products from a range of hundreds, which could be anything from expensive buys such as smoked salmon to frequently bought items such as loo roll. It was available to millions of holders of the myWaitrose card. Launched by the grocer as an eye-catching salvo in the UK supermarket price war in June 2015, pick your own offers was described by the then managing director, Mark Price, as “groundbreaking” but potentially very expensive. It was estimated that the price cuts could cost up to £260m a year or more, with Waitrose splitting that cost with suppliers it signed up. Members of HotUKDeals, the UK’s biggest deal-sharing community, spotted that the scheme was due to close on 28 February. According to a staff briefing document, the reason given was that customers had told Waitrose they found the “process for choosing and remembering their picks quite confusing”. Waitrose will instead be “investing more in tailored vouchers and personalised offers sent through the post or at the checkout”, the document says. These will be similar to those offered by other retailers including John Lewis through its myJohn Lewis card, and Marks &amp; Spencer via its Sparks scheme. A spokesman for Waitrose said: “We are always looking at how we reward our customers. We will be contacting all myWaitrose members on Thursday about how they can make savings more easily on the products they buy most often.” Anika Newjoto, the editor of the supermarket loyalty points site shopperpoints.co.uk, said: “Pick your own offers was simply too complex for the average busy shopper. Unless you regularly went back on to the website to change your selection as your preferred products changed, it became less and less useful. “Most people will have forgotten what was on their list.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/feb/05/tech-addiction-former-facebook-google-employees-campaign","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-05T22:05:03Z","webTitle":"Former Facebook and Google workers launch campaign to fight tech addiction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/05/tech-addiction-former-facebook-google-employees-campaign","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/feb/05/tech-addiction-former-facebook-google-employees-campaign","fields":{"headline":"Former Facebook and Google workers launch campaign to fight tech addiction","bodyText":"Reformed techies have united to launch a campaign to put pressure on technology companies to make their products less addictive and manipulative. “Truth About Tech” is the brainchild of the Center for Humane Technology, a group of former Facebook and Google employees dedicated to “reversing the digital attention crisis and realigning technology with humanity’s best interests” and is funded by Common Sense, a not-for-profit that promotes safe technology and media for children. The campaign will include educational material aimed at families highlighting the potential harm caused by digital platforms and outlining techniques for mitigating the addictive properties of tech, for example turning off notifications and changing the screen to greyscale. There will also be a lobbying push around the issue calling for policymakers to regulate tech companies using manipulative practices and the two organisations will develop standards of ethical design to help the industry discourage digital addiction. The Center for Humane Technology is led by former Google design ethicist Tristan Harris and former Facebook investor and adviser Roger McNamee. “Tech companies are conducting a massive, real-time experiment on our kids, and, at present, no one is really holding them accountable,” said Common Sense’s CEO, James Steyer, warning that tech companies’ attention-grabbing business models may hurt “the social, emotional and cognitive development of kids”. “When parents learn how these companies can take advantage of our kids, they will join us in demanding the industry change its ways and improve certain practices.” According to research by Common Sense, teenagers consume an average of nine hours of media per day, while tweens consume six hours. A separate study by psychologist Jean Twenge found that heavy users of digital media are 56% more likely to say they are unhappy and 27% more likely to be depressed. This is the latest chapter in a rising backlash against big tech. Many former employees of large Silicon Valley firms have offered sharp critiques of the industry. In November, Facebook’s founding president, Sean Parker, said the social network knew from the outset it was creating something that exploited a “vulnerability in human psychology”. “God only knows what it’s doing to our children’s brains,” he said. In January, the Salesforce CEO, Marc Benioff, said that Facebook should be regulated like the cigarette industry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/feb/05/agree-brexit-deal-or-both-uk-and-eu-suffer-says-financial-regulator","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-05T19:30:12Z","webTitle":"Agree transition deal or both UK and EU will suffer, financial regulator warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/05/agree-brexit-deal-or-both-uk-and-eu-suffer-says-financial-regulator","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/feb/05/agree-brexit-deal-or-both-uk-and-eu-suffer-says-financial-regulator","fields":{"headline":"Agree Brexit deal or both UK and EU suffer, says financial regulator","bodyText":"The head of Britain’s financial watchdog has warned both sides in the Brexit talks that they will be risking mutually damaging instability unless they agree to a transition deal smoothing the UK’s departure within the next two months. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, said City regulators needed time to sort out issues including the validity of derivatives contracts, clearing financial trades and cross-border flows of data. “There is a range of operational issues arising from Brexit which, if not tackled, will create financial stability risks and issues for both the UK and the European Union,” Bailey said at a dinner in London on Monday evening. The FCA chief executive said the financial risks were symmetric in impact and so were in the interests of both the UK and the EU to tackle. “I think this point is increasingly understood on both sides. It is not a matter of scaremongering to get negotiating advantage.” Bailey said that when the UK leaves the EU, a wide range of financial contracts between UK and EU counterparts would cease to function unless action is taken. This might involve UK citizens no longer being covered by insurance policies taken out with EU insurers. He added that the “least good” approach would be to expect firms to come up with solutions, since this would be expensive, messy, prone to risk and protracted. A second-best, but distinctly inferior, way forward would be the UK and EU authorities to enact solutions at the official level but independently. “The best solutions are mutually agreed and enacted so that they are consistent. And to achieve this, we need by the end of March a joint commitment by the political authorities to a well-defined implementation or transition period which will create the space and support for the regulators to work with firms and political authorities to put practical solutions into place,” Bailey said. “It can be done, and I think there is a growing consensus on both sides that it must be done. I sense this view increasingly taking hold from my discussions around Europe.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/feb/06/century-after-women-vote-barriers-exist-disabled-people","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-06T10:15:22Z","webTitle":"A century after women got the vote, many people are still disenfranchised","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/06/century-after-women-vote-barriers-exist-disabled-people","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/feb/06/century-after-women-vote-barriers-exist-disabled-people","fields":{"headline":"A century after women got the vote, many people are still disenfranchised","bodyText":"Barbara Waterman was born 13 years after the Representation of the People Act gave women over 30 the right to vote in 1918. But it was not until three years ago, in the 2015 election, at the age of 83, that she finally used that right. Until then, Waterman thought she was barred because of her learning disability. Her belief that universal suffrage didn’t extend to people such as her is not uncommon, according to Dimensions, a charity that runs a scheme to help and encourage people with learning disabilities and autism to vote. What changed for Waterman was that she became involved in the charity’s Love Your Vote scheme. It gave her a “voting passport”: a document that provides instructions for polling station staff regarding how she would like to be assisted to vote. After studying Easy Read manifestos produced by each of the political parties online, Waterman was supported to cast her vote for the first time in 2015, then again in June 2017. “The voting passport helped me remember what to do when I got to the place where you vote,” says Waterman. While, legally, universal suffrage has been achieved for all undetained citizens over the age of 18, many people still find it difficult to vote in elections. Ciara Lawrence, campaigns officer at the learning disability charity, Mencap – who has a learning disability herself – says: “Even today some people still question whether we have capacity or can make decisions on who to vote for. This is insulting and wrong. We have a right to vote like anyone else, but still face huge barriers.” People with physical disabilities can face problems voting, with 67% of polling stations not being accessible. And blind or partially sighted people are often hindered in their attempts to even make it on to the electoral roll by registration forms that are not easy to read. One hundred years this week after women got the vote, there are fears that proposals to introduce photo ID checks at polling stations could further disenfranchise millions, including disabled or homeless people, older voters and the poorest citizens. Cat Smith, Labour’s shadow minister for voter engagement, has flagged various problems with the proposals. Trials in May’s local elections in five towns in England – Woking, Gosport, Bromley, Watford and Swindon – will require passports or driving licences to be shown at some polling stations, and polling cards in others. Smith says concerns have been raised by disability charities about these trials. “Disabled people are less likely to have driving licences, and polling cards, which will be required in some areas, are hard to recognise for a blind person as they feel the same as many pieces of junk mail.” The cost of passports and driving licences is prohibitive for some, at a minimum of £34 for a provisional driving licence and £72 for a passport, and will be a barrier to voting for the poorest people if free provision of ID is not introduced. Although Northern Ireland has required voter ID since 1985 in a bid to stamp out widespread electoral fraud, it issues free photographic ID cards to voters. “Voter personation is a serious offence, and there is no doubt that cuts to our police make this more difficult for them to investigate and seek prosecutions However, due to the small number of proven cases [of fraud] and the consequences of voters being put off voting after being required to show ID, the government is taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut in this case,” says Smith. Older people, too, are less likely to have driving licences or passports. A Labour analysis of the five towns taking part in the ID trials found that at least 10,000 people aged 65 or over are unlikely to have this type of approved photo ID. Data from the 2011 census shows that only 46% of people over 85 hold a passport and 50% of women over 70 do not have a driving licence. For homeless and formerly homeless people, losing their ID and then having to apply for and afford new ID is insurmountably difficult. Maeve McGoldrick, head of policy and campaigns at homelessness charity Crisis, says: “Registering to vote can already be a complicated process for homeless people, but, with the right forms and guidance, anyone who has the right to vote in this country can do so – with or without a permanent address. Making it compulsory to show identification before voting risks compromising a basic human right by creating further barriers for people who may no longer have an acceptable form of ID, thanks to the often unpredictable and chaotic lifestyle homelessness can cause. Without a place to call home and somewhere to keep documents, many of our clients struggle to keep hold of identification, and already struggle to claim benefits, access healthcare or open a bank account as a result. We would welcome the opportunity to work with government to identify the solutions before these changes come into force.” In December, the government published a five-year democratic engagement plan designed to ensure that everyone eligible to register to vote is given the opportunity to do so. It sought to identify the needs of under-registered groups and to work with organisations to make it easier for these groups to exercise their democractic rights. Chris Skidmore, the then minister for the constitution, said: “The government believes that fostering democratic participation must start with an understanding of the barriers that prevent individuals and communities form registering to vote.” But Darren Hughes, chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, is sceptical that making people show ID will help. “Forcing voters to bring photo ID to the polling station is counterproductive,” he says. “Its real impact would be to add an additional barrier to those wishing to cast a legitimate vote. There are millions of people who don’t hold either a passport or a driving licence: mandatory voter ID – with no free provision – would stop those people from exercising their right to vote.” The issue of what happens on polling day for those who do have ID is also an issue. “What about voters who simply forget their ID and then don’t return to vote?” Hughes asks. “Are we really going to disenfranchise honest voters to placate those who claim there is fraud, when there’s no evidence it’s a major problemin the UK?” The gap between voting intention and actual participation still remains particularly high among people with disabilities. Only 31% of people with a learning disability reported that they voted in the 2001 election, in comparison with 59.4% of the general population, and research by Mencap found that while 70% of people with a learning disability say they intended to vote in the 2015 general election, 60% said they found the process of registering to vote too difficult, and 17% said they had been turned away from a polling station. Many charities cannot see voter participation increasing if voter ID is rolled out without addressing disability rights. As Waterman says: “It is really important to vote, and if you have the right to vote you really should as it is your way of saying what you want to happen about your country.” And Lawrence is clear what should be done. “All political parties should be making adjustments so people with learning disabilities are included and have a voice in politics. But at the moment we can still feel excluded and not fully part of society.” A Cabinet Office spokeswoman says: “We are committed to ensuring everyone who is eligible to vote can vote. If voters do not have the required ID then councils provide alternative methods for voters to identify themselves. We already ask that people prove who they are to collect a parcel from the post office, rent a car, secure a mortgage, or travel abroad – and we should take the same approach to protect voting rights.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/feb/06/this-may-not-in-time-be-the-best-book-about-the-weinstein-scandal-but-it-will-surely-remain-the-most-visceral-anger-burns-from-every-page","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-06T15:44:06Z","webTitle":"Brave by Rose McGowan review – Hollywood’s avenging warrior speaks out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/06/this-may-not-in-time-be-the-best-book-about-the-weinstein-scandal-but-it-will-surely-remain-the-most-visceral-anger-burns-from-every-page","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/feb/06/this-may-not-in-time-be-the-best-book-about-the-weinstein-scandal-but-it-will-surely-remain-the-most-visceral-anger-burns-from-every-page","fields":{"headline":"Brave by Rose McGowan review – Hollywood’s avenging warrior speaks out","bodyText":"In the week that I read Rose McGowan’s memoir, Brave, I went to see All the Money in the World, the Getty biopic that originally starred Kevin Spacey, before he was hastily swapped for Christopher Plummer after Spacey was publicly accused of groping multiple men in the past. I downloaded some shows made by Amazon Studios, which is no longer headed by Roy Price, as he resigned last year after a producer accused him of sexual harassment. I read an interview with Uma Thurman in which she called out her former longterm collaborators, Harvey Weinstein and Quentin Tarantino, accusing the former of sexual assault and the latter of life endangerment, when Tarantino asked her to drive a car she felt was unsafe while shooting a movie (and which Thurman then crashed). And I saw pictures from the red carpet: at the Golden Globes, female actors wore black as a sign of solidarity with victims of sexual assault, while at the Grammys singers carried white roses for the same reason. In the last six months the entertainment world has changed almost beyond recognition, and one person who has done more than most to bring about this change is McGowan. That McGowan has turned out to be an avenging warrior, determined to expose Hollywood’s toxic lies and cover-ups, would have once seemed as improbable as the most ludicrous superhero movie; a spoilt rich guy saving the city while dressed as a bat has nothing on her tale. For almost two decades, she was seen as a good if underused actor, one whose career was hampered by her reputation for being, as the saying goes, “difficult”. But it turns out both of these sides to her public image – underused and difficult – may have had less to do with her and more with Weinstein. Last year, McGowan publicly claimed he had raped her in a hotel room in 1997. According to her, after the assault he proceeded to trash her reputation, telling producers: “Don’t hire her. She’s bad news.” Weinstein has denied all specific allegations of non-consensual sex; yes, he did pay her a settlement of $100,000 in 1997, according to documents obtained by the New York Times last year, though not “as an admission”, merely a means to “avoid litigation and buy peace”. It has since been alleged that other actors from the 90s, including Annabella Sciorra, Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino, whose careers had a similarly mysterious lack of traction, may have also had their reputations tarnished by Weinstein after being assaulted or harassed by him. For a long time, he was celebrated as the maker of movie men: Ben Affleck, Matt Damon and Tarantino. But it turns out he might have also damaged the careers of a generation of female actors. The Weinstein allegations are the biggest scandal to hit Hollywood since the blacklist era, and they have revealed a national shame that wasn’t even below the surface – it was right in front of everyone’s eyes. At the last count, 122 high-profile men have been accused of sexual assault or harassment since the New York Times published the first story about Weinstein in October, and many have resigned from their jobs or are at least making the suddenly de rigueur noises about the importance of listening to victims. And yet because the men are high profile they have tended to hog the conversation. McGowan is determined to change this. She doesn’t even name Weinstein in her memoir, calling him instead “the monster”; this is McGowan’s story and she will not share the spotlight. She has proved to be a sexual predator’s worst nightmare because she has not just a public voice but a deeply admirable lack of fear and shame. When Weinstein’s lawyer last week called McGowan’s claims “a bold lie” told merely “to promote her new book”, she unhesitatingly retaliated, calling him “sad, pathetic” and an “old-fashioned sexist”. But Brave also reveals why she would have looked like a predator’s perfect target. McGowan was born in the Children of God cult, and her childhood, even after the family left the cult, was spent bouncing between her mentally unstable father and her mother, who had a bad habit of dating abusive men. She went to rehab and lived on the streets for a short time before ending up in Hollywood as a teenager, emancipated from her parents and living with a controlling boyfriend. Abusers pick vulnerable characters: the alone, the unstable, the unreliable, people whose cries are easy to ignore, and McGowan ticked a lot of those boxes. She still cuts an eccentric figure: on her US publicity tour last week she shouted at a transgender activist – “I don’t come from your planet, leave me alone!” – and appeared on a US TV talk show where she discussed how wearing suits “psychologically makes people insane”. A lot of her story sounds just as incredible. “My life was infiltrated by Israeli spies” is how she begins her book and, amazingly, we now believe this may be true: Weinstein allegedly used ex‑Mossad agents to spy on accusers who he feared would expose him. Maybe we should all stay away from suits after all. McGowan’s book will not be the best book about the Weinstein scandal, but it may be the most visceral. Anger burns from every page. Tarantino, who has admitted about Weinstein “I knew enough to do more than I did”, gets an enjoyably brutal shot in the neck. Recounting how he used to tell McGowan he liked to watch on laser disc one of her movie scenes in which she paints her toes, she sneers: “Tarantino has a known foot fetish. That means Tarantino paid extra money to jerk off to my young feet and he told me about it loudly, over and over, for years in front of numerous people, as if I should be so thrilled that he donated his solid-motherfucking-gold semen that is clearly better than all the other semen in the world, and he gave it up for little ol’ me? It’s time men realized their semen isn’t all that.” But the problem with burning everything down is that it all becomes an indistinguishable pile of ash. The misogyny of gossip blogger Perez Hilton is a worthy target for McGowan; that actors occasionally have to perform wedding scenes is not. “I was fake married three times on film before my ‘real’ marriage. By then I was repeating an emotional scene I’d already played. Your entertainment comes at a cost to us performers. You should know this and acknowledge,” she admonishes the reader. This reads like a book written by a woman driven to near derangement by decades of abuse and gaslighting. At times I wished McGowan could filter her anger, highlighting the real abuses as opposed to folding them in among the generalised sexist garbage. But if she had been able do that she probably wouldn’t have written this book: self-control isn’t helpful when you are kicking down doors. McGowan set out to write a book that examines abuse, and she has done just that. She has also, inadvertently, shown how much damage abuse can wreak in even the toughest of women.

The three-week patchwork funding deal that ended the January shutdown is set to end on Thursday. Protections for so-called Dreamers, children brought to the US illegally who have grown up in the country, are set to expire on 5 March. Republicans in the House have mooted a proposal to fund the government through 22 March. This has raised concern among Democrats, as it would keep the government open past the deadline for replacing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), the Obama-era policy protecting Dreamers that Trump rescinded last year. Under the agreement that ended the January shutdown, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell pledged to allow the Senate to vote freely on immigration after 8 February, provided the government was not closed. As part of efforts to reach a compromise, the Delaware Democratic Senator Chris Coons was set to introduce a bipartisan immigration bill with John McCain, an Arizona Republican, on Monday. The bill is modeled on a proposal in the House, authored by Texas Republican Will Hurd and California Democrat Pete Aguilar, that would grant permanent legal status to Dreamers and increase border security. Coons said on a conference call with reporters on Monday that he saw his proposal as “a strong bipartisan option” to advance the immigration debate. He added that the bill does “not have robust investments for security” and instead requires a plan to be submitted to Congress for protecting the border. Coons noted that he would be “open to adding funding” as a potential compromise. The bill was offered as a more limited compromise than broader proposals offered by Donald Trump and by another pair of senators, South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham and Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat. Trump’s proposal, which offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million Dreamers but also demands $25bn to build a wall on the border with Mexico, has been panned by Democrats. Coons said his limited deal was an opportunity to create “a base ball” on immigration, allowing the Senate to move forward and “resolve all the unfinished work that is months past due”. Any Senate immigration bill would face a difficult path in the House. In 2013, a bipartisan deal on comprehensive immigration reform passed the Senate 68-32. It never received a vote in the lower chamber, under then-speaker John Boehner. Boehner’s successor, Paul Ryan, leads an even more fractious Republican caucus, in which some are even opposed to Trump’s relatively draconian proposal, because of it offers a path to citizenship."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/06/england-ford-farrell-another-10-space","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-06T10:00:05Z","webTitle":"The beauty of Ford-Farrell is you have another 10 to see the space | Nick Evans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/06/england-ford-farrell-another-10-space","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/feb/06/england-ford-farrell-another-10-space","fields":{"headline":"The beauty of Ford-Farrell is you have another 10 to see the space","bodyText":"Speaking from the point of view of a backs coach, I find it no surprise Eddie Jones does not have a permanent one in his England set-up. In fact, it is extremely encouraging because it demonstrates the amount of ownership taken by George Ford and Owen Farrell. He has talked before about how they “can’t be coached” – that effectively they coach themselves – but increasingly it looks as if they are taking a firm handle on running the back division. You can see it when they line up together and it was really quite obvious against Italy. Farrell is vastly experienced and Ford is a lot more experienced than you might think too. They’re not new to the Test match or Six Nations environment, or to each other and they have such a good understanding of what makes the back-line unit tick. It’s something you get at club level – senior players who have been around a while know what makes things tick and it’s very powerful when you have that. I’m the other side of it now. I don’t want to be standing there talking and yelling at every backs session, telling them what to do. If you get an ownership from the players and they understand the expectations – if it’s player led, that’s very powerful and I’m sure at Test level it’s even more powerful. It puts England in a very good place. You’ve got your leaders of the game: if they’re doing it at training as well, it makes for a slick operation. You get the transfer from what you’re doing at training because there’s a massive buy-in and everyone feeds off that. Against Italy I thought the variety from the two of them was really good. It wasn’t just going side to side, they played the front line, they were very patient. They really manipulated Italy in defence and shortened them up – that is the beauty of having that Ford-Farrell combination because you have another 10 to see that space and when it’s on in the wider channels. Then you’ve got the strike runners who are deadly when in space, as we saw with Anthony Watson’s two tries after Ford and Farrell had combined. They both used the forwards really well too. It all comes down to the work England are doing at the contact area – it becomes a lot easier to make decisions because you have a lot of time. If you’re getting that front-foot ball and the ruck speed you want, a combination at 10-12 or 9-10-12, you’ll see a really quick progression and a quick understanding of what each player wants and needs and what their strengths and weaknesses are. What you’re seeing when they get that front-foot ball is Ford can be really flat and Farrell can punch and make line breaks off it. It allows Ford to play on that front line and Farrell in that second wave. He’s played 10 a lot so he has the ability and the awareness. He knows the appropriate depth he needs when he’s playing out the back. He can read the defensive line in those wide channels and he knows when to play the front line as well. Wales will be an altogether different challenge because defensively they were extremely strong against a Scotland side who were very confident after their autumn performances – Shaun Edwards will be very pleased. And I was hugely impressed with the way Wales’s big Scarlets contingent performed, especially Scott Williams and Hadleigh Parkes in the centres. Part of me felt it would be difficult to translate their Champions Cup form to a tournament but they were fantastic. They’ve got a bulk of a Scarlets squad there that know how to play that style of rugby but the big difference at Twickenham will be whether they can get parity at the set piece and have a platform. If the England defence can stop Wales behind the gainline, do Warren Gatland’s players have the ability to manipulate and get that go-forward ball? If they don’t, it looks great passing from side to side but they are not going anywhere. Eventually the pressure comes on, someone gets isolated and England will feed off that. Sexton made it look easy When I saw Jonathan Sexton line up the drop-goal, I couldn’t help but think it was too far back. A drop-goal on its own is an extremely difficult skill – there are so many variables and that’s before you add in the opposition chasing you down and the sense of urgency that comes with knowing the game could end at any moment. I remember mine against Stade Français in the Heineken Cup in 2008 – it was probably the ugliest drop-goal I’ve ever kicked but it doesn’t matter if it goes over. But what we saw with Sexton was a world-class piece of skill from a world-class player."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"travel/2018/feb/07/plastic-not-fantastic-eurostar-plans-carbon-emission-cuts-and-waste-reduction","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T15:45:48Z","webTitle":"Eurostar plans to halve its use of plastics within two years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/feb/07/plastic-not-fantastic-eurostar-plans-carbon-emission-cuts-and-waste-reduction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/feb/07/plastic-not-fantastic-eurostar-plans-carbon-emission-cuts-and-waste-reduction","fields":{"headline":"Eurostar plans to halve its use of plastics within two years","bodyText":"Eurostar has unveiled a new 10-point plan to cut carbon emissions and reduce waste over the next three years, highlighting the reduced carbon footprint of high-speed rail for short-haul journeys. Among its pledges are reducing its use of plastics by 50% by 2020 – including the millions of plastic bottles handed out to passengers every year. It will also work with its catering partners to reduce food and other waste, at source, and find alternative materials for packaging, aiming to eventually eliminate paper ticketing with a reduction of 50% by 2020. The new targets build on the initial Tread Lightly programme launched in 2007, which led Eurostar to achieve a 32% reduction in carbon emissions and a 50% cut in waste across its business. The operator already promotes itself as the “greener” alternative for trips between London and Paris, claiming that high-speed rail emits up to 90% less carbon than flying and produces less carbon per passenger than a single car journey from central London to Heathrow airport. Although it has not yet announced the launch date of its new London to Amsterdam service – it has been put back several times but is promised for the spring – it is targeting the four million-plus passengers who fly on that route every year. Nicolas Petrovic, outgoing chief executive of Eurostar said: “Over the last eight years we have reduced our carbon footprint by more than 30% but given the scale of the challenge facing the environment, we are now setting new targets. We are committed to increasing our energy efficiency and reducing our waste across the business.” Eurostar carries more than 10 million passengers every year and Petrovic admitted that reducing its dependence on plastic bottles was a “major challenge”. But the goal of reducing the use of plastics has already begun with the ban of plastic straws onboard trains and in lounges, while metal cutlery is used in first class. The company has set up a working group to look at alternatives for plastic cutlery in the bar buffet, reducing plastic bottles and exploring the use of more eco-friendly materials."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/feb/07/worker-productivity-in-north-grew-twice-as-fast-as-london-in-2016","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T18:15:06Z","webTitle":"Worker productivity in north grew twice as fast as London in 2016","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/07/worker-productivity-in-north-grew-twice-as-fast-as-london-in-2016","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/feb/07/worker-productivity-in-north-grew-twice-as-fast-as-london-in-2016","fields":{"headline":"Worker productivity in north grew twice as fast as London in 2016","bodyText":"The productivity of workers in northern England grew twice as fast as London in 2016, according to official figures, in a sign that the north’s economy is making progress despite huge challenges in bridging the country’s regional divide. Economic output per hour worked increased by 1.8% in the north versus 0.9% in the capital over the course of 2016, according to an IPPR North analysis of figures from the Office for National Statistics. The thinktank also found the north’s productivity grew at roughly the same rate as the capital over the past five years. The figures will encourage supporters of the northern powerhouse project designed to boost the region’s economy, amid lingering concerns over the government’s commitment to regional devolution. But they also show the scale of the challenge despite the progress being made. While economic output per hour worked in the north is improving, only London and the south-east had productivity levels above the national average, according to the ONS. Wales and Northern Ireland were the weakest regions. Total economic output increased by 5.1% in London compared with 2.7% in the north, although the capital required workers to put in much longer shifts in order to make those gains. The number of hours worked went up by 4.1% in London versus just 0.8% in the north. Tower Hamlets, home to the Canary Wharf financial services centre, had the highest labour productivity levels among 168 areas of Britain, with an efficiency level 72% above the national average. Powys ranked bottom, with workers in the rural area of Wales producing 35% less economic output per hour worked than was average. The ONS figures also showed how growth in low productivity jobs over the last decade had fuelled a slowdown in Britain’s overall economic efficiency. The issue has vexed the chancellor Philip Hammond, as weaker economic growth stands to erode the public finances and hold back workers’ pay. Luke Raikes, senior research fellow at IPPR North, said devolving industrial strategy to regions, cities and counties was an important part of the solution. “The UK has never had regional industrial strategies and has fallen behind as a result,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/08/vladimir-putin-russian-election-iran-zimbabwe","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-08T06:00:27Z","webTitle":"As Vladimir Putin steals the Russian election, our leaders are shamefully silent | Simon Tisdall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/08/vladimir-putin-russian-election-iran-zimbabwe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/08/vladimir-putin-russian-election-iran-zimbabwe","fields":{"headline":"As Vladimir Putin steals the Russian election, our leaders are shamefully silent","bodyText":"Russia will vote in presidential elections next month that Vladimir Putin is certain to win. Consider that statement for a moment. An election implies a contest. So how can the current president, who has already served three terms and wielded power in the Kremlin continuously since 1999, be assured of victory in advance? The answer is that Russia’s is an election in name only. In truth it is a sham and a smokescreen, designed to confer democratic respectability on to a corrupt oligarchy. For Russians accustomed to unaccountable rule from on high, this is nothing new. More surprising is the supine acquiescence, bordering on complicity, of western democracies. Putin will win on 18 March because the system he created, politely known as “managed democracy”, removes all elements of surprise. His most credible challenger, Alexei Navalny (who in any case did not expect to win), has been banned from participation on specious legal grounds. Last month Navalny was arrested while urging an election boycott. Putin’s control of Russia’s television outlets and other media means political opponents are virtually invisible, unless they are in court on a charge. By contrast, his own public appearances receive fawning blanket coverage. There are no presidential debates, no unsanctioned opinion polls. Rival candidates do exist, but they resemble sparring partners whose task is to legitimise the process while helping the champ show off his best punches. They include Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a sort of ultra-nationalist Screaming Lord Sutch, and Pavel Grudinin, the Communist party’s candidate, who runs a privatised company called Lenin State Farm. Ksenia Sobchak, a liberal, pro-gay rights former reality TV host, claims to offer an alternative to Putinism. But her wealthy establishment background has prompted the dismissive nickname “Russia’s Paris Hilton”. When Sobchak recently visited Grozny, stronghold of the Chechen warlord and Putin ally Ramzan Kadyrov, police harassed her and gangs of men shouted that she resembled a horse. Political theatre aside, Putin, projecting strength and continuity, knows he will win by a landslide. The fix is in. No other result is imaginable – or allowable. His main concern, analysts say, is achieving a high turnout and a big victory margin, surpassing the 64% he gained six years ago. He also wants an ostensibly free and fair election to boost his international credibility – and no repeat of the 2012 street protests. In other words, Putin wants it both ways: a genuine electoral contest and a no-risk, hands-down victory. And so far, he seems to be succeeding. If this rigged election were being held in Iran or Zimbabwe or Venezuela, screams of tweeted outrage would issue daily from the White House. But Donald Trump is strangely silent. Why? Everybody knows he has a soft spot for the hard man in the Kremlin. There are numerous personal, business and political crossovers. Some are the subject of a federal investigation. But even by Trump’s standards, the current administration’s behaviour is contemptible. Rather than condemning Navalny’s harsh treatment and Russia’s yawning democratic deficit, Trump last week refused to activate additional sanctions against Putin and his oligarchs that had been agreed by Congress last year. He might just as well have donned a “Vote Vlad” campaign badge. This latest sign of collusion came despite a recent Senate minority report that furiously decried the global threat posed by Putin’s Russia, and Trump’s “negligent” response. “For years,” the report said, “Vladimir Putin’s government has engaged in a relentless assault to undermine democracy and the rule of law in Europe and the US. Mr Putin’s Kremlin employs an asymmetric arsenal that includes military invasions, cyber-attacks, disinformation, support for fringe political groups, and the weaponisation of energy resources, organised crime, and corruption.” It added: “If the US fails to work with urgency to address this complex and growing threat, the regime ... will continue to develop and refine its arsenal to use on democracies around the world, including against US elections in 2018 ... Never before in American history has so clear a threat to national security been so clearly ignored by a US president.” Trump’s blind eye is not unique. Theresa May lambasted Putin in November for meddling in other people’s elections and referendums. But neither she nor Boris Johnson has raised public objections to Putin stealing his own election. This silence contrasts sharply with oft-stated British concerns about upholding democracy in Africa and elsewhere. Europe’s leading lights, France and Germany, have not been any more outspoken, although the EU did jib at Navalny’s exclusion. The ban “casts a serious doubt on political pluralism in Russia”, it inoffensively declared. And perish the thought that western governments might launch the same covert cyber and disinformation operations to influence Russia’s polls that Putin has used against theirs. There is certainly no sign of it. If they are trying, it isn’t working. Why this shaming diffidence, even deference, towards Putin’s regime? Western ineffectiveness in sticking up for democracy in Moscow is matched by serial weakness over illegal Russian actions in Ukraine, the Balkans and Syria, where war crimes are committed daily under Putin’s imprimatur. Perhaps western leaders fear instability, and financial and energy supply disruption, should Putin fall. Maybe an enfeebled, divided west has given up on post-Soviet, post-cold war democracy. In Trump’s case, maybe he admires the dictatorial strongman approach and wishes to emulate it. Apologists say we do not understand Russia and Putin. Yet the whole world understands a liar and a cheat. • Simon Tisdall is a Guardian assistant editor and a columnist on foreign affairs"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/feb/09/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-09T08:11:40Z","webTitle":"Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/feb/09/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/feb/09/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend","fields":{"headline":"Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend","bodyText":"1) Van Dijk faces the brickbats Welcome back Virgil van Dijk ... no Southampton supporter will be saying when the centre-back strides onto the St Mary’s pitch on Sunday.

It’s been a rocky process for Van Dijk – following his Hollywood-esque debut against Everton there have been appearances in two defeats and a draw, with six goals conceded in the process.

That thought, plus an extravagant salary, has probably kept Arsène Wenger going in recent years even when everyone else called him deluded. So how giddy the Frenchman must feel in advance of Saturday’s north London derby, to which extra oomph has been added by the unravelling of Chelsea. The top four spot that once looked secure in the hands of Roman Abramovich’s club is up for grabs again and Arsenal, along with Spurs, are suddenly back in contention, with Wenger boasting a pair of snazzy new forwards.

Toby Alderweireld missed November’s match but his successful return during Wednesday’s FA Cup win over Newport County gives Pochettino an interesting selection question: should Spurs’ best defender be preserved for Juventus or, after four months out with hamstring trouble, is he really ready to try keeping pace with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang?

Alan Pardew’s managerial stints tend to follow a pattern: early lift followed by an alarming drop-off, and the hope of West Bromwich Albion’s hierarchy would have been that he delivered on the former while avoiding the latter. Yet two months on, Pardew appears to be operating in reverse. West Brom have won just once in the league under his charge, with last week’s 3-2 defeat to Southampton leaving them rooted to bottom place. It looks bleak for the Baggies and, as such, they need a quick turnaround. With Chelsea in disarray, this game may be an unexpected opportunity for West Brom to kick-start that process.

Riyad Mahrez was magnificent that day, as he was when Leicester walloped Manchester City 4-2 at the King Power last season in what was one of Pep Guardiola’s most embarrassing experiences in England. Conveniently enough for City and Guardiola, Mahrez is no state to play against them this weekend. But Leicester sure have the motivation to cause them problems. And even without Mahrez they have dangerous counterattacking power, and it will be interesting to see how new signing Aymeric Laporte copes with Jamie Vardy. It is not impossible, then, that Manchester City will drop points in two matches in a row for the first time this season. PD Mahrez will not play for Leicester against Manchester City 5) A potentially season-defining match for Huddersfield? Huddersfield are in all sorts of relegation bother. They are without a win in their past eight league matches and have lost five on the spin. With 12 matches left to save themselves and so many teams concertinaed in the lower half of the table, survival remains well within their remit. However, with three of their final four games coming against Manchester United, Tottenham and Chelsea, one can’t help but feel theirs is a crisis that needs to be addressed sooner rather than later. They entertain Bournemouth this weekend, a resurgent side who are unbeaten in seven and have won four of their past five, smiting Arsenal and Chelsea along the way. Against Birmingham City in the FA Cup in midweek, David Wagner’s side did at least get to experience what it’s like to win again, even if their fourth-round replay – and the extra time that came with it – was conceivably a distraction they could have done without as they focus on maintaining their Premier League survival. Wagner argued otherwise, saying the win will help Huddersfield “build momentum for the Premier League”. Their third round win against Bolton did nothing of the sort, preceding as it did four consecutive league defeats. A similar run now will almost certainly consign them to the drop, but a win against in-form Bournemouth could prove season-defining. BG FA Cup match report: Birmingham 1-4 Huddersfield 6) A return for Pogba Much was made of the long-running feud between Rafael Benítez and José Mourinho before they renewed hostilities for the first time in a decade last November, in a match Manchester United came from behind to win comfortably after struggling in the opening 30 minutes. The match passed off without further needle between the pair and Mourinho was magnanimous enough to praise his opposite number’s bravery in fielding two strikers at Old Trafford. Ultimately the tactic didn’t pay off but it’s worth remembering Newcastle missed a terrific opportunity to give themselves a two-goal first half cushion. It’s also worth remembering that Paul Pogba was the standout player for Manchester United in that game, following his return from a two-month lay-off with injury. His most recent lay-off came last weekend against Huddersfield, punishment for a woeful performance at Wembley against Tottenham. Expect him to be handed a shot at redemption at St James’s Park.

When does new manager bounce end and an actual turnaround begin? It’s a question rarely asked but feels relevant in the context of Swansea City’s recent form. A team sliding towards relegation has been revitalised since Carlos Carvalhal succeeded Paul Clement as manager, winning five of their subsequent 10 matches. Swansea are on the rise but now comes a tricky encounter. Burnley earned a credible draw with Manchester City last week and will make life uncomfortable for their hosts at the Liberty Stadium – it will be a test of Swansea’s character as well as talent and provide a strong indication of just how transformed they have been by a change in the dugout. SN Match report: Swansea City 8-1 Notts County 8) Evra arrives in the east end Patrice Evra described himself as “thankful” after completing his move to West Ham, and the sentiment is understandable given the Frenchman has been out of work since Marseille terminated his contract in November. Ultimately, however, it may be West Ham who are thankful to the left-back for joining them given the crisis that has enveloped the London Stadium in recent weeks. Evra cannot solve that on his own but he could prove to be a galvanising presence. As such, it may be a good idea for David Moyes’s to include the 36-year-old in the squad to face Watford – a new face for the supporters to be excited by and, for the players, a winner who comes with a larger-than-life personality to lift spirits in the dressing room. SN Evra has great pedigree but Premier League return will be testing Match report: Watford 4-1 Chelsea 9) A return to the Everton lineup for Sigurdsson and Rooney? Despite making one notable change in formation and several others in personnel for Everton’s match against Arsenal last weekend, Sam Allardyce was predictably quick to absolve himself of all blame when his side was thrashed at the Emirates. Yes, there is only so much a manager can do and Everton’s performance was truly dismal, but the manner in which Allardyce threw his players under the bus so soon after Arsenal’s had flattened them with a steamroller is likely to have had several of the more senior among them bristling with resentment. Wayne Rooney and Gylfi Sigurdsson were conspicuous, controversial absentees from the lineup against Arsenal, not least because of Everton’s dismal record – P6 W0 D3 L3 – when both players don’t start, compared to their excellent one – P6 W4 D1 L1 – when both do (spotter’s badge: @JakeEntwhistle). Fitness permitting, only the most arrogant fool would leave both men out again after last weekend’s debacle; Everton’s teamsheet to face Crystal Palace will make for interesting reading.

Following his team’s defeat at the hands of Bournemouth last weekend, Lambert seemed surprised they had not won, let alone claimed a point, and with a fourth consecutive six-pointerlooming, can ill afford back-to-back defeats. Brighton remain above the drop-zone, as they have done since August, although a column in the local paper, the Argus, suggests a vocal minority of their supporters are unhappy with the caution with which they approached their recent draw against Southampton after taking the lead. Chris Hughton will be unperturbed by such brickbats and will continue to do things the way that have worked for him thus far. The man who began his working life as an apprentice lift engineer in south London has no intention of going down. Away to Stoke in a match of such huge importance, a fairly cagey affair could be on the cards.

Marmorkrebs in German. Age: Potentially infinite. Appearance: Marbled, to be blunt. Right, so it’s a potentially infinitely old crayfish with a marbled appearance. Got it. Not so fast. There’s something interesting about this potentially infinitely old marbled crayfish. Is it to do with the marbling? The infinity, actually. For this is a self-cloning crayfish. Parthenogenesis is the technical term, I think you’ll find. Correct. And the crayfish bowled over scientists when it was first discovered in the early 2000s. The entire clone army – now in the millions – is descended from one bag of Texas crayfish a German aquarium enthusiast bought online from a US trader in 1995. Who is this curious mogwai merchant? Is he still selling them? Definitely not. They are banned in the EU. They’re the laser-pointers of decapod crustaceans? The problem is that they’re taking over. The species has shown up in the wild in Germany, Italy, Slovakia, Sweden, Japan and Madagascar. Isn’t that evolution in action? It’s pretty destabilising when you consider that, in the past 10 years, they have expanded 100-fold in Madagascar. They are less successful in colder Germany, but the fact that they can survive as far north as Sweden suggests a rugged nature. Yikes. What’s inside these succulent replicants? Unfortunately, these are part of the “dwarf” half of the crayfish family tree, and so are less delicious than their bigger cousins. But that still hasn’t stopped the Madagascans developing quite a taste for them. But at a genetic level? Do we have any clues? Scientists have sequenced their entire genome. Crayfish differ from one another by maybe four letters in a DNA strand of 3.5bn letters. Plus, they have three sets of chromosomes. Almost all other animals have two: a mother’s and a father’s. But why has that happened? Chance, so far as anyone can gather. But huge odds. Some species dabble in parthenogenesis: Komodo dragons, velvet worms, zebra sharks, New Zealand mud snails. But this is the first time such a leap has been observed in real time. Can anything be done? Do we just need to welcome our new insect overlords? Well, in terms of evolution, parthenogenesis is much less common because, over the extreme long term, it doesn’t allow for as much adaptation through mutation. Clone species tend to die out when the environment changes. So we just have to wait a few million years? Problem solved. Do say: “Never feed a marbled crayfish after midnight.” Don’t say: “Why hasn’t evolution coated them in butter and garlic?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/feb/23/what-i-wore-this-week-lilac","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T13:00:05Z","webTitle":"What I wore this week: lilac | Jess Cartner-Morley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/feb/23/what-i-wore-this-week-lilac","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/feb/23/what-i-wore-this-week-lilac","fields":{"headline":"What I wore this week: lilac","bodyText":"Context is all, Margaret Atwood wrote. I couldn’t agree more. I mean, I wouldn’t even make a decision as to which earrings to wear without looking in a full-length mirror. Possibly that wasn’t exactly the point she was making, but still. When you wear a colour, context can change everything. If you wear a white dress to someone else’s wedding, or a gold dress when everyone else is on a red carpet blackout, then context is definitely all. Whether it is in or out of fashion alters our perception of a colour. Wearing pink used to signify girliness; the rise of millennial pink means that it is now a unisex choice, but puts you firmly in the Snapchat generation. Lilac is the colour of this season. For the next six months, at least, a colour that has recently been confined to National Trust gift shops will be on every shop floor. Before you tell me that this doesn’t concern you, let me explain something. What happens next is that you roll your eyes, turn the page and buy another navy blazer, congratulating yourself on your independent spirit. But here’s the thing: lilac will creep up on you, by stealth. You won’t even register, when you are looking at the photos of that friend-of-a-friend’s wedding, that two of the most stylish female guests are in lilac. You will briskly shut down the windows that pop up suggesting pastel knitwear that spring up when you open your laptop. And then, at some point in the short to medium term, you will spot… I don’t know, a pair of high-waisted mom jeans in washed-out lavender, or a chunky lilac cardigan with patch pockets and jewelled buttons, and this will look… right, somehow. And you will snap up this garment, while congratulating yourself for your unique style point of view. Seriously, dudes, no offence or anything but you do this to me every time. So as we will be wearing lilac, let’s talk how. We want to make it clear that the context is fashion. That we are wearing the colour lilac, which is the shade of an on-trend matching blouse and midi-skirt such as this one, rather than the colour lavender, which is the shade of bars of soap. The simplest way is to keep the shape modern – a trouser suit is good, a twinset less so – and make your use of the colour as bold as possible. Top to toe is ideal. You are wearing lilac as a fashion statement, after all. Whether you know it or not. • Jess wears floral shirt, £39.99, and skirt, £39.99, both hm.com.

The housing minister Dominic Raab, who has been regularly touted as a future Tory leader, advertised the position on the W4MP website, which has a jobs board for roles with politicians. It is the only position advertised by a sitting MP that is unpaid. The ad says the role would be based in Westminster and would “ideally suit a gap-year student or recent school leaver” to help with research and casework from Raab’s Esher and Walton constituency. Raab, a prominent Brexit supporter, was given a senior ministerial role in June last year and was made a housing minister in the recent reshuffle, though many colleagues had expected him to receive a cabinet post. On Wednesday, a day after Raab’s ad was posted, May announced a raft of labour policies aimed at tackling the debilitating effects of insecure work in response to the Downing Street-commissioned review by Matthew Taylor. In its response, the government said it would “seek to protect workers’ rights by [taking] further action to ensure unpaid interns are not doing the job of a worker”. The advert for the internship says travel expenses will be reimbursed and the successful candidate will be expected to work three to four days a week, for between four to six months. The volunteer would be expected to work with a senior caseworker to help deal with constituency correspondence, supporting the senior parliamentary assistant with research, as well as doing general administrative tasks and assisting colleagues in the office. No qualifications are specified but the advert asks for good communication and administrative skills and competency in IT. “Experience of working with members of the public would be an advantage,” it says. “Good teamwork ethic is essential.” Raab said: “This is part-time work experience with commuter expenses paid, typically suited to a gap-year student. The role is not fixed, but designed to offer a range of experience of a parliamentary office.” The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy issued guidance on internships overnight as part of its response to the Taylor review, much of which appears to be at odds with the advert. “Exploitative unpaid internships should not exist and we will work to eradicate these,” the response states. “An employer cannot avoid paying someone the minimum wage simply by calling them an ‘intern’ or saying that they are doing an internship.” The Labour MP Justin Madders, the chair of the all-party parliamentary group on social mobility, said: “The housing minister recruiting an unpaid intern the same day the government profess they will take action in response to the Taylor review shows how little they understand the issues and how insincere their promises on workers’ rights are. “There are millions of people out there struggling because of exploitative workplace practices – the government should be taking a lead on tackling them, not being part of the problem.” A Labour source said: “The timing couldn’t be more embarrassing. Presumably Dominic Raab hasn’t read the recommendations of the Taylor review yet.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/feb/08/schools-are-not-the-answer-to-childhood-obesity-epidemic-study-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-08T06:27:44Z","webTitle":"Schools are not the answer to childhood obesity epidemic, study shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/08/schools-are-not-the-answer-to-childhood-obesity-epidemic-study-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/feb/08/schools-are-not-the-answer-to-childhood-obesity-epidemic-study-shows","fields":{"headline":"Schools are not the answer to childhood obesity epidemic, study shows","bodyText":"Childhood obesity programmes in schools are not the answer to the epidemic affecting the UK, according to researchers who say much wider local and national action is needed, including curbs on the advertising of junk food. A major obesity programme introduced into more than 50 primary schools in the West Midlands has failed to have any significant effect on children’s weight. Children were given a year of extra physical activity sessions, a healthy eating programme and cookery workshops with their parents. Families were invited to activity events, including sessions run by Aston Villa football club. But at the end of 30 months, there was no difference in obesity between those children who took part and those who did not. The government’s childhood obesity plan, launched from Downing Street in January last year, placed great emphasis on increasing sport and other activity in schools. A number of school-based obesity programmes have been introduced around the country, focusing on increasing physical activity and improving children’s diet in school. But, says the team from the University of Birmingham’s Institute of Applied Health Research, the negative results from their large study published in the British Medical Journal are in line with what has been found elsewhere; schools may have a role to play but can only be part of the answer to the obesity problem. “We need to look at ways that we can really engage communities in this agenda, change our local environment and look at how national policies can support diet and physical activity,” said Miranda Pallan, one of the team. Children, she said “are at the centre of lots of layers of influence”. For primary school children, parents and the wider family are key. “They function within their family. Decisions on what to eat and what they do are determined by their family.” Adults, who may themselves be obese, are influenced by many different things. Local initiatives in communities can help but national policies on food and the environment are also vital. The government is tackling sugar levels in soft drinks and foods. “There are some good things in the government’s plan but we would argue that there need to be further measures and there are things like advertising restrictions that would be very good to see,” Pallan said. “If anything what our research highlights is that although schools are vitally important, they can’t do it alone. We need many, many approaches. Each of those will make a marginal difference. We need to look at the whole picture of the causes and tackle each of those areas.” The institute created and introduced an ambitious programme called West Midlands ActiVe lifestyle and healthy Eating in School children, dubbed Waves. The programme included extra daily physical activity in schools, a physical activity and healthy eating programme in conjunction with local sporting heroes, regular information to parents about local physical activity opportunities, and workshops on healthy cooking for families at schools. About 1,400 children aged six and seven took part in the trial. At the start of the trial, height and weight was recorded for each of them, along with other measurements relating to body fat, diet and physical activity levels. The researchers found no significant difference in weight status and no meaningful effect on body fat measurements, diet or physical activity levels at 15 and 30 months in children taking part in the programme, compared with those not taking part. They suggest that “nudge” interventions, such as using financial incentives to prompt healthier behaviour, merit further investigation. But they conclude that school based motivational, educational approaches “are unlikely to halt the childhood obesity epidemic.” Prof Melissa Wake, paediatrician and obesity expert from Victoria, Australia, says in a linked editorial that it is time to step back and take stock. The important findings of the trial “could perhaps help break the cycle of policymakers continuing with ineffective educational preventive approaches that can never hope to greatly impact on the obesity epidemic.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"social-care-network/2018/feb/15/social-care-allowances-clarity-government-reform","type":"article","sectionId":"social-care-network","sectionName":"Social Care Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-15T11:58:34Z","webTitle":"Social care allowances are confusing – the government must offer clarity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2018/feb/15/social-care-allowances-clarity-government-reform","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/social-care-network/2018/feb/15/social-care-allowances-clarity-government-reform","fields":{"headline":"Social care allowances are confusing – the government must offer clarity","bodyText":"A new report details an expert panel’s solution to the care crisis: for national insurance to be replaced with a new, ringfenced tax dedicated to health and social care. It contends that few people would argue with reforming and raising tax, given the severe financial and capacity pressures on services. The panel’s proposals should be carefully considered – but the stark reality is that previous attempts to reform social care funding have been met with deep hostility, no matter how pragmatic they may have seemed to those proposing the policy. While the latest report recommends reinstating the Dilnot commission’s proposal of a cap on the costs of adult social care – which is sensible: people need clarity about what they need to save – it is arguably not clear enough about how the new funds will be distributed to the public. If people are expected to put more money into the system, they also need to be told what they are going to get. One of the effects of having health and care systems that work independently of each other is that those trying to navigate both can be left muddled. People don’t know what the state will contribute towards later life care – and often they don’t know how to get it, either. This means it is almost impossible for the public and the long-term care market to plan ahead efficiently, a situation that actively discourages self-provision for care. Currently, all people aged 65 and over are eligible for a basic state pension of £122.30 per week and those with care needs will be able to apply for a funded nursing care stipend and the attendance allowance. Combined, this means a person over 65 in need of care can access up to £360.45 per week. However, this system is not easy to navigate as it requires a person to have extensive knowledge of the allowances available from different government departments. Even with that knowledge, they will have to complete multiple assessments in order to access benefits that are rightfully theirs. These allowances should be packaged together so someone in need of care can go to one department to apply for a tax-free weekly sum for their care. This sum should include the money they would receive from the state pension and any other allowances. This could be paid directly to care providers and should be explained to the public as functioning in a similar way to the pension system. Like pensions, people will need to make their own contribution in addition to the state support if they wish to enhance their standard of living. The latest health and social care funding report sensibly calls for the government to to look to introduce incentives to encourage people to save more towards the costs of their adult social care, comparing it to the system of childcare costs paid via salary sacrifice. Often people’s largest asset after their home is their pension – money already earmarked for later life. The government could explore the option of incentivising people to use the pension system to allow them to channel their funds tax free into products such as care annuities. Social care reform has been a hotly debated political topic for years. The government has now positioned itself to deliver meaningful reform to the system, with a new social care green paper – and a newly enhanced remit for the health secretary. As it devises a new system and seeks a pragmatic response from the electorate, opposition parties and the media, it must offer clarity and simplicity. In the end the public simply want to know if they are going to get funding – and, if so, how much.

Unions say the job cuts are the result of £2.8bn of real-terms funding cuts in schools, where budgets are described as being at “breaking point”. Many schools are facing deficits and more than half of the biggest multi-academy chains have issued warnings about funding. Based on analysis of government figures, the unions say the 15,000 job losses equate to an average reduction of 5.5 members of teaching and support staff in every secondary since 2015. Almost half of those are classroom teachers, who are being lost at a time when pupil numbers are growing, according to the School Cuts alliance of education unions. It says the situation is likely to deteriorate, estimating that nine in 10 primary and secondary schools (17,942 in total) will be affected by a real-terms cut in funding during 2015-19. Some of the largest staffing cuts have been in areas with the lowest average funding per pupil, including Reading, the Isle of Wight, central Bedfordshire, the East Riding of Yorkshire, York, Derby and Milton Keynes. At the same time, the number of pupils in England has risen by 4,500 as a population bulge begins to move from primary to secondary schools, the alliance says. On average, the staff cuts equate to 2.4 classroom teachers, 1.6 teaching assistants and 1.5 support staff in every secondary since 2015. The unions say the government’s new funding formula, which aims to distribute money more fairly across the sector, will not solve the problem without further significant investment. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said school budgets were at breaking point. “School leaders have made every other possible efficiency and now it is impossible for many schools to avoid making redundancies, to continue to keep class sizes at an acceptable level, and to offer a full and rounded curriculum to all pupils,” he said. Unison said the cuts had had a major impact on the number of teaching assistants, leaving just one per 67 secondary pupils. Jon Richards, the union’s head of education, said: “Children with special educational needs and disabilities rely heavily on teaching assistants, so, sadly, they will be suffering the most as a result of these devastating staff cuts.” As well as job cuts, schools are having to reduce the number of subjects they offer and their extracurricular activities. In many schools, parents are being asked to make regular voluntary contributions. Parents at the high-achieving St Marylebone Church of England school for girls, in central London, recently received a letter from the chair of governors suggesting a voluntary contribution of up to £50 a month. It has experienced a funding cut of almost £1m in four years, amounting to £867 less per pupil. The school’s headteacher, Kathryn Pugh, said it was an annual appeal and stressed it was entirely voluntary. But she acknowledged the situation had become more urgent, saying: “A major part of my job is to make significant savings. We’ve had to reduce our staffing – we simply can’t afford to maintain the same levels. Most schools are in a similar sort of position.” Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “Our analysis of the government’s figures now confirms what teachers and headteachers have been saying for the last two years: the cuts to education are damaging for children’s education.” A Department for Education spokesperson said the unions’ figures were fundamentally misleading. “We are investing £41bn into our core schools funding in 2017-18 and £43.5bn in 2019-20. “As the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies has confirmed, funding per pupil will now be maintained in real terms between 2017-18 and 2019-20.” “We have a record number of teachers, with 15,000 more teachers in our classrooms than in 2010 and 32,000 new trainee teachers having recently been recruited.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/10/building-boom-in-chinas-tropics-as-beijings-smog-refugees-flee-toxic-air","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T05:00:39Z","webTitle":"Building boom in China's tropics as Beijing's 'smog refugees' flee toxic air","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/10/building-boom-in-chinas-tropics-as-beijings-smog-refugees-flee-toxic-air","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/10/building-boom-in-chinas-tropics-as-beijings-smog-refugees-flee-toxic-air","fields":{"headline":"Building boom in China's tropics as Beijing's 'smog refugees' flee toxic air","bodyText":"It was on 3 January last year, days after Beijing’s last major airpocalypse, that Ji Feng began to put into action his plan to escape one of the world’s most polluted cities. After more than two decades as a resident of China’s smog-choked capital, he boarded a flight for Jinghong, an azure-skied river town in Yunnan province, close to China’s borders with Myanmar and Laos. There, more than 1,600 miles from Beijing’s toxic climes, Ji coughed up 460,000 yuan (£52,000) for a two-bedroom flat in a palm-dotted condominium near the Mekong river. Two months later he returned with his wife, Liu Bing, to start afresh. The couple placed a doormat at the entrance to their pollution-free abode that read: “Natural life.” “I don’t miss the urban life,” he said. “And now we’ve moved here, the chances of us going back are slim. For me, life’s better here.” Ji and Liu, 40 and 32, are part of a small but telling band of jaded Chinese urbanites seeking to outrun the hustle and bustle of their country’s big smoke. Some are permanently moving to China’s comparatively peaceful and preserved periphery, putting down roots in places such as Yunnan or Hainan, a tropical outpost in the South China Sea. “Stocks and futures!” Ji chuckled when asked how he made a living in his new home. Others are seasonal migrants – so-called “smog refugees” or elderly “migratory birds” – who take extended annual breaks to avoid the worst of the winter weather. President Xi Jinping recently launched his second term with a pledge to make China’s skies blue again and experts say he is making progress: in November Beijing’s air quality was better than any previous winter month on record, according to Greenpeace. But many cities still endure hazardous smog episodes that are blamed for up to a million premature deaths each year. Hotels catering to such urban fugitives have sprung up across Jinghong, the capital of Yunnan’s Xishuangbanna prefecture. At one, a check-in brochure promises guests an “untainted” stay. “Don’t worry: you won’t get intoxicated with the fresh air,” it says. Property developers are also cashing in, throwing up gîtes and apartments partly geared towards China’s “clean lung” market. At Jinghong’s airport, posters announce one gated community called Viva Villa with the slogan “Fresh air!”. “The weather’s really good; there are no chemical factories and we have tropical forest,” boasted Li Rongrong, a sales agent, as she showed off mansions in a soon-to-open compound called Rivulet Villas. Li Yanjun, a budding estate agent, said green living was a key part of his sales pitch to northerners. “The only time we talk about PM2.5 here is when we’re trying to sell a property to someone from Beijing,” the 35-year-old joked, referring to the minuscule particulates that strike fear into the hearts – and lungs – of Beijingers. Xishuangbanna’s renown as an oasis of fresh air and forests has made it one of China’s premier domestic clean lung destinations. But some locals fear that very reputation is now robbing the region of some of its natural charms. The stampede of tourists and developers has transformed Jinghong’s skyline over the past decade. Gargantuan luxury hotels now rise from patches of forest – half fortresses, half multistorey car parks. Look in one direction and you see yellow cranes erecting Nine Towers, Twelve Villages, a garish riverside resort of high-rises and shopping malls built on the site of a recently bulldozed village that was inhabited by members of the Dai ethnic minority. Look the other way and you see part of the construction site for a high-speed rail line that will link Yunnan’s capital, Kunming – as well as Jinghong – with the Laotian capital, Vientiane, and, possibly one day, Singapore. “All the major developers are now coming,” said Li. “The city is booming.” Smog is not the only factor driving migration to Xishuangbanna. Ji, who used to work for the state-run China Development Bank, said he was also tired of human beings. “Beijing has too many people, it’s too big, and has too many tall buildings. I don’t like it.” Jin Di, a Beijinger who runs Jinghong’s first craft brewery, Big Black Dog, said he came chasing opportunity; others were attracted by property prices: “You can sell one house in Beijing and buy 10 here.” But Jin, 37, said he regularly hosted northern guests who had received medical orders to quit the capital. “Last year a lot of my friends came here because their children were always coughing – very serious coughs – and the doctor advised them to change place … because if your children stay in Beijing they will not [get better].” During 2016’s airpocalypse, “a lot of people came here to buy houses”, he said. Li, the estate agent, 35, said he had mixed feelings about the changes. As the first member of a family of rubber tappers to go to university, he had benefited directly from two decades of development. But such growth was “a double-edged sword”: cement factories on the outskirts of town meant Jinghong was no longer completely smog-free. Ji and Liu, who hope to start a family in their new home, said they were also wary of unbridled growth and the pollution from the growing numbers of cars and construction sites. Still, having spent more than half his life in mega-cities, including a year in São Paulo, Brazil (population 20 million), Ji said he was happy with life in Jinghong, which has only about 530,000 residents. “The air is good. The weather is good. If we want to climb mountains, all we have to do is drive for a few minutes … In every respect, things are better here.” How long would they stay? “I don’t know – maybe forever,” he replied, before correcting himself: “Probably.” Additional reporting by Wang Zhen"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/17/best-thing-i-ate-in-2017-jamie-oliver-nadiya-hussain","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T11:00:28Z","webTitle":"The best thing I ate in 2017","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/17/best-thing-i-ate-in-2017-jamie-oliver-nadiya-hussain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/17/best-thing-i-ate-in-2017-jamie-oliver-nadiya-hussain","fields":{"headline":"The best thing I ate in 2017","bodyText":"Stuffed squid, Salina, Sicily Jamie Oliver: cook, activist, food writer This year, me and Gennaro spent a day with a lovely 92-year-old Italian nonna called Franchina, on Salina in the Aeolian islands. The local fisherman caught a squid – and Franchina made this incredible stuffing of capers, lemon zest, garlic, pecorino, breadcrumbs and parsley. She stuffed the squid and stitched it up, then braised it in the most beautiful sweet tomato sauce with basil. Just let it chug away, then you simply cook some spaghetti, and have the sliced squid with the sauce. It was pure joy, joy, joy. We’d spent the whole day cooking and chatting together, and Franchina was adamant that I share the recipe in my Italian book that I’ve just finished writing, so that younger generations learn how to cook it – she was really worried that people don’t cook like that any more and things are changing. So, I see it as our job as food writers and magazines to keep it alive. Tunworth cheese, Cheesy Tiger, Margate Marina O’Loughlin: restaurant critic I thought about this long and hard, considering the insanely good shou pa chicken from Xu, the pistachio ice-cream from the beach restaurant in Sicily, the porcini doughnuts with raclette from San Francisco’s Rich Table or the fresh crab roll from the Spud Point Crab Company in Sonoma, near where Hitchcock filmed The Birds. But in the end it had to be the thing that gave me the purest jolt of sheer, physical pleasure – and it was one of the simplest. Rackety, eccentric Cheesy Tiger on Margate’s Harbour Arm takes a whole Tunworth cheese (like the perfect, ripe camembert you rarely ever find), studs it with fat slabs of garlic, crowns with thyme and olive oil and bakes until it’s virtually liquid. With tiny new potatoes – roasted with more garlic, whole cloves for squeezing on top – plus toasted sourdough and cornichons: for this turophile, it’s undiluted bliss. Poached brain at Clown Bar, Paris Fergus Henderson: St John, London I’ve had quite a few good things this year but one that really sticks in my mind is brain at Clown Bar in Paris. Beautiful. Clean. Two pale lobes in a small bowl. Gosh, that’s quite a lot of brain. A lovely citric, slightly sharp dressing on it didn’t kill it but helped the brain come to the fore. A tamed cloud of joy. A thing of beauty, as well as delicious. Shiitake broth with turnip and clementine at P Franco, London Olia Hercules: food writer In January, I had a mindblowing dish cooked by Tim Spedding, who was doing a residency at P Franco wine bar in Hackney. It was a shiitake broth with turnip and little segments of clementine in it. Tim wouldn’t tell me what he did to make the broth so viscous – I think he boils down millions of shiitakes so it was super-concentrated and rich, but light at the same time. I don’t know how he made clementine work with mushrooms but the combination was inspired. All this was done on a couple of portable stoves at the back of the tiny bar – P Franco has the feeling of being in somebody’s kitchen, but surrounded by loads of really good wine. Cromer crab, Norfolk Nadiya Hussain Food writer and broadcaster The best thing I have eaten this year is Cromer crab in Norfolk. We all talk about fresh food but when the journey from boat, to boiling water, to mouth is so short you really can tell the difference. Although I would rather somebody else does the boat bit! Actually, probably the best thing I ate this year is something I drank. I drank kombucha for the first time. It is a fermented tea, which sounds disgusting but it is sweetened and you can flavour it with different fruits. The only way I can describe it is it tastes like apple cider vinegar mixed with fruit. That doesn’t make it sound any more appealing. But it is so delicious. Nadiya’s Bake Me a Festive Story (illustrations by Clair Rossiter), £14.99 Hodder Children’s Books. To order a copy for £12.74, go to guardianbookshop.com Crisps, Hole in the Wall, Little Wilbraham, Cambridgeshire Bee Wilson: food writer If I say that the best thing I ate all year was some crisps, you’ll think me ridiculous. Bear with me. We were eating dinner at the Hole in the Wall, a deeply comforting restaurant in a 16th-century Cambridgeshire pub run by chef Alex Rushmer. Before dinner there were always home-made crisps. They weren’t made from beetroot or kale or anything trendy, just normal potatoes. But they were sublime: warm and rustly and moreish as toast. Nibbling them, with a glass of champagne, I was reminded that potato crisps used to be a high Edwardian luxury. Each one tasted slightly different, having fried to varying shades of golden. I was eating with my oldest son, to toast him getting a college offer and turning 18. He would soon be off on gap year in China and there wouldn’t be many more shared meals like this one. We didn’t realise Rushmer would close The Hole in the Wall a few months later, so the memory of that meal is bittersweet. The restaurant is gone. My son’s place at the family dinner table is empty. But I remember the crisps. Moo ping at Moo Ping Hea Owen, Bangkok Andrew Wong: A Wong, London My wife and I went to Thailand in April (for our honeymoon, five years after getting married). The best meals by far were at really basic places. A customer of ours who lives in Bangkok recommended Hea Owen for moo ping, which is basically a marinated pork skewer cooked over charcoal on the side of the street. The pork is sliced really thinly and then skewered, so it seals together into a single piece when you cook it. It comes with a slightly fermented peanut vinaigrette, which was sweet but also sharp and just really delicious. I’ve been trying to recreate it since I came back and I can’t do it, so there must be something about it I still don’t understand. Hugh Maguire’s smoked black pudding Zoe Adjonyoh: Zoe’s Ghana Kitchen, London This year I was invited to judge the Great Taste Awards, and my God there was some great tasting artisanal products in the running. However, there was one that just blew me away with the simplicity of the idea and the complexity of its flavour profile: a smoked black pudding from Hugh Maguire butchers in Co Meath, which ended up as this year’s supreme champion. Being half-Irish – my mother was from west Cork – meant that I grew up eating black pudding regularly. Clonakilty black pudding has always been the benchmark for me, until I tasted Hugh Maguire’s ingenious twist. The smokiness and the melt-in-the-mouth consistency really blew me away. I can’t believe nobody ever thought of it before. Yakhni in Srinigar, India Anissa Helou: food writer In Kashmir, having just finished my book about cooking in the Islamic world, I had an incredible lamb and yogurt dish called yakhni. It was part of a bigger meal cooked at home by Baji, the sister-in-law of my writer friend Marryam Reshii, and what was so interesting for me was its similarity to a Lebanese dish from my childhood called laban emmoh (meaning “its mother’s milk”). Baji made the whole thing sitting on the floor of her tiny kitchen, hardly more than a metre squared, cooking the yogurt separately from the meat and spices and then bringing them together with dried mint. The Lebanese dish is made in a very similar way, even down to the dried mint (though we sometimes use fresh coriander), but the taste was completely different and I loved it. Coal-roasted lamb at Ergospasio Asian Restaurant, Elounda, Crete Tom Kerridge: The Hand &amp; Flowers, Marlow, Bucks I don’t get to go on holiday very often, but this year we made it to Crete. In Elounda, on the northern coast, there were all these seafront restaurants touting for business – “come and eat the best fish here” – but right at the end of the row was a bar with a big outdoor coal-fired grill, where they’d roast a whole lamb every evening, asador-style. There was nothing fancy about it, we just had it with a beautiful Greek salad, but it was jaw-droppingly good, with the salty kick you get from island lamb. 898 Squash, bred by Michael Mazourek at Cornell University Dan Barber: Blue Hill, Manhattan It’s been almost 10 years since I stood in the kitchen with Michael Mazourek, a talented plant breeder at Cornell University, and asked him half-jokingly if he could breed a butternut squash to actually taste good. Since chefs and home cooks heroically work to eke out flavour from this workaday squash –or reach for maple syrup or honey to do the trick – I thought it was a fair question. Michael stared at me with utter seriousness and said it was the first time, in all his years breeding squash, that anyone had ever asked him to breed for flavour. I’ll never forget that. Fast-forward eight years and we now have the honeynut, a new variety of squash exactly as envisioned: a miniature version of the butternut with amped-up, deliciously sweet squash flavour. Not long ago, Michael showed us the next generation of the honeynut, which the cooks and I have helped co-select for flavour. It’s still a trial number – “898” –but is easily the most exciting (read: delicious) thing I tasted all year. More than that, I recognised something powerful about our baby butternut. As chefs and eaters, we have the opportunity (and maybe the responsibility?) to create the best flavours imaginable by writing a recipe that starts with the seed. What I tasted is the blueprint for the future of food. Butter chicken at Goila Butter Chicken, Mumbai Romy Gill: Romy’s Kitchen, Thornbury My friend Saransh Goila is a very talented chef who has a takeaway place in Mumbai. He makes the best butter chicken I have ever had. I make a nice one, but that was the best. He smokes with coal on the side, and gets the balance of smokiness and texture so right with the juicy, tender chicken. He made me a lucha paratha; it is a small paratha, and quite difficult to make, but it goes so, so well with butter chicken. Then we had naan bombs. The dough is the naan dough, and has tandoori chicken in it, a lot of spices and a hint of chutney. He bakes them, and they are so delicious and light – I have never had anything like that. He is so young, but so clever. King crab at Fäviken, Sweden Tommy Banks: The Black Swan at Oldstead, Yorkshire Fäviken is a restaurant in a remote part of central Sweden – the nearest town is half an hour away – run by the chef Magnus Nilsson. It’s an amazing piece of theatre: everyone arrives at the same time and they serve dinner like a banquet. The food is quite minimal: it’s all about the produce. The whole meal was amazing but the king crab was the best bit of seafood I’ve ever eaten. They took a big piece of meat from the claw, seared it off on a really high heat, and served it with what they describe as almost-burnt cream – it’s like that delicious bit you get in dauphinoise potatoes when the cream has caramelised on the side of the pot. It felt so brazen, serving cream that’s almost caught, but the taste was phenomenal. Mohinga at the Rangoon Sisters supper club Grace Dent: restaurant critic No one invites me to dinner in their home. No one. Oh, when they’re tipsy they say they will, but in the cold sober light of day they picture a restaurant critic appearing in their home, possibly carrying a spiral jotter and a pen, to judge them harshly. “Let’s book a table!” they say, instead. So, probably the nicest thing I put in my mouth in 2017 was in August when cooking duo the Rangoon Sisters beckoned me into their house and fed me a bowl of Burmese mohinga soup, a fishy, noodly, sweet, sour broth. It’s sort of fideu and sort of pho, but uniquely satisfying. A comforting hug of lemongrass and catfish with garlic, banana stem and fish sauce, shot through with vermicelli. It arrived topped with crispy chickpea fritters and a handful of coriander. There’s a reason many Burmese people eat this for breakfast. It’s joyous. Roast pork in Tahiti Monica Galetti: Mere, London In Tahiti in September, while filming Amazing Hotels for the BBC, we met up with some locals who were doing a bit of celebrating on the beach and they cooked the most amazing pork belly. They wrapped the pork in banana leaves, with a bit of coconut milk through it, and baked it underground. It’s very similar to how we cook in Samoa, where I was born, except we’d use heated volcanic rocks whereas they used coral. The pork was just flaking apart when they took it out. Some of it had charred where it caught on the hot coral, giving it a smoky, salty flavour. It was so wonderful. I want some now. Spiced scrag end pie at Jikoni, London Itamar Srulovich: Honey &amp; Co, London I want to say the shepherd’s pie at Jikoni was my favourite dish this year, but it’s not technically a shepherd’s pie. Instead of lamb mince, the chef Ravinder Bhogal uses good quality mutton which is slowly braised and then shredded. The meat is beautifully spiced and so are the potatoes on top. It’s really special – perfect for a cosy evening out in the middle of winter. Bihari kebab in Uttar Pradesh Asma Khan: Darjeeling Express, London Growing up in Kolkata, my favourite dish was bihari kebab made by our wonderful cook, Haji Waheed. He taught a girl, who is now the family chef, and she made this for me and it tasted just the way he used to make it. She cooked it on charcoal, in the courtyard of my parents’ home, and that smell reminded me of my childhood. There is no kebab like it. This one was buffalo. When I was growing up it was beef. The meat is cut into strips and marinated with raw papaya, which works as a tenderiser. The strips are covered in crushed poppy seeds and crushed nuts, marinated for 24 hours and slow cooked. It is served with paratha and classic sides of onion and lemons – and that is it. I have the recipe but I haven’t had the courage to make it. I am too in awe of it. Mark Hix’s pheasant curry Angela Hartnett: Murano, London There were 10 of us at an informal party at Mark Hix’s house for a friend’s birthday. Mark was just cooking away and we were eating and drinking nice wine. People usually associate Mark with English food but he likes to turn his hand to all kinds of things. He made lots of small dishes – a lamb sweetbread curry, some sea purslane onion bhajis, a lobster biryani – but it was the spicy, meaty pheasant curry that really stood out for me. Absolutely delicious. Nam khao tod at Night + Market Song, Los Angeles Lee Tiernan: Black Axe Mangal, London I ordered the crispy rice salad, which has fermented Thai sausage in it. It’s super delicious, spicy, fresh and vibrant. My friend, who had been before, said “We have to get this.” And then it came and I was in full agreement. I’ve thought about it a lot since. It’s a statement to me of how food and attitudes towards food have evolved. I’ve noticed people are more up for trying challenging ingredients and heightened levels of spice when they eat out. It’s always refreshing to find somewhere like Night + Market that embraces the bold. Rice and curry at Thaulle Resort, Thissamaharama Fuchsia Dunlop: food writer Rice and curry is a typical meal in Sri Lanka, but every time you get it it’s different – and it’s not just rice and curry, it’s rice with several contrasting curries. This particular one was in the south of Sri Lanka. We had red rice with deep fried curry leaves. Cucumber curry was a revelation: slices of peeled, deseeded cucumber in a thick coconut milk that was golden from turmeric, with garlic, curry leaves and red onion. There was a cuttlefish curry with a red chilli sauce, fish curry and pumpkin curry, and an amazing relish made from deep-fried dried fish with fried onion, curry leaves and chilli. Also something that looked a bit like tabbouleh: chopped gotu kola leaves with grated coconut and various other flavourings. We were sitting on a gorgeous terrace on a sunny day and it was this beautiful palette of colours and flavours. It was my first trip to south Asia and the food was unlike anything I was used to. Also, we were eating with our hands, which is a really interesting way of engaging with the food if that’s not what you’re used to. Tater tots, creme fraiche and caviar at PDT, New York Nadine Redzepi: cookery writer I am in the very fortunate situation of being married to a brilliant chef and have good friends who also happen to be incredible chefs and own brilliant restaurants. My first impulse was to write about the very last dinner at Noma before it closed in the original space, or about the Noma Mexico meal, but it seemed like it would be too obvious. When I was in New York, I went to PDT, a cocktail bar (it stands for ‘please don’t tell’) and even though I’m the sort of person who prefers a glass of wine, I was dying to go after seeing a post on David Chang’s Instagram of golden brown tater tots, creme fraiche and caviar. It looked like a mix of potato chips, and a tiny hasselback potato. I was sure I would love them. To get into PDT you enter a hotdog joint that has a phone booth in it, pick up the phone and if you are lucky and they have space, the wall opens and you step into a cozy, darkly lit bar. It made me think of Harry Potter going to the Ministry of Magic. After sipping delicious cocktails for a few minutes out came a bowl filled with steaming, golden brown tater tots, along with a small bowl of creme fraiche and a tin of caviar. The tater tots smelled so good, I first tried one all by itself. It was crispy on the outside like the best chicken skin with comforting soft potato on the inside. For the next one, I added about half a teaspoon of creme fraiche and a full teaspoon of caviar. I put it in my mouth and closed my eyes: for a second I forgot about where I was, lost in the pure, simple deliciousness of crispy, creamy, salty perfection. Roasted porcini with borlotti beans, Tuscany Ruth Rogers: River Café, London In early August, when the first porcini mushrooms came, we roasted them whole at my cousin Ernesto Bartolini’s house in Tuscany and ate them with fresh borlotti beans, which were also in season. The porcini we roasted with thyme and a bit of garlic. They worked so well with the beans, which have a really creamy consistency if you cook them long enough – we did them with sage and a little garlic, finished with black pepper, salt and a lot of good Tuscan olive oil. Very simple but really very delicious. Being fed at St John Bread &amp; Wine, London Gary Usher: Wreckfish Bistro, Liverpool My best friend Farokh Talati is the head chef at St John Bread &amp; Wine, so I go all the time. While I do love it there, it’s just kind of like, “Whatever, I am going to get something to eat and see my friend and not really think about it too much.” I sit at the bar and Farokh will give me a couple of bits. But when I went in the summer, it was just stunning. Everything was amazing. Rarebit. Foie gras pate on toast. The vegetable dish was cheese, this really good Saint Cera with a couple of spring onions. Really well thought out, simple food. Simple food has to be perfect. My good food experiences are never planned. They’re unexpected, by chance. I hadn’t even wanted anything to eat that day."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/07/champions-league-draw-who-can-premier-league-teams-draw-in-last-16","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T11:08:55Z","webTitle":"Champions League draw: who can the Premier League five meet in last 16?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/07/champions-league-draw-who-can-premier-league-teams-draw-in-last-16","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/07/champions-league-draw-who-can-premier-league-teams-draw-in-last-16","fields":{"headline":"Champions League draw: who can the Premier League five meet in last 16?","bodyText":"Five English teams are in the last 16. Is that a record? Yes it is. Never before have so many clubs from one country reached this stage of the tournament. It became possible to enter five teams only from 2015-16, when the Europa League winners were awarded a Champions League place. Spain had five clubs in the 2015-16 group stage after Sevilla won that tournament but only three progressed. Manchester United’s Europa League triumph last season put them in the Champions League with Chelsea, Manchester City, Tottenham and Liverpool. Liverpool won a play-off against Hoffenheim to make it five English clubs in the group stage. When is the last-16 draw and how does it work? It takes place on Monday from 11am GMT and you will be able to follow it on the Guardian’s website. Group winners are seeded and will face a group runner-up but teams from the same nation cannot play one another and nor can teams who were in the same group. Where did the Premier League clubs finish in their groups? Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool and Tottenham won their groups. Chelsea finished second. Only once before have four clubs from one country reached the last 16 as group winners: in 2006-07 when Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United did it. So there aren’t many possibilities for Chelsea in the draw then? Correct. They know they will face Paris St-Germain, Barcelona or Besiktas – and it is fair to assume they hope to land the Turkish club, who finished top of a group that also included Porto, RB Leipzig and Monaco. Chelsea have the greatest probability (44%) of facing Barcelona, though, because Barcelona cannot be drawn against Juventus, who were in their group, Real Madrid or Sevilla. The group winners will have it easier then? Not necessarily. Bayern Munich, Juventus and Real Madrid finished as runners-up so they lie in wait, although Tottenham came out of Madrid’s group and so cannot play them in the last 16. The other non-English clubs that went through in second place are Basel, Sevilla, Shakhtar Donetsk and Porto. So who can Manchester United get? One of Bayern, Juventus, Sevilla, Shakhtar, Porto or Real Madrid. How about Liverpool? They will face Basel, Bayern, Juventus, Shakhtar, Porto or Real Madrid. And Manchester City? One of Basel, Bayern, Juventus, Sevilla, Porto or Real Madrid. And finally Tottenham? They can meet Basel, Bayern, Juventus, Sevilla, Shakhtar or Porto. When will those ties take place? The group winners will be away in the first legs on 13-14 and 20-21 February and at home in the second legs on 6-7 and 13-14 March. Have four clubs from one country made the quarter-finals before? Yes, twice – and involving English clubs each time. Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United got that far in 2007-08; then Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United repeated the trick the following season."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/07/star-wars-last-jed-plucky-films-going-up-against","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T12:34:56Z","webTitle":"Size matters not: the plucky films going up against The Last Jedi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/07/star-wars-last-jed-plucky-films-going-up-against","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/07/star-wars-last-jed-plucky-films-going-up-against","fields":{"headline":"Size matters not: the plucky films going up against The Last Jedi","bodyText":"If you thought Luke Skywalker’s victory over the empire was the most thrilling tale of against-the-odds rebellion in the universe, then you haven’t been paying attention to the cinema listings for the weekend of 15 December. That’s when The Last Jedi, AKA Star Wars: Episode VIII, opens at UK cinemas, along with eight films you’ve probably never heard of. “When you’ve got a behemoth like that, a lot of films will run terrified,” says Andreas Wiseman, deputy editor of Screen International. “They did when The Force Awakens came out in 2015. But it’s interesting to see that this time they’re not quite as terrified.” Indeed, a long time ago (in a galaxy far, far away etc), a film like the Chinese coming-of-age drama Youth or the meditative, Willem Dafoe-narrated documentary Mountain (both out on 15 December) would have been more or less assured a small but bankable audience on screens booked in the UK’s arthouse cinemas. “We never show the Star Wars or the Bond films because that’s not really what we’re about,” says Allison Gardner, programme director at Glasgow Film Theatre. “It’s nothing to do with whether I think these films are quality or not, but they’re on everywhere. Our job is to give people a wider choice.” They will instead be showing Song of Granite, an Irish folk-singer biopic, and Prince of Nothingwood, a documentary about Afghanistan’s most prolific film actor-producer, the swashbuckling Salim Shaheen. And they’ll have their annual festive classic screenings with mulled wine, mince pies and hankies: “We take probably as much on It’s a Wonderful Life as some of the smaller commercial cinemas do on Star Wars.” Cinemas willing to take such a stand are increasingly rare, however, with Curzon, Picturehouse and several other independent chains all choosing to include Star Wars films in their programmes, often to the exclusion of less bankable arthouse or foreign-language options. So why on earth would any independent film distributor choose to go up against The Last Jedi? “I do work in mysterious ways,” confesses Martin Myers, the founder of Miracle Communications, the distribution company responsible for releasing two of the non-Star Wars films out on the weekend in question. One is Bingo: The King of the Mornings, a Brazilian biographical drama about an 80s TV clown, which, Myers says, he opted to release in December, “purely for Bafta qualification if I’m absolutely frank with you because you have to have 10 cinemas play [it] before February”. The other is the low-budget, British psychological thriller The Unseen, released opposite The Last Jedi because “we just felt that it was [good] counter-programming”. Counter-programming? When contemplating those rammed mid-December schedules, you would be forgiven for assuming that offering audiences an alternative was a lost art in cinema. In fact, there are still some expert practitioners, including Myers, who learned the basics at his late father’s knee. Back in 1976, Myers Sr did such a good job drumming up audiences for the European release of Assault on Precinct 13 that its director, John Carpenter, was moved to name his infamous Halloween character Mike Myers in tribute. “You have to look at the calendar and see what else is out there,” says Myers Jr. It’s common sense to release children’s films during the school holidays, for instance: “The only thing with Whit Sunday half-term is that you can never guarantee if you’re going to get hot weather. Then, obviously, you struggle.” A big sporting event remains a good time to release a romcom (our modern, gender-neutral sensibilities notwithstanding). Although if England reaches the semi-final stage of the World Cup next year it’s another distributor’s headache: “Then, everyone wants to watch the football.” Getting the date right is a crucial component of any film’s release strategy, but perhaps less so for a film like The Last Jedi, which has been shuffled from an initial 26 March 2017 release slot, to its present one. “Huge movies tend to have extra work go into them late in their process,” suggests Wiseman. “I think maybe off the back of The Force Awakens’ huge $2bn take they thought: ‘Well, look, give [Last Jedi director] Rian [Johnson] a bit more time to do his thing and we’re going to do super-well at Christmas, anyway.’ At the end of the day, Star Wars is always king.” The regal bearing of a new Star Wars, combined with the fact that the franchise appeals across demographics, presents a particular problem for aspiring counter-programmers. But Fox – the only other big studio to step into the fray – has spotted an opening for Ferdinand, its U-certificate animation about a gentle bull who would rather smell flowers than fight matadors. “On paper, while it might not be Ice Age, it still could do very well,” says Wiseman. “They’ll look to be the real kids’ movie over Christmas, whereas Star Wars might be doing [children who are] a little older.” In the US, in fact, Ferdinand is one of only two films out on The Last Jedi weekend. The other, Permanent, is an 80s-set indie comedy about a misfit family starring the US Office’s Rainn Wilson and Patricia Arquette. So, thematically fitting, at least. Could this underdog drama appeal to an underdog crowd? Wiseman isn’t convinced: “I don’t know if that is a strategy they’re employing, but, if it is, I think it’s just a total gamble. Star Wars does appeal to so many different groups; it’s one of the real juggernauts. There aren’t many chinks in its armour. Could Permanent be a breakout? It’s possible, but if it is a breakout, I imagine it’s going to be a very contained breakout.” Most of the films going up against The Last Jedi will be adopting a more tried-and-tested release strategy, one that prioritises making play for press coverage over box office takings. “We thought we were being quite clever, to be honest,” says Gary Sinyor, director of The Unseen. “Obviously, the other big films avoid Star Wars like the plague, but we’re not a big film. Our thinking was that, normally, we might get lost, but if we’re the only other fiction film out that week then the papers should, hopefully, give us more space. And, since the reviews are good, that’s a positive.” In the event, however, The Last Jedi’s tractor beam has been difficult to escape: “We were told, particularly, I think, by Vue and Odeon, that there was no room at the inn. Which is quite appropriate for Christmas,” says Sinyor. Yet this situation has only made him more determined to ensure The Unseen doesn’t live up to its title too literally. He has already taken out adverts in the national press asking Disney’s CEO, Bob Iger, to release a single screen in central London on 15 December. “Be afraid of us the Empire need not,” reads the payoff line. Still, not every film out that weekend considers The Last Jedi to be a threat. The Prince of Nothingwood’s director, Sonia Kronlund, says it would make an excellent double-bill with her documentary, since both are “about the childhood of cinema, in a way … Star Wars is taking adults back to childhood and Shaheen is a ‘child’ making movies.” But what would the Afghan film impresario Salim Shaheen, AKA the Prince of Nothingwood himself, have to say about this box office non-battle. “I know exactly what he would say: ‘In my film, everything is real; we shot with real bullets. In their Star Wars films, nothing is real.’” Kronlund is amused by her subject’s bravado, but when it comes to what really matters, she agrees that there’s really no comparison between the Hollywood franchise machine and passion-driven, independent film-makers all over the world, from Shaheen to Sinyor. “They would really risk their lives. These guys are true, genuine lovers of the cinema. Whereas Star Wars people don’t risk anything. Except for money, maybe.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/dec/11/the-best-50-tv-shows-of-2017-no-7-the-deuce","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T06:00:13Z","webTitle":"The 50 best TV shows of 2017: No 7 The Deuce","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/11/the-best-50-tv-shows-of-2017-no-7-the-deuce","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/11/the-best-50-tv-shows-of-2017-no-7-the-deuce","fields":{"headline":"The 50 best TV shows of 2017: No 7 The Deuce","bodyText":"When David Simon announces he’s making a new TV series, even the most jaded of critics tend to take notice. Sure, not everything Simon touches turns to gold, but the creator of The Wire has more than earned the widespread goodwill he enjoys: few writers are as comfortable turning difficult, complicated subjects into intricate, heartbreaking TV. The birth of the porn industry in 1970s New York does not make for the most promising of subject matters. Not only have we been here before in everything from Boogie Nights to the 2004 documentary Inside Deep Throat, but also the last time HBO visited the 70s it was for the big-budget excesses of Vinyl, a show whose multiple failings remain an all-too-vivid memory. However, if we’ve learnt anything from Simon’s previous work, it’s that he excels at making the unpromising very promising indeed. The Deuce is a cleverly told tale of sex, commerce and the price of power, which works because it looks at the sex industry as a job, with the same problems and complaints as any other. Thus the street workers trade war stories in a dimly lit Times Square cafe (“Daddies, husbands and pimps – they’re all the same. They love you for who you are until you try to be someone else,” states the tired-before-her-time Ashley), while their pimps sardonically shoot the breeze about “product” while noting that President Nixon is the biggest pimp of all. Everyone here is on the make, from James Franco’s sad-sack Vincent (even his moustache seems to droop despairingly in contrast to that of twin brother Frankie, also played by Franco) to Maggie Gyllenhaal’s entrepreneurial Eileen, AKA Candy, who sees sex movies as her shot at financial freedom. Such dark subject matter could have made for an extremely depressing series, but The Deuce is vibrant, visceral viewing which frequently takes the most well-worn scenarios – a wide-eyed young girl arrives in the big bad city from the midwest; a young mother visits her child, who has no idea about her real job – and upends them: the girl is not so wide-eyed and has her own ideas about how to survive in New York; the young mother feels no guilt about leaving her son with her own mother – she too has a vision of how to survive. It helps that Simon has a terrific writing team, including crime novelists George Pelecanos, Richard Price, Lisa Lutz and Megan Abbott. It was Abbott who wrote the series’ best episode, Au Reservoir, which showed us with compassion and honesty that even the most hard-edged characters, such as Gary Carr’s violent CC, were simply scrabbling to survive. This generosity of spirit is the show’s greatest gift. Where other series use sex as titillation, The Deuce prefers to examine the nature of desire, both fantasy and reality. The sweet-natured Darlene (a wonderful Dominique Fishback) might find her escape in old movies, but she is capable of sharp-eyed savviness when on the job: her silent side-eye to Eileen during the shooting of a porn scene says more than any number of sharply scripted words. Similarly the show’s bleak finale, My Name is Ruby, highlighted the difference between Eileen – who uses her understanding of fantasy to move behind the camera (uttering the memorable line: “His dick takes us in, if we start on the pussy there’s no story”) – and her friend Ruby (Pernell Walker), AKA Thunder Thighs, who talks a good game but can’t protect herself from the brutal reality of picking a bad john. The series’ closing scenes, in which street worker Lori looks wide-eyed at a seemingly on-top-of-the-world Linda Lovelace at the premiere for Deep Throat, further highlights that disconnect between starry fantasy and bitter reality. The same goes for a small but telling moment when police officer Chris Alston (Lawrence Gillard Jnr), one of the few people on the show with anything approaching a conscience, realises that any relationship with reporter Sandra (Natalie Paul) will come at the price of his job. It is its melancholy streak that makes this series so worthwhile. The Deuce might be hard to watch at times but it is also a truly adult drama about the adult film industry: thoughtful, candid, complex and surprisingly warm underneath all that grime.

During an interview marking the conclusion of the parliamentary sittings for 2017, Turnbull told the ABC Labor had “produced no evidence – not even an argument” that any member of the government was ineligible to sit in the parliament. Continuing in combative mode, the prime minister pointedly declined to credit Labor with working cooperatively to achieve Thursday’s historic parliamentary vote to legalise same-sex marriage, blasted the ABC for its reporting of competing arguments in the citizenship imbroglio and Turnbull told his interviewer, Leigh Sales, that she would have to ask his internal critics why they “snipe”. “You’d have to ask, ah, the snipers, I suppose, why they snipe,” the prime minister said. “Look, you know something? I focus on getting things done. I focus on delivering a thousand jobs a day.” Turnbull said despite the regular queries about his team not being onside, the team had done “an amazing job”, delivering childcare reform, tax reform, national security reform and resolving the national energy guarantee. “It’s a very, very long list of achievements that we have got done despite our many failings, which you remind me of from time to time, and, of course, the fact that we don’t have a majority in the Senate,” he said. The interview followed a hectic final day in parliament in which marriage equality was legislated and the government introduced a much telegraphed package of legislation designed to minimise the risks of foreign interference in Australia’s political system. Legal experts warned on Thursday that part of the new package, a proposal to ban foreign donations, would likely end up in the high court, because it might offend the implied right of political communication. The Nationals also created a headache for the prime minister by selecting a new deputy leader, Bridget McKenzie, who is not currently in cabinet. This development means Turnbull will have to use a reshuffle expected on 17 December to either dump one of the existing Nationals frontbenchers to accommodate McKenzie, or expand the frontbench. The attorney general, George Brandis, has already confirmed that Peter Dutton will be sworn in as home affairs minister on 17 December, and Turnbull also needs to use the reshuffle to replace the special minister of state, Scott Ryan, who has departed to be the new Senate president. But while widespread speculation persists that Brandis will exit the Turnbull ministry at the time of the reshuffle, bound for a government appointment, the attorney general told Sky News earlier this week that his “intention” was to remain where he was. The government is also hanging on the result of a byelection due in Bennelong on 16 December, to see if the Liberal John Alexander can hold on to the seat he won at the last election by a margin of just under 10%. The government will also bring an official end to the political year by delivering the midyear economic and fiscal outlook, the budget update, on 18 December."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2017/dec/07/brexit-deal-may-varadkar-eu-less-hospitable-for-foreign-talent-after-brexit-says-banking-chief-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T16:59:08Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson rejects claims he had to back down from telling EU to 'go whistle' over 'Brexit bill' – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/dec/07/brexit-deal-may-varadkar-eu-less-hospitable-for-foreign-talent-after-brexit-says-banking-chief-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2017/dec/07/brexit-deal-may-varadkar-eu-less-hospitable-for-foreign-talent-after-brexit-says-banking-chief-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson rejects claims he had to back down from telling EU to 'go whistle' over 'Brexit bill' – as it happened","bodyText":"The Irish government has said it will not back any new Brexit deal that alters the core principles of what was agreed earlier this week. Speaking in the Dail in Dublin, Simon Coveney, the Irish deputy prime minister, We are in a position where we still need to find a way forward but, let me be very clear, the core issues that Ireland got agreement on at the start of this week are not changing. Coveney was referring to provisions in the draft agreement proposing some form of regulatory alignment between Northern Ireland and the Republic to prevent the emergence of a hard border. The DUP objected to the wording because they thought it could result in Northern Ireland getting detached in regulatory terms from the rest of the UK. The UK government and the DUP are still working on a solution, but there are no indications that an announcement is imminent. MPs, families and legal experts have raised serious concerns about comments made by the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, suggesting that British troops should break the law by carrying out targeted extrajudicial killings of British jihadists. A small number of prisoners – probably around 100 – will be given the right to vote after a British compromise offer to marginally extend the franchise was accepted on Thursday by the Council of Europe. NHS bosses have been accused of unacceptable secrecy after deciding no longer to reveal how many hospitals come under such pressure during winter that they have to declare an alert. Opposition is mounting to a planned visit to the UK by a leading American conservative evangelical Christian who has made Islamophobic and anti-gay statements, with critics saying it will promote prejudice and damage interfaith relations. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here are some fuller quotes from the George Osborne speech. I’m using the copy from the Press Association. Osborne said there was a “consensus” in the Conservative party that Theresa May would be replaced before the general election. He said: The essential question is going to be - is there going to be a change of leadership in this parliament? The Conservative party parliamentary party assumes there will be, the prime minister has said nothing about that. And at some point that is going to come to a head. I would make the observation that it is the consensus view of the Conservative parliamentary Party that the leadership should change. So at some point something will happen. He said the Conservative party had to be modern to win. He said: If you as a party set yourselves against the future, if we’re hostile to business, if we think they are the problem not the solution, if the Cabinet game becomes who can get the most money out of the chancellor, if we’re anti-tech, if we talk about building homes but pretend they can only be built on brownfields, then we will lose our economic credibility and cause damage to our country’s economic future. He said Labour could be 20 points ahead in the polls with a different leader. He said: The Labour party chose to change its leadership rules, the new membership of the Labour party chose to head to the political fringes, and the Labour movement now lives with the consequences of that big decision. And in my view, for all this undoubted ability to connect to younger and more disillusioned voters, Jeremy Corbyn remains the biggest obstacle to Labour winning an election. If the party was led by a more moderate social democrat of even middling ability then they would now be 20 points ahead in the polls and on the cusp of power. Instead the Labour movement is consumed by an internal battle for its soul. He said he did not expect to return to politics, but did not rule it out. He said: I don’t rule it out [returning to the Commons] just because I think you can be foolish saying never to things, but it is certainly not what I think I’m going to be doing with my life in the future. I am very much enjoying editing the paper and for me aged 46, having had 20 years in politics, I’ve discovered a new career and a new life and I’m quite enjoying it. Charles Walker, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons procedure committee, has announced that he is tabling amendments to the EU withdrawal bill for debate next week that would give a Commons committee new powers to demand votes when ministers want to amend the law using secondary legislation. At the moment most secondary legislation gets passed at the stroke of a pen, without MPs getting a vote. This has become a big issue in relation to the EU withdrawal bill because it will give ministers extensive new powers to incorporate EU law into UK law. The Walker amendments, which have the backing of his committee, would create a “sifting committee” which would have the job of going through all the statutory instruments passed under the EU withdrawal bill (up to 1,000, ministers expect) and identifying important ones which would have to be debated by MPs. Many Tory MPs, as well as the opposition, have been calling for a mechanism of this kind, and it is very likely that the government will accept the amendments, or table their own alternatives. In a statement Walker said: In Wednesday’s debate I shall look forward to a positive response from both despatch boxes to the constructive suggestions we have made. The process of transferring over 40 years’ worth of accumulated EU law into UK law is one of the greatest legislative challenges parliament has ever faced. I shall be looking to the government for assurances that the process is going to be managed appropriately and in a way which allows the new sifting committee to do its job properly. This is from ITV’s Carl Dinnen. CBI Northern Ireland has said that local businesses urgently need the government what will happen to trade arrangements after Brexit. A recent survey found 81% of its members said they did not have sufficient clarity as to what was planned. After a quarterly council meeting today, CBI NI’s director Angela McGowan said: Business leaders are united – they want to see Brexit talks move onto the next phase as quickly as possible and are becoming increasingly impatient that negotiators can’t find a way through the deadlock on future trading arrangements, citizens’ rights and the financial settlement. Prevarication is getting us nowhere, the people of Northern Ireland need clarity now. We find ourselves in serious danger of not only losing out on much needed foreign investment but of facing the real prospect of fantastic companies making the reluctant choice to move away from Northern Ireland. This is from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg. And this tweet from Lisa is worth noting too. Hilary Benn, chairman of the Brexit select committee, and other MPs on the committee have been inspecting the Irish border for the first time in a visit to Middletown between Armagh and Monagahan. The frontier is barely detectable apart from a change in mobile phone service and the two derelict customs posts on either side of the bridge. “The fact these customs houses are derelict is a good thing, “ said Benn. He went on: We do not want to see them coming back. The customs post, the fact it is decaying, that represents progress. The new housing estate we passed on the way in is on the old police station. That’s two symbols of progress. If there were customs checks, that would represent going backwards. By popular request (well, redfalcon BTL), here are some quotes from the UQ on Trump and Jerusalem this morning (which I did not cover earlier because it did not add much to what was said yesterday.). Alistair Burt, the Foreign Office minister who was responding for the government, said President Trump had created a “trust deficit” in peace negotiations between Israel and Palestine. Burt told MPs other states would have to fill the gap left by the United States after the president’s announcement in order to ensure the “prospects for peace are not diminished”. And Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said the government’s whole approach to handling Trump was wrong. She said: They told us that holding his hand and hugging him close, indulging him with the offer of a state visit, was the best way of wielding influence and shaping his policies. But on Jerusalem, as on so many other issues before, they have been made to look like fools. Weak, ignored and entirely without influence. When will they realise that bending over for a bully only encourages that behaviour, when what our country needs and what the world needs is a British government prepared to stand up to him. Here are some highlights on Twitter from what George Osborne, the former chancellor, said at the press gallery lunch. On Corbyn On the Conservatives On Theresa May On Brexit On his future On his regrets Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, has been in Portsmouth today for the HMS Queen Elizabeth commissioning ceremony. Asked by Sky News if he would issue orders for UK troops to hunt down and kill British jihadis abroad, he replied: You can obviously appreciate that I am not going to go into operational discussion with yourself. What we need to do is make sure that we are doing everything we can do to eliminate the the threat of extremism and terrorism reaching the streets of Britain. So often people do not see that threat as something that is manifesting itself in the lands abroad, but that is where it is manifesting itself. That’s why our forces are constantly doing so much to make sure that is eliminated. The European commission has said the UK has until Sunday to finalise a phase one Brexit deal if it wants the EU to agree to open talks on trade next week. (See 12pm.) The phase one issues cover Ireland, the financial settlement and citizens’ rights. Ireland is the sticking point, and Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, said he expected the UK government to produce fresh proposals on this issue within the next 24 hours. (See 11.39am.) Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has rejected claims that he has had to back down from telling the EU to “go whistle” over the the so-called “Brexit bill”. (See 12.15pm.) Johnson has called on President Trump to show “leadership” in restoring momentum to the Middle East peace process. In a Q&amp;A after a speech on fighting terrorism, he said the government thought Trump’s decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel was premature. But he went on: A lot of people are very excited and interested in possibilities that the American administration, the Trump administration, could bring to the Middle East peace process. There is an opportunity, there is a conjuncture of the stars, there is a moment - people think - when progress could be made. I think, this decision having been announced by President Trump, the world would like to see some serious announcements by the US about how they see the Middle East peace process and how to bring the two sides together. I think that’s what we all want to see. If we are going to have a move of the US embassy, then let’s also see some moves towards the long overdue resolution of the Middle East peace process. A former director of public prosecutions, Lord Macdonald, has described the new defence secretary Gavin Williamson as “juvenile” for saying all British jihadis should be eliminated instead of ever being allowed to return to the UK. (See 2.11pm.) Others have strongly condemned Williamson’s remarks too, and Number 10 and Boris Johnson have backed away from endorsing exactly what Williamson said. (See 12.35pm.) Theresa May has failed to get the EU to agree that Britain will retain a voice at the European court of justice in return for her concession that the Luxembourg court will retain a role in protecting citizens’ rights in the UK after Brexit. Momentum is to be investigated by the Electoral Commission over its role campaigning for Labour during the 2017 general election, including whether it breached campaign spending rules. The number of people arrested over terrorism-related offences in Britain has risen by 54% to 400 in one of the most intense periods for attacks in recent history. Lord Macdonald, a Lib Dem peer and former director of public prosecutions, has described Gavin Williamson’s declaration that all Britons fighting with Islamic State should be killed rather than ever being allowed to return to the UK as “juvenile”. He explained why in an interview on the Word at One. I think it is very important to understand that there are limits [to what the state can do.] In wartime soliders have immunity from prosecution for killing enemy combatants. But not in all circumstances. In wartime, if enemy soldiers have laid down their weapons and are fleeing or trying to surrender and their opponents kill them, that’s likely to be a war crime. And the situation is going to be no different in Syria and Iraq. So it simply will not be lawful in all circumstances to kill jihadis, as the secretary of state seems to be suggesting. If they’ve laid down their arms, if they are fleeing, if they are trying to surrender, to hunt them down, as he put it, and kill them is likely to raise serious legal issues and perhaps legal liabilities for the people carrying out those killings. So I think his response needs to be a great deal more nuanced than it is. He hasn’t been in the job very long, and maybe that explains why his response is so unnuanced ... A policy which says we will simply kill every individual who has travelled to Syria or to Iraq, even if they are surrendering, even if they have laid down their weapons, is really a policy that belongs in a Netflix series more seriously than it belongs in the range of policies that should be being applied by the UK government ... We can’t simply say that everyone who has gone to Iraq will now be hunted down and killed. That’s a juvenile response. It’s not a serious, grown-up policy response for a senior British government minister. The Labour MP John Woodcock also condemned Williamson’s comments. He said: Insecure Gavin Williamson is shooting from the hip to mask his inexperience and distract attention from the appalling cuts the government is about to inflict on our armed forces. The defence secretary risks endangering the lives of British troops with this fatuous posturing on returning British jihadis. If he is not slapped down, any future enemy of Britain could say, ‘Why should we respect the Geneva convention on captured British soldiers when the British don’t respect it for their own citizens?’ The Lib Dem defence spokesman Menzies Campbell also made the same point. He said: In present circumstances it is not difficult to see that any member of the military that followed his advice could be subjected to court martial and prosecution. The gung-ho opinions that he has expressed undermine the credibility of British armed forces in general and his office in particular. And Prof Philippe Sands, the internationally-renowned barrister, said the government should confirm that Williamson was not making policy. He told the Guardian: I was surprised the secretary of state’s statement. It was inappropriate. It sounds as though we have or are on the cusp of having, on his terms, some sort of shoot-to-kill policy. It sounds like he was shooting from the hip, it sounds like the words of an inexperienced minister, like someone speaking who has given no thought or reflection at all to the underlying issues, including the consequences of having such a policy. If you adopt that policy in relation to them, you effectively legitimising their actions in relation to us. We need a confirmation from Number 10 Downing Street that the UK is committed to the totality of its legal obligations in domestic law and international law and it does not operate to shoot-to-kill policy in relation to people who violate criminal law. Number 10 made it fairly clear earlier that Williamson was not speaking for the government in what he said. (See 12.35pm.) Reading the Daily Mail interview, it seems obvious that what Williamson said was more the political equivalent of pub talk than a new statement of security policy. Still, the Daily Mail will probably like the sound of it. Williamson’s colleagues think he wants to be party leader one day and perhaps he’s auditioning for the role of Daily Mail candidate. (The Mail will probably want to back a Brexiter, but it has reservations about Boris Johnson, so there is probably an opening ...) Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, has ruled out becoming prime minister. Although seen as someone with long-term ambitions to lead Labour, he told ITV during a visit to Pakistan that he was ruling himself out as a candidate to be the first Muslim prime minister. He said: I never had ambitions in the first place and I’ve got no ambitions now. I love being the mayor. Why give up a job I love to do a job I don’t want? I’m absolutely ruling myself out. Forever. He also had a good put-down when asked how it felt to be coming “home”. Nicola Sturgeon has strong words for Theresa May’s government at today’s session of first minister’s questions, describing it as “dissembling, mendacious and totally, totally incompetent”. “I don’t think we’ve seen a more incompetent UK government in my lifetime and that really is saying something,” she told the Holyrood chamber. Asked about her support for a second Brexit vote, she then turned her fire on Jeremy Corbyn, calling on him to “get his act together” as she has a number of times on her Twitter account since Monday’s negotiation debacle. She said: It may well be that the case [for a second referendum on Brexit] becomes difficult to resist but I think there is a more immediate necessity and that is to stop this reckless UK government driving the entire UK over this cliff edge. I think the majority exists in the House of Commons if Labour gets its act together, and I think the majority exists across the whole of the UK to stop that happening. The sensible compromise option and the least damaging option for our economy is to stay within the single market and the customs union so everyone who is of that view should come together and make that happen. She concluded by reminding the chamber that the current shambles only strengthened the case for independence, though noticeably avoided mentioning the ‘I’ word directly. As long as we continue to allow our future to be in the hands of Tory governments in Westminster rather than having our future in our own hands we will always be at the mercy of reckless decisions taken by Tory government in Westminster. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, said he would not divulge any cabinet committee discussions about the proposed Irish deal but said “whatever agreement reached has to be consistent with the UK taking back control of its laws, borders and cash”. During the Q&amp;A after his speech, he also defended himself from claims that he had been defeated on the levels of money being given to the European Union as part of the deal, saying his remarks about the EU needing to “go whistle” were made at a time when sums as high as £80bn or £100bn were being discussed. (See 12.15pm.) He said it was time for the EU and Britain to “get going” with the second phase of talks. Breaking briefly into French he said: We need to get going, franchement [frankly], with the second part of the talks. That’s the exciting bit. That’s the bit where we will achieve a new trading relationship with our friends and partners. We can get it done, we just need to get on with it, and I hope very much that the December European council will mark that progress. The Police Service of Northern Ireland has warned it does not want to return to an era when sex offenders, human traffickers and burglars use the Irish border to evade capture. The deputy chief constable of the police force said 20 years ago there was a huge problem with aggravated burglaries on elderly with criminals fleeing across the border north or south to escape justice. Strong co-operation between the PSNI and the Garda Siochana underpinned by European arrest warrant legislation and a bilateral agreement has made the rural border areas a place of “safety”, Drew Harris told the Brexit select committee which is visiting the Irish border today. He said: Criminal gangs did evade us using the border. We’ve worked hard over the last 20 years to make sure that’s not the case. What we want to concentrate on is that we don’t diminish where we are a the moment, that our relationships are maintained [post Brexit]. I served on this border are 30 years ago, we had good relationship with the Garda Siochana, but we just didn’t have the legislative infrastructure – and people flee across the border to evade the police. The border also proved a means of evasion for people involved in road traffic accidents, the committee heard. Harris, deputy chief constable of the PSNI, said there would have to be a new extradition treaty with Ireland in the event of no deal. Extradition attempts before the European arrest warrant agreement came in was difficult, he told the Brexit select committee in Armagh. Incidentally, since Northern Ireland is in the news at the moment, it is worth pointing out that Gavin Williamson’s claim that “a dead terrorist can’t cause any harm to Britain” (see 12.35pm) shows striking ignorance of history. The circumstances were very different from what Williamson was talking about, but the deaths of Bobby Sands and other IRA prisoners in the Maze hunger strike are now generally seen as disastrous for British policy in Northern Ireland because they triggered a huge IRA revival. Downing Street and Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, have both distanced themselves from Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary’s, uncompromising language about killing British terrorists. As Jessica Elgot reports, he told the Daily Mail: A dead terrorist can’t cause any harm to Britain ... I do not believe that any terrorist, whether they come from this country or any other, should ever be allowed back into this country,” he said. “We should do everything we can do to destroy and eliminate that threat. Asked if the prime minister agreed with him, the prime miniser’s spokesman told lobby journalists: The government position on this has been made clear a number of times in recent months, which is that if you travel to Iraq and Syria, and if you’re fighting with our enemies there, then you make yourself a legitimate target. Asked if Williamson was contradicting government policy which does allow former Isis fighters to return to the UK, the spokesman said” There are existing powers relating to other fighters who seek to return to the UK. They include exclusion orders that allow the UK to cancel an individual’s passport. In instances where people do return to the UK, where we’re clear is that they should face the consequences of their actions and that would include investigation by the police and possible criminal prosecution. Where we’ve also been clear is we will take whatever steps are necessary to protect national security. In his Q&amp;A Boris Johnson also refused to endorse Williamson’s language. (See 11.51am.) Sky and BBC News cut away from the Boris Johnson Q&amp;A before it finished. As often happens when they do that, they missed the best bit - with seems to be Johnson’s response to a question from Sky’s Faisal Islam. After it emerged last week that the UK was willing to pay around £50bn to the EU as its “divorce bill”, some commentators felt this was hard to square with Johnson telling MPs in July that the EU could “go whistle” if it wanted an “extortionate” sum from the UK. But Johnson is entitled to say that some potential “divorce bill” sums were a lot more extortionate than £50bn. One story in the Financial Times (paywall) claimed the EU would be demanding up to €100bn. Judging from this morning’s No 10 lobby briefing, there’s no immediate Brexit news: the word “ongoing” was used at least three times, referring to negotiations, conversations and the wider process. When asked if a new text of a deal was being circulated May’s spokesman said: As the PM set out at the start of the week in the Commons, we think we’re close to an agreement but there’s more work to be done. It’s an ongoing process and we’ll update you as it goes along. There was, we were told, no news of any fresh conversations between Theresa May and other figures, or when she might be going to Brussels again. So more news later, today perhaps. Or perhaps not. The European commission has said that the UK has until Sunday night to get a deal on Brexit if it wants the EU summit next week to agree to open trade talks. These are from the Express’s Nick Gutteridge and Le Figaro’s Isabelle Ory. Q: What do you think of what Gavin Williamson, the new defence secretary, said about eliminating Britons who fight with Islamic State? Johnson says: I think that ... Michael Fallon put it very well a few weeks ago when he said that anybody who goes to fight for Daesh in Syria or Iraq has got to understand that they are putting themselves in harm’s way and, indeed, making themselves legitimate targets of British armed forces, and that is the reality. Q: Do you agree we need higher defence spending? Yes, says Johnson. He says that is why defence spending is going up. Q: Do you know what the EU’s deadline is for a new Brexit deal? Johnson says he does not known. But it should be as soon as possible. Q: On Brexit, what is the government offering the DUP in an attempt to get a deal? And how hopeful are you of getting a deal? Johnson says he won’t give a running commentary. He says we are leaving the EU, but not Europe. What we want to achieve is a deep and special partnership where we can intensify our trade links, he says. But we need to get going on the second half of the talks. That is the exciting bit, he says. He says he hopes the December EU council will be where the progress happens. Q: Where is Britain’s leverage in the Middle East? It is focused on Brexit, at odds with the White House, and reducing its defence spending? Johnson says other countries want to see more of the UK, not less. He says the UK must fund its diplomacy properly, but also its aid budget and defence budget. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, is now taking questions. Q: [From the Latvian ambassador] What is your view on Jerusalem? Johnson says the UK is sticking to its policy: the future of Jerusalem must be settled as part of the two-state of solution. The US move is “not helpful”, he says. Q: There was a section in the text of your speech about Jerusalem. But you did not read it out. Why not? Johnson says it was inserted at the last moment. He says he did not need to say it because he repeated the words just now in the Q&amp;A. He says for years America and its allies have taken the view that Jerusalem was a card that should not be played at this point. He says some people thought the Trump administration would be good for the Middle East peace process. If America is going to move its embassy, it should also make other moves to help the peace process, he says. Ireland’s prime minister Leo Varadkar has claimed the British government plans to publish a new Brexit document to deal with the vexed issue of the Irish border. Speaking at a press conference in Dublin today, the Taoiseach said he had spoken to Theresa May by phone yesterday on the matter. Varadkar said the Irish side in the debate wanted to demonstrate a “willingness to consider any proposals that the UK side have”. He said he expected to see new British proposals over the next 24 hours. The taoiseach stressed however that Ireland’s “red line” remains a guarantee from the British that there is no hard border. He said: My responsibility as taoiseach - as prime minister of Ireland - is to protect our fundamental national interest and that is the rights of Irish citizens in Ireland and Britain and also the avoidance of a return to a border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. This is from AFP’s Danny Kemp. Checkpoints and cameras on the Irish border will be a target for attack by terrorist groups in Northern Ireland, the deputy chief constable for the region has said. Drew Harris said there is still a significant level of terrorism in Northern Ireland that does not get reported by the media with 58 shootings and 32 bombing incidents this year so far. “Dissident groups see this as an area [the border] which is contentious which will give them a further rallying call to try and engender support. It is of concern, they have a focus in this , they see it as an opportunity,” Harris, deputy chief constable of the Police Service Northern Ireland said. He was giving evidence to the Brexit select committee which is making its first visit to the Irish border since the referendum. Two key members of the committee, Conservative MP and Brexiteer Jacob Rees Mogg and Democratic Unionist Party MP and Brexiteer Sammy Wilson have snubbed the trip. Harris told MPs: The UK has said there will be no infrastrucure on the border, that would be an obvious place for dissident groups to rally around and also to attack. It is highly forseeable that dissident groups would seek to take action and that would include buildings. The committee will travel to Middletown, a small crossing between county Armagh and county Monaghan at lunchtime. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, is delivering his speech on the war against terror now. I will post highlights when I have seen the text, but if he takes questions, I will cover that in detail. Commenting on the announcement about the Electoral Commission investigation (see 9.48am), a Momentum spokesman said much of the investigation referred to “administrative errors that can be easily rectified.” He went on: Momentum put a lot of effort and resources into detailed budgeting and financial procedures during the election to ensure full compliance. Our election campaign was delivered on a low budget because it tapped into the energy and enthusiasm of tens of thousands of volunteers across the country. We have a good working relationship with the Electoral Commission, and will fully comply with the investigation going forward. At least a thousand extra policemen and women would have to be recruited to secure any “hard border” between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic post-Brexit, rank and file officers have warned. The Police Federation of Northern Ireland has said that policing in the region would be dangerously under-staffed to cope with protecting a 300 mile plus frontier if the UK left the EU and had to control a newly fortified border. At present numbers the Police Service of Northern Ireland would be ‘physically incapable of patrolling’ what has always been a porous, the Federation’s chairman Mark Lindsay told The Guardian. Lindsay said that during the Troubles police numbers were double the number of 6,700 – the current PSNI figure of serving officers. “That figure of nearly 13,000 was also backed up by considerable military support even in the mid 1990s,” he said. Stressing that the position of the Police Federation of Northern Ireland on Brexit was entirely neutral, Lindsay said that there were considerable security challenges posed even by a “soft border” that might require police back-up for customs officers at border customs posts. He said: Right now, the preparatory work for a “soft” or “hard” border should be well underway. However, I don’t believe the wider security implications have featured anywhere near as prominently as trade, free movement and the Customs Union. That’s a glaring deficiency and one that ought to be addressed with some urgency. The federation chairman also claimed that any kind of fortified border would place fresh demands also on the Irish Republic’s security forces. A hard border doesn’t simply affect Northern Ireland. It would have a costly and profound impact on policing in the Republic of Ireland. You can’t upscale on one side of the border without doing the same on the other. That would be a nonsense. Month by month the PSNI is reducing in number. Eleven per cent of the workforce is eligible to retire next year – that’s 730 in real terms. A further 331 can retire in 2019 and 2020. Recruitment plans fall far short of keeping pace with that number of departures. Any build-up in numbers to deal with Brexit would need to get the “green light” immediately. This cannot wait for another three to four months. We shouldn’t find ourselves in a situation where we have to play catch-up if, and when, any new border arrangements appear. By that stage, it would be too late to do the job effectively. Earlier this year the Police Federation expressed their concerns about the installation of new border posts after Brexit along the Northern Ireland-Irish Republic frontier. The rank and file organisation that represents around 6,500 police officers in the region said the posts would turn their members into ‘sitting ducks’ for violent dissident republican terror groups. The Federation also claimed that the erection of border and customs posts would be a “propaganda gift” for dissident republicans who oppose the Good Friday peace settlement. Last month the political allies of the New IRA, Saroadh, at their annual conference in Derry said they hoped that Brexit would turn out to be ‘hell’ for the British and Irish governments. The leader of Saoradh, former IRA prisoner Davy Jordan, said that ‘England’s Brexit difficulties are Ireland’s opportunity.’ Jordan told more than 100 delegates at the conference that Brexit had “driven the Tories’ beloved Britain to the point of fracture.” He said hard-line republicans should exploit Brexit to expose the continued existence of the border on the island of Ireland. Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge has breached the MPs’ code of conduct and should apologise to the House of Commons, a parliamentary sleaze watchdog has found. As the Press Association reports, the Commons committee on standards found that Hodge used parliamentary facilities, such as stationery and phones, to carry out work on the review of London’s proposed Garden Bridge for the London mayor, Sadiq Khan. The PA story says: The committee noted in a report that the sums of money involved were “very small” and that the Barking MP, who became prominent as a scourge of wrong-doers in her former role as chairwoman of the Commons public accounts committee, said she was not aware she was committing a breach. But it said the offence was aggravated by the fact that she allowed her parliamentary office to be used as many as 20 times for the review and “did nothing to prevent the impression being given that her work on the review was conducted on behalf of, or in some way connected with, the House of Commons”. Although the work on the review was initially expected to be unpaid, Hodge later accepted payment for it without seeking the advice of Commons authorities, the report found. The committee, which includes MPs and lay members, said: “We conclude that the appropriate sanction for Dame Margaret’s breach of the code of conduct is that she should make an apology for this breach on a point of order on the floor of the House.” In response Hodge said: I am extremely sorry that I inadvertently breached parliamentary rules. I carried out this inquiry in good faith and in the public interest. I think all MPs would benefit from greater clarity in the rules governing the use of offices. The Electoral Commission has sent out a note explaining the rules relating to spending for “permitted participants” (campaigning organisations) at an election. It says: The law enables non-party campaigners which wish to undertake ‘targeted spending’ – intended to influence people to vote for one particular registered political party or any of its candidates – to do so within prescribed spending limits. These are £31,980 in England; £3,540 in Scotland; £2,400 in Wales; and £1,080 in Northern Ireland. These limits apply during the regulated period which is 9 June 2016 to 8 June 2017. Registered non-party campaigners are only entitled to spend above these limits if they have the authorisation of the political party that they are promoting. If that party provides authorisation, the registered non-party campaigner can spend up to the limit authorised by the political party. It is an offence to spend above the statutory limits without the party’s authorisation. Should the party provide authorisation for a higher spending limit, any spending by that non-party campaigner up to that limit would count towards the party’s national spending limit. The national spending limit for parties fighting all constituencies at the general election was around £19m. The Electoral Commission has announced it has launched an investigation into whether Momentum, the pro-Corbyn Labour organisation, broke election spending rules in the general election. In a press statement the commission said: The investigation will look at: whether or not Momentum spent in excess of the spending limits for an unauthorised non-party campaigner in the UK parliamentary general election; whether or not Momentum submitted a return that did not include accurate donation information and/or the required declaration stating that the donation return was complete and accurate; whether or not Momentum submitted a return that was not a complete statement of payments made in respect of controlled expenditure; whether or not Momentum submitted a return that did not include all invoices for payments of more than £200. It is possible that during the course of the investigation, the commission will identify potential contraventions and/or offences under PPERA other than those set out above. And Bob Posner, the commission’s director of political finance and regulation and legal counsel, said: Momentum are a high profile active campaigning body. Questions over their compliance with the campaign finance rules at June’s general election risks causing harm to voters’ confidence in elections. There is significant public interest in us investigating Momentum to establish the facts in this matter and whether there have been any offences. “Once complete, the commission will decide whether any breaches have occurred and, if so, what further action may be appropriate, in line with its enforcement policy. There’s an urgent question in the Commons at 10.30am on President Trump’s decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Theresa May wanted to wrap phase one of the Brexit talks on Monday. It is Thursday, and we are still waiting for a deal. Last night Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, said he was expecting a new text by the end of today. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, said it has to be finalised tomorrow if EU leaders are going to agree to open trade talks next week. Perhaps we will get a settlement within the next few hours, although it is starting to look as elusive as the government’s Brexit impact reports. Here is our overnight story with all the latest. And here is a summary of the various Brexit news lines from this morning’s Today programme. Chris Grayling, the Brexiter transport secretary, said the “regulatory alignment” with the EU proposed for Northern Ireland after Brexit as one option in the draft UK-EU agreement rejected by the DUP on Monday would not involve the UK having the same rules as Europe. He said: We don’t have to have, we have never said we will have and we don’t want a situation where in future our laws are identical to those of the EU. There will be areas where we do things in a very similar way, there are will be areas where we don’t do things in a similar way. That’s all the prime minister was seeking to achieve, to make sure we can ensure that trade flows as freely as possible across the border of Northern Ireland and southern Ireland. Grayling said he was “absolutely optimistic” that there would be a deal. He said: I remain absolutely optimistic that we will reach a successful point, we will move on to the trade talks, because ultimately it is in everybody’s interests for that to happen ... If you are running a business in the Republic of Ireland and shipping foods to the EU, the relationship with the UK is pretty fundamentally important, because your goods need to go through the UK. The chief executive of Standard Chartered, one of the UK’s biggest banks, said the UK’s ability to attract talent is suffering because the country is no longer seen as such a “hospitable” place. Bill Winters also said that banks were “preparing for the worst” on Brexit, with his own institution spending millions on expanding a base in Frankfurt in case it needs to move staff and operations from London. On Brexit deterring some talented foreign workers he said: Some of the best talent that we can have in the UK marketplace is coming from students that have chosen to study here and then stayed for some extended period afterwards. We’ve noticed that impact already, more through a sense from non-UKs or foreigners that this might not be such a hospitable place any longer. It’s more psychological than contractual, as it were. But I think it’s something we must really be very careful about. And on banks making plans to leave London he said: London will take hits in the context of Brexit. Some jobs will move from London to the continent. I think big parts of the euro-denominated corporate banking business will be forced into Europe. It’s possible that through the Brexit negotiations that there is some sort of extended passporting rule, but none of us are expecting that quite frankly, or preparing for that. We have to prepare for the worst. Our regulators in the UK require us to prepare for the worst. The best would be we carry on as we are and passporting is allowed to continue to exist and we can run our business as we do today, in which case we will have spent a bunch of money [on contingency plans for moving to Frankfurt] and flushed it down the toilet. Lord Jay, the former head of the Foreign Office and acting chair of the Lords EU committee, said he was surprised the government had not done proper Brexit impact assessments. Describing the 850 pages of documents that have been shown to MPs and peers, he said: They are quite interesting but they are pretty underwhelming. They don’t really include an impact assessment, as far as I can tell. I would have thought there would have been a proper impact assessment, a proper assessment of what the impact of leaving the EU is going to be on different sectors of the economy. What we’ve got is interesting, and there’s a lot of good information there, but I can’t really say it’s a real impact assessment. It’s a fairly underwhelming report. Bernard Jenkin, a Conservative Brexiter, said the government should not give up the goal of “regulatory autonomy” after Brexit. He said: We shouldn’t be allowing ourselves to be bullied into promising more and more money or giving up the goal of regulatory autonomy or being dragged into a long period of uncertainty without clarity on what we are getting at the end of it. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Michael Gove, the environment secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 11am: Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, gives a speech on fighting terrorism. As Patrick Wintour reports, he will “pin the responsibility for the ‘crack cocaine of jihadi terrorism’ on repressive states, and not western foreign policy”. 1pm: George Osborne, the former chancellor, speaks at a press gallery lunch.

Starting the day at $13,600, bitcoin smashed through $14,000 for the first time ever in early European trading. By 9am in New York, it was surging through $15,000. In increasing frenzied trading, bitcoin then hit $19,000 on the coindesk exchange (although Reuters never clocked it above $15,995). It then subsided, as bitcoin exchanges admitted they were struggling to keep up with the huge trading volumes. At today’s prices, the total value of every bitcoin in the world is roughly equal to the market capitalisation of credit card firm Visa. The surge came despite fresh warnings that bitcoin could be a bubble. Sir Howard Davies, chair of Royal Bank of Scotland, said top central banks should cite Dante’s famous warning from the gates of hell - ‘Abandon hope all ye who enter here’. In the last 12 months, bitcoin has now gained around 2,000%. It’s gone from $11,000 to over $15,000 this week alone, amid signs that retail investors are piling in. Bitcoin is due to enter the mainstream next week, when clearing houses begin offering futures trading. But, several US banks are reluctant to take part, according to the Wall Street Journal. Analysts are split over whether futures trading will bring some calm to bitcoin. It could push the price down, as investors will be able to bet on a crash. But if money keeps pouring in, the price could head higher.... But investors were also reminded of the dangers of cybercrime, as a bitcoin wallet firm revealed it had been hacked. That’s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting, GW Wall Street has just closed for the day, with small gains on the main indices. The Dow gained 70 points, or 0.3% - a performance matched by the S&amp;P 500. The tech-focused Nasdaq rose by 0.5%, partly thanks to Alphabet (Google) and Facebook. Mark Hamrick,Washington bureau chief for Bankrate.com, reports that some investors aren’t happy about missing out on bitcoin: Two major US banks have decided not to offer bitcoin futures trading when it launches this weekend. That follows concerns (covered in this blog earlier today) that the systems aren’t robust enough. That’s according to the Wall Street Journal, which reports: Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup Inc. are telling customers that they won’t offer them access to the first bitcoin futures market when it goes live on Sunday, people familiar with the matter said. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the largest U.S. futures broker, will offer access but only for certain customers, a person familiar with the situation said. ABN Amro Group will be handling trades for “a small selected group of professional clients,” a spokeswoman for the Dutch bank said in an e-mail. Morgan Stanley and Société Générale SA are still evaluating their approach to bitcoin futures, other people said Thursday. CNN’s Seth Fiegerman joined the bitcoin party last week, when he invested $100 in the digital currency. He’s now written a handy explainer - here’s a flavour: Bitcoin exchanges have a checkered history. Mt.Gox, once the largest exchange, shut down in 2014 after losing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin after a hack. Today, the leading exchange is offered by Coinbase, a startup that has raised more than $200 million from a number of top tier venture capital firms. Square (SQ), the payments service, is also rolling out a bitcoin product. There are also bitcoin ATMs in scattered bodegas and convenience stores around the country, through companies like Coinsource. The ATMs let you exchange bitcoin for cash, or vice versa by scanning a QR code from the digital wallet application on your phone. With Coinbase, you must first give the app permission to connect to your bank account. As with other stock trading applications, you pay a small fee for each transaction, buying and selling. But the transaction can take significantly longer. My original $100 bitcoin purchase won’t officially be completed on Coinbase until Friday, more than a week after the transaction. The price I bought it at remains the same, but I won’t be able to sell at the earliest until Friday. If the price plummets before then, I’m out of luck. However, Mrs Fiegerman isn’t impressed (and this is after the price went up!) City investor Justin Urquhart Stewart reports that his cabbie is interested in bitcoin.... Borrowing money to buy into a rising asset... that’s one of the classic signs of a bubble, associated with the dreaded Minsky Moment (when prices suddenly collapse as speculators can’t service their loans) Right now, bitcoin is trading at $15,300, according to the ‘spot price’ on my Reuters terminal. That’s a gain of 12% today, and up over 40% since the start of the week Earlier it jumped to the brink of $16,000 (Reuters’ data shows) but was seen rather higher on some other exchanges. Some bitcoin exchanges are struggling to handle the interest today, it seems. Coinbase, the largest US bitcoin, blamed ‘record high traffic’ for technical problems: Bitcoin wallet provider Trezor had a similar story: This may not reassure critics who wonder how the bitcoin ecosystem will cope with the next price correction..... Ian Guider of Ireland’s Sunday Business Post spies a bubble... Speaking of volatile trading, bitcoin prices on the coinbase exchange just rocketed towards $20,000. But it swiftly slumped back to less stratospheric levels. What wild times! The bitcoin price has been particularly volatile today, as it struck a series of new highs: It won’t be easy to run a future market in such a volatile asset..... Economics professor Justin Wolfers has put his finger on the problem with bitcoin pricing - it’s hard to bet against it today. The launch of bitcoin futures markets on Sunday night will be an important moment, says Neil Wilson of City firm ETX. But he doesn’t agree that letting traders bet against bitcoin necessarily means its price will fall. Wilson explains: At least with regulated futures the market ought to behave more normally than it has done – notwithstanding some pretty major spasms in the market that are likely on Sunday night and Monday morning as the contracts launch - and this would be net bearish for Bitcoin overall as it will allow proper shorting and hedging strategies. At present the only way to short is to sell your bitcoin and exit the market, a bias that favours bulls. The ability to go short creates a new dynamic in the market and may result in a significant shock to prices. The problem is anyone shorting against this headwind of rapidly rising prices needs to be able to sweat out huge potential upside. As plenty before have noted, Bitcoin might keep rising longer than shorts can stay solvent.” If you’re just tuning in, here’s our news story on Bitcoin’s rally, and the concerns building about it..... Bitcoin has been likened to Dante’s Inferno by the chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland. As the digital currency surged above $15,000 on Thursday, Sir Howard Davies suggested it should carry a similarly apocalyptic warning for investors. Davies, a former head of the UK’s top financial watchdog, called on the Bank of England and other authorities around the world to launch a coordinated warning against the digital currency. Bitcoin has increased in value by $3,500 in the space of a week, after surging more than 900% this year. It was trading at $15,300 at lunchtime on Thursday. “Put up the sign from Dante’s Inferno – ‘Abandon hope all ye who enter here’ – I think that’s probably what’s needed,” he said speaking on Bloomberg TV, adding that the cryptocurrency appeared to be a “frothy investment bubble”. Davies argued for Threadneedle Street to take action at the same time as the US Federal Reserve, Securities and Exchange Commission, and the European Central Bank. “Central banks are very anxious about it [bitcoin],” he said.... More here: Analyst Charlie Bilello of Pension Partners points out that bitcoin usage isn’t keeping pace with its price: A majority of City investors think that bitcoin is an unsustainable bubble. That’s according to a survey of institutional investors, conducted by Natixis Investment Managers, which found: Institutional investors may believe bubbles have formed in both the bond (42%) and stock (30%) markets, but concerns for these traditional assets pale in comparison to the 64% who say there’s a bubble in Bitcoins. Over on FT Alphaville, Izabella Kaminska has a fascinating theory to explain bitcoin’s rise. In short, it’s that certain investors have piled into bitcoin, driving its price every higher, because they plan to ‘short’ it next week. Shorting becomes a serious option once the CME clearing house launches its derivatives contracts next week. So if you’ve invested the time and money to stock up on bitcoin this year, you could make immense profits if you short the cryptocurrency next week. She explains: Without the certainty of a properly regulated marketplace defending the futures side of the equation, a payoff cannot be guaranteed. It’s why the arbitrage exists in the first place: the trade cannot be exercised elsewhere in the bitcoin ecosystem because the risk of counterparty default at the first sign of distress is far too great. You’d win the trade, but you’d probably lose the payout. If a regulated futures market takes that risk away, however, the trade becomes a no-brainer if not a mastermind opportunity. Which is arguably where we are now. This chart shows how the plan would play out: But.... such a plan could still go wrong. For example: The futures launch is suspended unexpectedly, perhaps due to regulatory concerns or industry pushback? The anticipated futures demand never arrives because the margin costs of holding open long positions proves to be too great and/or liquidity is so shoddy nobody can trade effectively. The cash settled return on the futures leg, won’t necessarily be matched by the price achieved on the physical liquidation. More here: The smartest bitcoin trade in town? Wowzers! Bitcoin has now surged to $16,000 on one exchange: That means it’s gained more than $3,000 since yesterday morning. In any bubble, there’s a moment when new investors are lured in by reports of hefty profits, helping to drive the price higher and higher. Is that where we are now with bitcoin? And how much higher will it go? Craig Erlam of foreign exchange firm OANDA predict a correction is looming.... The cryptocurrency has undoubtedly come on leaps and bounds this year but it’s difficult to see anything move as Bitcoin has and not fear a devastating bubble bursting. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that Bitcoin has been making headlines over the last week or so, during which time it’s risen another $5,000, or 50%. If speculation is playing as big a role in the latest moves as some expect, then very interesting times may lie ahead. Although as is always the case, this could rise a lot more before the bubble bursts. The Guardian’s Business Today email has expanded its property coverage. As well as key news headlines, an agenda of the day’s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature, there is now more coverage of house prices, mortgages, the rental market – and the best picture galleries from our Money pages. For your morning shot of financial and property news, sign up here: So, where are all these people who have made fortunes out of bitcoin? The Daily Telegraph have found one - and he’s still just a teenager. They say: Eddy Zillan was 16 when he began investing in bitcoin, just two years later, the youthful investor estimates he has “made close to a million” from trading in various cryptocurrency. The perspicacious Ohio teenager was an early adopter of the bubble and bust digital currency, investing in 2015 when bitcoin’s price was as low as $214 following a prolonged bear market. “I started off with $1,000 to play around with out of my savings,” he told The Telegraph. “I then acquired another $5,000 through my bar mitzvah money (in 2012). “I then invested another $6,000 through money I earned and saved from working summer jobs.”... Here’s a useful non-technical explanation of bitcoin: Anyone who bought bitcoin two weeks ago (when it was trading at $8,000) has almost doubled their money. They won’t give you that at your local bank! But, of course, that’s exactly why some experts fear that a speculative bubble is building. Bitcoin buyers aren’t heeding Sir Howard Davies’s warning. The cryptocurrency just hit a new alltime high, at $15,200, as American traders arrive at their desks. Just in: The US jobs market remained strong last week. Just 236,000 Americans filed new claims for unemployment benefit during the seven days to 2nd December. That’s down from 238,000 the previous week, and the third weekly decline in a row. Yann Quelenn of Swissbank believes bitcoin will keep climbing this month, perhaps even hitting $20,000 -- before suffering an abrupt reversal. Quelenn writes: Sheer greed is driving the cryptocurrency higher, perhaps to $20,000 per coin by Christmas. This would put Bitcoin’s market cap above $300bn, one third that of Apple! Bitcoin is unique in history, true, but a correction will likely be very tough. Two Chicago exchanges, the CBOE and the CME, will soon launch trading of cryptocurrency futures. This signals an impending stampede of institutional investors – many speculators, some hedgers. Just watch the fireworks fly. Sir Howard Davies’s hint that bitcoin is a hellish investment for the unwary is somewhat ironic, given the track record of the bank he chairs. Royal Bank of Scotland has been controlled by the UK taxpayer for nearly a decade, having been bailed out after nearly collapsing after the failure of Lehman Brothers. It has made a steady stream of losses ever since, and the British government is now planning to crystallise a £26m loss when it sells its RBS shares over the next few years. Davies can’t be blame for RBS’s plight, as he only joined in 2015. But the legacy of the financial crisis is exactly why some people believe cryptocurrencies make a lots of sense. Workers at GE Power have just had a very nasty shock. The US company is axing 12,000 jobs across the globe in a cost-cutting drive. The move includes 1,100 workers at its UK operations, mainly in Stafford and Rugby. GE blamed falling demand for fossil fuel power plants, saying: “Traditional power markets including gas and coal have softened”. Jerry Yang, the co-founder of Yahoo!, is more optimistic about bitcoin’s future. Yang reckons digital currencies can be a force for good in the long term. The key it to treat bitcoin as an actual currency, not an asset whose price has been driven up by speculation. As Yang put it to CNBC: “Bitcoin as a digital currency is not quite there yet. Personally, I am a believer in how digital currency can play a role in our society… but for now, it seems like it’s more driven by the hype of investing and getting a return rather than using it as a transaction currency. The FT points out that Bitcoin has hit $15,000 on some crypto-exchanges. Look at that spread of prices, though! No wonder the US banks have concerns about bitcoin derivatives contracts hitting the markets...... Sir Howard Davies, the chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, has issued a dire warning against investing in bitcoin. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, as bitcoin headed towards $15,000, Davies warned that the digital currency looked like a “frothy investment bubble”. He’s concerned that bitcoin doesn’t really fall under any one regulator’s remit, meaning the adults in the room aren’t warning of the risks. Davies says it’s hard to see any ‘rational reason’ for bitcoin’s recent surge: All the authorities can do is put up the sign from Dante’s Inferno - ‘Abandon hope all ye who enter here’. That’s what’s needed, and it need to done by the Federal Reserve, the SEC, and the Bank of England and the European Central Bank at the same time. So why aren’t the world’s top central bankers acting? Davies suspects they’re worried about being seen as luddites if they criticise digital currencies, adding: The market is telling us something about the need for new faster payments systems. [But] I personally don’t think it’s bitcoin in the long run. But should bitcoin actually be outlawed, as economist Joseph Stiglitz argues? No, replies Davies - if you ban bitcoin, other variants will simply take its place. Here’s our story about the problems at NiceHash: The pound’s volatility has hit its highest level in almost six months, as Brexit headines shunt sterling around: The old mantra Caveat Emptor goes without saying where bitcoin is concerned. Not only is its value uncertain (‘higher than yesterday’ won’t be true forever), but you run the risk of losing your bitcoins to a cybercriminal. Overnight, Slovenian-based bitcoin miner NiceHash says it is investigating a security breach and the possible theft of tens of millions of dollars’ worth of bitcoins. It’s a blow to bitcoin miners who had contributed their computing power to mine bitcoins through NiceHash. Users reckon that NiceHash’s bitcoin wallet had held around 4,736.42 bitcoins — equivalent to over $66m at current prices. Here’s the official statement: More reaction to Bitcoin’s latest spike: Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says Bitcoin’s rise looks unstoppable -- but the launch of those bitcoin futures could change things. Bitcoin bulls have driven the virtual currency beyond $14,500 for the first time. The bitcoin has jumped 20% over the last 24 hours with buyers of the virtual currency now eyeing up $20,000. Given the fact that both the CBOE and the CME exchanges will begin offering bitcoin futures this month, perhaps the prediction of $20,000 is not that far off? However, the start of futures trading also means the start of short trades on the bitcoin, which could increase volatility further. Now this is interesting. The Financial Times is reporting that some of the world’s largest banks are resisting the imminent launch of bitcoin futures. Futures trading will allow people to trade the digital currency without actually owning it. It’s means to open bitcoin up to a wider range of investors. However, given bitcoin’s volatility, some industry figures fear that the clearing houses that underpins the markets could suffer massive losses if the cryptocurrency were to crash. The FT says: The world’s largest banks are pushing back on the introduction of bitcoin futures, raising concerns with US regulators that the financial system is ill-prepared for the launch of the contracts as the value of the volatile cryptocurrency has soared. Institutional investors have been keen to trade the asset but only via a regulated market. However, the planned launch in the next 10 days of futures contracts by the Chicago exchanges CME Group and CBOE Global Markets, given a green light from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission last week, has prompted a backlash among the major brokers who backstop trading across the industry. The Futures Industry Association, the main futures industry lobby group, plans to send a letter to the CFTC that will be published on Thursday. In a draft seen by the FT, the FIA writes that the rapid introduction of bitcoin futures “did not allow for proper public transparency and input”. Newsflash: UK house prices kept rising last month, according to the latest data from Halifax bank. Halifax reports that prices rose by 0.5% during November, leaving them 3.9% higher than a year ago. Jonathan Samuels, CEO of the property lender, Octane Capital, says the Bank of England’s (well-flagged) interest rate hike last month hasn’t spooked buyers: “The improved performance of the market in the latest quarter suggests the first interest rate rise in a decade may have ignited demand. “On this evidence, the November rate rise has brought prospective buyers out into the open rather than sent them underground. “Many buyers may have come to the conclusion that it is better to move now while mortgage rates are still low than further down the line when they could be less competitive. Currency traders may need to don their tin hats in the coming days, as the Brexit negotiations intensify. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at interactive investor, predicts plenty of volatility: “Europe is the only show in town right now, and ongoing speculation around a solution to the Irish border issue has further dampened enthusiasm for sterling. A deal must be done by close of play Friday if Brexit talks are to move onto trade after next week’s summit. Reality is, deadlines will likely get extended, whisper from Brussels will raise and dash expectations, and we may or may not get anything at the end of it. Prepare for a volatile couple of days on the currency markets. Merger news: GVC, the gambling giant behind Foxy Bingo and PartyCasino, is in talks over a £3.9bn takeover of Ladbrokes. Shares in both companies have jumped in early trading (Ladbrokes surged by over 25%). If successful, it would create one of the world’s largest betting firms. Ladbrokes could welcome a takeover, given the mounting criticism over its fixed-odds betting terminals (savaged as being ‘crack cocaine’ of gambling). The final value of the deal will partly depend on the government’s clampdown on FOBT, which could take a chunk out of Ladbrokes profits. Geopolitical issues are high on the market’s agenda today, says Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services: Politics will again be to the fore as UK government attempts to find some compromise on the hypersensitive issue of the Irish border, while the fall-out from Trump’s decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital threatens to escalate already enormous tensions across the Middle East, and quite obviously contradicts UN resolution 478. Last night’s price surge was remarkable, even by bitcoin’s recent standards: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound is under pressure this morning as traders worry that Britain may not get a Brexit breakthrough before Christmas. Sterling dipped overnight to $1.337 against the US dollar, with no immediate sign of an end to the deadlock over the Irish border question. That’s almost two cents lower than Monday, when optimism of a deal was rising. It’s also a little weaker against the euro, at €1.133. Tensions mounted after Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, said the UK must agree the text on a potential deal by Friday night. Otherwise, the two sides can’t shift onto taking about that precious trade deal. Time is running short, as analysts at FxPro warn this morning.... If talks do not move on to the next stage of discussions in December then the terms of a transition period will likely be pushed back until the next European council summit of leaders in March, by which time many businesses in the UK will have had to make decisions over their location and investments in the country. So, the City is looking to Westminster for some serious progress between the UK government, the DUP (it’s Northern Irish partners) and Dublin. But if each side sticks to its principles, this will be tough - so sterling could have a choppy ride. Bitcoin, meanwhile, continues to soar at an ever faster rate. The digital currency battered its way through the $14,000 mark overnight, having hit $12,000 yesterday. More consumers are jumping into bitcoin - presumably having heard stories of its rapid ascent. Institutional investors are also taking more interest, as they’ll soon be able to buy and sell bitcoin derivative contracts. It will intensify the argument between those who think bitcoin is a monetary paradigm shift, and those who see a dangerous bubble.

The painting is valued at about $90,000 and the proceeds from its sale will help fill a health service gap in the Indigenous renal health crisis that governments have been slow to address. Cameron Miller, the chief executive of the Ngurratjuta Aboriginal Corporation, said the board had made a decision to help the Alice Springs-based Purple House clinic “because at the time no one else would”. End-stage kidney disease patients receive dialysis three times a week and when services are not available in communities they travel to regional centres, which has cultural implications as well as a detrimental impact on health and wellbeing and survival rates. Purple House provides lifesaving dialysis to Indigenous patients in Alice Springs and a number of remote community clinics, and operates a travelling clinic, the Purple Truck. Miller said the continuation of Purple House’s community controlled health services had an enormous benefit to NAC members. “Hence why the board made the decision to make a large donation. We’re an investment organisation and we also make investments to better people’s lives.” NAC had owned the Namatjira painting since about 1989 and it had been on display at Alice Springs’ Araluen Centre alongside several others until it was delivered to the Purple House chief executive, Sarah Brown. “I got a phone call to say, ‘Hey Sarah, come to the Araluen art centre and choose a Albert Namatjira painting,’” Brown said. “I was a bit floored. “It’s such a good story about Aboriginal communities helping each other out. Aboriginal communities and patients can’t wait for governments to sort these things out.” The money raised through the painting’s sale will help fund salaries of nurses at new dialysis clinics in Docker River, Mount Liebig and Papunya, which the Northern Territory government is setting up but isn’t funding operations until June next year. “We’re hoping Papunya might open next week,” Brown said. “We’ve promised the patients and their families that we’ll get them home for Christmas and I’ll think we’ll just manage it.” Brown noted the new clinics were “a long time coming” for communities that are home to family of the Purple House directors. “They’ve helped all these other communities but haven’t had dialysis in Papunya where lots of them grew up,” Brown said. In 2015 the NT government accepted a four-year-old federal government offer of $10m to build remote dialysis infrastructure and patient accommodation in Alice Springs. It had long refused the offer – which was originally $13m – because it said it could not afford the operating costs. “Although in every sense of the word we are a primary healthcare community development model, the commonwealth still argues that dialysis is hospital business, which is state and territory government business, and state and territory governments say they can’t afford services in remote communities,” Brown said. “We say you can’t afford not to, because the numbers of people on dialysis are still increasing, people are living longer.” Brown said having to fundraise was a challenge and took time the clinic could use to concentrate on service delivery – but praised the efforts of the Indigenous community to support it. “There’s so much pride about what people have achieved because they have bloody done it themselves against the odds,” Brown said. “There are people still waiting for us to fall on our arses but what has developed is this whole kind of holistic service that not only provides dialysis on country but has a focus on wellbeing and social support and cross-cultural dialogue and access to bush medicine and all those things work together well.” Purple House was established with funds raised by Papunya Tula artists, who held an auction and raised about $1m so they and their communities would have dialysis services closer to home. It receives funding through various government departments but also relies on philanthropic donations and its own fundraising. Purple House patients are also contributing, dropping coins in a moneybox when they come through the door. Funding for the clinic nurses – estimated to cost about $450,000 – has also come from proceeds of a book, sales of bush medicine and an online art auction organised by a Melbourne gallery. Purple House also covered the first year of operation at an Ernabella clinic, partly funded by the $63,000 sale at auction of a painting donated by Anangu women from the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara lands, to a European collector who promptly donated it to the South Australian museum. The head of anthropology at the museum and auctioneer for that sale, Dr John Carty, said it was an emotional moment for everyone and, in donating the painting, the buyer “got what it was about”. “Let’s face it, a lot of the art being celebrated or sold for hundreds of thousands on the art market is by people who are suffering from health issues or their family are,” Carty told Guardian Australia. “Rather than waiting for someone else to address the problem, they use art to bring attention to the health issues. “The fact that Purple House has to beg and borrow and steal to get basic funding is kind of criminal.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/07/sia-ethics-of-fame-and-maddie-ziegler-a-question-i-have-asked-myself-often","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T04:07:22Z","webTitle":"Sia: ethics of fame and Maddie Ziegler 'a question I have asked myself often'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/07/sia-ethics-of-fame-and-maddie-ziegler-a-question-i-have-asked-myself-often","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/07/sia-ethics-of-fame-and-maddie-ziegler-a-question-i-have-asked-myself-often","fields":{"headline":"Sia: ethics of fame and Maddie Ziegler 'a question I have asked myself often'","bodyText":"Performing artist Sia Furler has responded to concerns about her use of 15-year-old dancer Maddie Ziegler as a creative partner, saying the use of children in entertainment is “a conversation we should all be having”. On Thursday the enigmatic singer responded to a Guardian column which questioned Sia’s use of Ziegler as an avatar of herself in her live performances and music videos. The column asked whether the spotlight-shy artist was exposing a child to the same fame she sought to avoid, writing that “the grown-up who has seen what fame can do and fears it has, perhaps unwittingly, handed it over to the child instead”. On Twitter, Furler admitted that the article “poses a question I have asked myself often”. “I do check in with Maddie weekly about whether she wants this, and assure her if she ever wants it to stop it stops,” she wrote. “It’s a conversation we should all be having. Not just myself but all directors, stage parents and agents [w]ith their children, clients, charges.” Furler began working with Ziegler after spotting her on the US show Dance Moms and the teenager has now appeared in six music videos, live TV performances and a global tour as what Malkin called the “the fury and the face” of Furler’s music. Reviewing the recent concert in Melbourne, Guardian writer Richard S He said: “if [Sia is] JM Barrie, Maddie Ziegler is Peter Pan”. But Furler wrote that fame “affects her differently than how it affected me”. “Maddie was already famous when I discovered her, but I have certainly expanded her exposure and feel responsible for that. I feel very protective of her and my goal is to empower her in whatever choices she makes,” she wrote. “Some would argue a teenager [c]an’t or shouldn’t be charged with making sound choices for themselves and so I do try to choose the best for her always. But I think this is an important conversation. “What I learned from Maddie is that fame affects her differently than how it affected me. I can only trust that she is telling me the truth. If that changes, we stop.” The Adelaide-born star has just wrapped up a two-date tour of Australia, her first since 2011."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/07/amazon-hunger-games-players-losers-second-headquarters-site-us-techno-capitalist","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T14:16:47Z","webTitle":"Amazon is running its own hunger games – and all the players will be losers | Jathan Sadowski and Karen Gregory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/07/amazon-hunger-games-players-losers-second-headquarters-site-us-techno-capitalist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/07/amazon-hunger-games-players-losers-second-headquarters-site-us-techno-capitalist","fields":{"headline":"Amazon is running its own hunger games – and all the players will be losers","bodyText":"Amazon, the online retail giant, is in the midst of running its own hunger games. The contestants are 238 cities and regions across North America. The prize is being chosen as the site for Amazon’s second headquarters (HQ2), which promises to employ upwards of 50,000 people. These cities are locked in a fierce battle to outbid each other and they’ll do anything, give anything, to be chosen. In an era of brutal austerity, cities are hollowed out and hoping for a savior. Since the tech sector is flush with cash, by showing up and saying the magic words – growth, jobs, investment, innovation – city leaders bend to their will. Amazon’s HQ2 competition is the latest egregious example of a techno-capitalist regime that’s bewitching cities around the world. While only about 30 of the proposals are publicly available so far, they paint a troubling picture of cities clamoring to sell their soul to Amazon. As the Seattle Times reports, the amount of money, perks and power that cities are ready to give away to Amazon is absolutely galling. It goes way beyond just standard subsidies and tax breaks. New Jersey has offered $7bn in incentives to Amazon if they build HQ2 in Newark. Whereas, in a proposal that sounds like it should be illegal, Chicago’s bid would force employees of HQ2 to pay part of their salary back to Amazon as “income tax”. That is, HQ2 employees would still have income tax deducted, but instead of going to the government – to fund things like public services and infrastructure – it would be given to Amazon. This is a case where taxation is actually (wage) theft. In a similar vein of outrageous offerings, Fresno, California, has proposed the creation of an Amazon Community Fund – innocuous name, insidious plan. For 100 years, 85% of all taxes collected from Amazon would be put into an account jointly controlled by city leaders and Amazon executives. The taxes would be spent to support HQ2 and Fresno promises to promote Amazon’s role as benefactor for any project paid for by the “community fund” (AKA public dollars). It’s alarming that so many proposals are essentially treating Amazon as a sovereign, whether that’s collecting taxes for the company or allowing it to control tax spending. Amazon – and by extension the 100-billion-dollar man founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos – will be crowned king of whatever city it decides to grace with the HQ2. Writing in N+1 Magazine, Nikil Saval shows how the HQ2 competition is not just an exciting project for cities, rather it is a melancholic plea for revitalization: “All cities were forced to realize their basic inadequacy: that ultimately, all their tireless work to cultivate their urbanity amounted to nothing if they did not have Amazon.” If only the hunger games brought to you by Amazon was a one-off spectacle, rather than just another in a series of warning signs that we’re all on a bleak trajectory. Frankly, the future of our cities looks grim: Amazon lords over desperate cities, while Google owns entire urban districts, Bill Gates builds his own smart city, and Uber privatizes city services. These are not discrete events. They are manifestations of an overarching agenda: the techno-capitalist takeover of cities. While corporate promises of high-paying jobs and investments in city infrastructure tantalize politicians, the immediate effects of this agenda will be paid by ordinary citizens through rising taxes, increased housing costs, and selling off public goods. Cities represent the frontier of value extraction for tech corporations, as they are full of public services to “disrupt”, government coffers to raid, and people to exploit. While American cities are no stranger to privatization, the entrance of tech giants into urban development portends a long-term reorganization of local power based on proprietary platforms, data harvesting, managerial control. All of which reshapes cities into profit-generating machines for techno-capitalists. At the heart of this techno-capitalist agenda is a reimagination of what it will mean to live in the city: how we will access goods and services (Amazon!), how we will move about (Uber!), how we will afford housing (Airbnb!), how we will be governed (Google!), and how we will be recognized as citizens with rights, if at all? The rise of “smart cities” represents a grand experiment in what it will mean to live in and through powerful, data-driven, networked systems. This might not sound so bad, if you are privileged enough to enjoy the modest conveniences and capabilities that smart tech provides. For many who lack that position in society, however, this vision of the city looks like unaccessible services, unaffordable rents, unmitigated power, and undemocratic politics. Amazon has said it will make its final decision about where to locate HQ2 in 2018. Wherever it moves, it will mold the urban landscape to feed its hunger for profit and power. That same hunger drives the techno-capitalist takeover. We cannot be so tempted by promises of prosperity and progress that we miss the pernicious agenda at work. The future of our cities is at stake.

Flames fanned by strong winds reached a temperature-controlled wine storage shed on the mogul’s Moraga Vineyards estate on Wednesday after destroying at least six properties in Bel-Air and threatening hundreds more. The so-called Skirball fire is one of multiple wildfires that flared across southern California this week, forcing thousands to flee and smothering cities in smoke which is expected to last several more days. Firefighters backed by helicopters were unable to stop flames reaching Murdoch’s estate, a 2.8 hectare property he bought for $28.8m in 2013 after spotting an advert in the property section of the Wall Street Journal, which he owns. The estate has been evacuated. The house appeared undamaged on Wednesday night but the blaze was still largely out of control. It is unclear how much wine was lost in the storage shed which burned. “We are monitoring the situation as closely as we can and are grateful for the efforts of all the first responders,” Murdoch said in a statement. “Some of our neighbors have suffered heavy losses and our thoughts and prayers are with them at this time.” California’s fire season usually ends in November but the hottest summer on record and delayed rains have left the region tinder-dry into December. Some scientists have linked the conditions to climate change. “This fire is big, fast, and furious. But the most striking thing about its vast size, bewildering speed, destructive power is that this fire blew up in December. Repeat: December,” said Char Miller, a Pomona college professor of environmental analysis and expert on wildfires. “This is a sign that the fire season is lengthening as the drought in southern California deepens. That the fire season is intensifying in response to climate change.” Murdoch, 86, has ridiculed climate change as “alarmist nonsense”, a scepticism echoed in his media empire. Some social media commentators seized on the fire as comeuppance and juxtaposed images of the blaze with a 2011 tweet in which the mogul mocked global warming. Earlier this year the estate’s winemaker, Scott Rich, told the Guardian climate change was aiding its production of sauvignon blanc and a cabernet-merlot dominant blend. “We’re finishing harvest a little bit earlier than we used to,” he said in May. “It’s been a positive thing. We don’t get rained on. Rain can ruin everything for us.” Asked if they had discussed the impact of a warming planet on the vineyard with his boss Rich said: “I have not. My general feeling about people’s beliefs is that I’m not going to change them regardless of the discussion. I haven’t broached it with him.” The property resembles rural Tuscany but nestled amid the mega-mansions of Bel-Air, a wealthy neighbourhood in the Santa Monica mountains just west of Los Angeles. Murdoch bought the estate, boasting steep vine-lined slopes and a 1920s Mediterranean-style house with nine bathrooms and 11 bedrooms, as a home for when he and wife, Jerry Hall, visit the US west coast. A previous owner, Victor Fleming, the director of The Wizard of Oz and Gone with the Wind, used to host Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, Ingrid Bergman and other Hollywood illuminati. Murdoch called the winery a personal fascination as well as a business. “I try to help out on the property whenever I can and am looking forward to doing so even more in the future,” he told the Guardian via email in May. “This year I’m hoping to be there for the harvest. I’m in contact with the staff almost daily and very aware of what is going on both in the vineyard and with regard to sales.” Asked about the estate manager’s belief in climate change, Murdoch responded: “I’m not a climate denier. Climate is always changing. We just had years of drought in California. Now we’re having a lot of rain.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/08/morning-mail-protests-against-trumps-jerusalem-move-turn-violent","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T19:55:38Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: protests against Trump's Jerusalem move turn violent","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/08/morning-mail-protests-against-trumps-jerusalem-move-turn-violent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/08/morning-mail-protests-against-trumps-jerusalem-move-turn-violent","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: protests against Trump's Jerusalem move turn violent","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Mike Ticher, standing in for Eleanor Ainge Roy, bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 8 December. Top stories US missions across the Middle East are braced for more violent protests against Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, after widespread clashes between Palestinians and Israeli forces on Thursday. Violence spilled on to the streets in cities across the occupied West Bank as international anger grew over Trump’s move. The most violent confrontations occurred in Ramallah, Bethlehem and Hebron, where Israeli security forces fired teargas and plastic-coated rounds and hundreds of protesters threw stones and set alight barricades. In the Gaza Strip, two protesters were wounded by live fire, with one reported to be in a critical condition. International condemnation has been all but unanimous. A meeting of the UN security council has been called for Friday to discuss Trump’s decision. The EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said the bloc had a united position that Jerusalem must be the capital of both Israel and a future Palestinian state. Arab leaders have condemned the decision. France said it rejected the “unilateral” US decision while the British prime minister, Theresa May, and her foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, described Trump’s announcement as “unhelpful”. The state department has placed diplomatic staff and their families in the region under tight security restrictions in case protests target US interests after Friday prayers. Survivors and advocates for victims of sexual assault are furious that they have not been told when they will be able to read the report from the child sex abuse royal commission. The commission will hand the report to the governor general next Friday but the government will not say when or if it will be made public. Leonie Sheedy, an advocate for survivors of abuse in foster care and government-run institutions, said she had been trying to find out the information for weeks. “My country doesn’t care to inform survivors and care leavers about the most significant event in our history. Where and when is this report going to be released to the public?”. A former senior intelligence analyst has called for an urgent review of the NSW education department’s relationship with a Chinese government-affiliated entity, the Confucius Institute. The institute is part of an international network established by Beijing to promote Chinese language and culture and, in the words of a former senior Chinese official, is “an important part of China’s overseas propaganda set-up”. Amid concern about Beijing’s increasing influence in Australian institutions, the department’s unique arrangement is coming under renewed scrutiny. “I think it is unacceptable,” said Ross Babbage, the former head of strategic analysis at the Office of National Assessments. “This sort of activity has to be put in the picture of the broader programs – propaganda, influence, cyber, even espionage – programs that the Chinese government has been sponsoring into Australia.” The US senator Al Franken has resigned, becoming the highest ranking US politician yet to step down over allegations of sexual misconduct. Speaking on the Senate floor, Franken said: “All women deserve to be heard and their experiences taken seriously.” But he said his response to the sexual misconduct allegations against him “gave some people the false impression that I was admitting doing things that I hadn’t done. Some of the allegations against me are simply not true. Others I remember differently.” The Minnesota Democrat insisted: “Nothing I have done as a senator has brought dishonour on this institution.” The chairman of a British bank has compared Bitcoin to Dante’s Inferno as the digital currency surged above $15,000. Sir Howard Davies, chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland, called on banking authorities around the world to launch a coordinated warning against investing in Bitcoin. “Put up the sign from Dante’s Inferno – ‘Abandon hope all ye who enter here’ – I think that’s probably what’s needed,” Davies said. The cryptocurrency, which has increased in value by $3,500 in the space of a week, appeared to be a “frothy investment bubble”, he said. “Central banks are very anxious about it.” Sport Mitchell Starc has warned England to expect an even tougher time against Australia’s bowlers in the remaining Ashes Tests. Starc has taken 14 wickets in Australia’s back-to-back victories, and believes he and his team-mates are ready to step up another gear as the series moves on to Perth. “The exciting thing is our bowling group can still get better,” Starc said. The quality of Australia’s pace attack is one of the big lessons from the Ashes so far, writes Rob Smyth. “There are no weak links in Australia’s four-man attack; there aren’t even any average links.” Football in Australia faces recriminations and fresh uncertainty on Friday after the surprise announcement that Fifa would not be taking over the administration of the game after all. The harsh critics of the Football Federation Australia chairman, Steven Lowy, will now be expected to work with him to resolve the crisis, despite the failure of mediation over many months. Thinking time While the white ibis has been the focus of controversy in the Guardian’s bird of the year poll, the brush turkey draws equal levels of love and loathing in Australian suburbs. But the loathing is misdirected, according to behavioural biologist Alicia Burns, who says the turkey is “one of the most remarkable birds on the planet”. She says scientists have studied the bird to get an idea of how the dinosaurs may have reared their young. “Which is to say – they don’t,” she writes. “Baby brush turkeys enter the world buried under a metre of compost and have to dig their way out on their own.” A failed petition to remove a controversial Balthus painting from New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art is the latest worrying attempt to censor a work of art, writes Jonathan Jones. Liberals used to know where they stood on censorship – unequivocally on the side of artistic freedom – but now very often they are the ones calling for bans, Jones argues. “The case for artistic freedom is as clear cut now as it ever was. It needs to be stated unequivocally: censor art and you shrink the shared heritage and future of humanity. Who attacks art? Isis in Palmyra, that’s who.” On Thursday more than 100 members of parliament joined 42 senators and nearly 8 million Australians to finally say “I do” to marriage equality. It has been a long journey to get to this point, and it hasn’t always been easy, says Alex Greenwich, “but Australians showed immense leadership in adversity, and the most dedicated volunteers and a skilled campaign team showed amazing professionalism and dignity to deliver a landslide victory for love.” What’s he done now? Fresh from setting the Middle East on fire, Donald Trump has moved on to recommending improving literature, in the shape of a biography of Andrew Jackson by the Fox News presenter Brian Kilmeade. It’s “really good”, Trump tweeted. Media roundup The long-awaited same-sex marriage vote dominates the front pages this morning, with most papers choosing the moment when Warren Entsch lifted Linda Burney off her feet in parliament as the defining image. The Canberra Times has one of the simplest but most effective treatments. Elsewhere the Australian reports that the tax commissioner, Chris Jordan, has “issued a passionate call to arms” for people to stop paying tradies in cash (passion may not be enough on that one). And the Courier-Mail has its daily prediction that the official outcome of the Queensland election is imminent, imploring the opposition leader, Tim Nicholls, to admit defeat. Coming up The citizenship saga goes back to the high court today for a directions hearing on former senators Stephen Parry (Liberal), Jacqui Lambie (independent) and Sky Kakoschke-Moore (Nick Xenophon Team), while the joint standing committee on electoral matters holds hearings on possible changes to section 44. Australia’s ambassador to the United States, Joe Hockey, will be speaking at the Australian National University on Australia-US relations and the first year of Donald Trump’s presidency.

Defence has been investigating the extent of contamination in waterways around its air force base in Darwin, where per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (Pfas) were used in firefighting foam for decades. Pfas has been shown to share a probable link with cancer and pregnancy-induced hypertension, and is highly persistent in the environment. The chemicals bioaccumulate, meaning they build up in living organisms over time. On Wednesday night, the department told the local community of results of nine months of ongoing investigations into the contamination caused by its air force base. Drains leading into two creeks – Rapid Creek and Ludmilla Creek – showed significant levels of Pfas, it said. Defence confirmed its advice that recreational activities should be avoided in the two creeks, which are poplar fishing spots, particularly with local Indigenous groups. Water from those creeks is also not suitable for drinking, although most of Darwin’s water supply comes from a separate source, and is considered safe. Defence also confirmed earlier investigations by the Northern Territory government that elevated levels of Pfas have been found in seafood, but that it was still safe to eat in small volumes. Defence spokesman Steven Grzeskowiak said the department’s initial findings were broadly the same, and assured residents who live in the area that their bore water was safe to drink. However, homegrown produce on these properties could pose a health risk because of Pfas concentration in soil. Defence will undertake further analysis for both dry- and wet-season conditions, and a human health study due in late April will determine whether blood tests are needed for Darwin residents. The Pfas contamination scandal has, so far, been concentrated in three locations: Williamtown in New South Wales, Oakey in Queensland, and Katherine in the Northern Territory. Defence has faced criticism for its handling of the issue. It was warned of potential dangers with its firefighting foam in the 1980s, and the Australian government was repeatedly warned of the chemicals’ toxicity years before it began a gradual phase-out of their use in 2004. The contamination has caused health fears, losses in property values, and considerable anxiety and distress. Defence is now facing two class actions from Oakey and Williamtown residents. Katherine residents are also considering a separate case. Grzeskowiak noted that in Katherine, Williamtown and Oakey, where free testing has already been offered, people have historically been drinking contaminated water. “And we have not found that to be the case here in Darwin,” he said. This week, the government announced an assistance package for Katherine, three hours’ drive south of Darwin, where contamination has been caused by decades of Pfas use at the town’s air force base, RAAF Tindal. The $5.7m package will include free blood tests for residents. Pfas was manufactured by multinational giant 3M, which maintains there is no consistent evidence that it causes adverse health effects. Australia’s military, fire services, and airport authorities imported large quantities of foam products containing Pfas, including the most toxic 3M Light Water. The federal government was directly warned about its toxicity and persistency by the US Environmental Protection Agency as early as 2000."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/07/parliament-votes-yes-and-casts-a-permanent-shadow-over-abbotts-legacy","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T07:32:01Z","webTitle":"Parliament votes yes and casts a permanent shadow over Abbott's legacy | Katharine Murphy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/07/parliament-votes-yes-and-casts-a-permanent-shadow-over-abbotts-legacy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/07/parliament-votes-yes-and-casts-a-permanent-shadow-over-abbotts-legacy","fields":{"headline":"Parliament votes yes and casts a permanent shadow over Abbott's legacy","bodyText":"It wasn’t entirely clear from my vantage point but it looked for all the world like Christine Forster, sister of Tony Abbott, may have rolled her eyes as her brother launched with gusto into the soundtrack of his contemporary political life: treachery from the top. Forster was just one in a sea of faces in the visitors’ gallery in the House of Representatives on Thursday who arrived early and lingered late. As the marathon debate ground on, the onlookers leaned forward with an undimmed sense of anticipation, enjoying their ringside seat on history. The visitors clapped heartily during the contributions that inched the debate forward, giving Thursday’s proceedings a kinetic quality, a rare sense of interactivity, of theatre-in-the-round. They injected joyful exuberance into a chamber that has spent much of 2017 hermetically sealed from the voters, preoccupied in its own grim state of war. The manager of government business, Christopher Pyne, could barely bring himself to dampen the high spirits, but he made a half-hearted attempt to quieten the strangers in the House. Pyne prefaced that he didn’t want to be “a Christmas Grinch” but he counselled visitors weren’t really supposed to barrack for one side or another. The visitors ignored Pyne of course – politely, as he knew they would – and they continued their periodic affirmations. But when Abbott rose to object to colleagues coming into the chamber with preconceived ideas (perish the thought) and encouraged them to assess amendments “on their merits” – there was some consequential shifting by Forster and in the seats around her. A ripple of frustration was visible. Abbott below was bathed half in shadow, half in blinding white sunlight, which happens in the chamber as the sun tracks overhead. The lighting lends the protagonists a thespian tinge as they deliver their soliloquies in the spotlight. The former prime minister felt put upon, having to consider these weighty issues on the run, “because the promises from the top were not adequately delivered upon”. Just in case we’d missed the negative pass at Malcolm Turnbull, Abbott warmed to his theme. “A promise was made by the leaders of this parliament and the promise has not adequately been delivered upon”. Abbott also wondered what Paul Keating would make of this display of “supine respect” the House of Representatives was delivering on marriage equality to the Senate. It wasn’t entirely clear why Keating had just been exhumed, summoned from battles past, and was now at large among us, but perhaps Abbott felt comforted by the ghost of a fellow combatant, who would always joust to the last. “I have never heard before members of this House showing such supine respect to another place,” Abbott said. “Why is it that simply because something has been passed in the Senate, these are tablets of stone handed down from the mountaintop beyond any question or consideration or delay by this House?” The horror of submission, to the Senate, of all places. So here we all were, washed up in exactly the same place we would have been if the postal survey had never happened, creeping to a conclusion in a free vote in the parliament on the last sitting day of a brutal political year, with protagonists taking predictable positions. Tony was wronged. Kevin Andrews was aggrieved. Marking an intergenerational divide, the up-and-coming conservatives of the Liberal party were entirely energised and strutted and fretted during their hour on the national stage. The Next Gen clique of the conservative right stormed the frontbench when they triggered their various divisions, trying out the big boys’ seats, feeling quite at home. They sized up events and one another as they worked, proposition by proposition, to close down one epic internal battle inside the government in order to better create room for the next one – synthesis suiting no one. The Liberals Michael Sukkar and Andrew Hastie eventually set up camp in the front row, such was their anticipatory familiarity. At one point, the Nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce, crept to the dispatch box to affirm he was in favour of traditional marriage, before confirming he was “currently separated”, a fact he noted was already on the record (it wasn’t, actually, at least not before then) and noting, as he very often does, that he was “not a saint”. At another point on the surreal end of the scale, Bob Katter raved about the word gay. Gay people, Bob felt, had a damned hide taking that wonderful word off straight people and making it their own. Not content with that creeping acquisition, now the gays were absconding with marriage. The visitors’ galleries laughed at the old man in the chamber. Once the rainbow families would have crouched, defensively, at that kind of onslaught, at that kind of visceral public rejection. Now, it was safe to laugh, because the old man in the chamber, and the history of shaming he represented, was about to be routed. It was all about to be washed away. As the divisions happened, Malcolm Turnbull’s cabinet quietly split. Moderates took up defensive positions in enemy territory, watched by colleagues across the demilitarised zone marked out by the central table, the dispatch boxes, and the gold mace, the enduring symbol of authority in the chamber. Christopher Pyne sat close to his Labor mate, Anthony Albanese. Kelly O’Dwyer sat with Liberal women who made the journey with her: sometimes with Jane Prentice, sometimes with Sussan Ley, sometimes with Julia Banks. Josh Frydenberg ventured into enemy territory to vote down one amendment, so did Christian Porter. Turnbull, who told very us often he and Lucy were voting yes, was an infrequent visitor during the amendments phase of the debate; a Delphic presence, a cheshire cat grin, more felt than seen. And, in the end, the obstacles were cleared. Just before 6pm the House of Representatives did what it struggles to do – faithfully represent the will of the majority of the people of Australia. The minority postured, preened, raved and roiled but the majority pushed through and made history. Only four parliamentarians voted no, a chapter of discrimination passed into history and the parliament’s temporary theatre-in-the-round exploded in triumph and relief."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/07/charities-criticise-bizarre-appointment-of-anti-charities-campaigner-as-head-of-regulator","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T02:27:48Z","webTitle":"Charities criticise 'bizarre' appointment of Gary Johns as head of regulator","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/07/charities-criticise-bizarre-appointment-of-anti-charities-campaigner-as-head-of-regulator","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/07/charities-criticise-bizarre-appointment-of-anti-charities-campaigner-as-head-of-regulator","fields":{"headline":"Charities criticise 'bizarre' appointment of Gary Johns as head of regulator","bodyText":"The Turnbull government has appointed a man perceived as a longtime anti-charity campaigner as the head of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission. The appointment comes amid moves to limit the advocacy rights of charities, including an upcoming review of the ACNC, including a number of parliamentary reviews, a Treasury review and an upcoming review of the ACNC Act. Gary Johns, a Labor minister under the Keating government, is known for his views that charities should not be allowed to advocate for changes to government policy and was head of NGOWatch at the Institute for Public Affairs, which investigated charities the IPA thought were targeting businesses. He has also argued that people on government allowances should be required to take contraception, described Indigenous mothers as “cash cows”, attacked Indigenous charities and criticised BeyondBlue’s campaigning for marriage equality. Speaking after the assistant minister to the treasurer, Michael Sukkar, announced his appointment, Johns said he wanted the ACNC to focus more ensuring charities were fulfilling their charitable purpose. “But we need to keep in mind the purpose,” Johns said. “The overall market here is that donors give money to charities in the expectation that most of it will be used for the charitable purpose ... And that what is more, the work that is undertaken on behalf of a donor works. So these are matters I want to bring to the fore as part of the work of the charities commission.” The appointment of Johns was met with outrage. “It’s bizarre, absolutely bizarre,” said David Crosbie, the chief executive of the Communities Council of Australia, a peak body for not-for-profit organisations. “Why you would appoint a well-known anti-charities campaigner to head up the charities regulator is beyond me, even if you are trying to close down advocacy by the charities sector.” Cassandra Goldie, the chief executive of the Australian Council of Social Service, said the appointment undermined the regulator’s independence. “We see the appointment through the lens about what it says to the government’s approach to the regulation of the charitable sector,” she said. Marc Purcell, the chief executive of the Australian Council For International Development, said the move “displays a contempt by the government for Australia’s charities”. Johns said his political views were not relevant and that he would be a “technician”, simply applying the law. But the sector sees the appointment in the context of an ongoing battle with the Coalition government, which is trying to limit the ability of charities to advocate for policy change. Purcell said: “We’re concerned that this appointment couples with the upcoming review of the legislation for the charity regulator could combine into a perfect storm that may destroy charitable advocacy and tax deductions for advocacy.” Purcell said during the five-yearly review of the ACNC legislation, which is due now, the government would have the ability to change the remit of the regulator, giving Johns the ability to implement his views. Dermot O’Gorman, the chief executive of WWF Australia, said there was “deep shock” in the sector. “I wasn’t expecting someone who would be our best friend,” he said. “But what message is the minister trying to send here?” At the press conference, Sukkar defended the appointment. “He is here to apply the law as it is contained in the act. And the fact that he has a deeper understanding of the issues in a more philosophical sense is a strength.” A Labor spokesman, Andrew Leigh, said the appointment was “like putting Dracula in charge of the bloodbank”. “Mr Johns has been a foe of charities and he has been one of the strongest critics of charities in Australia. He has attacked Indigenous charities, he has attacked mental health charities and he has attacked charities that attempt to engage in advocacy,” Leigh said. “That’s the thing about this government, they have a ‘charities should be seen and not heard’ approach. They think that charities are OK so long as they’re running soup kitchens, but once they start talking about poverty and inequality, they’re overstepping their mark … “A leopard doesn’t change its spots. Gary Johns will not cease being a foe to charities in this new role.” Writing in the Australian in 2014, Johns said: “If a person’s sole source of income is the taxpayer, the person, as a condition of benefit, must have contraception. No contraception, no benefit.” Appearing on TV with the rightwing commentator Andrew Bolt in 2015, Johns reportedly described Aboriginal women on welfare as “cash cows”. “Look, a lot of poor women in this country, a large proportion of whom are Aboriginal, are used as cash cows, right?” Fairfax Media reported Johns as saying. “They are kept pregnant and producing children for the cash. Now, that has to stop.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/06/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-rout-champions-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T23:51:14Z","webTitle":"Jürgen Klopp says Liverpool strike force will have last-16 rivals worried","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/06/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-rout-champions-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/06/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-rout-champions-league","fields":{"headline":"Jürgen Klopp says Liverpool strike force will have last-16 rivals worried","bodyText":"Jürgen Klopp said Liverpool’s formidable attacking quartet will strike fear throughout the Champions League after his team swept into the last 16 with a 7-0 destruction of Spartak Moscow. Philippe Coutinho, with the first hat-trick of his Anfield career, Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mané and Mohamed Salah scored as Liverpool struck seven without reply for the second time in the group campaign. Victory ensured Klopp’s side advanced into the knockout phase as group winners and means the Premier League has five clubs in the last 16 of the competition for the first time. It also made Liverpool the highest scoring English team in a Champions League group campaign, the second highest ever, and Klopp admitted the attacking prowess of Coutinho, Mané, Salah and Firmino would intimidate every team in Europe providing it is maintained. “If we perform like this, if we are that clinical, then yes we can [strike fear into opponents],” said the Liverpool manager, who also oversaw a 7-0 win away in Maribor. “But we had the same players before and they didn’t score and then it is not that we talk like this. That is not a criticism of the past. If we perform like this then we are a threat, 100%. And if you see how Dom Solanke performed at Stoke, how Daniel Sturridge performed when he came on tonight – he could have scored two or three and he made a goal for Sadio – that’s good.” Liverpool’s prize for winning their group and reaching the knockout stage for the first time since 2008-09, will be a last-16 tie against either Basel, Bayern Munich, Juventus, Porto, Shakhtar Donetsk or the reigning champions Real Madrid. Klopp said: “We knew if we won we would top the group so that’s not the biggest surprise but I think it’s strange this year in the group stages. There are a lot of really strong teams in second place. Obviously all the teams in the last 16 are strong but this year is quite special. It’s not often you can face Bayern Munich, Real Madrid or Juve if you win your group. Antonio Conte said it yesterday – there are no easy opponents and I don’t think anyone is happy when they get us in the draw. We will not be happy when we see who we face in the next round, but we will ready.” After several underwhelming seasons in Europe’s elite competition, the Premier League will be strongly represented in the last 16 with Liverpool joining Manchester City, Manchester United, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur in the knockout phase. “I could not be less interested in the other teams to be honest but I think the reason [for five English teams in the draw] is quality,” Klopp said. “All the teams in the Champions League have strong squads. We will see where this leads to but it’s a fact that English football is top quality. I don’t know why it didn’t happen in the last few years. I don’t think there are a lot of options for English teams in the next round but it is good news for English football. There has been a lot of good news for English football recently with their youth teams winning World Cups.” He said the “little shadow” on the rout of the Russian champions was an injury to Alberto Moreno that could sideline the in-form left-back for several matches, beginning against Everton on Sunday. Klopp said: “It could be something serious but he was a little more positive in the treatment room, so maybe we will be lucky. We need all the boys for the next few weeks and especially for Sunday. We showed tonight we learned from the mistake we made in Seville. Now we must show we learned from the mistake we made after Maribor when we faced Tottenham [and lost 4-1].”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/07/fast-track-assessment-fundamentally-unfair-to-refugees-high-court-told","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T06:08:04Z","webTitle":"Fast-track assessment fundamentally unfair to refugees, high court told","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/07/fast-track-assessment-fundamentally-unfair-to-refugees-high-court-told","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/07/fast-track-assessment-fundamentally-unfair-to-refugees-high-court-told","fields":{"headline":"Fast-track assessment fundamentally unfair to refugees, high court told","bodyText":"Legal Aid Victoria has challenged the “fundamental unfairness” of the fast-tracked refugee assessment process in the high court, arguing that it treats those who arrived by boat as second class. The one-day hearing on Thursday focused on the case of an Iranian asylum seeker in his mid-20s whose application for a temporary protection visa was rejected by the Department of Immigration, in a decision reviewed by the immigration assessment authority (IAA). It’s the first time the fairness of the fast-track process has been challenged in the high court. The man, known in court documents as M174, arrived in Australia by boat in October 2012 and made an application for a temporary protection visa in September 2015 on the grounds that he had converted to Christianity and would face persecution if he returned to Iran. He said that he had regularly attended a church in suburban Melbourne since arriving in Australia. A department official rejected the visa application in April 2016 after speaking to the reverend of the church, who said the man did not attend church as often as he had claimed. In their reasoning, the official said they did not accept the man had genuinely converted to Christianity or would be perceived as having genuinely converted to Christianity by Iranian authorities in the event he returned. They suggested the man had attended church “in order to falsely strengthen his claim for protection”. That decision was reviewed and approved by the IAA in May 2016. Joel Townsend, the migration program manager at Legal Aid Victoria, said his client was not given the opportunity to explain why he had attended church less frequently in the years between his arrival in Melbourne and his visa application. Townsend said the man had moved to another suburb, which made it more difficult to travel to the church, but could provide letters of support from other Christians confirming his commitment to Christianity. “He never had a chance through that review process to answer the concerns that had arisen as a result of that telephone call between the [department official] and the minister,” Townsend told Guardian Australia. The IAA was established as part of a suite of immigration reforms approved by parliament in late 2014 to deal with the backlog of 30,000 undetermined cases of people who arrived in Australia by boat in the first half of the decade, against a backdrop of the Abbott government promising to release all children from offshore detention centres. It was intended to fast-track the lengthy process of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which still applies to immigration matters of people who arrived in Australia by plane. Unlike the tribunal, the IAA does not have the ability to consider new material when conducting a review, except in exceptional circumstances. An applicant must present all information and documentation supporting his or her case at the point where it is being assessed by a department official. Townsend said that cases such as M174, where new information arose in the course of that assessment, the process was fundamentally unfair. “It’s not just about this decision, it’s about a process that has the potential to leave people in a position where their cases are unfairly dealt with,” he said. Lawyers for the Department of Immigration and Border Protection argued that the department official was not obliged to tell the man about the substance of their conversation with the reverend because it was “not relevant” under section 57(1) of the Migration Act 1958, which sets out what should be considered adverse information for the purposes of due process. They also argued that parliament in establishing the IAA did not intend that the fast-track process could not apply in circumstances where there was adverse information. Dr Maria O’Sullivan, a migration law expert with the Castan Centre at Monash University, said that limiting procedural rights was a trade-off made by parliament in order to clear the backlog of immigration cases. “In the interests of getting people through, you limit your procedural rights,” O’Sullivan said. Concerns were raised when the IAA was established that the requirement for asylums seekers, who could have poor English skills and often do not have legal assistance, to provide all possible relevant documentation and evidence upfront would lead to unfairness. Similar cases before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal usually have a half-day hearing, which O’Sullivan said was more “robust” process but could lead to delays. The difference, she said, was “emblematic of having a second-class system for people who come by a boat.” “There is an argument that when you have a vulnerable cohort who may have difficulty with English there should be an oral hearing,” O’Sullivan said. “That’s the more robust system for people who come by a plane.” The high court is expected to reserve its decision."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/08/confucious-institute-in-nsw-education-department-unacceptable-analyst","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T19:00:21Z","webTitle":"Confucius Institute in NSW education department 'unacceptable' – analyst","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/08/confucious-institute-in-nsw-education-department-unacceptable-analyst","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/08/confucious-institute-in-nsw-education-department-unacceptable-analyst","fields":{"headline":"Confucius Institute in NSW education department 'unacceptable' – analyst","bodyText":"A former senior intelligence analyst for the Australian government is calling for an urgent review of an arrangement whereby a Chinese government-affiliated entity is embedded inside a state government department. The New South Wales Department of Education is the first government department in the world to host a Confucius Institute, part of an international network established by Beijing in 2004 to promote Chinese language and culture and, in the words of a former senior Chinese official, “an important part of China’s overseas propaganda set-up”. Amid concern about Beijing’s increasing influence in Australian institutions and an escalating international backlash against Confucius institutes, this arrangement, signed in 2011, is coming under renewed scrutiny. “I think it is unacceptable,” says Ross Babbage, the former head of strategic analysis at the Office of National Assessments, the government’s intelligence adviser. “This sort of activity has to be put in the picture of the broader programs … that the Chinese government has been sponsoring into Australia. “These Confucius Institute initiatives cannot be seen as somehow separate, or an abstraction from them. Accepting Chinese government-funded personnel within an Australian state government department is a very serious issue that deserves urgent review.” Under a 2011 agreement, the NSW Department of Education Confucius Institute manages Confucius classrooms teaching Chinese in 13 NSW primary and secondary public schools. Two of the four positions in the NSW institute are funded by the department, while the others are funded by Chinese partners, the Office of Chinese Language Council International, known as the Hanban, in partnership with Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education. Under the Confucius Institute constitution, all institutes are obliged to report their annual projects and accounts back to their Beijing headquarters “for examination and approval”, effectively giving a Chinese government body potential veto power over work done within an Australian government department. The NSW Department of Education said: “The Confucius Institute at the NSW Department of Education is managed by the department and complies with all departmental policies. “The intent of the agreement is to strengthen educational cooperation between China and Australia, support and promote the development of Chinese language education, and increase mutual understanding and friendship among people in China and Australia.” Dr Marshall Sahlins, a renowned sociologist at the University of Chicago who wrote a book about the influence of Confucius institutes on academic life, criticised the arrangement as “dangerous for the obvious reason that it implants Chinese interests and personnel, not simply in NSW universities but in the NSW government department in charge of education”. The worldwide Confucius Institute headquarters (the “Hanban”), which is affiliated with China’s ministry of education, provided $150,000 in establishment funds for the NSW Department of Education Institute, and gives $10,000 per year for each Confucius classroom, as well as a native Chinese teaching assistant and teaching materials. One Chinese language teacher, Jinping Blunden, at Homebush Boys high school, said Confucius Institute funding has increased the popularity of Chinese among students at the school. It has helped pay for excursions to the Blue Mountains, Sydney’s Chinatown and the Chinese Garden of Friendship, deepening students’ understanding of Chinese culture. When asked about the possibility of political content being included in class, she said all NSW Chinese classes must follow the state-mandated syllabus, using local textbooks, with the institute’s teaching assistants only playing a supplementary role in the classroom. The Chinese Language Teachers Association of NSW says the Confucius classrooms have benefited Chinese language and culture studies, and there is no evidence of political content. Jamie Parker, a NSW MP who raised concerns about the Confucius classrooms in the parliament in 2011, said: “I’m concerned this is acting as an arm of propaganda from the Chinese perspective and trying to extend that into our education system here in Australia. One of the problems is that schools are always so desperate for funding that people that are supposed to be providing funds are often welcomed with open arms without the kind of analysis and critical eye that’s required.” Another expert, Dr Falk Hartig at the Goethe University in Frankfurt, has studied Confucius institutes in Australia, and raises concerns about the target audience in this particular collaboration. “They are targeting young students and children,” he said, adding that it was “a little different than targeting adult students who may think for themselves what it may mean if I go to a Confucius Institute.” Hartig said: “It’s a very smart move to engage western stakeholders in Chinese public diplomacy efforts, and even making those foreigners pay. This is the very, very interesting aspect. Because you provide the infrastructure and you provide local human resources, you’re also co-financing those institutes. From the Chinese side, that’s a very smart and clever move.” One NSW parent, Alexander Nilsen, has been a vocal critic, partly due to his belief in Falun Gong, a spiritual movement banned in China as an evil sect. He chose not to send his son to Chatswood Public school after discovering it had a Confucius classroom. “It may be called an ‘education department’ but that’s not really what it is,” he said. “Hanban decides who teaches … what they teach, and the materials they use.” Another parent of a child learning Chinese in a Confucius classroom, who asked not to be named for fear her child would be disadvantaged, said she had asked for Chinese flags to be removed from the classroom. She said that the principal of her child’s school was aware of the risks associated with the program, even going so far as to ask her to “monitor” the lessons on behalf of the school. When the classrooms were opened, the Department of Education’s regional director Dr Phil Lambert openly discouraged discussions in the classrooms about controversial subjects such as China’s human rights record, Tibet or Tiananmen. The confidential 2011 agreement signed between the department and the Confucius Institute headquarters, states: “The Institute activities … shall not contravene the laws and regulations, both in Australia and China.” Such an agreement could rule out discussion about, for example, the status of Taiwan or calls for independence in Tibet or Hong Kong, and as such could limit academic freedom. A third overseas scholar of Confucius Institutes, Dr Lionel Jensen of Notre Dame University in Indiana, has raised concerns that such language “may be construed as an illegal overreach of jurisdiction”. A similar arrangement to establish a Confucius Institute inside the Toronto District school board was scrapped in 2014 after heated community protests. Pamela Gough, who serves as a trustee on the board, said that cultural partnerships inflaming sectors of the community are “not necessary or appropriate”. “The main issue with the Confucius Institute partnership with the Toronto District school board was the strong links that the leadership of Confucius Institutes has with the government of China … there are many other ways to offer enrichment opportunities in Chinese languages, history and culture without necessarily entering into partnerships with organisations such as the Confucius Institute.” According to the China Daily, there are 1,076 Confucius classrooms at schools worldwide, and 516 Confucius institutes. Universities including Chicago, Penn State, Stockholm University, Lyon University and Canada’s McMaster university have closed down their Confucius institutes, while the conservative National Association of Scholars called for all US universities to close their Confucius institutes, following “improper concessions that jeopardize academic freedom and institutional autonomy.” This week China’s ministry of foreign affairs urged Malcolm Turnbull to “discard prejudice” and deepen the bilateral relationship rather than pursue measures aimed at shoring up Australia from the risks of foreign interference, insisting it “does not interfere in other countries’ domestic affairs”. The embassy in China also said the Australian media have “repeatedly fabricated” stories about Chinese influence and infiltration in Australia. Additional reporting by Daniel Connell.

Before the introduction of legislation on Thursday, Guardian Australia asked the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, for details of to whom the proposed ban would apply. A spokeswoman for Cormann said the legislation would mean only Australian citizens and organisations incorporated in Australia would be permitted to make political donations to political parties and candidates. “Any non-citizen, including permanent residents, will be banned from making political donations,” she said. Legal experts said the broad nature of the ban left it open to challenge by anyone in the banned category who wanted to make a donation, or any political party of a candidate wanting to receive a donation from anyone in the banned category. Anne Twomey, constitutional law professor at the University of Sydney, said the government’s proposal was “really doubtful in terms of its constitutional validity”. She pointed to paragraph 30 in the high court’s judgment in the Unions NSW case in 2013 which noted freedom of political communication was not a “right” or a “personal freedom” but people in Australia had “a legitimate interest in governmental action and the direction of policy” and would seek to influence the outcome of elections “directly or indirectly through the support of a party or a candidate who they consider best represents or expresses their viewpoint”. “The government is certainly moving into challengeable waters, and there would certainly be good grounds for challenging,” she said. George Williams, a constitutional law expert from the University of New South Wales, was of a similar view. “The legislation will face real pressure in the high court if they go down that path,” he said. “I wouldn’t be surprised to see a challenge brought.” Twomey said if the legislation proceeded, and someone brought a high court challenge, the Turnbull government would have to argue the policy justification for the proposed ban, in essence that the ban was imposed for “a legitimate end”. She said the high court had upheld a state-wide ban on political donations from property developers on that basis, but it was hard to predict what the court would decide in relation to threats posed by foreign influence of Australia’s political system. Twomey said another problem with the regime was the proposal to ban foreign funding for non-political actors, such as advocacy groups and charities. She said smaller advocacy groups could argue they lacked the administrative resources to comply with such a ban, and they could also argue the practical implication of the change was to “silence the voices of third-party campaigners” in Australia. Twomey said “the risk of unconstitutionality arises” if more groups were able to validly argue their voices were being excluded. The Turnbull government has been flagging for months an intention to restrict the activities of third-party actors, such as the progressive activist group GetUp, but it has proposed the ban in political funding more recently in the context of trying to limit foreign influence in the Australian political system. The government this week telegraphed the introduction of a package, including the donations ban, which aims to counter incidences of espionage and improper foreign influence within Australia’s political system. That package is expected to proceed on Thursday. The introduction of the package comes in the context of rolling controversy surrounding Labor’s strife-torn senator Sam Dastyari, who remains in hot water over his dealings with the Sydney-based Chinese businessman, Huang Xiangmo. China has responded furiously to the Turnbull government’s move, and Labor and the Greens have signalled they will attempt to amend the legislation banning foreign political donations to ensure third-party actors were not adversely affected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/07/marriage-equality-law-passes-australias-parliament-in-landslide-vote","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T06:58:54Z","webTitle":"Marriage equality law passes Australia's parliament in landslide vote","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/07/marriage-equality-law-passes-australias-parliament-in-landslide-vote","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/07/marriage-equality-law-passes-australias-parliament-in-landslide-vote","fields":{"headline":"Marriage equality law passes Australia's parliament in landslide vote","bodyText":"Australia’s parliament has legislated for marriage equality, passing a bill almost unanimously to allow two people, regardless of sex, to marry. On Thursday the House of Representatives passed a cross-party bill after an unprecedented national postal survey gave unstoppable momentum to legislate the historic social reform. Australia, which changed the law in 2004 to say that marriage is only between a man and a woman, now becomes the 25th country to recognise same-sex marriage. The lower house passed marriage equality with almost all members of the governing Liberal-National Coalition joining Labor, the Greens, and crossbench MPs in a free vote to pass the bill which cleared the Senate last week without amendment. The only no votes were Coalition MPs Russell Broadbent, Keith Pitt, David Littleproud and independent MP Bob Katter. The speaker of the House of Representatives, Tony Smith, declared the vote carried, since fewer than five MPs opposed it, triggering a standing ovation from the parliamentarians and public gallery. Some broke into a rendition of the chorus of one of the country’s many unofficial anthems: “I am, you are, we are Australian.” The prime minister Malcolm Turnbull told the house that “Australia has done it - every Australian had their say, and they said ‘it’s fair, get on with it’.” “We’ve voted today for equality, for love, it’s time for more marriages, more commitment, more love, more respect,” he said. “This is Australia: fair, diverse, loving and filled with respect.” The attorney general, George Brandis, announced that on 9 December same-sex couples will be able “to lodge a notice of intended marriage”, paving the way for weddings as early as 9 January 2018. The Labor opposition leader Bill Shorten said that LGBTI Australians were now equal and the laws reflect “a modern Australia, inclusive and fair”. Appropriating Ecclesiastes 3, Shorten said there was a season for everything: “It is now a time to heal, a time to build, a time to laugh, a time to embrace, a time to love and now, at last, a time for marriage equality.” Prominent LGBTI Australians including the swimming stars Ian Thorpe and Daniel Kowalski, the actor Magda Szubanski and the campaigner Kerry Phelps descended on the nation’s capital, Canberra, to celebrate the final legislative victory that has followed years of activism and a three-month community campaign by the Equality Campaign. At a press conference after the vote, the Equality Campaign co-chair, Alex Greenwich, said: “We came, we saw and love finally conquered. Marriage equality is finally the law of the land.” The veteran LGBTI rights campaigner Rodney Croome said: “This reform is a gift that we’re all here give to the next generation, a gift of equality and inclusion, for them to build a better Australia from.” For thousands of same-sex couples who have already married in countries including New Zealand, Canada, Britain and the Netherlands, their marriages will be recognised automatically when the bill gets royal assent from the governor general in mid-December. Couples hoping to marry in Australia will have to wait until the new year after the one month notice period to marry. A Rainbow Families spokeswoman, Jacqui Tomlins, and her wife, Sarah, are one couple who will have their marriage recognised immediately, after they wed in Canada more than 12 years ago. Tomlins told Guardian Australia it “has been a massive journey for us and our family” to marriage equality. “When Sarah and I got married … our son was nine months old … and our daughters, who are 10 and 12, were just a twinkle in their mother’s eye.” Tomlins was one of a few couples who brought a legal case to have their overseas marriage recognised, prompting Australia to change the law to exclude them in 2004. “This is the end of a journey that has been bookended with two pieces of legislation: one that put discrimination in and one that will take the discrimination out,” she said. Jason Tuazon-McCheyne and his husband, Adrian, are another couple who will be recognised. They married in Canada in 2004. He likens the journey to the birth of children: with a long pregnancy, a “painful childbirth” in the last few weeks and months before his feeling of “elation and joy”. “A weight taken off our shoulders,” he said. The author of the cross-party bill, the Liberal senator Dean Smith, told ABC News on Thursday the passage of marriage equality was “a measure of what can be done when people put some of their partisan politics behind”. Smith – the first openly gay federal parliamentarian in the Liberal party – said the historic social reform was “owned by everyone, it is owned by the Australian people”. He credited advocates for the “great struggle for many, many years” and said despite the public attention on his role he was conscious that he was “called upon in the final few steps to make this happen”. The attorney general, George Brandis, has declared that marriage equality will be the “imperishable legacy” of Malcolm Turnbull’s Liberal-National Coalition government. But the achievement of the 45th parliament may also be claimed in part by the Labor opposition, which has campaigned for a free vote on same-sex marriage and brought its numbers to bear, with almost all its members voting in favour. When Turnbull took the prime ministership from his conservative predecessor, Tony Abbott, in September 2015, he retained the Coalition’s commitment to hold a national plebiscite on same-sex marriage before changing the law. The move was controversial, with LGBTI groups objecting to a human rights question – equality before the law – being decided by popular vote. Labor, the Greens and other opposition parties blocked the proposed plebiscite in the Senate in November 2016 and August 2017, leading the Turnbull government to launch a $100m voluntary national postal survey to fulfil its election commitment to give Australians a say. In a bruising three-month campaign, opponents of marriage equality claimed same-sex marriage would have far-reaching negative consequences for gender education and claimed it would harm religious freedom and freedom of speech. The yes camp’s Equality Campaign combined with moderate Liberals, Labor, the Greens, unions and the progressive campaign organisation Get Up to argue that same-sex marriage was a matter of equality and fairness. On 15 November the Australian Bureau of Statistics announced that 61.6% of Australians who took part voted yes, an overwhelming win that led to Smiths’ cross-party bill being passed unamended by both houses of parliament. Tuazon-McCheyne said the postal survey was “rubbish” and “unnecessarily painful”. But he said he loved the fact that the Australian people had rejected fear campaigns that had “questioned the legitimacy of LGBTI people and our families”. “I love the fact the Australian people turned it on its head, and forced [the parliament] to pass legislation without amendments … 62% was an overwhelming win in a vote designed to maximise the no vote.” Tuazon-McCheyne said he would “cry with relief” when the result was sealed. “I’m embarrassed how much I’ve been crying,” he said. “It’s something I’ve been working on for 18 years.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/18/american-government-business-privatisation-jon-michaels","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T11:00:01Z","webTitle":"How the American government slowly became a business | Jon Michaels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/18/american-government-business-privatisation-jon-michaels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/18/american-government-business-privatisation-jon-michaels","fields":{"headline":"How the American government slowly became a business","bodyText":"In the 1980s, the end seemed nigh for supporters of the US welfare state. The pitchforks were out in force. Pundits, legislators and newly politicized business and religious leaders joined Ronald Reagan in railing against the American version of what Margaret Thatcher derisively called the nanny state. But a funny thing happened on the way to the gallows. The mob got cold feet. The torch and pitchfork crowd realized they really, really liked government programs – at least the ones that benefited them directly. They liked their pensions, tax credits, healthcare, subsidies, licenses, and housing and education loans. They liked their clean air and water. They liked their safe workplaces. And they liked the fact that they could trust the food, drugs, consumer products, and financial services and instruments they purchased. What they really disliked, they decided, was the government itself – its people, its procedures, and its institutional and organizational architecture. And so, over the past 30-odd years, elected officials across the political spectrum have acted accordingly, simultaneously indulging and deceiving the American public by disassociating government goods and services from the government, at least as it has been traditionally conceived and staffed. Though these efforts have been framed, quite pointedly, in terms of decreasing the size, reach and power of government, what’s really happening is that the government is being transformed. There is no denying that the state today is bigger and more potent than ever before. It just happens to look very different – a consequence of it being privatized, marketized and generally reconfigured along decidedly businesslike lines. In short, Reagan didn’t, and couldn’t, kill the nanny state. But he did replace our old familiar nanny with a commercial upstart – a nanny corporation, as it were. Consider just some of the ways the privatized, businesslike state comports itself today. Private contractors now number in the millions. These contractors have taken leading roles in fighting our wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. They run prisons and immigration detention facilities. They facilitate domestic surveillance and counterterrorism operations. They draft major rules, shape energy, transportation, healthcare and environmental policy and render public benefits decisions. In addition, they also collect taxes and monitor and enforce regulatory compliance across the vast administrative expanse. The stated justification for such privatization is, very often, that contractors are more efficient than their government counterparts – driven, we’re told, by market competition to provide higher-quality and lower-cost services. At the same time, government agencies are privatizing from within, radically overhauling their in-house employment practices to better match what we generally find in the private sector. Among other things, hundreds of thousands of tenured civil servants have been reclassified as at-will employees, subject to summary termination just as they would be if they were working for McDonald’s. The Trump administration is pushing further still, promising to strip the rest of the career federal workforce of its legal protections. The stated justification for this overhaul – this marketization of the bureaucracy – is substantially the same: to make government workers internalize the pressures, demands and incentives of the competitive private labor market. Government contracting and marketizing the bureaucracy represent the biggest, most consequential manifestations of the contemporary businesslike government movement. But those seeking to remake the state have experimented further. They’ve created an array of intra-governmental venture capital and IT firms; transformed essential bureaucratic offices into for-profit revenue centers; converted our storied space program into something akin to a galactic Uber; established charitable trusts, allowing wealthy individuals and powerful corporations to finance and effectively direct state programs and initiatives; and created VIP prisons, posh accommodations for those able and willing to pay a hefty price to buy their way out of gen pop. This is, for better or worse, the moment we find ourselves in. Americans are (grudging) enthusiasts of government goods and services, still deeply allergic to government instruments and instrumentalities, and still very much captivated by the lures of the market. But the state cannot be separated from its people, practices and infrastructure without doing considerable violence to our constitutional order. For it is these very (and very distinctive) people, practices and infrastructure – and the interplay among them – that legitimate the state and validate state exercises of sovereign, coercive and moral force. And it is these distinctive actors, procedures and institutions that infuse liberal democratic governance with the necessary admixture of normative politics, civic engagement, professional expertise, financial disinterest and fidelity to the rule of law. A state shorn of these constitutive people, practices and infrastructure is perhaps better described as part gated community, part corporate conglomerate. To be sure, gated communities and corporate conglomerates have their charms. And so does businesslike government. It promises to be faster, more innovative, cheaper, and more “customer” friendly – and that no doubt sounds appealing to any number of us who have endured long lines at the DMV or who have otherwise experienced wasteful, sclerotic or simply apathetic government. But even assuming that those promises can be kept (a big if), there is good reason not to embrace privatized, commercialized government. Government’s force, and ultimately its favor, turns on it being decidedly unlike IBM or Walmart or Facebook. Government is – and very much ought to remain – a fundamentally different enterprise. Businesslike government is all about embracing the logic and discipline of the market. But the market, at least in its pure, idealized state, is not democratic, deliberative or juridical. Nor need it be. It is the world of Schumpeter and Coase, not Montesquieu or Madison. We can tolerate, even admire, corporate hierarchy, leanness, and efficiency. We can do so because those organizations have (or are presumed to have) a single, objective mission: to maximize shareholder value. We can tolerate, even admire, the unforgiving laws of capitalism. We can do so because only in the rarest of circumstances does the single-mindedness of individual businesses endanger our economic or national security. And we can tolerate, even admire, the rising cult of all-powerful CEOs. We can do so because, generally speaking, their word is not law, their fiefdoms are bounded, and rarely can they exert real coercive force. None of the seemingly celebrated market norms, practices, or fiduciary and legal duties translates well into the liberal democratic arena, and certainly not into our constitutional realm. For starters, there is no such thing as a single public goal or truth to pursue. We have no magic commonwealth formula, certainly none that’s the political equivalent to the maximization of shareholder value. Some of us surely prize national economic growth above all else, and those who do might be the closest approximation of corporate shareholders. But many do not. Instead, we privilege the plight of the poor and disenfranchised. We prioritize social justice or environmental causes or consider the best government to be as unobtrusive as possible. Interests in military hegemony, reproductive rights and religious freedom throw yet more, often incommensurable, variables into the mix. As such, we cannot readily reduce the goal of government to a single, undifferentiated objective; nor can we readily aggregate or harmonize our interests and channel them through one political leader, an inside-the-Beltway version of a Steve Jobs or Henry Ford. Rather, we need multiple voices, amplified by multiple platforms, constantly speaking to a multiplicity of decision-makers scattered across multiple branches of government. This isn’t efficient or orderly. But it is democratic, pluralistic, inclusive and deliberative. What’s more, even if we somehow could effectively aggregate, rank or harmonize our interests and direct a single leader to implement the public’s will, we still should resist the temptation to do so. We should resist for two reasons. First, absolute power corrupts, and a renegade sovereign that chooses to deviate from the public’s charge poses infinitely greater danger than does a rogue or simply tone-deaf corporate CEO. Second, and more importantly, even if we could effectively aggregate the public’s interests and ensure the selection of a faithful leader, there still is the very real possibility of tyranny by the majority. That is to say, a dominant faction, or cluster of factions, might settle on a course of action that stigmatizes or oppresses broad classes of minorities. In either case, we want, indeed need, a heterogeneous, overlapping and cross-checking government to limit the possibility of myopic or abusive exercises of state power. Sovereign power, unlike most (but of course not all) expressions of corporate power, is intentionally and necessarily morally inflected and coercive. As such, so long as men and women – rather than angels – govern, that sovereign power must be subject to checks and balances, even if such checks and balances are messy, time-consuming, and very much lend themselves to what market actors consider waste and obstinacy. It is for this reason that the United States is founded in large part upon a simple structural commitment: the separation of powers. Separation prevents tyranny, promotes liberty, and helps enrich public policy. Separation gives voice and venue to any number of important but conflicting values and provides procedures and pathways for those values to collectively inform American public law and governance. This simple structural commitment, and all that it enables, animated the framers’ constitutional architecture. But it didn’t stop there. This commitment carried forward into the 20th century, ultimately structuring (and legitimating) our modern welfare state. Now, however, that dynamic commitment – a commitment to separation of powers all the way forward – is very much threatened by the instant movement to render the American government more like a business – and a politicized one at that.

Oliver Schmidt, a German national who was the general manager in charge of VW’s environmental and engineering office in Michigan, had pleaded guilty to his part in the cover-up and argued he was “misused” by VW in its attempts to circumvent US emissions tests. But at the sentencing in Detroit judge Sean Cox sided with the prosecution. “It is my opinion that you are a key conspirator in this scheme to defraud the United States,” Cox told Schmidt in court. “You saw this as your opportunity to shine … and climb the corporate ladder at VW.” Schmidt read a written statement in court acknowledging his guilt and broke down when discussing his family’s sacrifices on his behalf since his arrest in January. “I made bad decisions and for that I am sorry,” he said. Alongside the sentence Schmidt was fined $400,000. Both the jail term and the fine were at the top end of sentencing guidelines. Schmidt, who oversaw emissions at VW’s office in Michigan from 2012 to early 2015, met with key California regulators in 2015 but did not disclose the rogue software. The government said he later misled US investigators and destroyed documents. Schmidt’s lawyers argued that his role only heated up in 2015, years after others at VW hatched the scheme, which violated the Clean Air Act. “The defendant has a leadership role within VW,” federal officials said. “As a consequence of that role, he was literally in the room for important decisions during the height of the criminal scheme.” VW pleaded guilty as a corporation in March and agreed to pay billions of dollars in fines. Schmidt, who had returned to Germany, was arrested in Florida in January after attempting to return home from a vacation following the filing of an FBI complaint. He is the highest-ranking VW employee to be convicted in the scheme in the US and the chances that the US authorities will prosecute more senior VW executives are slim as most are in Germany, which is unlikely to extradite its citizens to stand trial in the US."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2017/dec/11/theresa-may-statement-brexit-mps-commons-davis-seeks-to-heal-rift-with-ireland-over-brexit-deal-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T18:37:04Z","webTitle":"Theresa May tells MPs Brexit deal 'good news' for both remain and leave supporters – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/dec/11/theresa-may-statement-brexit-mps-commons-davis-seeks-to-heal-rift-with-ireland-over-brexit-deal-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2017/dec/11/theresa-may-statement-brexit-mps-commons-davis-seeks-to-heal-rift-with-ireland-over-brexit-deal-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May tells MPs Brexit deal 'good news' for both remain and leave supporters – as it happened","bodyText":"As I said earlier, the key fact from Theresa May’s statement was a negative: the absence of any fresh Tory row about Brexit. (See 5.54pm.) But there was some news in what May and Jeremy Corbyn had to say. Here are the key points. May confirmed that the UK’s financial offer to the EU was conditional on the government getting a Brexit deal. She told MPs: It is clear in the joint progress report, I have repeated it in my statement just now, that this offer is on the table in the context of us agreeing the partnership for the future, agreeing the next stage and agreeing the partnership for the future. If we don’t agree that partnership, then this offer is off the table. But the Brexit deal she was talking about was the withdrawal agreement. This will refer in general terms to a future trade deal, but it won’t actually be the trade deal. May also also said the UK’s final “Brexit bill” payment would be worth between £35bn and £39bn. May claimed the government still hoped to agree a trade deal by next autumn. Asked by the Tory MP Anna Soubry if the agreement on trade next autumn would be details of a new trade relationship, or just “heads of agreement”, May replied: We have always said that we will be working to negotiate our full agreement in terms of the future relationship that we have with the European Union. Of course, legally it won’t be possible for them to sign up to that agreement until after we have left the European Union and we’ve become a third county. While we are in the EU, it’s not possible to [be] a signatory of that agreement. But the pieces of work that will now go forward will be the details of the implementation period, the details of the withdrawal agreement, which will have to go through certain parliamentary processes in European member states ... and also the future relationship that we will have in trade terms and security terms with the European Union. But the EU does not expect to agree a proper trade deal by the end of next year. It just envisages a “political declaration” covering trade. (See 11.08am.) May said the transition deal arrangements may not be agreed until March. In response to a question from the Tory Jeremy Lefroy about how long it would take, she said she expected work on the transition to start straight after the EU summit this week. She went on: There are some details to be sorted out. I think the general expectation is that it will be agreed, we’ve said as early as possible in the new year, and Michel Barnier [the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator] has indicated that could be during the first quarter. She indicated that the government was not dropping the amendment to the EU withdrawal bill fixing 29 March 2019 as Brexit day. Some Tories have criticised this on the grounds that it might stop the government seeking an extension if the negotiations over-run, and at one point it looked as if the goverment might drop the amendment, which will be put to a vote next week. But today May said: We put that amendment down because we believe it’s important that we actually confirm and people have the confidence of knowing the date on which we will be leaving the European Union, which is March 29 2019. She said last week’s deal was “good news” for people who voted leave and for people who voted remain. She said: This is good news for people who voted Leave, who were worried we were so bogged down in tortuous negotiations it was never going to happen. And it is good news for people who voted Remain, who were worried we were going to crash out without a deal. She flatly denied a claim from Labour’s Chuka Umunna that civil servants have been told not to write memos about the impact of Brexit on sections of the economy. Umunna said: Senior civil servants across Whitehall have reportedly been instructed from here on not to commit into writing any evaluation they make of the impact of Brexit on their industry sectors. Is this true and if so why the cover-up? May simply replied: “No.” Jeremy Corbyn suggested he would be happy to see the Brexit deadline slip if that proved necessary for the sake of the UK getting a better deal. (See 3.57pm.) That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, is currently making a Commons statement. My colleague Patrick Wintour says he is striking a new tone on Yemen. The Conservative party has decided collectively to postpone its next Brexit row until after Christmas. That is probably the most important takeaway from Theresa May’s marathon 105 minutes at the despatch box. With arch pro-Europeans and supposed mutineers like Ken Clarke and Anna Soubry (“supposed” because they don’t seem to have done much mutineering recently) praising May’s Brexit deal, alongside diehard Brexiters like Iain Duncan Smith and Sir Edward Leigh, it all felt very choreographed by the whips. But so what? That’s politics. For an afternoon at least, May has managed to unite her party. It was probably her happiest moment in the Commons since her first PMQs as party leader. About the only Conservative who did express reservations was Philip Davies. (See 4.41pm.) But, in relative terms, even his question was supportive. According to Tim Shipman and Caroline Wheeler in the Sunday Times yesterday (paywall), last week Davies told colleagues at a dinner May should be replaced. “Philip Davies gave a speech about how crap Theresa May is,” they quoted one MP as saying. It wasn’t a speech he repeated this afternoon. That doesn’t mean the underlying splits and tensions have disappeared. “This is a moment when sceptical MPs – frightened of seeming disloyal – are pretending to be happy,” the Thatcher biographer and Conservative party guru Charles Moore wrote in the Telegraph (paywall) on Saturday. “I know they are not – and the same applies to millions of people across the country.” But even the Tory party has a finite appetite for feuding and plotting. It feels as if any further rebelling has been postponed until the new year - which may help to explain, incidentally, why Number 10 now seems confident of winning the vote on the amendment putting Brexit day on the face of the EU withdrawal bill. (See 2.53pm and 5.17pm.) I will post key points in a moment. May’s statement is over. John Bercow says she was on her feet for one hour and 45 minutes. That was quite a substantial commitment, he says, although Geoffrey Boycott (see 4.30pm) would not have thought that very long, he jokes. The SNP Carol Monaghan asks where hospitals will get the radioactive material they need to diagnose cancer after the UK leaves Euratom. May says the government recognises the importance of this issue. Arrangements will be put in place to ensure supplies continue, she says. Labour’s Kevin Brennan says May did not answer Peter Bone’s question (see 4.50pm) about putting Brexit date on the face of the EU withdrawal bill. May says the government put that amendment down so that people would have confidence that the UK will leave on 29 March 2019. May says government still committed to amendment to EU withdrawal bill specifying 29 March 2019 as Brexit date. May says if Ken Clarke and Iain Duncan Smith can unite in backing the deal, it must be a good one. The Conservative Jeremy Lefroy asks when we will get a clear picture of what the transition will look like. May says, if the European council agrees to move talks on to phase two, the transition arrangements could be agreed before the end of March. May suggests transition agreement might not be agreed until the end of March. Here is the full text of May’s opening statement. https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-eu-negotiations-11-december-2017 Sky’s Jon Craig points out that Damian Green, the first secretary of state, is not in the chamber for May’s statement. Green has tweeted a response - presumably to make the point he has not been sacked! Alberto Costa, a Conservative, says he wanted an assurance that his parents, who are Italian, would not lose their rights. He thanks May for honouring her promises on this. Huw Merriman, a Conservative, asks when the eight-year period during which the European court of justice continues to adjudicate on certain cases relating to citizens’ rights starts. On the withdrawal date, or from the end of the transition? May says it is from the Brexit date. Labour’s Heidi Alexander quotes a freight handler on the news last week saying you are either in the customs union or you are not. It is like being pregnant; you either are or you are not, he said. You either require customs checks or you do not, she says. May says she does not accept the analogy. May says any regulatory “alignment” referred to in paragraph 49 (see 3.49pm) will not involve Northern Ireland being in the single market or the customs union. Labour’s Stephen Kinnock says paragraph 96 of the deal makes it clear the financial settlement is conditional on the withdrawal agreement, not a future trade deal. May says that is not her understanding. She says it is clear at the start of last week’s report that the payments are conditional on trade too. Paragraph 96 refers to the future relationship, she says. (See 11.08am for a bit more on this issue.) May says the UK will not pay for “access” to the EU in the future. But it may continue to pay to participate in certain EU programmes. Antoinette Sandbach, a Conservative, congratulates May for acting in the national interest. The DUP’s Ian Paisley quotes the European parliament Guy Verhofstadt as complaining about protestants in the DUP (although be pronounces his name so oddly that it is not immediately clear who he was talking about). He says the DUP were speaking up for the whole of Northern Ireland. Shailesh Vara, a Conservative, says May should publish details of how much money the UK is saving as a result of not being in the EU. Labour’s Stephen Timms asks for confirmation that the jurisdiction of the European court of justice will apply during the transition. May says the UK will continue to have a relationship with the EU during the transition. Andrew Bridgen, a Conservative, says the fact that the UK will not pay the divorce bill if there is no deal will focus minds in the EU. May says she is optimistic for a good deal. Peter Bone, a Conservative, asks May to confirm that the UK will be leaving the EU on 29 March 2019 and that that will be in the withdrawal bill. May says the UK will be leaving then. She says Labour is not committed to that date. (She does not confirm that the date will be in the bill, although her press spokesman did earlier. See 2.53pm.) Labour’s Wes Streeting asks about paragraph 49. (See 3.49pm.) Does this mean May has closed the door on a “disastrous no deal scenario”. May says she remains of the view that no deal is better than a bad deal. Labour’s Seema Malhotra asks about the chemicals industry. She quotes this story. May says these are matters for negotiation in phase two. Labour’s Mike Gapes asks when the legislation for the withdrawal agreement will come to the UK. May says the bill will come to the Commons when it is ready. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, has said he wants that agreed by October, she says. Philip Davies, a Conservative, asks why May is paying billions to the EU not legally owed. May says the offer is in the context of a future deal. But we are a country that honours our debts, she says. Labour’s Stephen Doughty asks how May knows that significant savings will be made after Brexit. What are they, and will she publish details? May says the UK will save by not paying into the EU budget. John Bercow, the speaker, says 27 backbenchers have asked questions. Another 57 want to get in, he says. He urges people to ask short questions. Labour’s Stella Creasy asks why her constituents are not getting freedom of movement after Brexit while people in Northern Ireland are getting this. May says the common travel area has existed for Ireland since 1923. David Jones, a Tory Brexiter, congratulates the PM. He asks May if she will ensure money is spent upgrading customs infrastructure. May says £3bn was set aside in the budget for Brexit planning. HMRC is putting plans in place for customs after Brexit. The Labour MP Chris Leslie has tweeted about May’s response to his question. Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, asks how what May said to Leigh about regulatory autonomy is consistent with what the deal says about regulatory alignment in Ireland. May says the point is that the UK parliament will get to decide what it wants to do. Labour’s Chuka Umunna says senior civil servants have been told not to commit in writing any estimate of the impact of Brexit on their sectors. Is that true, and if so why? No, says May. It is not true. May rejects claims civil servants have been ordered not to write memos about the impact of Brexit on sectors of the economy. Sir Edward Leigh, a Conservative, says May with her “calm, true grit” has shown that Brexit can be done. Will May confirm that after Brexit the UK will have “full regulatory autonomy”? May says that is the whole point. Nick Boles, a Conservative, says May’s performance was “worthy of Geoffrey Boycott”. He asks May to confirm that the payments will be made over 20 or 30 years. He asks for an assurance that she will not be handing over some humungous cheque. May says the report says the payments will be made as they fall due, unless otherwise determined. Labour’s Chris Leslie asks what “full alignment” means. The Sunday papers said No 10 was selling it to Boris Johnson as meaningless. May says it is about achieving the same objectives by different means. It covers six areas referred to in the Belfast agreement. Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Westminster, says DUP MPs agree the Friday document was significantly better than the Monday one. Will May confirm that Northern Ireland will not be separated from the rest of the UK? May says she is grateful for the contributions made by the DUP. (One suspects she did not feel that way on Monday afternoon.) Nicky Morgan, a Tory pro-European, thanks May for the deal, and for what it promises on citizens’ rights. Labour’s Pat McFadden says David Davis committed the government to getting the “exact same benefits” from Brexit as it gets from single market membership. Does May agree with Michael Gove that, if the public don’t like the final deal, they can change their minds? May says she does not agree with the interpretation of what Gove said. She says the government will not allow a second referendum. Labour’s Alison McGovern asks when the cabinet last discussed their objectives for a final trade deal. May says the cabinet has had a number of discussions covering Brexit. Sir Bill Cash, a Conservative, says there is an outbreak of unity on the Tory benches. But there are still serious matters to be resolved. She says Labour has demonstrated a “complete inconsistency on every point of principle and detail”. They are a national disgrace, he says. This is from the Spectator’s James Forsyth. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, says May should invite Labour to join her government because Labour and the Tories basically agree on Brexit. May says she does not agree. Anna Soubry, the Tory pro-European, says there is “complete unanimity” on her side in congratulating the PM. Does May expect to have details of the future trade deal by the autumn? Or will it just be heads of agreement? May says she expects to see details, although she says the UK will not be able to sign an actual trade deal until it is a third country, after Brexit. Labour’s Mary Creagh asks how May will get a good deal if she cannot even get David Davis to agree with her. May says the whole cabinet is behind the deal. Her party if “of one accord”, she says. Labour is not. The SNP’s Joanna Cherry says part of the agreement reflects an amendment that she tabled that the government voted against. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit committee, says paragraph 49 (see 3.49pm) is the most important part of the deal. Can May confirm that this commitment will apply even if there is no trade deal with the EU? May explains what paragraph 49 says. The “alignment” clause is a last resort, she says. The Tory Brexiter Iain Duncan Smith congratulates May on the deal. He says the two-year period after Brexit will be an “implementation” period. Can May assure him that is what it will be? It won’t just be a case of carrying on with no change? May says Duncan Smith is right. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, asks for a firm commitment from May that there will be no return to a hard border. She says the government had to rewrite the agreement to suit the DUP. We really have to wonder who is running the UK? Is it Arlene Foster or [May]? He says any special arrangements for Northern Ireland must be available for the rest of the UK. May says she has already confirmed in the Commons that there will be no hard border. She describes that as a “guarantee”. She says Northern Ireland is in a different position to Scotland. It has a hard border with the EU. Ken Clarke, the Tory pro-European, congratulates May on her triumph last week. This provokes cheering. (MPs are surprised.) Then comes the catch; Clarke says he has never known a deal like this followed by aides briefing that it is not binding. May thanks Clarke for his “positive comments”. May is responding to Corbyn. She says she set out clearly in her Lancaster House speech what her objectives were. Meanwhile, Labour has had 12 different Brexit plans. Corbyn cannot even reach alignment with himself, she says. She says the UK is leaving the EU on 29 March 2019. She says a financial settlement has been agreed. The calculations put that at worth £35bn to £39bn, she says. May confirms Brexit deal will cost UK £35bn to £39bn. She says this offer is “off the table” if the UK and the EU do not agree a future partnership. May says UK’s “Brexit bill” payment is conditional on EU agreeing a “future partnership”. She says alignment means having the same objectives. She says she and the Irish PM want to ensure the overall trade deal results in there being no hard border. She says Labour’s approach to Brexit would mean continued payments to the EU forever, no control over laws applying to the UK and no control over borders. Jeremy Corbyn is responding to May now. He says the UK has only just scraped through phase one. He says Labour respects the results of the referendum. He asks for clarification regarding the “Brexit bill” and the role of the European court of justice. And he asks for clarification about regulatory “alignment”, as spelt out in the agreement. (See 3.49pm.) He asks about the Brexit deadline. Will May drop the Brexit deadline from the EU withdrawal bill. It is more important to get the negotiation right than to hit a deadline, he says. Corbyn suggests he would be happy to see Brexit deadline slip. He asks if the government is still committed to maintaining the “exact same benefits” as the UK gets from single market membership. And he says he has left the hardest question to last; can May explain exactly what David Davis meant when he said Britain wanted a deal amounting to “Canada plus, plus, plus.” May is now winding up. I have always been clear that this was never going to be an easy process. It has required give and take for the UK and the EU to move forwards together. And that is what we have done. Of course, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. But there is, I believe, a new sense of optimism now in the talks and I fully hope and expect that we will confirm the arrangements I have set out today in the European Council later this week. She says it is good news for those who voted leave, who were worried that the process was getting bogged down and that Brexit would not happen. And says she it is good news for those who voted remain, because it shows that the UK will not crash out without a deal. May claims Brexit deal is “good news” for both remain supporters and leave supporters. May says if a new partnership with the EU is not possible, the government will take special steps to ensure there is no hard border in Ireland. She refers to paragraph 49 in the document (pdf). The United Kingdom remains committed to protecting North-South cooperation and to its guarantee of avoiding a hard border. Any future arrangements must be compatible with these overarching requirements. The United Kingdom’s intention is to achieve these objectives through the overall EU-UK relationship. Should this not be possible, the United Kingdom will propose specific solutions to address the unique circumstances of the island of Ireland. In the absence of agreed solutions, the United Kingdom will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the allisland economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement. May says the government will uphold the Belfast agreement in full. The report reaffirms the guarantee that there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. She says it was right to take time to listen to the concerns of the DUP. And on Friday she made six commitments to Northern Ireland, she says. On finance, May says after tough negotiations there has been a deal. She says the agreement to carry on paying will be conditional on various factors. And this part of the report is subject to the principle nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. She says these are the actions of a responsible nation, honouring its obligations. She says the taxpayer will soon see “significant savings” compared to being in the EU. There will be extra money for education, housing and the NHS. Theresa May says she wants to update MPs on the Brexit talks. On the basis of a report published last week, Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, has said he will recommend moving the talks on to phase two. She praises David Davis, the Brexit secretary, and the whole negotiating team for the “calm and professional” approach they adopted. She summarises the agreement. Starting with the rights of citizens, she says this has been a priority. But for these rights to be reciprocal, they have to be interpreted consistently. Originally the EU wanted the rights to be guaranteed by the European court of justice, she says. That was unacceptable. She says instead the rights will be guaranteed by the withdrawal agreement (UK law) and protected by UK courts, paying due regard to EU case law. This generates some jeering, but May says this principle applies in other areas of law too. She says courts will be able to refer cases voluntarily to the ECJ to adjudication on points of law. But this right will only last for eight years. Theresa May is about to start her Commons statement on the Brexit deal. Anti-Brexit campaigner have been protesting in London and Brussels today. Here are some pictures from London. And Natalie Bennett, the former Green party leader, was speaking at the Brussels event. According to extracts released in advance, she called for a second referendum. She said: The Leave side in the 2016 EU referendum failed to present a clear vision of what Brexit would mean, and the complex range of possibilities make it clear that the only democratic way to proceed is a ratification referendum once the terms of the proposed Brexit have been agreed. That’s what the Green party has been calling for since soon after the initial vote, and it is a call that is winning increasing backing from a wide range of political actors. That ratification referendum must include the possibility of the United Kingdom remaining as part of the EU. Recent weeks have revealed just how inadequate the debate during the 2017 vote was in informing the public about the issues, such as the Ireland/Northern Ireland border, which many have said they’ve only just become aware of. Theresa May has written an open letter to EU nationals living in the UK urging them to stay after Brexit. Posted on her Facebook page in the wake of the UK-EU Brexit deal agreed last week, it starts: As prime minister of the United Kingdom, I am proud that more than three million EU citizens have chosen to make your homes and livelihoods here in our country. I greatly value the depth of the contributions you make - enriching every part of our economy, our society, our culture and our national life. I know our country would be poorer if you left and I want you to stay. Here are the main points from the Number 10 lobby briefing. Downing Street said the government would accept amendments tabled to the EU withdrawal bill giving the Commons new rights to demand votes when ministers use Henry VIII powers to rewrite law. (See 2.05pm.) The prime minister’s spokesman would not say if the government would oppose another amendment to the EU withdrawal bill promising MPs a “truly meaningful vote” on Britain’s final EU deal. The amendment has been tabled by Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general, and is due to be put to a vote on Wednesday. The spokesman’s comments suggest the government may be planning some form of concession in the face of possible defeat. The spokesman said the government was still committed to the amendment to the bill putting 29 March 2019 on the face of the bill as the date of Brexit. Some Tory MPs are opposed to this, and there were hints a few weeks ago that the government could drop the amendment rather than risk defeat. Now Number 10 still seems confident it will win when the issue is put to a vote next Wednesday. Theresa May told cabinet ministers this morning that members of the public think the Brexit deal agreed last week means “we’re on our way” in relation to Brexit. Discussing today’s cabinet meeting, the spokesman said: Cabinet ministers said that in the wake of Friday’s announcement they had received a positive response from people who had voted both leave and remain. The prime minister said she believed the view of the public from her own constituency engagements over the weekend was “we’re on our way”. By amazing coincidence, this is exactly the same form of words used by the Daily Mail (May’s favourite newspaper, and her press secretary’s former employer) in its splash headline on Saturday. When asked if May was reflecting the views not of her constituents but of the Mail, the spokesman insisted “the PM was reflecting the views of constituents she met”. The spokesman played down claims that the government did not see the UK-EU Brexit deal as legally binding. The spokesman confirmed that last Friday’s document represented a political agreement and would not have legal status until the signing of the final withdrawal agreement. But he said it reflected a political commitment, and he implied that this meant it was not open to doubt. He said: We are clear that the agreement that was reached will be taken forward .... As [David Davis on LBC] was expressing, nobody should be in any doubt about our sincerity. The spokesman said that the Cabinet Office report into Damian Green will not be published today. The communities department will later today publish a Grenfell Tower buildings safety package. I’m just back from lobby. And - unusually - Number 10 had a story to announce: the government is accepting the amendment to the EU withdrawal bill tabled by the procedure committee last week giving the Commons the power to demand votes when ministers want to amend the law using secondary legislation. As I explained on the blog last week, at the moment most secondary legislation gets passed at the stroke of a pen, without MPs getting a vote. This has become a big issue in relation to the EU withdrawal bill because it will give ministers extensive new powers (the so-called Henry VIII powers) to incorporate EU law into UK law this way. Amendments tabled by the Conservative MP Charles Walker, chair of the Commons procedure committee, would create a “sifting committee” which would have the job of going through all the statutory instruments passed under the EU withdrawal bill (up to 1,000, ministers expect) and identifying important ones which would have to be debated by MPs. This is not a big surprise. Many Tory MPs, as well as the opposition, have been calling for a mechanism of this kind and if the government had not accepted amendments of this kind, it would probably have been defeated on Wednesday night, when the Walker amendments will be put to a vote. As the Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn reports, the European commission has admitted that the UK-EU Brexit deal agreed next week is not legally binding. That is because it is intended as the precursor to a withdrawal agreement that would be legally binding. I’m off to the Number 10 lobby briefing now. I’ll post again after 1.45pm. UPDATE: Here’s a fuller quote. Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader and shadow culture secretary, gave a speech this morning at the publication of a report from the Future of Work commission he set up. My colleague Anushka Asthana covered its main conclusions in a story overnight. Here are some of the key lines from Watson’s speech. Watson said automation could enhance jobs, not destroy them. The commission has looked hard at the evidence about what is likely to happen to the world of work in the future – both with the right interventions and without them. It has found that many more tasks are likely to be automated in future – but that this can enhance our jobs, not destroy them. The tasks that are less vulnerable to automation involve our most human qualities: creativity, care, teamwork, critical thinking and imagination ... Our report found that the most apocalyptic predictions about the impact automation will have on jobs are far too pessimistic. We believe automation and artificial intelligence can, with the right policy framework around it, create as many jobs as it destroys. He said automation could help productivity. The problem the UK has at the moment is not that we have too many robots, but too few. That is why our report calls for 3.5% of GDP to be spent on R&amp;D by 2030, and within that a much higher element dedicated to technology. We recommend fixing it as a percentage of GDP. He said automation needed to be accompanied by policies enhancing workers’ rights. This debate looks as if it’s about technology, but like so many other political debates it’s really about power. And, again like so many other political debates, it is about political choices. If technology is used – as it can be – to increase employers’ power over workers, to keep wages down and to accumulate more profits in ever fewer hands, then it will not enhance the quality of work or people’s quality of life. We saw too many examples in our research this year of technology becoming a new tool of worker exploitation. New forms of workplace surveillance. Shift management systems that suit employers but make it impossible for workers to be sure of when they can spend time with their families. App-based businesses who insist that their staff are self-employed, even though to any fair-minded observer they are regular employees. Which is why we need policies that increase workers’ rights, and their bargaining power, alongside investment in new technology. This report recommends not just regularising employment rights by moving towards a single category of “worker” in UK law, but developing new rights – a right to flexible working, a right to information and consultation, a right to take leave for learning and developing new skills. He said politicians should focus on the concept of “good work”. He said: As technology changes the world of work, the job of politicians and policymakers is to ensure that we generate and protect good work. Work that pays, yes, but also work that provides dignity and security, that respects people’s autonomy and choices, and allows them to exercise their creativity and judgement. That kind of work should be available to everyone – not just to those on the highest incomes. And where it isn’t, we have to focus on how we make it so. It’s not enough to pay lip service to the aspiration. We need to understand the components of good work, prioritise it, create it, measure it, and encourage fresh thinking about how to safeguard it through the age of technology. So that it means something for the many, not the few. That’s why the commission is suggesting a charter for good work, which sets out principles that should be put at the heart of public policymaking to make sure that we look at the quality of jobs, not just the quantity. Watson stressed that the commission recommendations are not party policy, but the report does give some indication as to where party thinking on this subject is heading. Since David Davis’s brainpower has become a talking point (see 11.08am), here is the Tory MP Andrew Mitchell (a close friend of his) saying, actually, he is very clever. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has been outlining Labour’s policy on the single market and customs union at an event in London, and it’s fair to say there’s still some constructive ambiguity going on. Asked whether his opposition to the UK remaining in the single market after Brexit was tougher than Keir Starmer’s view, the shadow chancellor said he and the shadow Brexit secretary were in full agreement. He said: What I said was, remaining in the single market would not respect the referendum result. But we’ve been using the phraseology ‘a single market’, not ‘the single market’ and ‘a customs union’ and not ‘the customs union’. Therefore a reformed single market or a new negotiated relationship with the single market. And Keir was exactly putting our position yesterday. We want to be as close as we possibly can to ensure a tariff-free access. It isn’t just about semantics, it’s about achieving the objectives that we want overall, which is protecting the economy and protecting jobs. The event was primarily for McDonnell to introduce an outside report commissioned by Labour (pdf) into how investment in the economy could work better. A key element in the report is to improve the current bias which sees so much money flow into London and the south-east of England. The report says a new national investment bank under Labour should be based in Birmingham, along with some parts of the Bank of England, and with satellite offices in Glasgow, Belfast, Cardiff, Newcastle and Plymouth. Asked if this could meant the bank leaving its historic Threadneedle Street headquarters in London McDonnell said this was all up to further reports, but did not reject it. Asked about the idea of parliament sitting outside London, McDonnell said this was “slightly beyond my remit” but said he would support “cabinet and maybe sessions of parliament” being held elsewhere. Lucy Fisher, one of the Times’s reporters who wrote the Times splash that David Davis was so rude about (see 10.01am), says that Davis’s claim about being misreported is “disingenuous”. The Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable was on Radio 4 earlier urging Labour backbenchers to support an amendment to the EU repeal bill which would oblige the UK to remain within the single market and customs union after Brexit. Cable told Today that while official Labour policy was “pretty ambiguous” their current stance – to leave the two arrangements but try to mimic their benefits outside – seemed very similar to that sought by the government. Many Labour members and MPs took a different view, he said: We know that large numbers of Labour backbenchers do support Britain remaining within the single market and the customs union and feel the government made a mistake by ruling that out, and we hope that a lot of those Labour people, and maybe even some Conservatives, will support it. The Lib Dem amendment, due to be voted on tomorrow, seems unlikely to pass, but it’s a chance for Cable to remind voters of his party’s distinct Brexit stance. Simon Coveney, the Irish deputy prime minister, has also welcomed David Davis’s clarification. Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, has welcomed David Davis’s clarification of what he said yesterday (see 10.01am), Sky’s Darren McCaffrey reports. Here is a summary of all the points from David Davis’s interview on LBC. Davis, the Brexit secretary, retracted the suggestion he made yesterday that the UK could back out of the commitments it had made on the Irish border. He said his comments had been misinterpreted. (See 10.01am.) He said that Philip Hammond, the chancellor, was wrong when he told MPs last week that the UK should pay a “Brexit bill” even if it did not get a trade deal. Asked about this, Davis said: I’m afraid the chancellor slightly misspoke ... It says at the beginning of the thing nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. It’s a classical European Union thing. They put it in every treaty. They put it there, not us. It’s about paragraph 5, I think. [See 10.22am.] In his LBC interview Davis said the “Brexit bill” payments were conditional on their being a Brexit deal, but he did not specify what deal. This is key because there will be at least two deals: a withdrawal agreement, and a trade agreement. On the Andrew Marr Show yesterday Davis said the payment was conditional on their being a transition deal and a “trade outcome”. But Will Straw, who was executive director of Britain Stronger in Europe, used Twitter to argue that the “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed” principle only covers the need for a withdrawal agreement. Although the UK government says it wants to conclude a trade deal before Brexit takes place in March 2019, the EU says the trade deal will take much longer to finalise. In draft negotiating guidelines released by the European council on Friday (pdf), the council just said that it expected trade to be covered by “a political declaration accompanying the withdrawal agreement” (ie, something quite different from a proper trade deal) in the period before Brexit. Davis dismissed suggestions that an open border between the Republic and Northern Ireland could allow illegal immigrants into the UK. Asked about this, he said: That would be a very hard way to get into Britain. You would have to be a fairly dumb people smuggler to come that way. He said the EU had never put a figure on the divorce bill. But he claimed that the sum had come down from €100bn, the sum quoted in a Financial Times story in the spring about the EU’s opening demand (paywall). He claimed that he did not need to be clever to do his job. Being able to stay calm was the key quality, he said. When asked about the qualities needed to do the job, he said: What’s the requirement of my job? I don’t have to be very clever. I don’t have to know that much. I just do have to be calm. He said he could not drink orange juice. This came out when asked about the breakfast meeting in Brussels on Friday. He said he was told there was champagne at the breakfast. He did not see it, he said; he just saw the orange juice. You probably don’t know, I can’t drink orange juice. It’s poison to me. It’s my Kryptonite. Northern Ireland secretary James Brokenshire has said Friday’s border deal is not legally binding but it was a “solid commitment”by the UK to resolve the conundrum caused by Brexit. He appeared on Irish radio in a bid to repair damage to Anglo Irish relations caused by Brexit secretary David Davis and other Brexiters who said over the weekend the deal on Ireland was merely a statement of intent with no legal effect. As Theresa May prepares her update to parliament, he said that the taoiseach and the European Commission had agreed “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed” and this was clearly set out in paragraph 5 of the agreement. But Brokenshire told RTE’s Morning Ireland that the same paragraph also stated that the “joint commitments set out below in this joint report shall be reflected in the withdrawal agreement in full detail” and this was a “firm commitment that we want to pursue”. He went on: I think this has given us a really solid way in which we can now approach the second phase of negotiations, with confidence. I am sure that is a positive message that the PM will be giving in parliament today as she provides her update. In his LBC interview David Davis (see 10.01am), the Brexit secretary, said the UK was “quite certain” it could avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, even if it does not get a free trade deal that it believes would obviate the need for such a border. Davis said: What is most symbolic [of the preservation of the peace process] is the absence of a hard border, the absence of border posts, and that sort of thing. And we are quite certain we can do that by technical and other means, even if we end up without a deal with the European Union. It is worth pointing out that the European commission does not agree. In its own commentary (pdf) on the UK-EU Brexit deal, it is unusually blunt about this. It says” Whilst the United Kingdom remains committed to protecting and supporting continued NorthSouth cooperation across the full range of contexts and frameworks, including after withdrawal, the common understanding provides that the United Kingdom aims to achieve this protection and the avoidance of a hard border through the overall EU-United Kingdom relationship. This intention seems hard to reconcile with the United Kingdom’s communicated decision to leave the internal market and the Customs Union. Yesterday, in an interview on the Andrew Marr Show, David Davis, the Brexit secretary, alarmed the Irish government by appearing to say that assurances about the Irish border given by the UK government in the UK-EU Brexit deal were not legally binding. The full transcript is here (pdf), and here is the key quote. One of the things I’ve always said, is we want to protect the peace process and we also want to protect Ireland from the impact of Brexit for them. So we – you know – this was a statement of intent more than anything else. It was much more a statement of intent than it was a legally enforceable thing. That final sentence - “it was much more a statement of intent than it was a legally enforceable thing” - seemed pretty clear. Crucially, Davis’s interview also coincided with some Sunday newspapers claiming that No 10 officials were privately telling Tory Brexiters that some parts of the agreement had no legal force. For example, Edward Malnick in the Sunday Telegraph (paywall) A senior Eurosceptic with knowledge of the discussions involving cabinet ministers, including Mr Johnson and Mr Gove, told The Telegraph that No 10 had said a commitment to “full alignment” between the UK and the EU “doesn’t mean anything in EU law”. A separate source confirmed that a specific cabinet minister had been told by No 10 aides that the provision was “meaningless” and was simply included to secure Ireland’s approval for the document. That helps to explain why the Davis interview was seen as evidence that Theresa May signed off the Brexit deal with her fingers crossed behind her back. On LBC this morning Davis staged a full retreat, camouflaged by an attack on newspapers which he claimed had misreported what he said. Asked about today’s Times splash, he said: I’ve never seen a more convoluted piece in a newspaper. What I actually said yesterday, in terms, was we want to protect the peace process, we want to protect Ireland from the impact of Brexit for them. And I said this was a statement of intent which was much more than just legally enforceable. In other words, of course it is legally enforceable under the withdrawal agreement. But even if that did not happen for some reason, [if] something went wrong, we would still be seeking to provide a frictionless, invisible border with Ireland. They’ve completely twisted my words, I’m afraid. What we’re saying is, this bit of it, the bit about full alignment argument, on the issues which affect the peace process and the Belfast agreement, we would look to that anyway because one of our absolute underpinning aims is to ensure that Ireland, and particularly the Northern Ireland peace process, is not harmed. And what is most symbolic in that is the absence of a hard border, the absence of border posts, and that sort of thing. And we are quite certain we can do that by technical and other means, even if we end up without a deal with the European Union. When Nick Ferrari, the presenter, challenged Davis by quoting his actual words from the Marr interview at him, Davis said that he had said “much more than legally enforceable” (although that was not the exact phrase he used on Marr). He said there had been “a slight misquote”, although it was not clear if by that he meant that he had slightly misspoken when he was on the Andrew Marr Show yesterday or if he was accusing Ferrari of misquoting him. (Reading the Marr transcript, it is fairly clear to me that, if Davis did intend to make the point he is making this morning, then he expressed himself very poorly, because he appeared to say the opposite of what he intended.) Davis repeated the point again on LBC. He said: Of course it’s legally enforceable ... It’s more than legally enforceable. In the event that the withdrawal agreement does not happen, then we would still be seeking to maintain an invisible border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. That was the point. I was making the point that it was much more than just in the treaty; it’s what we want to do anyway. Davis normally adopts a jaunty manner in interviews, but this morning his enforced jollity was very marked. And he was speaking very quickly. It sounded as if he was nervous, knowing that he had messed up a bit yesterday and had a damage-limitation exercise to perform. Here are some more lines from the David Davis interview on LBC. The tweets are from LBC’s Theo Usherwood and the BBC’s Chris Mason. I will post a fuller summary, with the proper quotes, soon. As with a modernist poem, or holy scripture, the meaning of the UK-EU Brexit deal agreed at the end of last week is not universally agreed. In fact, it is subject to wildly differing, or even contradictory, interpretations. As far as the Irish government was concerned, and in the eyes of some commentators, it was legally robust, and it meant the UK was turning away from hard Brexit. But No 10 aides were reportedly claiming that some bits of it were “meaningless” in legal terms, and David Davis, the Brexit secretary, yesterday said it was a “statement of intent” rather than something legally enforceable. Theresa May will be under pressure to clarify all of this when she gives a statement to MPs about the deal this afternoon. The session is expected to last for a good two hours and EU leaders, who have yet to take the final decision about opening trade talks with the UK (they are due to do so at the EU summit starting on Thursday) will be listening closely. According to extracts released in advance, May will tell MPs that her plans are “not about a hard or a soft Brexit”. She will say: This is not about a hard or a soft Brexit. The arrangements we have agreed to reach the second phase of the talks are entirely consistent with the principles and objectives that I set out in my speeches in Florence and at Lancaster House. I know that some doubted we would reach this stage. I have always been clear that this was never going to be an easy process. It has required give and take for the UK and the EU to move forwards together. And that is what we have done. Of course, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. Davis is currently giving an interview to LBC seeking to clarify some of what he said on the Andrew Marr Show yesterday. In his opening answer, he tried to patch up the rift with Dublin opened up by what he said yesterday. I will summarise the interview soon. Here is the agenda for the day. 10.45am: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, launches Labour’s interim Financing Investment report. As Sarah Bosely reports, it will float the idea of moving parts of the Bank of England to Birmingham, 11.15am: Theresa May chairs cabinet. (Cabinet normally meets on Tuesdays, but May is on a visit tomorrow.) 1.15pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. 2pm: Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP and co-chair of the Jo Cox Loneliness Commission, gives a speech. As Anushka Asthana reports, she will argue that loneliness should be added to the list of great social evils identified by William Beveridge. 3.30pm: Theresa May is due to give her statement to MPs about the Brexit deal.

He said he challenged Abbott two years ago because Abbott was not providing the economic leadership Australia needed and he was not treating cabinet properly. Turnbull said his government had turned things around in the past two years, with unemployment falling to its lowest level since January 2013, business confidence hitting its highest level in 20 years and cabinet now working like it used to under the former prime minister John Howard. He said he wished he did not cite the loss of “30 Newspolls in a row” because that was not the reason why Abbott had to go. “I do regret having said it,” Turnbull admitted on Monday, during a live internet radio interview with NewsCorp columnist Miranda Devine. “Only because it allowed people to focus on that, rather than the substantive reasons [for my challenge]. The substantive reasons that I stated were related to economic leadership and governance. “I don’t believe in captain’s calls. I believe in using the system of cabinet, which John Howard used so well, to make decisions.” Last week’s Newspoll was the 24th consecutive Newspoll in which the Coalition has trailed Labor. Turnbull’s critics are increasingly pointing to his run of consecutive Newspoll losses to say his time is running out – by his own metric. Turnbull said he did not think Abbott was a “difficult problem” for him but he would not be inviting Abbott back into cabinet. “I’m focused on bringing new, younger people into the cabinet and ministry,” he said. He would not speculate on who may be promoted in a reshuffle over the summer break. He declined to say if Christian Porter would replace the attorney general, George Brandis, if Brandis decided to resign. “Everyone wants prime ministers to speculate about reshuffles and prime ministers never do,” he said. “The ministers are all doing a fantastic job.” Both the recent Newspoll and the Fairfax-Ipsos poll have Labor ahead of the Coalition on the two-party preferred measure, 53% to the Coalition’s 47%. Last month’s Guardian Essential poll had Labor ahead 54% to 46%. The Ipsos poll also recorded 71% support for the idea that prime ministers should be allowed to govern for a full term, rather than being turfed out in leadership contests prior to elections. The Fairfax-Ipsos poll contained questions about preferred leaders for the Liberal party and the survey had the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, ranked ahead of Turnbull as the most popular choice, with 32% support compared to Turnbull’s 29%. Abbott polled at 14%, favoured conservative choice Peter Dutton at 5% and the treasurer, Scott Morrison, at 4%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/12/annastacia-palaszczuk-to-officially-veto-adani-railway-loan-after-swearing-in","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T17:00:10Z","webTitle":"Annastacia Palaszczuk to officially veto Adani railway loan after swearing in","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/12/annastacia-palaszczuk-to-officially-veto-adani-railway-loan-after-swearing-in","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/12/annastacia-palaszczuk-to-officially-veto-adani-railway-loan-after-swearing-in","fields":{"headline":"Annastacia Palaszczuk to officially veto Adani railway loan after swearing in","bodyText":"The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, will move to officially veto any loan to the Indian mining company Adani from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, as soon as she and her new government are sworn into office. After almost two weeks of vote-counting, Labor was declared the winner of the 25 November poll on Friday, returning to parliament with a majority for the first time under Palaszczuk’s leadership. A letter confirming the Adani veto, which marked a turning point in Labor’s campaign, will be sent to the prime minister immediately after Queensland’s governor swears in the new state government on Tuesday. “The premier will send the letter the Turnbull government actioning her 3 November announcement to use her government’s veto power to block the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility loan for the Adani rail project,” a spokeswoman for Palaszczuk said. “Adani have previously said that the project’s mine and rail components had been given the ‘green light’ to proceed.” The move to veto the Naif loan has frustrated the federal government, particularly the minister for resources and northern Australia, Matt Canavan, who last week told News Corp the Queensland government decision was motivated by “xenophobia” and “racisim”, comments Bill Shorten’s office labelled “unhinged”. Palaszczuk announced the veto at the end of a fraught first week of campaigning, which included numerous ambushes from anti-Adani protesters, after learning of what she said was a planned “smear campaign”. Palaszczuk said she had learnt political opponents planned to use her partner Shaun Drabsch’s work with PwC preparing Adani’s application for the Naif loan as proof of a conflict of interest, so she had decided to outright block the loan. She further vowed to stop all direct taxpayer funds going to the mine and its associated infrastructure. Labor remains officially supportive of the mine itself although, privately, members have expressed scepticism Adani will receive the funding necessary to make it a reality. But the veto was seen as instrumental in saving south-east Queensland seats, particularly those in Brisbane, where preferences from the Greens proved crucial in deciding electorates. That cost the LNP, with the biggest scalp coming in the form of the former Newman government minister Scott Emerson, who lost his seat to Queensland’s first Greens MP, Michael Berkman. That has led to soul-searching within the Queensland opposition, which is about to undergo a leadership spill, following Tim Nicholls’s decision to step down as leader. The LNP’s current deputy, Deb Frecklington, remains frontrunner for the position, although former leader John-Paul Langbroek has also thrown his hat into the ring, with a LNP backbencher, Mark Robinson, making it a three-point contest. Frecklington has Nicholl’s endorsement and her choice of deputy, Tim Mander, brings many of the party’s Christian right votes, which is seen as giving her the edge. The LNP is expected to vote on its new leadership team on Tuesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/11/sexual-abuse-survivors-fear-being-deserted-after-royal-commission-ends","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T17:07:13Z","webTitle":"Sexual abuse survivors fear being 'deserted' after royal commission ends","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/11/sexual-abuse-survivors-fear-being-deserted-after-royal-commission-ends","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/11/sexual-abuse-survivors-fear-being-deserted-after-royal-commission-ends","fields":{"headline":"Sexual abuse survivors fear being 'deserted' after royal commission ends","bodyText":"Survivors of sexual abuse and their advocates have spoken of their fears of being left in the lurch once the child abuse royal commission’s work officially draws to a close. On Friday the royal commissioners will deliver their final report to the governor general in Canberra, marking the end of their five-year inquiry into how abuse was able to occur in more than 4,000 Australian institutions. Dr Judy Courtin, a lawyer who has represented dozens of survivors and their families, said that through public hearings and private sessions the commission had shown people that their stories of abuse were believed, and that they were not to blame. It would be tough for many survivors once that focus ended, she said. “It’s like having a favourite aunty who you totally trust and believe in, and they back and support you, and then suddenly they’re not there,” Courtin said. “There is a risk people will just feel deserted.” The commission had been a valuable source of support for legal professionals too, Courtin said, being an authority where submissions about abuse and failures of organisations could be referred for further investigation. “People are losing a powerful ally in the commission,” she said. A spokesman for the social services minister, Christian Porter, told Guardian Australia supports for survivors and their families were encompassed in redress scheme legislation introduced in October, which includes access to counselling and psychological services. The legislation was referred to a Senate inquiry by the shadow social services minister, Jenny Macklin, over concerns about the opt-in nature of the scheme for institutions, and the amount of redress available being inadequate. The inquiry is due to report in March. In the meantime, “everyone will feel a sense of loss” once the commission’s work ended, said Leonie Sheedy, co-founder of the Care Leavers Australasia Network. “We have bonded with many of the commission staff and when they exit our lives that will be hard for many people,” she said. “We will even miss the security guard, who has been there for hearings from Melbourne to Ballarat and who greets us with a smile dressed in his lovely purple shirt. A lot of people have left the royal commission over the past two years as their work winds down and we had formed trust with many of them.” Paul Levey, a victim of the notorious paedophile priest Gerald Ridsdale, said he felt a similar sense of loss after travelling to Rome in 2016 to watch Cardinal George Pell give evidence. After Pell was declared by his doctor to be too unwell to fly to Australia to give evidence in person, a massive campaign erupted to raise money to fly survivors to Pell to watch his testimony. Comedian singer-songwriter Tim Minchin and radio personality Meshel Laurie helped to fuel the crowdfunding. Levey started a men’s support group for survivors of child sexual abuse in Sunbury, Victoria, because available counselling services could not cope with demand. “When we went to Rome there was a lot of support around us,” Levey said. “There was a lot of commotion … and it just exploded on us with the media and GoFundMe and everything like that. And then when we got home everyone sort of went their own way. I think that’s one of the things that a lot of people don’t realise about being in this situation you’re in. You have a group of people who are incredibly vulnerable and who are all survivors and … you’re all a support group for each other and you grow to love each other. But then [support drops away].” The royal commission’s final report will be tabled to government on 15 December.

Demonstrators gathered on the streets of Feijia village, about 12 miles northeast of Tiananmen Square, on Sunday for the small but rare rally condemning the eviction and demolition campaign. Activists say thousands of migrant workers have been forced from their homes in Beijing’s rundown periphery since late November when authorities intensified efforts to drive “low-end” migrant workers out of the city in the wake of a deadly tenement fire. Sunday’s protest was not reported in China’s Communist party controlled press but videos and photographs of the event spread online, with human rights campaigners cheering the scenes. “The ‘low population’ is hitting back,” tweeted Yaxue Cao, the editor of ChinaChange.org, an English-language human rights website. Footage showed crowds processing through the community, which is just north of the motorway leading to Beijing’s international airport and close to the 798 art district, itself the target of violent demolitions in the past. One group carried a white banner emblazoned with the phrase: “Baoli qugan qinfan renquan” - forced evictions violate human rights. Eli Friedman, a Cornell University academic who studies China’s labour movement, said the protest – which coincided with the international human rights day – appeared to be the first since Beijing’s recent crackdown began. The demonstration suggested Beijing may have miscalculated how much outrage would be caused by the “ferocity” of its campaign, which has seen once vibrant migrant communities reduced to rubble. Friedman, the author of a recent article about the evictions called Evicting the Underclass, predicted authorities would now move swiftly to ensure that the protest was nipped in the bud. “They have a very well-developed apparatus for responding [to this kind of protest] ... They do some divide and conquer [among protest leaders], they make some compromises, they pay a few people off … they might arrest a few people or sometimes even beat a few people up… But usually their repression is pretty targeted - they don’t do mass arrests in most cases - and they make the problem go away.” Friedman said it was certain that the protests would not be allowed to spread - particularly if they appeared to be contaminating “potentially politically explosive groups” such as students or the middle class. Even so, Chinese president Xi Jinping’s attempts to project himself as an all-powerful champion of China’s poor were likely to be undermined by the mass evictions. During visits to affected communities last week, several victims of the crackdown directly - and unusually - pointed the finger of blame at Xi. “I think what is happening is that ... Xi Jinping has water in his head,” said one angry migrant from Anhui province. Friedman said: “Given the scale people know that there is no way that [Beijing Communist party chief] Cai Qi or anyone in the Beijing municipal government would do something on this level without the approval of Xi Jinping.” “It’s clearly been a terrible PR exercise.” Additional reporting by Wang Zhen"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/12/australians-faith-in-system-of-government-waning-survey-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T23:15:44Z","webTitle":"Australians' faith in system of government waning, survey finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/12/australians-faith-in-system-of-government-waning-survey-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/12/australians-faith-in-system-of-government-waning-survey-finds","fields":{"headline":"Australians' faith in system of government waning, survey finds","bodyText":"A new survey on Australian attitudes to democracy suggests our faith in Australia’s system of government is waning, in the face of short-term, knee-jerk politics and a growing scepticism about whether politicians have voters’ interests at heart. A discussion paper released on Tuesday by the Centre for Policy Development concludes that 73% of Australians think politics is fixated on short-term gains and not on addressing long-term challenges. Only 34% thought politicians were good at making difficult decisions when representing their communities, and just 39% thought that parliaments were effective at tackling the major challenges facing their communities. The survey also paints a picture of a sceptical public. Two-thirds responded that politicians did not seem to be serving their interests, and 65% said they thought lobbyists had too much influence. The survey for the centre was undertaken by Essential in October 2017 and was based on an online panel of 1,025 respondents. It was overseen by Glenn Withers from Australian National University and sought to replicate similar polls undertaken in 1994 and 2015. Taken with the Lowy Institute’s finding in April this year that only 60% of Australia’s voting age population (and only 52% of 18- to 29-year-olds) believe that “democracy is preferable to any other kind of government”, the survey raises many concerns. But the good news out of the survey is that Australians are broadly in agreement on the way forward. Unlike the US where debate over “draining the swamp” has deteriorated into an all-out war between President Donald Trump and institutions such as media organisations, the FBI and Congress, Australians have an appetite for democratic renewal and substantial policy reform, the survey’s authors said. “Every day we’re reminded our democracy is struggling under the strain of new and old challenges,” said the centre’s chief executive, Travers McLeod. “The arduous and painful path to marriage equality despite broad public support is one example. The rolling crisis over the citizenship status of parliamentarians is another. “And this isn’t a temporary blip. For too many years we’ve been treading water while the big challenges of our time – climate change, inequality, the future of work, sustainable growth, and Australia’s place in the region – have gathered steam. We need better answers, and we don’t have any more time to lose.” Last month the former head of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet Terry Moran, who chairs the centre, gave a speech to senior public servants describing the state of policy advice in Canberra as being “in palliative care”. He also criticised a policy direction he had helped implement for the Rudd-Gillard governments – contracting out to the private sector the delivery of social services such as job search. “What’s clear from CPD’s research,” said Moran “is that Australians think reinvigorating our democracy is a pressing and overdue task. This is about improving the way the system works and ensuring that the best contemporary policy ideas rise to the top.” The report offers some clear signposts to both fixing the system and policy directions. It showed Australians strongly back reforms such as a federal anti-corruption commission (77%), a tougher code of conduct for MPs (79%), putting citizens on parliamentary committees (68%), fixed four-year parliamentary terms (58%), and giving public agencies more independence (55%). Unlike Americans, Australians want an active government that boosts equality and protects the most vulnerable, the survey found. Despite the constant talk of tax cuts, the survey found a majority – 61% – were willing to pay more tax in return for better services and improved infrastructure and are highly sceptical of outsourced human services. The report also drew on a focus group of 30 eminent Australians who assembled in Melbourne last month to discuss the challenges to democracy. “The importance of genuine citizen engagement in democracy and the policy making process was emphasised by the roundtable participants as one example of the paradox of Australia’s democracy [and parliamentarians] listening but not hearing,” the report said. “The postal survey for marriage equality provided ample evidence that Australians haven’t switched off,” the authors said. This week the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, warned against a repetition of the postal vote exercise as a way of devising policy. But the authors say people are interested in citizen engagement in the process, though probably by more modern forms of communication than the post. “There is a huge appetite for greater citizen involvement in policymaking whether it be through citizen juries or allowing citizens to serve on parliamentary committees, alongside politicians,” the paper said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/11/sandy-hook-families-post-video-on-how-to-spot-signs-of-potential-mass-shooting","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T19:07:08Z","webTitle":"Sandy Hook families post video on how to spot signs of potential mass shooting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/11/sandy-hook-families-post-video-on-how-to-spot-signs-of-potential-mass-shooting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/11/sandy-hook-families-post-video-on-how-to-spot-signs-of-potential-mass-shooting","fields":{"headline":"Sandy Hook families post video on how to spot signs of potential mass shooting","bodyText":"When 20 children and six educators were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, people across the US said: “Never again.” Instead, family members of victims have watched as a series of increasingly deadly mass shooting attacks have occurred at schools, churches, baseball practices and concerts. Each time, the grieving families have waited for the reports showing that the shooter had not simply snapped: that there were warning signs missed, red flags that got no response. To mark the fifth anniversary of the Sandy Hook shooting, a nonprofit founded by some of the family members of victims is releasing a new video with the message that it is possible to see the signs of a potential act of violence ahead of time – and that it is crucial to act on them. The new video ad follows Evan, a viral video released last year by Sandy Hook Promise, which said it received more than 150 million views. The new ad “does have an emotional gut punch”, said Nicole Hockley, one of the co-founders of Sandy Hook Promise, who lost her six-year-old son Dylan in the shooting. “We don’t want people to be comfortable around the subject of gun violence,” she said. Sandy Hook Promise has trained more than 2.5 million students and adults across the country in its “Know the Signs” programs, which it offers free of cost to local school districts. The programs are designed to help kids and adults recognize the signs of someone who might be at risk of harming themselves or others, and know how to report them to someone who will take action. The programs are continuing to expand to school districts across the country, and the new video is designed to raise money to continuing to fund the expansion of the trainings. Sandy Hook Promise, which does not represent all 26 families, also advocates for mental health reform and has endorsed a slate of local and federal gun control laws. New national gun control laws have been blocked by Republicans in Congress, and are now opposed by Donald Trump, who sees himself as a close ally of the National Rifle Association, the nation’s leading gun rights group."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/11/rugby-union-talking-points-from-weekend-european-action","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T10:00:01Z","webTitle":"Rugby union: talking points from the weekend’s European action","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/11/rugby-union-talking-points-from-weekend-european-action","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/11/rugby-union-talking-points-from-weekend-european-action","fields":{"headline":"Rugby union: talking points from the weekend’s European action","bodyText":"1) French show their polish but English clubs fail to shine Have a side ever taken to Europe as well as La Rochelle? It is supposed to require years of failure and frustration – or experience, as it is known in self-help circles – before a team start to move with confidence in this competition, but there they are, all but qualified for the quarter-finals after 15 points from their first three games. They may yet stumble in the knockouts, but La Rochelle are cruising. Then again, it is proving a disappointing pool otherwise. If English clubs are flopping right, left and centre, Wasps and Quins are as dispiriting examples as any. The latter’s defeat to Ulster followed their heroics the previous week as night does day. Ulster look best placed to mount a case as best runners-up, with home games against Quins and La Rochelle still to come before the pool is decided. Michael Aylwin 2) Ospreys soar after Sarries are frozen out In light of the postponement of Saracens against Clermont, the Pool 2 table makes for good viewing for the Ospreys. For an hour against Northampton they were excellent, having arrived at Franklin’s Gardens in a run of form every bit as bad as the Saints. Sam Davies did not get a look-in for Wales during the autumn but his was an eye-catching performance, although for all that the Ospreys impressed until the final quarter, Northampton were dreadful. Another bonus-point win for the Welsh side this weekend is within their capabilities considering how devoid of confidence Northampton are, and that would bring the Ospreys back into contention to reach the knockout stages. They do have to go to Clermont still but they should at least be bolstered by a number of international players who were absent on Saturday. Gerard Meagher 3) Away wins throw pool wide open Away wins in Europe are supposed to be rarer than teetotal English cricketers but victories for Leinster and Montpellier have reshaped the landscape in Pool 3. In both cases the home teams were made to pay for not keeping 15 men on the field for the whole game and for making too many little errors under mounting pressure. Rob Baxter still believes his Chiefs side can go to Dublin this weekend and turn the tables on Leinster but it will require a special performance to outwit a defensively excellent home pack. Glasgow, with three successive defeats, are already out of the picture for qualification for the knockout stages, not what their highly rated new coach, Dave Rennie, might have anticipated when he arrived from New Zealand to take over from Gregor Townsend. Robert Kitson 4) Veainu’s broken jaw leaves Leicester reeling To make matters worse for Leicester following their comprehensive defeat to Munster, Telusa Veainu suffered a broken jaw and is facing a lengthy spell on the sidelines. The injury compounds a disappointing weekend for the Tigers, who suffered the familiar feeling of leaving Thomond Park empty-handed for the second consecutive season and it means Matt O’Connor’s side must exact revenge this weekend if they are to reach the knockout stages. To do so they will have to find a way to combat the excellent Munster back-row trio of Peter O’Mahony, Chris Cloete and CJ Stander. Spare a thought for Teddy Thomas, meanwhile, who made a superb break for the try line for Racing 92, only to make a monumental blunder in failing to get the ball down against Castres. Racing went on to lose the match 16-13. Gerard Meagher 5) Late shows make for unlikely pool of death It was never anticipated this would be the pool of death with Treviso making up the quartet, but it has been the group where games have been won at the death. Toulon scored the winning try against Bath four minutes from time after the Scarlets had come from behind to overhaul Treviso in Llanelli with two tries in the final five minutes against a side who had played with 14 men from the 24th minute, following the sending off of the flanker Francesco Minto. The Scarlets won the Pro 12 last season but, like the current Pro 14 leaders Glasgow – who are unbeaten in the league – have found they need more than league form in Europe. Treviso may not be going through to the knockout stage and there may be no Italian side in the Champions Cup next season, but they could have won all three games so far, should perhaps, in a pool that is providing excitement rather than the likely winner.

Unfortunately that situation decided the game, but that is what we must accept.” Jordan Henderson and a couple more Liverpool players waited to speak to the referee, Craig Pawson, about that situation at the final whistle, unhappy with his decision to award a penalty against Dejan Lovren, and Klopp too said he felt the official had made a mistake. “I didn’t think it was a penalty, did you?” the manager said, inviting a show of hands in the press room. More hands went up than not, even in the Anfield press room, which left Klopp to reflect on the first rule of politics – never ask a question to which you do not know the answer. “OK, obviously you all thought it was a penalty,” Klopp said, a little sheepishly. “I thought [Dominic] Calvert-Lewin just stepped inside him at the last moment. There was no push, just body contact.” Predictably that was not the way Sam Allardyce saw it, although in this instance the Everton manager did appear to share the same view as the majority of observers, including the referee. “I’ve had a good look at it and Lovren raised his hands,” Allardyce said. “He had no need to do that, I don’t think Dominic was going anywhere, and I think it was very brave of Craig Pawson to make the decision in view of the number of years since Everton were last awarded a penalty here. You can call it soft if you like, I don’t have a problem with that, but these days you can’t put your hands on an opponent in the box. Don’t mess with him, don’t touch him, don’t shove him.” Allardyce also defended Everton’s ultra-defensive tactics, which were not pretty to watch but ultimately secured a point which continued an unbeaten run under their new manager. “I was pleased with the way we defended, we restricted the best attacking team in Europe to three shots on target,” Allardyce said. “I don’t actually think it would have made much difference had Coutinho and Firmino played from the start, we defended that well. You can’t knock our defending, because we still had to keep Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane quiet, but I must admit we still have a lot of work to do to get better when we are in possession. We still have five players to come back from injury, and that should help, but the ball from Wayne Rooney that led to the penalty was one of the few good passes we managed all afternoon. When Liverpool attack they often leave the two centre halves on their own and if you can get the right ball in you have an opportunity. We only managed it once but it won us a precious point.” It also gave Rooney the opportunity to score his first derby goal. “We nicked a draw in the end but we deserved it,” the Everton captain said. “It is easy to go away from a game plan when you are 1-0 down but we knew that at 1-0 there is always a chance, so we stuck to it. I had to walk over to get the ball to take the penalty because Lovren had kicked it way. All I was thinking was ‘you can’t miss this’, because it was such a big moment in the game. I am delighted with the result. We have made ourselves hard to beat again, and that’s what we needed to do.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"science/2017/dec/26/trump-nasa-moon-space-travel","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-26T09:00:44Z","webTitle":"To infinity and beyond: Trump has big plans for Nasa – but is it just a fantasy?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/dec/26/trump-nasa-moon-space-travel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/dec/26/trump-nasa-moon-space-travel","fields":{"headline":"To infinity and beyond: Trump has big plans for Nasa – but is it just a fantasy?","bodyText":"The world is not enough for Donald Trump: he has declared space “the next great American frontier” and mused to Congress that “American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream”. Earlier this month, the president ordered the agency to head back to the moon. “This time we will not only plant our flag and leave our footprint, we will establish a foundation for an eventual mission to Mars, and perhaps someday to many other worlds beyond,” he said, before signing the new policy for Nasa. The potential moon mission harkens back to policy under George W Bush, who in 2004 asked the agency to “gain a new foothold” there. His successor, Barack Obama, prioritized instead a 2030s mission to Mars, a program that has inched along due to its relatively low levels of funding. Trump’s proposals leave many questions unanswered – a timeline, budget, specific goals and methods – and space policy experts expressed cautious optimism tempered by deep skepticism about the details. “It could be a significant, almost historic step – if it is followed through,” said John Logsdon, professor emeritus at George Washington University and founder of the Space Policy Institute. “The proof is in the pudding, and the pudding is whether there is meaningful funding.” For years, Nasa has worked on a deep space capsule and its Space Launch System, the most powerful rocket it has ever developed, with Mars in mind, although its current plan included a hypothetical pit stop in lunar orbit – the Deep Space Gateway, a space station that could be used as a staging post for deep space missions or landing on the moon’s surface. Casey Dreier, director of space policy at the Planetary Society, an advocacy group, said that Nasa can adjust its plans to focus squarely on landing on the moon, but that “space policy is a big ship to turn”. He added: “It ultimately comes down to: what do you want to get out of the moon? Maybe you can get water out of the surface and get rocket fuel out of it and it can be a fueling depot. But it’s like building a gas station in the middle of the Alaskan wilderness before you’ve even built a road. There is no pre-existing business model on the moon.” Nasa will have at least some competition. China has sent three robotic landers to the moon since 2007, with more in mind, and Moon Express, a private American venture aiming to win a $30m prize offered by Google, has a 2018 launch date and ambitions to mine the moon. But would-be space entrepreneurs have run into regulatory hurdles, namely the Outer Space Treaty, signed in 1967, which holds that no country can claim a celestial body, and that governments supervise non-governmental organizations – like businesses – in space. In 2015, Obama signed a law that gave companies “space resource rights”, and earlier this year members of Congress proposed creating an “Office of Space Commerce”. But for now the legislation, like hopes to mine asteroids, remains far ahead of the actual technology. Like Bush and Obama before him, Trump has encouraged private companies to fill the gaps. SpaceX and Blue Origin, owned by billionaires Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos respectively, are developing their own “heavy” rockets and space tourism programs. In February, Musk announced that two private citizens had bought tickets for a flight around the moon in 2018, though SpaceX has never flown a crewed mission or tested its heavy rocket. The first test flight is set for January, and a spokeswoman declined to give any new details about the moon mission. But Congress, which sets Nasa’s budget, holds most of the power over Nasa’s ambitions – and moon base dreams require moon base money. After John F Kennedy’s call to put astronauts on the moon, Nasa received an 89% budget increase; the agency spent about $207bn, adjusted for inflation, across the Apollo missions. The agency’s current budget has hovered around $19bn a year recently – about 0.5% of federal spending, compared to 24% spent on social security and 15% on defense. “We could spend a penny instead of half a penny and would get a lot more,” said Alan Steinberg, a political scientist at Rice University who studies Nasa policy. But while Kennedy could appeal to cold war sentiment, he said, “now it’s really hard for any administration, Republican or Democrat, to justify space funding.” The experts are not holding their breath. “It’s very easy to sign a statement and it’s something different to implement it,” said Marcia Smith, an editor at the journal Space Policy. “They’ve always fallen flat in the long run.” Part of the problem is timing, Steinberg said: missions take years. “Even if Trump says, ‘We’re going to Mars, this is gonna happen,’ it’s not going to happen under him,” he said. “Given the amount that any politician is concerned with credit, I think you get the same kind of problems with big spending for space.” Congress is expected to finalize its 2019 budget in February. In the meantime, Nasa has no confirmed administrator or deputy administrator. The Senate has stalled for weeks over Trump’s pick to lead Nasa, the Republican congressman Jim Bridenstine. If confirmed, the socially conservative politician, who has criticized spending on climate change research, would be the first elected official to be named administrator, and the rare Nasa head without a career in science or with the agency. But the Senate has yet to vote, and at least one Republican, Marco Rubio, vocally opposes him. Trump has proposed cuts to earth sciences and canceled an asteroid mission, but many of Nasa’s other plans are still in place. Missions like the James Webb Space Telescope remain works in progress, and next summer the agency will launch a new Mars lander, to study the planet’s interior, as well as a car-sized spacecraft to fly into the atmosphere of the sun. In August, a spacecraft called Osiris Rex should arrive at the asteroid Bennu, where it aims to retrieve about two ounces of asteroid to bring back to earth. Meanwhile the Kepler spacecraft is still hunting new planets, and the Voyager and New Horizon vessels are cruising into the farthest reaches that humanity has ever explored. Science advocates like Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon, have continued to press the president to support space exploration. “Infinity and beyond!” Aldrin joked to the president in June. “This is infinity here,” Trump replied. “It could be infinity. We don’t really don’t know. But it could be. It has to be something. But it could be infinity, right?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/10/london-emergency-services-carry-out-training-exercise-at-israeli-embassy","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T19:31:57Z","webTitle":"London emergency services carry out training exercise at Israeli embassy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/10/london-emergency-services-carry-out-training-exercise-at-israeli-embassy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/10/london-emergency-services-carry-out-training-exercise-at-israeli-embassy","fields":{"headline":"London emergency services carry out training exercise at Israeli embassy","bodyText":"A section of the Israeli embassy in London was cordoned off as emergency services carried out a training exercise to test their response to a hazardous substance incident – the first test of its kind at a foreign embassy in the capital. Police, firefighters and paramedics wearing biosuits took part in the “live-play” exercise near Kensington Palace in central London on Sunday, amid snowy and wet conditions. Around 50 members of the Royal Military Police Reserves posed as casualties and embassy staff, though actual staff members were not involved in the exercise. The test saw emergency service teams descend on the embassy in Kensington Palace Gardens, to rehearse their response to “casualties affected by a noxious substance”. A spokesman for the Metropolitan police, which coordinated the exercise, said all the emergency services were involved, including London fire brigade and the London ambulance service. “It was an exercise involving the emergency services, and the reason they do it is to see how they can link up in such events, and if there is anything that can be improved in the future,” the spokesman said. However, he denied that the event held any connection to events earlier this week, which saw US president Donald Trump recognise the city of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, with plans to relocate the US embassy there. “It was planned for a long time – it’s just something routine and it could have been any embassy – we just needed a base,” the spokesman said. He added that the weather conditions “added another dynamic” to the exercise, and said that there were no plans for further events of the kind in the near future. Commander Adrian Usher, head of the Met’s parliamentary and diplomatic protection command, said: “This was the first time we have been able to carry out a live exercise inside a foreign embassy and the experience and learning gained from this will be invaluable. “It also tested our joint response in dealing with a hazardous substance, which is important as it will help officers and staff be better prepared should we ever face this type of challenge for real. “I must stress, however, that the exercise, which has been planned over several months, was not designed with any specific threat in mind, either in terms of the hazardous material element or the location.” Usher also thanked the embassy for their cooperation, adding: “the learning from this exercise will really benefit and help us in our response should a major incident ever occur at any embassy site in London.” A spokesperson from the embassy said they were happy to participate and work with the emergency services. London fire brigade earlier reassured passersby, tweeting: “If you are out and about near #Kensington High Street / Kensington Place Gardens area today, we are taking part in a @metpoliceuk training exercise close by – it’s not a real incident so please don’t be alarmed”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/ng-interactive/2017/dec/12/the-guardian-essential-report-12-december-results","type":"interactive","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T23:38:26Z","webTitle":"The Guardian Essential report, 12 December results","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2017/dec/12/the-guardian-essential-report-12-december-results","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2017/dec/12/the-guardian-essential-report-12-december-results","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian Essential report, 12 December results","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/dec/11/jessica-mauboy-delighted-to-compete-in-eurovision-for-australia-its-unfinished-business","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T08:46:26Z","webTitle":"Jessica Mauboy delighted to compete in Eurovision for Australia: 'it’s unfinished business'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/11/jessica-mauboy-delighted-to-compete-in-eurovision-for-australia-its-unfinished-business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/11/jessica-mauboy-delighted-to-compete-in-eurovision-for-australia-its-unfinished-business","fields":{"headline":"Jessica Mauboy delighted to compete in Eurovision for Australia: 'it’s unfinished business'","bodyText":"When Jessica Mauboy arrived in Denmark to perform at the Eurovision song contest in 2014, she knew she wouldn’t be the last Australian to do so. “I wasn’t aware until I physically felt the welcome on the ground,” she said. “I’m sure there would have been many, many conversations between all the big bosses before that, but for me, actually going there and being in the presence of the show [and] all of the people, I was so emotionally moved by how welcomed Australia was. “I felt right there and then that it wasn’t going to be the last time we were going to be able to be a part of it.” She was right. The reaction to Mauboy’s performance of her song Sea of Flags as an interval act four years ago was the catalyst for Guy Sebastian to become Australia’s first competitor in the contest a year later. His fifth place in the competition was followed by Dani Im who was runner-up in 2016 and Isaiah Firebrace who finished ninth in 2017. On Monday SBS announced Darwin’s biggest pop icon will become the fourth Australian to compete at the event when it’s held in Lisbon, Portugal in May next year. An Aria award-winning performer who became the first indigenous artist to reach number one on the Australian album charts last year, Mauboy admits that while she was “definitely barracking for my great friends” in the competition, there was “some part of me saying I would like a chance to compete”. “I am a deeply a competitive person when it comes to music,” she said. “I almost feel like I was the permission for Australia to become properly involved ... a year after that, the gate was opened for Australia [and] I almost feel like I’ve been waiting for this, like it’s unfinished business.” She now has five months to work on a song. In 2014 Sea of Flags, she said, was about representing the particular passion that Eurovision elicits in even non-European countries such as Australia. “You know, the flags everyone holds up, and the parties that get put on around the world because they can’t be there … the passion behind it all,” she said. The performance also managed to capture the idiosyncrasy that defines Eurovision; at the end of her performance, an astronaut appeared waving a double-sided Australian and Aboriginal flag. As a competitor, Mauboy, whose mother is from the Indigenous KuKu Yalanji tribe and whose father is from Timor, said wanted to write something that reflected “Australia as a whole”. “Obviously my Indigenous culture is very special to me … it runs through my blood and I definitely want to portray that in the music and as well as Australia as a whole,” she said. “The idea of singing in language could be quite special.” The head of Australia’s delegation to the song contest, Paul Clarke, said Mauboy had “opened the door for Australia to compete at Eurovision”. “Before the great moments of Guy, Dami and Isaiah, there was Jess, who touched the hearts of the Eurovision directors and proved just how talented our vocalists are,” he said. “Since then we have always wanted to give Jessica a shot at the competition, and this year the stars aligned. “We can’t wait to develop a great song and stage production with Jessica and her team, and recreate her Eurovision style as a galactic soul diva.” Since finishing as runner-up of Australian Idol in 2006, Mauboy has become one of Australia’s most successful female artists, selling more than 3.4m albums globally and releasing five top 10 albums and 15 top-20 singles. She has also won two Aria awards from 24 nominations. Her songs have been streamed 158m times and her videos have been viewed globally 37m times."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/12/tina-arena-and-courtney-barnett-join-campaign-against-music-industry-sexual-harassment","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T22:20:16Z","webTitle":"Tina Arena and Courtney Barnett join campaign against music industry sexual harassment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/12/tina-arena-and-courtney-barnett-join-campaign-against-music-industry-sexual-harassment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/12/tina-arena-and-courtney-barnett-join-campaign-against-music-industry-sexual-harassment","fields":{"headline":"Tina Arena and Courtney Barnett join campaign against music industry sexual harassment","bodyText":"Courtney Barnett, Tina Arena, Sarah Blasko, the Veronicas, Missy Higgins and Jenny Morris have signed an open letter from more than 360 leadings figures in the Australian music industry demanding “zero tolerance for sexual harassment, violence, objectification and sexist behaviours” in the industry. The letter, organised by a group of women in the industry as they launch the #MeNoMore movement, contains anonymous first person accounts of harassment, assault and rape. By Tuesday morning, more than 360 women had signed it, including artists, managers, publicists, booking agents and record label employees. The open letter is just the latest moment in a movement against sexual harassment, assault and rape in the entertainment and media industries, which has been gathering steam in the wake of allegations against Harvey Weinstein. It was inspired in part by a similar open letter from the Swedish music industry, which was signed by Robyn, Tove Lo, First Aid Kit and more than 2,000 others last month. The authors of the Australian letter write: “As Hollywood led the #MeToo movement and stories started breaking around the world, we found ourselves offering strength to our friends and colleagues who had their own stories to share – both publicly and in whispered circles. “It’s become clear that the magnitude of #MeToo extends to our own shores and to our own industry.” In anonymous anecdotes shared within the letter, one woman told of winning a high school music competition before being recruited and groomed by an Australian musician, who sexually abused her for months, leading her to quit the industry. Another told of a man who was “a pretty big deal in the local electronic music scene” and forced her to “do sexual things to him”, and threatened to ruin her career if she told anyone. Other stories detailed powerful men groping women, sending unsolicited nude photos, and pressuring women for sex. “We have listened to our friends,” the letter reads. “We have names of perpetrators. We know the same names that are repeated in unrelated circles. It saddens us that the people who hold us in fear and keep us silenced are people we work with, people who many of us have aspired to work under, and people who some of us have known as friends. These people need to be held accountable.” Other signatories to the letter include Heidi Lenffer from Cloud Control, singer-songwriter Holly Throsby, DJ Nina Las Vegas, and Isabella Manfredi from the Preatures. In October, Manfredi detailed her own experiences of sexual harassment in the industry in two Instagram posts. “Perhaps the greatest clarity this unfolding story has given me is some perspective on my own experiences in the music industry, mostly in, but not confined to, America,” she wrote. She told of sexual harassment from a New York indie label head, and inappropriate behaviour from a US booking agent. “I don’t want the next generation of women coming up in the music industry to face this kind of morally ambiguous, second-guess-yourself crap. It’s not on.” Tina Arena, who signed the open letter, has also been outspoken against sexism in the music industry. “Women and men of all ages have something interesting to say but what I have struggled with is the complete ostracisation of a woman [in the music industry] at a certain age,” she said at the 2015 Aria awards. In 2013 Arena told Fairfax: “It is very difficult to be a female in the industry in Australia, yes absolutely.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/11/jose-mourinho-fracas-manchester-city","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T11:03:31Z","webTitle":"José Mourinho in post-match fracas over Manchester City’s ‘noisy’ celebrations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/11/jose-mourinho-fracas-manchester-city","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/11/jose-mourinho-fracas-manchester-city","fields":{"headline":"José Mourinho in post-match fracas over Manchester City’s ‘noisy’ celebrations","bodyText":"Police officers and stewards had to separate up to 20 players and members of staff from Manchester United and City after an extraordinary bust-up in which bottles and punches were thrown and Mikel Arteta, one of Pep Guardiola’s assistants, was left with blood streaming down his face. The incidents have prompted an inquiry from the Football Association, which has asked both clubs for their observations after establishing that the referee did not witness what happened. The governing body could sanction clubs and/or players or staff. Greater Manchester police will launch an investigation if they receive a complaint but will not act unilaterally. As of Monday morning they had not received a complaint from United, City or any alleged victim. Arteta’s eyebrow was split open during a melee in a narrow corridor outside City’s dressing room and there were unconfirmed reports that another member of Guardiola’s backroom staff needed medical treatment after a confrontation sparked by José Mourinho apparently telling the victorious players to keep their music down. Mourinho became embroiled in a row with Ederson, City’s Brazilian goalkeeper, who was standing just inside the dressing-room door and the two started shouting insults at one another in Portuguese. Mourinho is said to have accused Ederson of play-acting to waste time and then reverted to English, screaming “you fucking show respect. Who are you?” Other players became involved and Romelu Lukaku was said to be prominently involved as the confrontation escalated into something much more serious, described by one person on the scene as being reminiscent of a pub fight. Early accounts indicate it was a much more serious incident than the infamous “Battle of the Buffet” in 2004 when Arsenal were the opponents and Sir Alex Ferguson was hit by flying pizza slices. There were also reports that Mourinho was struck by a plastic bottle, as well as being squirted with milk, although that has not been confirmed and the Guardian has been told he escaped lightly despite being in the middle of it. Once everything had calmed down, Mourinho went into the referee’s room to voice his complaints to Michael Oliver about the incident when Ander Herrera was booked for going down under a challenge from Nicolas Otamendi in the penalty area. Mourinho then emerged to do his television interviews and there was no sign of him needing to dry off. He did not make any reference to what had happened during all his media work. Arteta, meanwhile, was being assessed in the City dressing room after being caught in the crossfire. United’s players are understood to feel like the noise from the away dressing room was provocatively loud and, with the door continually being opened, Mourinho appears to have been asking more respect to be shown to the losing team. As the confrontation escalated, Sergio Agüero and Bernardo Silva were caught on the outside looking in, having not been inside the dressing room when it started. However, other City players were clearly incensed by Mourinho’s behaviour and the fact that several players, most notably Lukaku, had become involved. There are always two police officers in the Old Trafford tunnel after games and eventually they helped to restore peace."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/11/new-south-wales-drops-pledge-to-reform-states-racial-vilification-laws","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T04:15:47Z","webTitle":"New South Wales drops pledge to reform state's racial vilification laws","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/11/new-south-wales-drops-pledge-to-reform-states-racial-vilification-laws","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/11/new-south-wales-drops-pledge-to-reform-states-racial-vilification-laws","fields":{"headline":"New South Wales drops pledge to reform state's racial vilification laws","bodyText":"The New South Wales government has quietly dropped plans to reform the state’s racial vilification laws, prompting anger from Jewish leaders, ethnic groups and the Labor opposition. The state government had previously pledged to fix the laws, which are widely seen as deficient. The laws, set out in section 20D of the Anti-Discrimination Act, have not led to a single successful prosecution in 30 years, despite examples of incitement to racial violence. The former attorney general Gabrielle Upton conceded the laws were not working in 2015 and promised to introduce a bill early last year to strengthen and streamline section 20D. She did so after the director of public prosecutions was left unable to charge Ismail Al-Wahwah, the leader of the fringe Islamic movement Hizb ut-Tahrir, after he described Jews as the “hidden evil” and called for a “jihad against the Jews”. Upton said at the time: “It’s too hard to get a prosecution for a criminal offence.” But no bill was ever introduced. The current attorney general, Mark Speakman, has confirmed to Guardian Australia that there is now no intention for reform. “There are no present plans to amend section 20D of the Anti-Discrimination Act,” he said. “Apart from section 20D and its analogues, existing general criminal law provisions, including in the Crimes Act, are capable of covering conduct of the kind in question.” The position has outraged Labor’s shadow attorney general, Paul Lynch. Lynch said change had been blocked by “rightwing ideologues in the Liberal party”. “NSW is a successful multicultural society,” Lynch said. “That has happened and will continue only if we get our institutions and laws correct. Reforming section 20D is part of that.” An alliance of 31 ethnic community groups and prominent individuals – including the Indigenous leader Warren Mundine – formed in 2015 to lobby for change to the “weak and ineffective” laws. A spokesperson for the Keep NSW Safe campaign, Vic Alhadeff, said it was “a great disappointment” that the NSW government had not honoured its commitment to reform. “Just recently a religious leader addressed a rally in Sydney and called for the murder of people of another faith – yet the law did nothing,” Alhadeff said. “Worse, by failing to act, it effectively told him he was free to do it again. “It is because of such incidents that so many communities combined forces, from Armenians, Chinese, Greeks, Hindus and Copts to Indians, Assyrians, Muslims, Jews, Christians and Vietnamese. “It is unconscionable that one can incite violence against fellow Australians and the law is powerless to respond.” In 2013, a cross-party parliamentary committee recommended that procedural changes be made to make 20D more effective. That included improving the timeframes for lodging and referring complaints, allowing the president of the anti-discrimination board to refer serious racial vilification complaints to police and authorising police to prepare briefs of evidence for the director of public prosecutions on racial vilification responses. Lynch said the government had ignored the recommendations. “The government has ignored the unanimous cross-party parliamentary recommendation made four years ago,” Lynch said. “They’ve refused to act on recommendations their own members agreed with.” The Federation of Indian Associations of NSW president Yadu Singh said he “strongly believes that NSW government should act and fix 20D without further delay”. “There is a strong feeling that the actions in regards to 20D are overdue,” Singh said. Alhadeff is also the chief executive of the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies. Speaking on behalf of that organisation, he said the board “cannot work out what the government is afraid of”, given the near universal support for change. “The only people in NSW who don’t want to make the promotion and advocacy of violence on the basis of race illegal appear to be in government,” Alhadeff said. “The government can talk about social cohesion but when the time came for real and meaningful action, it has fallen short, and all the citizens of NSW will be the worse off for it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/11/facebook-messenger-kids-younger-data-screen-time-danger","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T12:36:43Z","webTitle":"Facebook Messenger for six-year-olds: need I say why that's a bad idea? | Nancy Jo Sales","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/11/facebook-messenger-kids-younger-data-screen-time-danger","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/11/facebook-messenger-kids-younger-data-screen-time-danger","fields":{"headline":"Facebook Messenger for six-year-olds: need I say why that's a bad idea?","bodyText":"Letting six- to 12-year-olds use Messenger Kids, Facebook’s new app targeting young children, is a terrible idea, and not necessarily because of concerns over online safety. Facebook went to great lengths in rolling out the app to assure parents that its latest shiny object was developed “with parents” and “parenting experts” to keep kids “safe.” This was even used as a rationale for developing the app, as Facebook said in a blog post on the day of the launch, the alleged “need” for a messaging app for young children that gives parents a “level of control”. But “level” is the operative word here. While Facebook has designed Messenger Kids so that only parents can approve contacts, and can closely monitor their children’s messaging, this doesn’t mean that kids won’t figure out ways around these controls, as they have with Facebook’s existing platform, on which countless kids who are not yet 13 have lied about their ages and created accounts. It also doesn’t mean that parents, who are often overwhelmed with other concerns, or simply trusting of what their kids tell them about their online “friends,” will actually remain consistently involved in the monitoring of every contact or message. And will Facebook be there to pick up the slack, if something goes wrong? Not likely, if its history is any guide. Facebook doesn’t effectively control the grievous amount of abuse on its main platform, including cyberbullying and revenge porn – it leaves it to users to report these abuses, a grossly imperfect method of monitoring that has been widely criticized. Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager, wrote a New York Times op-ed in November entitled, “We can’t trust Facebook to regulate itself,” in which he relayed an instance in which the company did not have controls in place to keep another developer from collecting data to “automatically generate profiles of children, without their consent”. Facebook promises that the collection of children’s data on Messenger Kids will be limited. But limited to what, and to what end? The company owes parents a much more detailed explanation of what type of data it will be collecting on this app, and how it will be used. Not to generate ads, the company promises (at least for now). OK, but then what kind of data, exactly, will a six-year-old be providing Facebook that it needs to gather? The issue of data pales in comparison with the more troubling concern of screen time. Let’s assume that everything goes as Facebook suggests, and parents are checking up on every single contact and message sent by their young children on Messenger Kids. Kids still don’t “need” another messaging app. Kids don’t need more screen time at all – they need less. And they don’t need to be using any form of social media at a younger age. They need to wait until they are older. Delay, delay, is the watchword of many experts in this field. In 2016, the American Academy of Pediatrics released policy recommendations setting strict limits on screen time, particularly at younger ages. Excessive screen time has been linked, in studies, to delayed speech, loss of sleep, and other ills ranging from anxiety to depression to impaired concentration. What do children really need? They need to play. They need to learn to socialize and communicate face to face. And while Facebook suggests that the purpose of its new app is to allow children who are separated from their parents and grandparents throughout the day to be able to communicate with them, there are already ways for them to do this – there are phones and there is texting, ideally regulated by the person in whose care the children are left. Kids are getting phones at younger and younger ages, a regrettable trend that is also part of Facebook’s reasoning for introducing this new app. “Some 93% of six- to 12-year-olds in the US have access to tablets or smartphones, and 66% have their own device,” Antigone Davis, Facebook’s public policy director and global head of safety, says in another blog post promoting Messenger Kids. But the proliferation of smartphones among younger children is itself a health concern, not a reason to be inventing new products that potentially exacerbate the problem. With Messenger Kids, Facebook is clearly targeting a younger market, making a move to get children engaged with its brand at a younger age. At age 13, the account of a child on Messenger Kids will automatically migrate over to Facebook. “Get ’em while they’re young” has been a bedrock tenet of marketing forever, and this is no different. Messenger Kids will be used by kids mostly, I believe, to talk to each other. They will lose more language skills in favor of sending videos and gifs. They will be communicating more and more through screens, behind which, studies tell us, we are all likely to be more aggressive and even less ethical. Is this really how we want children to grow up?

Proceeds from downloads of the song will benefit Sandy Hook Promise, a nonprofit founded by several family members of the shooting victims that has trained more than 2.5 million students and adults to identify signs of at-risk behavior before it leads to violence. The song was inspired by Crow’s “real sense of helplessness” after the Las Vegas shooting, her frustration with America’s toxic gun debate and her struggle with how to tell her two sons, aged 10 and seven, about mass shootings that targeted kids like them as well as music lovers like their mother and her fans. “It’s a horrible feeling for my kids to not even be able to know what happened at Sandy Hook,” Crow said, “for fear they’ll walk into school and think they’re not in a safe place, or that mom will go to work and there’s a chance she may not come home if there’s somebody in the audience with a gun.” She tried to protect her two sons as much as possible from seeing news about the Las Vegas shooting on 1 October, she said, an effort made easier by the fact that her two boys are young enough not to have their own phones. Three days before her Sandy Hook tribute song was slated to debut on ABC’s Good Morning America, she told the Guardian, she still had not sat down with her children to explain what had happened at the elementary school in Newtown. Even contemplating that conversation left her shaken. “I think they won’t understand,” she said. “I’m not even able to fathom that.” After the Las Vegas shooting, Caleb Keeter, a guitarist who played at the Route 91 concert which was targeted, shared a viral post explaining how the experience had profoundly changed his opinion on gun rights. “We need gun control,” he wrote, “RIGHT. NOW.” Roseanne Cash wrote an op-ed challenging country artists to speak out against the National Rifle Association and to break the cozy relationship between country artists and the gun rights group. “There is no other way to say this,” Cash wrote. “The NRA funds domestic terrorism.” But mainstream stars have not come forward to start a conversation on how to strike a better balance between gun rights and the right to go to a concert or a movie theater without the fear of being targeted, Crow said. “I think it’s fear-based, this fear of losing your audience, this fear of pissing off your audience,” she said. Crow said she knows that speaking out about gun violence and gun laws will spark a new round of online harassment and vitriol. “My stance on it is very unpopular,” she said. “I’m a person just like everyone else is, and I’m not above being really hurt.” But, she said, “I want to see us do better, I want to see us as the country we were meant to be. “The emotional terrorism that is being wielded from the White House down has everyone so on edge that it’s robbed us of our ability to have reasonable conversations, where we sit in a room and we’re able to discuss these very important topics with people we don’t necessarily agree with. “As artists, I feel like we really have to show up in this, in all the areas that are hard for us. We need to write songs that talk about these issues. We need to write songs about what’s happening in our communities – the injustices, the people who feel left out. “Outside of Bruce Springsteen, who writes for these people?” Too many artists are putting out “the same song over and over, because it’s paying for the big houses”, Crow said. “Our fans need to know that we care about them.” Crow’s new song is more grieving than confrontational. She said she saw writing a benefit song for a Sandy Hook nonprofit as “an opportunity to be proactive in a way that’s completely non-political, that’s completely compassion based”. For the Sandy Hook parents and family members who listen to the song she said, she hopes that “perhaps there’s a little bit of comfort in it. Perhaps there’s just a moment of being transported away from the experience, and feeling there is something larger at play.” Nicole Hockley, a co-founder of Sandy Hook Promise, lost her six-year-old son Dylan at Sandy Hook. She has become a full-time advocate for violence prevention. She said she cried the first time she listened to Crow’s song, and that “it is constantly, constantly in my head now”. “When I wake up in the morning it’s the first thing I listen to,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/10/west-ham-david-moyes-spares-thought-joe-hart","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T22:30:04Z","webTitle":"West Ham’s David Moyes spares a thought for displaced Joe Hart","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/10/west-ham-david-moyes-spares-thought-joe-hart","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/10/west-ham-david-moyes-spares-thought-joe-hart","fields":{"headline":"West Ham’s David Moyes spares a thought for displaced Joe Hart","bodyText":"David Moyes has admitted that his “compassion” for Joe Hart’s position as England No1 made it difficult to leave the West Ham United loanee out of their 1-0 win against Chelsea on Saturday. Hart had been ineligible to play against Manchester City, his parent club, six days previously and saw his replacement Adrian – whose only previous appearances this season had been in the League Cup – perform well. The Spaniard kept his place for Chelsea’s visit and was again beyond reproach. It was the latest setback in a chastening 15 months for Hart, who will be at serious risk of losing his World Cup place if his fortunes do not improve. “I always have compassion for the players, and I have to think of their situation as well,” Moyes said when asked whether Hart’s situation with the national team had entered his reasoning. “That’s why it wasn’t an easy decision – it wasn’t easy because of that. But ultimately it’s West Ham I have to think about getting a result for. I need to win as well.” Moyes looks certain to stick with Adrian for Arsenal’s visit to the London Stadium on Wednesday. “[He kept a] clean sheet, didn’t make any mistakes today, so I’d have to say on that I would think so,” he said, adding standard caveats about the couple of days’ training that lie in between. He said Hart “will play a lot of games this season, I’ve got no doubt about that” and emphasised that his importance to the squad extends to his wider role in the dressing room. That will be cold comfort to Hart, who turns 31 in April and saw a season‑long move to West Ham as a chance to re‑establish himself in the Premier League after being jettisoned by Pep Guardiola at City. Things have not gone to plan and Hart, whose form for a struggling side has been patchy, faces the kind of battle he could not have expected four months ago. “I thought he was very good,” Moyes said of Hart’s reaction to not being picked. “He wasn’t happy, you know – I told him the reason why and that’s it. But that happens all round the country. Part of a manager’s job is relaying messages to your players on how you think they’re performing. I said to them when I came in: ‘I’m going to tell you what I think, I’m not kidding anyone on, if I think you’re doing fine I’ll tell you and if you’re not I’ll tell you as well’.” Perhaps Hart can take solace from the tough love Moyes has already dished out to Marko Arnautovic, another underperforming summer arrival who was restored to the starting lineup against Chelsea and responded with an all-action performance that was capped with a fine winning goal. “I think his all-round work has been really good,” was Moyes’s verdict on his appetite to track back and chase lost causes. “I’ve just said to them: ‘If you don’t do it, I won’t select you because at the moment we need it’. Football isn’t all about running but I think what the people here want to see is that the players are putting in effort and energy. I think the energy that Marko’s shown has given the crowd a lift – and I think they’re reacting to seeing that if Marko Arnautovic can do it then, well, they all can do it.” It was a level of vigour that Moyes’s opposite number, Antonio Conte, would have welcomed from his own players. Chelsea looked leggy – “a bit tired”, Conte agreed – against opponents for whom fitness had been a major concern before Moyes arrived in November. He bemoaned the fact he will essentially have “20 minutes” to prepare them for the assignment at Huddersfield on Tuesday; the implication is that reinforcements are needed but whether everyone in the corridors of power is singing from the same hymn sheet remains to be seen. “I think it is right to keep it secret if we have a conversation with the club,” he said of any discussions with Roman Abramovich about the January transfer window. “Now, it is very important for us to be focused on the league, to go game by game and try to find the right energy to play every three days.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/10/sizing-john-john-durkan-chase-punchestown-jessica-harrington-un-de-sceaux","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T17:56:41Z","webTitle":"Sizing John shows his class with impressive win in John Durkan Chase","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/10/sizing-john-john-durkan-chase-punchestown-jessica-harrington-un-de-sceaux","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/10/sizing-john-john-durkan-chase-punchestown-jessica-harrington-un-de-sceaux","fields":{"headline":"Sizing John shows his class with impressive win in John Durkan Chase","bodyText":"While racing in Britain on Sunday was wiped out by the Arctic conditions, scorching performances from Sizing John and Un De Sceaux at Punchestown and Cork left their supporters dreaming of the Cheltenham Festival as each showed they are ready to defend their respective crowns. Sizing John, winner of the Cheltenham, Irish and Punchestown Gold Cups, was sent off the 2-1 second favourite to win the Grade 1 John Durkan Memorial Chase at Punchestown and after surviving a scare at the second fence, where his jockey had to regather the reins and get his mount back on an even keel, his supporters were never really in much doubt who would win. Jessica Harrington’s brilliant chaser was winning his fourth successive Grade One Chase, and in doing so he thwarted Djakadam’s bid to complete a three-timer in this race. Paul Townend made the running on Djakadam until the third-last fence, where Robbie Power gave Sizing John the signal to seize the race and he quickly put the issue to bed, coming home seven lengths clear of Willie Mullins’s charge. The bookmakers understandably shortened the champion’s odds about retaining the Gold Cup at Prestbury Park next spring by cutting him to a general 4-1. Harrington said: “He gave us all a fright when he made that mistake at the second, but apart from that he jumped very well. He travelled much better than he did in the Gold Cup here at the end of last season and that was good to see as he had three hard races last spring and we weren’t sure how he would come back.” Last month connections had contemplated running him in the Betfair Chase at Haydock – the first leg of a series of races, including the King George VI Chase and Cheltenham Gold Cup, that would earn any horse to win all three a £1m bonus – but they felt the trip and ground would work against him. Harrington explained: “It wasn’t his ideal ground but two and a half miles in those conditions is very different from three miles-plus on testing ground. Not going to Haydock was the right decision.” Inevitably she was questioned where her stable star will run next but conceded there are no firm plans. She said he could go to Kempton for the King George VI Chase (on Boxing Day) or stay in Ireland, but did not rule out the possibility of him staying in his box over the Christmas holiday period. The only thing she was certain of is that he will be aimed at Cheltenham again in March. Mullins quickly made amends for that defeat as 15 minutes later at Cork his exciting chaser Un De Sceaux ran away with the Hilly Way Chase, which was a fifth consecutive win for the trainer in this event. Un De Sceaux, one of the most exciting chasers in training, thrilled the crowd with a peerless performance in this Grade Two chase which saw him stroll over the line 25 lengths ahead of Top Gamble, trained by Kerry Lee. David Mullins, his jockey, admitted: “It was the first time I have ever sat on a horse like him. For a horse that goes so hard, he’s just clear and sharp. It was a pleasure to ride him. He loved the conditions and ploughed through them.” The heavy conditions got worse and the meeting was eventually called off with two races still to run. Earlier in the day Highland Reel ended his brilliant career with victory in the Hong Kong Vase at Sha Tin. The five-year-old was seeking his seventh Group One success in the 12-furlong feature after being beaten into third by Talismanic in the Breeders’ Cup Turf on his previous start last month. Highland Reel more than had that rival’s measure this time though as he dug deep to repel the French challenger’s burst a furlong from home before staying on again to win by a length and three-quarters in the hands of Ryan Moore. The son of Galileo was winning the race for the second time after triumphing in 2015 and he retires with a total of 10 wins in 27 starts and over £7.5million in prize money. O’Brien said: “He ran a great race in America and we were very happy coming here. All the lads were really happy with him through the week and Ryan has given him a brilliant ride.” Moore added: “He’s always been a very straightforward horse with a lot of heart as well as speed and I was always happy and confident on him today. “When he gets into a fight, the longer it goes on, the more likely it is he will win it. That’s what happened today and he was going away at the finish. He’s high class, has a great attitude and his durability has been seen wherever he’s raced. I’m sure he will pass on those attributes in the future.” MONDAY TIPS by JOHN O’HARA Fontwell 12.45 Comrade Conrad 1.15 Goosen Maverick 1.45 Roksana (nb) 2.15 Get On The Yager 2.45 Born Legend 3.15 Stoical Patient 3.40 Llantara Southwell 12.30 Dorian Gray 1.00 Bernie’s Boy 1.30 On The Warpath 2.00 Alternate Route 2.30 Monteverdi 3.00 Dellaguista (nap) 3.30 Archie Stevens"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/10/does-tim-dowling-have-four-candles-in-his-shed","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T18:49:09Z","webTitle":"Does Tim Dowling have four candles in his shed? | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/10/does-tim-dowling-have-four-candles-in-his-shed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/10/does-tim-dowling-have-four-candles-in-his-shed","fields":{"headline":"Does Tim Dowling have four candles in his shed?","bodyText":"Peter Bradshaw’s review of the new reissue of A Matter of Life and Death (G2, 8 December) captures much of the film’s “enduringly rich and strange” romanticism, which surely has its roots in the long history of English metaphysical time culture, from Sir Thomas Browne to JB Priestley.

After rising phoenix-like from the devastation of the blitz, it suffered a second blitz as a result of Margaret Thatcher’s policies, and saw its industrial base as a centre of engineering and the car industry totally devastated. But it has a strong cultural track record. While growing up there after the war, I witnessed its architectural innovative flair, with one of the first pedestrianised shopping centres in the UK, a generously proportioned new museum and art gallery, the visionary new cathedral with windows by John Piper, tapestry by Graham Sutherland and a powerful St Michael and the devil sculpture by Jacob Epstein that adorns its portal. Its visionary postwar socialist administration established links with other cities badly damaged by the war, particularly in the communist world, with strong links to the then Stalingrad, Lidice and Belgrade, the latter supplying the beautiful wood for the interior cladding of its state-of-the-art Belgrade Theatre. It was there I saw premieres of Arnold Wesker’s trilogy about an East End Jewish family, new plays by John Arden and productions by a young Trevor Nunn. I went to concerts where Soviet performers like Emil Gilels, Marx Raizin, Galina Vishnevskaya and Igor Oistrakh were all together on stage; only later did they become world renowned. I was also enthralled by the velvet bass of the African American Paul Robeson at the city’s Hippodrome. During the 1970s, from its roots in Coventry, the Specials with Jerry Dammers brought multicultural ska to a world audience. Sadly, in retrospect, that appears to have been the city’s cultural swan-song. I hope becoming city of culture in 2021 will, once again, bring a revival.

For more than 40 years he represented and defended a string of famous and not-so famous clients and boasted of his professional and sexual prowess, not least in his 2005 autobiography, Read All About It. Never reticent at self-publicity, Clifford was unrepentant about the stories he sold to the tabloids, both true and false – and the ones he claimed he had kept out of the papers on his clients’ behalf. He once boasted at the Oxford Union: “Every day, every week, every month, a lot of the lies that you see in the newspapers, in magazines, on television, on radio, are mine.” Among those he claimed to have represented were Muhammad Ali, Simon Cowell, Diana Ross, OJ Simpson and Shane Warne. Besides the gossipy dross, there was also the revelation of the actor Antonia de Sancha’s affair with the Tory cabinet minister David Mellor in 1992, which ended his political career and the admission by the television producer Ted Francis that he had given a false alibi to help his friend Jeffrey Archer, which was repeated in the famous libel trial that resulted in the novelist’s imprisonment in 2001. As a self-proclaimed Labour supporter, Clifford professed to enjoy embarrassing Tories, though he also did work for Ukip. Cowell once said that hiring Clifford had been his best decision. Whether the comedian Freddie Starr felt the same after the Sun’s front page claimed wrongly at Clifford’s urging that he had eaten someone’s hamster was less clear. But when Clifford came to court in 2014, charged with 11 counts of indecent assault against seven teenage girls over a 20-year period between the mid 1960s and the 80s, his celebrity friends abandoned him. His was the first conviction arising out of the Metropolitan police’s Operation Yewtree investigation following the Jimmy Savile scandal – the first of a string of revelations about celebrities and others exposing the seamy, predatory side of show business. After he was found guilty on eight of the counts against four of the victims, his courtroom bluster finally deserted him as Mr Justice Anthony Leonard told him that his behaviour had been quite extraordinary and that he had shown no remorse. Clifford was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment. Born in Kingston upon Thames and raised in Wimbledon, Clifford was the youngest of four children of Frank Clifford, an electrician, and his wife, Lilian (nee Boffee). He left school at 15 with no qualifications and was soon sacked as an apprentice sales assistant at a Wimbledon department store. Through a relative who was a printer, he landed a job as an office boy at the Eagle comic and progressed from there to the Merton and Morden News, where besides reporting duties he also wrote a music column. He was taken on as a junior publicity officer at EMI in 1962, at the dawn of the British pop industry. Clifford later claimed to have helped to promote the early Beatles’ single Love Me Do and subsequently as an assistant to have represented the talents of Tom Jones, Jimi Hendrix and the Bee Gees. In 1970 he set up Max Clifford Associates which, over the next 44 years, became the best-known show business publicity organisation in the UK, with offices in New Bond Street and – inevitably – a silver Rolls-Royce (registration 100 MAX) at the door ready to take Clifford home to a Surrey mansion. Only occasionally he came a cropper, as in 2002 when he lost a libel action brought by Neil and Christine Hamilton over a rape claim he had promoted on behalf of a woman called Nadine Milroy-Sloan, who was herself subsequently imprisoned for attempting to pervert the cause of justice. Clifford was quite shameless about the manipulation, bullying and intimidation he used and cheerfully admitted playing off one tabloid against another. He was genial, with a hint of menace, but also easily approachable – even for the Guardian, to whom he gave the story of Mark Kennedy, the undercover police officer who infiltrated an environmentalist group and had an affair with one of its activists. In Read All About It, he could not resist boasting of being a control freak, holding sex parties and having affairs, including four while married to his first wife. He was, he said, too greedy to be faithful. “I became a ring-master, a role I liked to have in many aspects of my life … the parties became my circus and various people performed in various ways … I knew one or two agents who would issue contracts in return for sexual favours. One (friend) was a plumber but I pretended to the girls at the party he was a film producer. Sexual procuring has never bothered me.” He told his trial that even if he had looked like the Hunchback of Notre Dame aspirant women would still have flung themselves at him. Such boasts made it very difficult for him to rebut the allegations of witnesses during his trial nine years later that he had enticed and manipulated them into having sex with promises of introductions and film work. At Southwark crown court he denounced them as liars and fantasists to no avail. An appeal against his conviction and sentence was turned down last year. Clifford's first wife, Liz Porter, whom he met at a dance in Croydon in 1963, died of lung cancer in 2003. In 2010 he married a former personal assistant, Jo Westwood; she divorced him after the trial. Clifford is survived by his daughter, Louise, from his first marriage. • Maxwell Frank Clifford, public relations consultant, born 6 April 1943; died 10 December 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/10/labour-could-move-parts-of-bank-of-england-to-birmingham","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T18:34:26Z","webTitle":"Labour could move parts of Bank of England to Birmingham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/10/labour-could-move-parts-of-bank-of-england-to-birmingham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/10/labour-could-move-parts-of-bank-of-england-to-birmingham","fields":{"headline":"Labour could move parts of Bank of England to Birmingham","bodyText":"Parts of the Bank of England could be moved out of London to Birmingham under Labour plans to push investment into other parts of the UK. The radical plan threatens the historic association of the Bank with Threadneedle Street in the City of London, where it has been based since 1734. The recommendation is part of an interim report into the UK’s financial system, led by the economist Graham Turner of GFC Economics and launched by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. UK output from hi-tech industries has fallen on average over the past 10 years, says the report. Investment in manufacturing, ICT and other critical sectors is lagging £28bn behind investment in real estate companies, it says. The report proposes moving some of the Bank’s functions to Birmingham and establishing offices in Glasgow, Cardiff and Belfast, with smaller regional offices in Newcastle and Plymouth. The Bank would be sited close to the National Investment Bank and Strategic Investment Board secretariat and research department, organisations that Labour has said it will set up when it enters government, creating a new “economic policy hub” in Birmingham, possibly close to the railway station. Whether the governor would relocate to the city would be part of Labour’s policy review. “This important report drums home the message that our financial system isn’t delivering enough investment across the whole country, and in the high-technology industries and firms of the future where it is needed most,” said McDonnell. “Under the Tories, we’ve seen more and more investment flowing into property speculation whilst high-tech firms have been starved of the money they need, and research spending has lagged far behind.” Turner said: “The pace [of] automation and technological change is accelerating, threatening established business models and creating an economy characterised by frequent ‘disruptive’ episodes. As a central bank sitting at the heart of the UK financial system, the Bank of England needs to be playing an active, leading role, ensuring banks are helping UK companies to innovate. Flow of funds analysis shows that banks are diverting resources away from industries vital to the future of this country. “There is a risk that the disproportionate number of technology companies in London and the south-east will increase, exacerbating regional inequality. Governments have a critical role in addressing these weaknesses, but that will require determined, strategic action.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/10/family-carers-must-get-the-financial-support-they-deserve","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T18:50:17Z","webTitle":"Family carers must get the financial support they deserve | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/10/family-carers-must-get-the-financial-support-they-deserve","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/10/family-carers-must-get-the-financial-support-they-deserve","fields":{"headline":"Family carers must get the financial support they deserve","bodyText":"Louise Tickle importantly identifies the legal barriers to kinship carers receiving financial support (Family carers need our help, 8 December). The statistics are stark. In 2017 only 6,310 (3.5%) of the 180,000 children in kinship care were legally entitled to financial and professional support. It is also of note that in England only 9% of “looked after” children are placed with kinship carers compared to just under half in Spain, and there is also the injustice of opportunity arising from great variations between English local authorities. Research shows that kinship carers provide a strong family and cultural identity, the child not seeing themselves as “in care”, and they stick with them through troubled times, even when lacking financial, practical and personal support. This evidence clearly suggests the urgent need for all kinship carers to receive legal recognition and resources as part of a continuum of preventative and care services for vulnerable children and their families. Professor Mike Stein University of York • Finally, a call for financial support for kinship carers. We’ve campaigned for years to end the discrimination that pays strangers for foster care but not grandparents who often have to fight to stop children being adopted. But what about supporting mothers so children can stay with them? Women, 80% of whom are mothers, suffer 86% of austerity cuts, including benefit sanctions which drive thousands to food banks; 56% of single parents (overwhelmingly mothers) with jobs live in poverty; single-mother families are 47% of the statutory homeless and nearly three-quarters of families affected by the benefit cap. Section 17 of the 1989 Children Act instructs local authorities to “promote the upbringing of children by their families” by “providing accommodation and giving assistance in kind or in cash”. The Care Act 2014 entitles disabled mothers to extra help. Why are these entitlements rarely implemented? The 40% cut in “early intervention” highlighted by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, is not the only reason. An ideology of blaming mothers even for the domestic violence they suffer, devaluing the child-mother relationship regardless of its impact on children, promoting forced adoptions and privatisation of children services, has resulted in nearly 90,000 children in care (England and Scotland). In some working-class areas, 50% of children are being referred to social services. In 2016, ruling against a forced adoption, the European court of human rights said that article 8 (respect for private and family life) placed the state under a “positive obligation” to keep families together. It blamed “public and private services provided by ‘saviours’” for “child maltreatment and discrimination”. Mothers and kinship carers picket London’s family court every month demanding to be reunited with their children. They ask: when will they get the support they are legally entitled to? Nina Lopez Support not Separation Micheleine Kane Scottish Kinship Care Alliance Kim Sparrow Single Mothers’ Self-Defence • I felt heartened by Louise Tickle’s piece it because it highlighted the situation for some children and their carers. My wife and I are special guardians to our grandson, who is seven. He first came to us at Christmas 2010 at six months old after being in care for five months. At the age of five weeks he had suffered serious physical abuse by his father. One of his injuries was almost impossible to imagine, having one leg twisted until it snapped. While many are quick to attack social services, I have nothing but praise for the local social services. They were helpful in any way they could be to us and were supportive throughout the process of obtaining special guardianship and after. While acting as a kinship carer for two other toddlers beforehand, I discovered that not all social services teams are as forthcoming. Naturally, being a de facto new parent in advancing years is hard, but I can honestly say that it has been the most rewarding time of my life. I agree that more should be done to enhance the status of kinship carer and special guardians, who do what they do not because of financial assistance – or assistance in any form, because in some cases there is none – but because they are good people trying to do what is right for the child. Again, thank you, Ms Tickle, and I really do mean it. Name and address supplied • I agree with Louise Tickle that as an alternative to adoption, the relatives of vulnerable children should be offered funding and practical help if they can provide a home for them. The fact remains, however, that the two-parent family is still the bedrock of society and its most cost-effective system of social care. In the long term, where possible, parents should be encouraged to stay together for the sake of their children.

One woman who came without her husband’s permission to a workshop I ran on domestic abuse told me she was not allowed to go out on her own, even to buy food for her three-year-old son. She had to wait for her husband to come back from work and go with him. This woman said her husband would punish her if he found out she had attended the workshop. She felt she had no choice but to accept the situation because he had sponsored her visa; if she didn’t do what he said, he could send her home. It is shocking that almost 2 million people a year in England and Wales – 1.2 million women and 713,000 men – experience domestic abuse, and that two women in England are killed by a partner or ex-partner every week. But an even greater number of people experience abuse without reporting it – and many of them are migrant women. In my PhD research study on the experiences of migrant women who had experienced of domestic violence in the UK, all the participants had migrated, when they were over 18, to the UK in the past 20 years and were separated or divorced because of domestic violence. I also run workshops for Solace Women’s Aid, a charity that last year supported more than 10,000 women and children affected by domestic and sexual abuse. Domestic abuse is not limited by borders, culture, class, education or migration status. But there is now considerable evidence to show that migrant women, women of colour and women with low income are often at higher risk of domestic abuse. Of this group, migrant women, in particular, are far less likely to seek support. Most of the women I speak to blame themselves, feel ashamed and are reluctant to share what has happened (or is happening) to them. This is not unique to them, but several studies have shown that migration is a stressful and traumatic experience, and that factors such as not speaking the local language and a lack of family and social support puts these women at higher risk of domestic violence. When migration law gives a spouse control over the immigration status of family members, it forces many women to endure violence, as they are too afraid to seek help. The perpetrators reinforce their power by using women’s immigration status to threaten them. The six stages of domestic violence Sociologist Liz Kelly, professor of sexualised violence at London Metropolitan University, has identified six stages of domestic violence. At the beginning, women try to manage the situation and hide it. They hope their partner will change. By the second stage, when they realise he (and it is often men) will not change, they blame themselves and find excuses for him, saying he is stressed, or working hard, or they themselves need to be better. This distorts their reality – women do not perceive the behaviour as abuse, but believe they have marriage problems. Many women from developing countries see this as normal behaviour. At the third stage, women recognise the abuse and understand it is serious. In my research, I have found that migrant women arrive late to this stage, often when their children start school and they break their isolation by meeting other parents. By now, many women will start to make plans to find a way out. Again, at this stage, migrant women face challenges. Many don’t have anywhere to go. It’s not until women see a real threat to their lives or those of their children that they reach stage five and decide to end the relationship and flee. This stage is often complicated because it does not mean the end of abuse. Even when women find a way to escape, they still feel threatened by their abusers. Sometimes the perpetrators find them, even at refuges. Many perpetrators keep texting or use charm to convince their partners to return. Women often go through repeated relapses before abuse ends for good. The final stage is the end of the abuse. This can often feel like an illusion, particularly for women who need to keep in touch with the perpetrator for the sake of their children, and who must continue to manage an abusive relationship of the past. I have found that migrant women feel they get valuable support from the police and charities, but not enough from local authorities. More also needs to be done by community leaders to reach out to women who are more isolated. Many community leaders in this country are sceptical about the scale of the problem, even when statistics confirm how widespread this issue is. We all need to be more aware, more responsible and more receptive to the signs of domestic abuse. And we need to be ready to provide the help needed.

It has been saved through an innovative financial structure that involved setting up the first ever community benefit society, raising nearly £1m in shares from local people, and a multimillion-pound investment from the Heritage Lottery Fund. When it was first opened in 1872 it was described as the peerless pier. This year it was voted the people’s pier of 2017; and in the ultimate accolade, in October its lovely new pavilion, clad in wood recycled from the original pier that had largely been destroyed in an arson attack in 2010, won the year’s most prestigious design award, the Stirling architecture prize. Then, within a matter of weeks, this ambitious project in heritage regeneration and civic engagement ran out of money and went into administration. The outlook is tough, but it is not beyond hope. And its revival should be a matter of national concern not only for the pier itself, but for what it stands for: a model of what can be achieved through the efforts of civil society. Austerity has been profoundly damaging to the fabric of local communities. But it has also had the unexpected consequence of forcing people to choose what they value and organise to preserve it. And it is not only austerity: for a generation, a drive for smaller government has led to the replacement of many of its core duties by the third sector – social enterprise, charities and volunteers. Last week, the charity sector leader Sir Stuart Etherington started a campaign for reform that envisages civil society becoming a co-partner with local government, reinvigorating and democratising communities and local services. He proposed changing funding and tax laws so that dormant cash in the charitable as well as the private sector can be used more widely, part of what he called “a framework for the common good”. There is an important argument to be had about the different roles of state and civil society, but it should not rule out the kind of reform that would make the latter more sustainable. Hastings pier ran into cashflow trouble when faced with unexpectedly high insurance and maintenance costs. The pier would not have won the grant had it not shown that it was competent to manage it. Risk assessments and business plans come as prerequisites. It had to fulfil undertakings about community engagement and local fundraising. The HLF has a continuing charge over the pier which is likely to influence who rescues it and how. But the HLF has no mandate to support the project’s running costs or to help it to grow into a resilient and sustainable organisation over the long term. Experts talk about “the non-profit starvation cycle”, where community enterprises find it relatively straightforward to raise funds for a specific venture, but much harder to keep going through the early years until they start to generate returns. Some enterprises lurch from famine to famine on the whim of a minister or the results of an election. Where a charity or NGO successfully manages to generate reserves, it might find itself considered too well funded to benefit from a project grant. Money matters, but so do less tangible assets. Community ventures need relationships and networks to be able to access expertise to support management. They need social capital, contacts with people with influence. Nor is volunteering a cost-free option: people might give their time and energy for free, but they need organisation, a room, light, heat and the internet. The “big society” has withered as a political idea, yet beyond the reach of Whitehall it may never have been more alive. That is very welcome. Volunteering and community engagement do good things to the wider society in which they operate, and they do good things to the do-gooders too. But even the best-intentioned and well-resourced movement must have some recognition of what it needs to keep going."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/10/roy-moore-alabama-election-richard-shelby","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T23:48:50Z","webTitle":"'Alabama deserves better': Shelby breaks with Republicans to denounce Moore","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/10/roy-moore-alabama-election-richard-shelby","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/10/roy-moore-alabama-election-richard-shelby","fields":{"headline":"'Alabama deserves better': Shelby breaks with Republicans to denounce Moore","bodyText":"Alabama’s senior senator has rebuked Roy Moore, the Republican candidate in Tuesday’s special election who has been accused of molestation and sexual misconduct by eight women, including several who were underage at the time. In doing so, Richard Shelby refused to fall in line with Donald Trump, who was endorsed Moore, and the Republican National Committee (RNC). “The state of Alabama deserves better,” Shelby told CNN’s State of the Union, stating on national television a position he was already known to hold. “I couldn’t vote for Roy Moore. “I think the women are believable. I have no reason not to believe them. I didn’t vote for Roy Moore. I wouldn’t vote for Roy Moore. I think the Republican party can do better.” Eight women have accused Moore of a range of misconduct, including an allegation that he molested a 14-year-old when he was a prosecutor in his 30s. In the days after the Washington Post first reported on the subject, Moore did not rule out that he had dated 17- or 18-year-olds, saying: “If I did, I’m not going to dispute these things, but I don’t remember anything like that.” He has since denied all the allegations, accusing the Post of pursuing a partisan agenda. Republicans including Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell at first called on Moore to step down, and the party’s fundraising apparatus withdrew its support. But President Donald Trump eventually endorsed Moore, arguing that he prefers Moore’s partisan vote to a Democrat’s opposition. Not long afterward, the RNC renewed funding for Moore. Trump recently recorded a robocall ad for Moore and McConnell has retreated from his earlier position. Shelby is among a handful of prominent Republicans who continues to reject Moore, though he said on Sunday he did not vote for Doug Jones, the Democratic candidate. Instead, he said he wrote in “a distinguished Republican name”. “I understand where the president is coming from and I understand we would like to retain that seat but I’ll tell you what, there’s a time we call a tipping point,” Shelby said. “When it got to the 14-year-old story, I said that was enough for me, I couldn’t vote for Roy Moore.” Shelby hinted that should Moore win the election, a Senate investigation into his actions may follow. “I understand that’s already being contemplated but that would be up to the leadership and others to do that,” he said, insisting that Republicans had the same standards as Democrats, who recently pressed the Minnesota senator Al Franken, accused by eight women of groping and unwanted sexual contact, to resign. “Whatever you are that you would not put up with the conduct, bad conduct, from a Democrat or a Republican,” Shelby said. “The Senate will weigh, if Roy Moore wins, his fitness to serve.” The Jones campaign seized on Shelby’s remarks, turning them into two 15-second digital ads. Moore has declined to take questions or interviews in recent weeks, and on Sunday sent one of his top aides, Dean Young, to appear on ABC’s This Week. Young dismissed the possibility of a Senate investigation. “Judge Moore is gonna be found telling the truth,” he said, “just like he always has.” Young echoed the president’s argument about the importance of partisanship and directly tied Moore’s fate to Trump’s. “This is Donald Trump on trial in Alabama,” Young said. “If the people of Alabama vote for this liberal Democrat, Doug Jones, then they’re voting against the president who they put in office.” Young called the allegations against Moore “fake news” and suggested his accusers were motivated by fame. “In this world everyone wants to be on TV, maybe that’s the reason,” he said. “I need you people in Alabama not to fall for all these false allegations.” Moore has long been a controversial figure in Alabama, disliked by Republicans in Washington. In the primary this fall, Trump, McConnell and the party supported Moore’s more conventional opponent, Luther Strange. Moore was twice removed as a state judge for refusing to obey federal court orders; has said “homosexual conduct” should be illegal; praised Vladimir Putin; and said America was “great” before the civil war “even though we had slavery”. On Sunday, CNN published details of two 2011 conversations between Moore and a “conspiracy driven radio show” in which Moore said getting rid of all constitutional amendments after the 10th would “eliminate many problems”. Amendments after the 10th include the 13th, which abolished slavery in the US, and the 14th, which guaranteed citizenship to former slaves and has been used in supreme court decisions including that which legalised same-sex marriage. A campaign spokesman told CNN Moore does not support removing all amendments after the 10th. CNN also reported that the interview with the Arrowstook Watchmen also included a discussion of the need for new hearings into what happened on 9/11 and Moore’s citation of Adolf Hitler in an exchange about Barack Obama’s birth certificate. In contrast to Moore’s absence from the campaign trail – he has made only one public appearance in the last week, with former White House adviser Steve Bannon – Jones has stumped energetically. Polls remain too close to call. On Sunday Corey Stewart, a Trump-supporting Senate hopeful from Virginia who this week resurrected the “birther” conspiracy theory about Barack Obama, announced that he would help Moore get out the vote. At a press conference in Selma on Saturday, Jones mocked his opponent’s apparent reluctance to campaign. “He seems kind of like the groundhog,” Jones said. “He comes out every so often to see whether or not he can see his shadow.” Regarding the allegations against Moore, Jones has focused on his pledge not to embarrass Alabama. A campaign mailer risked controversy, however, in asking voters: “Think if a black man went after high school girls anyone would make him a senator?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/dec/10/shirley-hebbert-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T15:19:14Z","webTitle":"Shirley Hebbert obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/dec/10/shirley-hebbert-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/dec/10/shirley-hebbert-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Shirley Hebbert obituary","bodyText":"My mother, Shirley Hebbert, who has died at the age of 96, combined lifelong intellectual curiosity with an extraordinary ability to make and keep friends of all ages and from all walks of life. She was born in Gibraltar, to William Draycott, the then colony’s director of public works, and Winifred Moore, a D’Oyly Carte actor and the daughter of Charles Moore, the celebrated landlord of Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese pub in Fleet Street, central London. Returning to Britain, the family led a happy bohemian existence in Odona, a caravan (complete with piano) on Hengistbury Head overlooking Bournemouth bay. Their idyll was curtailed by the deaths of Win and Will in the late 1920s. Orphaned, Shirley was taken – via a wartime naval and yachting connection – into the care of the nautical historians Charles and Romola Anderson. After attending Godolphin school, Salisbury, she won a place in 1939 at Girton College, Cambridge, gaining a double first in natural sciences. However, since full degrees were not awarded to women at that time, she collected her degree in 1998, when Cambridge made amends to older women graduates with a splendid if overdue ceremony. In 1943 she won a research fellowship at the Royal College of Surgeons’ laboratory, working on arsenical jaundice. In the same year she met and married John Hebbert, a doctor at the military hospital set up in her guardians’ house, Nunney Court, Somerset. After the war the couple lived in Glasgow, where John specialised in the new discipline of geriatrics. Subsequent moves to Norwich, Blackburn and the north London suburb of Woodford Green followed his career as a consultant physician. Shirley was devoted to her family of six children and, wherever the couple lived, accumulated lasting, loving friendships. In 1991 they moved for the last time, to Wilton, Wiltshire, establishing themselves at the heart of the local community. A voracious reader, talented artist and lifelong socialist, she energetically pursued a broad range of interests and activities, supporting local charities and historical and musical societies. Shirley was a volunteer at the Salisbury Museum and at the cathedral – she was a committed humanist who cherished the spirituality and companionship of churchgoing, as an active Roman Catholic parishioner. She travelled widely after John’s death in 2005, and even in her 97th year was still coming up to London for cultural events – intellectually curious to the end. Throughout her last decade she gathered family and friends for an annual summer beach-hut week on Bournemouth bay, closing the loop on her childhood idyll. She is survived by her children, Michael, Win, Sue, Clare, Antonia and me, 12 grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/04/polls-give-labor-clear-lead-over-coalition-keeping-pressure-on-turnbull","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T19:44:23Z","webTitle":"Polls give Labor clear lead over Coalition, keeping pressure on Turnbull","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/04/polls-give-labor-clear-lead-over-coalition-keeping-pressure-on-turnbull","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/04/polls-give-labor-clear-lead-over-coalition-keeping-pressure-on-turnbull","fields":{"headline":"Polls give Labor clear lead over Coalition, keeping pressure on Turnbull","bodyText":"Two new opinion polls show Labor is closing out the turbulent political year with a commanding lead over the Turnbull government, while one of the surveys underscores the profound fatigue of Australian voters with Canberra’s lethal coup culture. Both the Newspoll and the Fairfax-Ipsos poll have Labor ahead of the Coalition on the two party preferred measure, 53% to the Coalition’s 47%. Last week’s Guardian Essential poll had Labor ahead 54% to 46%. As federal parliament enters what is expected to be the final sitting week for the year, the Ipsos poll also recorded 71% support for the idea that prime ministers should be allowed to govern for a full term, rather than being turfed out in leadership contests prior to elections. Over the past decade, the Labor party switched leaders from Kevin Rudd to Julia Gillard then back to Rudd, and the Liberal party switched from Brendan Nelson to Malcolm Turnbull to Tony Abbott then back to Turnbull. Labor managed victory in its own right in 2007 before being pitched into minority government at the next election, while the Coalition won the 2013 election outright before Turnbull scraped back into government at the last election with a one-seat majority in the lower house. The build-up to the final sitting week for 2017 has seen a burst of febrile speculation about Malcolm Turnbull’s leadership, fuelled in part by the fact the Coalition has trailed in the opinion polls all year, but the prime minister on Sunday said he was confident he would remain in the top job. “I have every confidence, every confidence, that I will lead the Coalition to the next election in 2019 and we will win it, because we are putting in place the policies that will deliver for the Australian people,” the prime minister told Sky News in an interview. The Fairfax-Ipsos poll contained questions about preferred leaders for the Liberal party and the survey had the foreign minister Julie Bishop ranked ahead of Turnbull as the most popular choice, with 32% support compared to Turnbull’s 29%. The former prime minister Tony Abbott polled at 14%, favoured conservative choice Peter Dutton at 5% and the treasurer, Scott Morrison, at 4%. Turnbull ranked ahead of Bishop among Coalition voters, and the Newspoll recorded improvements in his net satisfaction rating and in his standing as preferred prime minister. The latest Guardian Essential poll will be published on Tuesday morning. The polls were in the field at the end of another difficult week for the government, in which Turnbull was forced into a backflip on a banking royal commission because of a rebellion by Nationals MPs, and the top ranking National in New South Wales, John Barilaro, called publicly for the prime minister’s resignation. The Liberal party will be hoping that the return of Barnaby Joyce to Canberra after his win in the New England byelection on Saturday night will restore some discipline to the National party in Canberra after weeks of unrest. The dissident Queensland MP George Christensen has also confirmed he will remain on the government benches after telling two Sky News commentators to publicly float the idea that an MP might resign from the government without naming him. The final sitting week for the year will be dominated by citizenship declarations, which will likely trigger more high court referrals, and by the lower house debate over marriage equality. The Turnbull government will also move forward with its much-telegraphed legislation banning foreign donations, a move that follows renewed controversy last week about contact between the strife-prone Labor senator Sam Dastyari and Chinese businessmen. The Liberal party is also attempting to defend the Sydney seat of Bennelong against a fierce campaign by Labor, with the byelection scheduled for mid-December."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/dec/03/arabian-nights-review-scheherazade-royal-lyceum-edinburgh","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T11:43:22Z","webTitle":"The Arabian Nights review – Fake news?

Scheherazade unleashes genies","bodyText":"These days nobody from the US president down can distinguish between real and fake. So it makes sense that in tackling The Arabian Nights, that great story about stories, playwright Suhayla El-Bushra asks why it is that we tell tales. Her Scheherazade, played with dynamism by Rehanna MacDonald, is the daughter of a storyteller, a magnetic Neshla Caplan, who prefers stories that moralise to those that entertain. For Scheherazade, by contrast, the more fantastical the tale, the better. “There is a difference between a story and a lie,” her mother warns before launching into a cautionary tale about fibbing. The tale twists again with the arrival of Nicholas Karimi’s defensive Sultan, a man so afraid of fiction that he’s outlawed storytelling. “Stories are horrid,” he complains as he banishes the garrulous traders of Baghdad to the dungeon. “Stories let feelings come to the fore.” In due course, Scheherazade will demonstrate how fiction, precisely by letting feelings surface, helps with real life. Fake news, however, is only one of today’s hot topics. We hear revelations every day about high-status men and sexual harassment. That presents El-Bushra with a problem. Had she stuck to the original outline of The Arabian Nights, in which the Sultan marries and executes a new virgin every day, would she have gained in topicality what she lost in family-viewing acceptability? In this female-focused retelling, she sidesteps the dilemma by giving Scheherazade the less urgent aim (than staying alive) of freeing her mother from prison. If the girl can sweet-talk the Sultan through enough bedtime stories, perhaps he will be lenient. It’s a serviceable framework, but one that lowers the sense of jeopardy. In the dizzying compendium of stories, it’s too easy to forget what’s at stake. The change also diminishes the relationship between Scheherazade and the Sultan. Instead of a sexually tense collision between masculine intransigence and feminine empathy, it’s more like a dull-witted teacher being won over by a gifted pupil. There’s no charge between them and too little sense of resolution. It’s the colourful stories of genies, carpets and caves, told with everything from song to shadow puppetry, that shoulder the weight of Joe Douglas’s production. Strong on ensemble playing, if less certain in its relationship with the audience, it offers a lively treasury of tales, celebrating intelligence over brute force, honesty over cruelty and happiness over riches. • At Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh, until 6 January.

The National Disability Services 2017 state of the sector report, released on Monday, warns that policy uncertainty and inadequate price-setting by the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) has seen business confidence and financial stability among disability service providers fall in the past 12 months. A survey of 516 service providers found that only 47% could keep pace with demand and 73% saw an increase in demand for their services in the past 12 months, while only 56% actually increased the scale or range of services they offered to meet that demand. Only 58% of service providers in 2017 said they planned to expand their services, down from 68% in 2015, and only 41% described their financial position as strong or very strong, down from 53% in 2016. Sixty per cent of organisations said they were worried about their ability to adjust to changes resulting from the NDIS and only 57% said they had sufficient resources in 2017, down from 60% in 2016. The report will be presented to industry chief executives at a meeting in Sydney on Monday, before a meeting between industry and the NDIA CEO, Rob De Luca, on Tuesday. The number of participants in the NDIS has grown from 30,000 to 113,000 in the 15 months since the trial period ended in July 2016. At the same time there was an almost sevenfold increase in the number of complaints about the scheme to the commonwealth ombudsman, which service providers said reflected problems with the process for designing individual service plans. The NDIA is working towards a target of 475,000 participants by 2019-20 but a productivity commission report in October warned that deadline would not be met because the sector was not growing fast enough. The chief concern listed by disability service providers in the state of the sector survey was that the service prices set by the NDIS were not sufficient, with 50% of providers saying they would have to reduce the quality of the service they offered to fit within NDIS cost parameters. National Disability Services has warned before that organisations were faced with shutting down regional or remote services because the price structure set by the NDIS did not cover the actual cost of services. Sixty per cent of organisations said they wanted the NDIS to set prices aligned with the cost of supply. An independent review of pricing under the NDIS, commissioned by the NDIA board, is due to report its findings this month. Organisations also raised concerns about poor-quality NDIS plans, which the report said were being undertaken by local area coordinators who were under pressure to meet rollout targets and often cutting corners. “Planning was rushed, often conducted over the phone and existing services were frequently disregarded as a starting point for considering the supports needed,” the report said. “Essential supports were omitted from plans and rectifying these omissions was not easy.” The number of organisations that said the government was neither anticipating nor responding to the needs of disability service providers rose from 62% in 2016 to 74% in 2017, and 67% said the NDIA was not working well with providers. “The NDIA cut corners to meet ambitious targets to get people with disability into the scheme,” the National Disability Services CEO, Ken Baker, said. “I think it recognises now that it needs to focus much more on improving the quality of the NDIS experience for providers and participants.” Baker said the disability sector would work with the NDIA to resolve problems. “We are determined to see the NDIS succeed,” he said. “Too much is at stake to let it fail.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/05/what-happened-to-las-status-as-americas-basketball-city","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T09:00:12Z","webTitle":"What happened to LA's status as America's basketball city?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/05/what-happened-to-las-status-as-americas-basketball-city","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/05/what-happened-to-las-status-as-americas-basketball-city","fields":{"headline":"What happened to LA's status as America's basketball city?","bodyText":"Sunday was another tough night for LA basketball. The Los Angeles Lakers’ losing streak increased to five games after the Houston Rockets blew them out 118-95. Meanwhile the injury-plagued Clippers lost their third straight, falling to the Minnesota Timberwolves 112-106. Despite coming into this season with radically different expectations, both teams have won just eight games and have a long way to go if they want to make it above the .500 mark. While it’s still early in the season, there’s a strong possibility that we could be heading towards the first NBA postseason without an LA-based team since 2005. It’s been a particularly unusual time to be a Lakers fan as their team has already missed four straight postseasons, by far their longest playoff drought. In fact, prior to this stretch, they had missed the playoffs in back-to-back seasons only once before, in 1974-76. Since 1960, when they moved from Minnesota (hence their geographically suspect nickname) to become the first NBA team on the West Coast the Lakers have won 25 conference titles and 11 championships, including two three-peats. This is a team that has showcased a laundry list of superstar players including Jerry West, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, James Worthy, Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant. Even if the Lakers hadn’t established themselves as one of the most successful and popular franchises in US sports, the Clippers were always going to be the lesser loved of the two teams. They began life as the Buffalo Braves in 1970 before moving to San Diego in 1978 and rebranding themselves as the Clippers. They then moved to LA in 1984, just in time to be completely overshadowed by Johnson’s “Showtime Lakers” teams, whose epic battles with Larry Bird’s Boston Celtics helped revive the league and laid the groundwork for the modern day NBA. Of course, it’s doubtful that the Clippers would have gained a large fanbase even if they had an entire major market to themselves. For most of their existence the Clippers have played awful, uninspired basketball. They wouldn’t make their first playoffs as the Clippers until the 1991-92 season. They lost in the first round, something that would become a fairly common result on those rare occasions that they actually managed to qualify for the postseason. Much of the blame for the Clippers’ legacy of losing has to be placed on Donald Sterling, the bigoted slumlord and notorious cheapskate who owned the Clippers from 1981 to 2014, when the NBA finally banned him for life after he was caught on tape making racist remarks. During his reign, the Clippers weren’t just bad on the court, they were an absolutely toxic organization with a reputation for making players miserable, a situation that ensured that free agents tended to give the team a wide berth. However, even before former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer bought the team in August 2014, it the Clippers’ luck was changing. IN 2009, they drafted No1 pick Blake Griffin who, after losing his entire rookie year to a knee injury, developed into one of the best players in the league. Then, in 2011, the Clippers pulled off a trade for all-star point guard Chris Paul after the league controversially voided a trade that would have sent him to, who else, but the Lakers. This, obviously, was considered a double win for long-suffering Clippers fans. With the Lakers mired in the longest slump of their existence, due in part to Kobe Bryant’s drawn-out decline, the Clippers finally established themselves as the most successful NBA team in the city. They had a new owner, the most talented team in franchise history and a proven head coach in Doc Rivers, who led the Boston Celtics to a title in the 2008 NBA finals. Now, it’s hard to argue that the Clippers haven’t been successful during that stretch. They have made the playoffs in each of the last six seasons, a genuine accomplishment since they before that they had made a grand total of four postseason appearances since moving to LA. Still it’s equally hard to argue that the Clippers have been able to take advantage of the Lakers’ recent struggles. It’s understandable that the Clippers didn’t win a title, especially considering that their best seasons occurred right when the Western Conference became historically competitive, but the Clippers failed to even make their first conference championship appearance. As good as they have been over the last few years, they haven’t been able to overcome injuries to their most important players, notoriously thin benches and good old fashioned “Clippers luck.” Now their window might be closed. The Clippers traded Paul to the Houston Rockets in the offseason. While there was some hope that the team could build around Griffin in the way that the Rockets have built around James Harden and the Oklahoma City Thunder are attempting to do with Russell Westbrook, Griffin’s latest knee injury has probably put an end to that particular fantasy. At this point of the season, the Clippers and Lakers have won the same number of games, but that doesn’t mean that they’re both on equal ground. The Clippers came into this season thinking that they were going to be a competitive playoff team and hoping to avoid having to go through a messy rebuild that would essentially end their latest attempt at stealing the spotlight away from their intra city rivals. Meanwhile, the Lakers had absolutely no intent on building a winning team last off-season. Instead they concentrated on clearing away the cap space so they can sign two superstar players next summer, possibly even LeBron James. If this were any other team, this would be an utterly presumptuous move to make, but it’s something that the Lakers can do given their winning tradition, gigantic fanbase and their history of attracting talent. In other words, star players come to the Lakers with an expectation of winning championships because the Lakers are the team where star players have won championships. In the NBA, success begets success and no team exploits that concept more than the Lakers. For that reason, it’s hard to imagine that the Clippers, with their ugly history of bad luck and worse basketball, will ever be able to truly make LA their town."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"crosswords/prize/27382","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-16T00:00:46Z","webTitle":"Prize crossword No 27,382","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/prize/27382","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/prize/27382","fields":{"headline":"Prize crossword No 27,382","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/live/2017/dec/03/manchester-city-v-west-ham-united-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T18:01:10Z","webTitle":"Manchester City 2-1 West Ham United: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/dec/03/manchester-city-v-west-ham-united-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/dec/03/manchester-city-v-west-ham-united-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Manchester City 2-1 West Ham United: Premier League – as it happened","bodyText":"There’s no sign of Pep Guardiola haranguing any West Ham players after the final whistle. He must have appreciated their effort. It wasn’t enough for them to claim an unlikely point, though, even though they led thanks to Angelo Ogbonna’s goal at half-time. West Ham leave with nothing despite an improved defensive performance and remain in 19th place, winless under David Moyes and three points off 17th place before hosting Chelsea and Arsenal next. The points belong to City. The leaders were off colour, but they responded in the second half, equalising through Nicolas Otamendi before David Silva earned them another late win. It’s City’s 13th successive victory, equalling the Premier League record, and their eight-point lead over Manchester United is back - just in time for next week’s trip to Old Trafford. Thanks for emailing and reading. Bye. City have done it again. 90 min+4: Adrian charges out of his area to try to beat Jesus to the ball on the right. He’s committed himself and once he’s realised he’s losing the race, he slides in to bring the striker down and earns a booking. 90 min+3: Bernardo Silva replaces Leroy Sane. 90 min+1: Arnautovic hassles Mangala on the right, showing good strength to bully the defender off the ball before making off with it. The Austrian looks up and cuts the ball back to Sakho, who clips a low shot just wide of the left post! What a chance for West Ham! Guardiola is absolutely livid with Mangala, who looks like he’s injured himself in the process. 88 min: Andre Ayew replaces the knackered Antonio. 87 min: City get a bit too cocky and West Ham win back possession in a threatening position. Arnautovic hangs a ball into the middle from the left - but it’s just too high for the unmarked Antonio! That was a scare for City. Antonio, meanwhile, has gone down clutching the back of his right leg. It looks like cramp. 86 min: City are now indulging themselves in some keep ball. 85 min: Fernandino replaces Sergio Aguero. What a ball that was from De Bruyne, who was having one of his quieter games. They’ve done it again! And this is superb. Kevin de Bruyne finally earns a yard of space and he takes advantage of it with an insouciant curling ball over the West Ham defence. Rice hasn’t realised that Silva has run behind him and the Spaniard adjusts brilliantly to hang out his left leg and divert a low volley past the distraught Adrian from close range! City’s patience has been rewarded and West Ham, utterly shattered, are heartbroken. 81 min: West Ham break at last and Antonio almost restores their lead! He steams inside from the left, on to his right foot, and hammers a rising shot towards the far corner, only for Ederson to make a fine save! 80 min: Fernandes, I think, goes down in the middle of West Ham’s half. There was no foul, though. City play on. The pressure is relentless here. But West Ham are protecting Adrian with so much heart. 79 min: Aguero’s shot from the edge of the area is charged down. Time is running out for City, even though West Ham are locked into their own area. But they do have a habit of scoring late goals. 77 min: City play around with the thing inside West Ham’s area. Silva turns and sees a shot blocked. Jesus tries to force in the loose ball, but he has to settle for a corner. The pressure grows. 76 min: Antonio charges off in pursuit of a long ball and almost nicks it off the dawdling Mangala. Almost. 75 min: West Ham are no longer attacking. Adrian wants them to push up. It’s not happening. 73 min: Walker skips round Masuaku on the right, but his inviting cross flashes across the face of goal, no City player attacking it in the six-yard box. Walker is entitled to ask why. 71 min: Gabriel Jesus receives a pass with his back to goal on the edge of the area, turns and tries to bend a careful shot into the right corner. Adrian, however, reads his intentions and dives to get a hand to it! Sterling hurtles in, with the goal vacant, but his timing is off and he miscontrols, allowing the visitors to hack the ball clear! What a let-off for West Ham! Adrian is having a bit of a stormer. 70 min: De Bruyne’s deflected shot from 20 yards is straight at Adrian. West Ham have 20 minutes to hold on. 69 min: Marko Arnautovic replaces Manuel Lanzini. 68 min: Sane has another go, but this one flies off target from 20 yards. 67 min: Sane runs at the isolated Zabaleta, swerves to the left and thumps a shot goalwards. Adrian is equal to it again, parrying the ball to safety. 66 min: Silva smacks a shot well over from 20 yards. There have been a few wild efforts from City today. They still aren’t looking particularly impressive. 64 min: Sane flattens Cresswell with a powerful shot. It looked like the defender handled it, mind you. Maybe he was playacting to throw Mike Dean off the scent. 63 min: De Bruyne shoots over from long range. “Just thought I mention that Delph dived shamelessly to win that free kick,” says Darren MacGowan. “It was egregious.” 62 min: Walker bursts inside from the right and stabs a pass through to Jesus. The Brazilian’s hooked volley is deflected wide by Rice. West Ham clear the corner. 61 min: Sane tricks his way into the area on the left, moving the ball on to his right foot, but Adrian dives to his right to beat the winger’s rising shot away. 59 min: De Bruyne is booked for tripping Masuaku. 58 min: Expect City to turn the screw now. West Ham are going to have show so much character. The pressure didn’t subside, however, and West Ham finally crack! Gabriel Jesus makes his first helpful contribution since coming on, driving into the area from the right and hammering a low ball into the six-yard box. It’s past Adrian and Otamendi bundles it in off Rice! 56 min: De Bruyne really does fancy it. He curls the ball around the wall viciously, but Adrian flies to his left to push it away! 55 min: City have had the ball for ages. Sterling has a shot blocked on the edge of the area. Delph goes on a dribble, twisting in between two defenders before being chopped down on the edge of the area by Rice, who does well to avoid a second booking. De Bruyne fancies this. This is a huge chance for the Belgian. 54 min: West Ham are very deep. They haven’t had the ball for a while. 53 min: City patiently probe on the edge of the area. The ball comes to Sane on the left. He pushes Zabaleta back before finding Sterling, whose low shot hits the offside Sterling. That was City’s clearest opening so far. 51 min: Masuaku has a sighter from 30 yards. It bounces in front of Ederson, who makes an easy save. West Ham have made a decent start to the second half. The home fans are turning up the volume now. 48 min: Lanzini is down after getting clobbered by the clumsy Mangala. He needs some treatment, but he should be okay. 47 min: Obiang tugs De Bruyne back on the right and concedes a free-kick. Adrian punches De Bruyne’s delivery clear, though. 46 min: West Ham - who are winning - get the second half underway. City are in a 4-2-4 system now. “It’s the hope that kills,” says Tom Shaw. “Forty five minutes of pure torture looms ahead.” Manchester City are making a change: Gabriel Jesus is replacing Danilo. Mike Dean brings an end to a brilliant half for David Moyes’s struggling side. Against all expectations, they’re in front at the home of the leaders thanks to Angelo Ogbonna’s header. They deserve to be ahead and they’re restoring a lot of pride here. Whether they can hold on, though, remains to be seen. Expect Pep Guardiola to tear into his lethargic players during the break. Jose Mourinho is the world’s biggest West Ham supporter at the moment. See you in 15 minutes. 45 min+4: City’s supporters don’t seem to know how to react. This wasn’t in the script. There are a few howls as another pass goes astray. 45 min+3: Ogbonna has scored a few big goals for West Ham - the defender got a 120th minute winner against Liverpool in the FA Cup two years ago and the decisive goal in the recent League Cup win over Tottenham. 45 min+2: Silva slips a pass through to Aguero, who’s offside as he sees his shot saved by Adrian. 45 min+1: West Ham merit this lead, having defended well and caused a lethargic City a few problems, but they’ll face four minutes of stoppage time. Do not adjust your screens. West Ham take the corner short, Cresswell knocking it back to Lanzini. The Argentinian assesses his options before playing it back to Cresswell, who curls a fine ball into the middle. And no one is close enough to Ogbonna, who rises to thump a low header to Ederson’s right. The goalkeeper gets his hand to the ball, but he can’t keep it out and this is preposterous! 44 min: West Ham break through the middle and Sakho is quickly involved. He shoots hopefully from the right and wins a corner, the ball spinning behind off Mangala. 43 min: Cheikhou Kouyate can’t continue. He looks miffed. Diafra Sakho replaces the midfielder and will go up front. Aguero, meanwhile, has had one touch in West Ham’s area. 42 min: This is turning into a big test for City. Manchester United’s win at Arsenal yesterday cut the lead to five points and City haven’t responded yet. They’re allowing this first half to drift away. 40 min: Kouyate wants to continue. West Ham are down to 10 men for the time being. Not for too long, though. Kouyate is back on. 38 min: Walker wallops a shot over from 35 yards. Guardiola looks unimpressed. West Ham have a problem, though. Kouyate has gone down with what looks like a hamstring problem. 37 min: Sane’s shot is deflected over for a corner. 36 min: Cresswell fails to beat the first man with his corner. A waste. 35 min: Sane and Sterling have barely been in the game at all. De Bruyne has offered little. Aguero hasn’t had a shot yet. Moyes must be loving this. And West Ham are growing in confidence. Lanzini, finally on the ball in a meaningful position, finds Antonio on the right of the area. He can’t sort his feet out, but a loose tackle inadvertently takes the ball through to Lanzini. From a tight angle, he hammers a shot at Ederson, who pushes it wide at his near post. That’s probably the best chance of the first half so far. 34 min: This is quite a dull game, but that’s making it strangely absorbing. When will City wake up? How long can West Ham maintain this level of organisation? 33 min: The free-kick’s clipped down the left channel by Cresswell, Antonio peeling behind Walker and running through to face Ederson. The flag’s up for offside, though. 32 min: Masuaku has a saunter down the left. Otamendi cynically brings him down but gets away without a booking. 30 min: West Ham are defending very well. City aren’t sure how to get through them. You suspect, though, that they’ll work it out eventually. 29 min: I don’t think Lanzini has had a touch yet. 27 min: West Ham haven’t been allowed out of their final third in the last few minutes, but the pressure comes to an end when Sterling whacks a poor shot high and wide from 20 yards. 25 min: De Bruyne flicks a pass from right to left with the outside of his right foot. Delph dummies it, opening up space for Silva, who decides to let fly from 25 yards. Adrian’s finally brought into action, turning the ball over the bar. It was a fearsomely struck shot from Silva, although it was right above Adrian, who would have been disappointed if he had let that in. The corner comes to nothing. But City have West Ham pinned back at the moment. 24 min: Adrian still hasn’t had to make a save. All hail The Moyesiah! 21 min: Sterling thumps a long ball in Aguero’s general direction. Adrian collects. Guardiola is annoyed. If only he had Nathan Redmond. 20 min: It’s still goalless! A crossfield pass bounces over Sane’s head and out for a throw. 19 min: It’s a bit slow from City at the moment. It almost feels like they’re waiting for a goal to come, but West Ham’s deep defence is making it difficult for them. Jose Mourinho will approve. 17 min: Walker makes a mess of getting the ball out of a tight spot on the right and ends up losing the ball. Masuaku seizes possession and whacks a hard, low ball into the six-yard box. Ederson, Mangala and Antonio all go for it. The ball briefly squirms clear but Antonio has fallen over, enabling Ederson to smother it. Up the other end, Rice is booked for a foul on Aguero. 16 min: More timewasting at a goal-kick from Adrian. There are a few whistles from the crowd. He’ll get booked soon. 14 min: De Bruyne whips in a bouncing, awkward cross from the right. Sane goes for it, but it’s too close to Adrian. “Earliest I’ve left a game?” says Ian. “West Ham 2-2 Manchester United in 1996. I left on 60 minutes with us 2 down to go on a first date with my future wife. First impressions and all that. Didn’t want to be late........ I missed Julian dicks’ hardest ever penalty strike and the only 10 minutes Florin ‘Harvey Nicks’ Raducioiu was any good for us.” 12 min: Masuaku loses possession deep on the left and City pounce on the error, De Bruyne striding through the middle before locating Silva. Again, though, Silva’s radar is slightly off as he tries to find Sane. 11 min: David Silva is finding too much space in dangerous positions. His one-two with Danilo doesn’t quite come off here, though, the pass from Silva too heavy. The ball goes behind for a goal-kick. Adrian takes his sweet time punting it forward and gets a warning from Mike Dean about timewasting. 9 min: City haven’t really got going yet. Adrian hasn’t had anything to do. West Ham have this in the bag. 7 min: Michail Antonio, ever willing, rumbles down the right flank after reaching a long pass. He does well to win a corner. “As a loyal and faithful West Ham fan of many years standing I’m going for a tight, low scoring game which finishes only 7-0 to City,” says Tom Shaw. “One has to be optimistic.” But Tom, City do struggle with corners! What can West Ham do here? They ... almost score. Cresswell curls it in from the right, it’s flicked on and Antonio can’t quite turn it in on the stretch at the far post! 6 min: David Moyes once faced Pep Guardiola in a Champions League quarter-final! 4 min: City are being allowed to do as they please at the moment. West Ham are sitting back and standing off them. They’ve set their stall out already. City win a corner. Silva whips it to the near post and Mangala heads wide under pressure. At which point we get a replay of Sterling’s penalty appeal. There was nothing in it. In fact, it was a bit of a dive from the winger. 3 min: Delph has a pop from 30 yards. No. 2 min: De Bruyne takes the corner short and the ball’s eventually worked into the feet of Sterling. He tries to wriggles through on the right and falls to the turf, turning to Mike Dean and claiming that his heels have been clipped. The referee isn’t interested. Peep! Off we go. Manchester City, in light blue, get the game underway. West Ham are in navy. City are attacking from left to right in the first half and West Ham are immediately into their 10-0-0 formation. Aguero curls a cross to the far post from the left and Masuaku heads behind for a corner. Pablo Zabaleta is given a great reception by the Manchester City fans. Maybe Leroy Sane will take pity on him. There’s talk that West Ham are lining up with a back three. On Sky, Jamie Carragher is asked what he’s expecting from them. “Not much.” The teams are out. We’ll be underway soon. Not that he was to blame, but Adrian was in goal when West Ham lost 6-0 away to Manchester City in their League Cup semi in 2014. Can they go one better today? David Moyes speaks! He notes that West Ham will have to defend well and score some goals. “We’ve made a couple of changes. Two were enforced. Winston Reid was injured and Joe Hart can’t play. We need to make it as hard as possible for them. We’re without at least three centre-halves today. We’re without two or three senior ones who we could have done with. We’re in a difficult run of games. I’m here a couple of weeks and we’ve got a couple of biggies coming up.” What’s the earliest you’ve ever left a game in disgust? Mine is Bolton 4-0 West Ham in December 2006. I walked out when Alan Pardew, who was about to be sacked, subbed off Carlos Tevez after an hour. Kevin Davies had just scored his second. Andre Ayew cost £20m! Marko Arnautovic cost £24m! West Ham have seven outfield players missing and those two are still on the bench! Once you’ve seen a couple of relegations, you can spot the warning signs. Stupid signings. Not enough signings. A miserable start despite a promising run of fixtures. Throwing away points late on. Hammerings. A lack of team spirit. Awful defending. An injury crisis. No fit strikers. Prima donna players. And above all, a failure to realise how bad you are until it’s too late. Manchester City make four changes to the team that beat Southampton on Wednesday. In come Eliaquim Mangala, Danilo, David Silva and Leroy Sane, out go Vincent Kompany, Fernandinho, Ilkay Gundogan and Gabriel Jesus. It’s a fairly strong starting 11. Watch out for Leroy Sane, though - the winger’s a booking away from a ban and the Manchester derby is next week. West Ham also shake things up after their midweek disaster at Goodison Park. Expensive misfits Andre Ayew and Marko Arnautovic are dropped after poor performances against Everton. Michail Antonio starts up front, Edimilson Fernandes comes into a packed midfield, Adrian replaces the ineligible Joe Hart and young Declan Rice replaces the injured Winston Reid in central defence. This is not a line-up to inspire confidence about West Ham’s chances. They’ve arrived in Manchester with a yawning injury list - Sam Byram, Andy Carroll, James Collins, Jose Fonte, Javier Hernandez, Mark Noble and Reid are all out - so there are four untried academy players on the bench. Poor Moyesie. Manchester City: Ederson; Walker, Otamendi, Mangala, Danilo; Delph; Sterling, De Bruyne, D Silva, Sane; Aguero. Subs: Bravo, Yaya Toure, Gundogan, Fernandinho, B Silva, Jesus, Kompany West Ham: Adrian; Zabaleta, Rice, Ogbonna, Cresswell; Obiang, Fernandes, Kouyate; Lanzini, Antonio, Masuaku. Subs: Trott, Johnson, Quina, Sakho, Ayew, Arnautovic, Martinez. Referee: Mike Dean Hello. There was a time when Manchester City and West Ham were spiritual companions, separated by geography but united by farcical tendencies and the irritation of having to live in the shadow of wealthier neighbours. Not so much any more, though. That kind of relationship no longer exists. One party has been life behind to fester in their limitations. For while Cityitis has been eradicated by a combination of oil riches, Catalan genius and a very clever Belgian who’s known as Ginger Kev in Manchester, West Ham remain a ragtag bunch, so bad at this football business that they’re capable of being beaten out of sight by David Unsworth’s Everton, so incompetent they let Wazziesta score a hat-trick against them. This one could get ugly. It could be the footballing equivalent of Homer Simpson pummelling the Hamburglar to death. “Stop! Stop!” we’ll cry, perhaps in the 27th minute, or maybe the 28th. “They’re already dead.” To put it in context, to can get better odds on City winning this 8-0 than West Ham winning 1-0. That might sound absurd, but there’s no failure of logic here. Consider the evidence. City have scored roughly one million goals this season, while West Ham have conceded roughly one million goals and are winless under their inspirational new manager. These are their results since David Moyes replaced Slaven Bilic: 0-2, 1-1, 0-4. They are 19th, have the worst defensive record in the league and have players so slow they’d probably lose a race with a Teletubby. But wait! Haven’t City been a little leggy in the past week? Didn’t they need late goals against Feyernoord, Huddersfield and Southampton? Isn’t there manager more concerned with making sure Nathan Redmond does some dribbles than sorting out his team’s defending at set-pieces? All true. But City can make it 13 successive league wins here, equalling the record jointly held by previous champions (Arsenal in 2001-02, Chelsea last season), and I’ll be calling it one of the greatest acts of heroism in the Premier League era if this is still goalless after 20 minutes. Kick-off: 4pm GMT."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27379","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T00:00:04Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,379","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27379","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27379","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,379","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/speedy/1167","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-11T00:00:31Z","webTitle":"Speedy crossword No 1,167","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/speedy/1167","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/speedy/1167","fields":{"headline":"Speedy crossword No 1,167","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/live/2017/dec/03/bournemouth-v-southampton-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T15:23:59Z","webTitle":"Bournemouth 1-1 Southampton: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/dec/03/bournemouth-v-southampton-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/dec/03/bournemouth-v-southampton-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Bournemouth 1-1 Southampton: Premier League – as it happened","bodyText":"Read Ben Fisher’s match report here. Yes, that was enjoyable and I think a reasonable reflection overall. Southampton were excellent for much of the second half, Redmond making a real difference, and Austin should have added to his goal. But Bournemouth still had their moments too and Ake might have won it with the very last action. A reasonable result for both and there shouldn’t be too much local disappointment. Thanks for your company. Now haste ye here for Manchester City v West Ham with Jacob Steinberg! A fair result, I think. And a really fun game! 90+4 min: Bournemouth win another corner in added-added-time ... and Ake should score after rising to win a free header. Over it goes! 90+3 min: Nope. What a waste. Ibe’s kick curls out of play before reaching the area. 90+2 min: Now Bertrand concedes a corner at the other end after some good battling from Ibe. Fraser is replaced for it by the more physical Afobe. Can they ... ? 90+1 min: Bertrand subsequently causes hilarity with a foul throw. 90 min: Bertrand fizzes in another of those devilish deliveries but it’s flicked away from Austin. The ball remains alive but Romeu blasts over. This has been a superb half of attacking full-back play from Bertrand and has deserved at least one assist. We have three added minutes to see if that changes. 88 min: Fraser, quiet this half, finds space on the left and cuts back but Hoedt is in for a timely block. 86 min: Ibe nibbles at Boufal, who has had an impressive half, and Saints win a very dangerous free-kick near to that left byline. It’s whipped in with pace but glanced away from danger. 85 min: Another Saints change – Gabbiadini for Davis. That’s a positive one, does Pellegrino scent blood? 83 min: Bournemouth spend a long time trying to work something inside the area but Saints’ defensive shape is good and they hold firm. Wouldn’t rule out a late winner for someone ... 81 min: Austin should score! Bertrand whips an absolutely sensational ball over from the byline and Austin, making such a textbook run and leap to the near post, thuds his header over when it should ripple the net! Saints have created so many moments in this half and this one should probably have won them the game. 80 min: Ibe and Wilson link up and the latter ends up running the ball out of play under Bertrand’s challenge, going down to plaintive cries from the support. 79 min: Not quite as close from Redmond as the “ooohs”, let alone Begovic’s dive, suggest but he drills one reasonably close to the target from range. It “stayed hit”. 77 min: Boufal sashays into the box and it takes a couple of Bournemouth players to clear. Lemina is then caught offside. The change has meant Davis moves into Tadic’s position. 76 min: Lemina’s first contribution, a tug back on Cook, earns a booking. 75 min: Now Bournemouth do attack and King comes close! He controls and turns really smartly, fires in a shot that Forster parries, and perhaps the Saints are lucky to see the ball subsequently ping off Wilson and well wide. 74 min: That last corner wasn’t quite as harmless as it seemed – replays show King pulled Hoedt’s shirt and that, my friends, should be a penalty. One apiece now, you might say. Lemina replaces Tadic, in the meantime. 73 min: It’s a good 15 minutes since Bournemouth posed any kind of threat. Will those subs change that? They have been on the rack but that’s been the way of this game – both sides having periods of being well on top. 71 min: Boufal is the latest to have a go, his shot deflecting not too far over. A corner is the result. Howe puffs out his cheeks. The corner from Redmond, a poor one that is easily caught, lets him relax a tiny bit. 70 min: Austin hits the bar! But no, the flag’s up anyway, Austin was rightly called offside after Van Dijk won the first header from a free-kick. 69 min: And they continue to look dangerous. Redmond volley across the box and it’s not far behind Austin – the ball was probably a little too quick. They are playing at a heck of a tempo. And Bournemouth react with two changes that, really, need making – Wilson on for Defoe and Ibe on for Stanislas. 67 min: Begovic claims a Tadic cross but there’s no doubt which way the scales have tipped now. Saints look extremely dangerous. 65 min: A blistering Saints counter should probably end in a goal. It’s a superb, lungbusting run by Bertrand and by the time he reaches the ball Austin is ready for a tap-in inside the six-yard box. But the left-back whips the ball too far ahead of him, when a bit more composure would have laid it on a plate for 2-1! 64 min: Redmond, who is making some very intelligent diagonal runs across the line, isn’t too far from a lofted Boufal ball over the top but Begovic is there first. 63 min: Now it’s anyone’s, this. We can only hope the game stays this open. It had been coming during an intense spell of pressure. Romeu beat the dithering Cook to the ball, finds Redmond on the right and his low delivery is turned in first-time, and so clinically, by Austin. It’s his third in two starts! 60 min: A slick give-and-go between Bertrand and Tadic leads to Begovic saving a certain goal from Austin with a great feet-first challenge. Then another Tadic ball flies across goal, and then Francis somehow blocks from Davis near the line! This is a really good game. 57 min: Cook, Surman and Smith all combine well in a move that sets up Stanislas, whose placed effort takes a deflection and is bundled away well by Forster at the near post! 55 min: King loses Romeu with a wonderful turn and drag back for Stanislas. It draws gasps from the crowd and leads to a flummoxed Romeu fouling the recipient, earning a yellow card for his considerable trouble. 52 min: A Redmond cross hits Cook but the appeals for handball are half-hearted. He’s been a lot more positive since that life-affirming chat with Pep. 50 min: Hoedt gives away a silly free-kick on his old nemesis King out on the right. It’s a fine position, this. And Stanislas delivers really well but nobody is attacking the six-yard box and Van Dijk gets it away. Fraser’s follow-up is blocked but the pressure remains on and King ends up drilling a low, angled cross-shot into the ground that evades the sliding King by a matter of inches! 48 min: Quick start from Saints and nearly an equaliser. Redmond finds Boufal, who tricks inside and forces a very smart low stop from Begovic, who sticks out a hand and then manages to gather. What have they got? A Saints half-time sub. Guardiola Pellegrino has brought Redmond on for Ward-Prowse. Not one that I can pin on the subs. That Hoedt error came from him messing around on the ball outside his own area. Sometimes you have to get rid. We see so many goals like that now. I get that nice, possession football is a laudable goal and when a team like Man City manages it regularly from front to back then it’s delightful. But my personal view is that it’s getting a bit slavish and is costing a lot of teams more than it gains. That half became very entertaining. It took 20 minutes or so but then the chances flowed, both goalkeepers making good saves and Smith claiming what seemed a certain penalty for Bournemouth. Not that it mattered – Fraser opened the scoring after Bournemouth capitalised slickly on a Hoedt error and, although Boufal should have equalised straight afterwards, Howe’s team are just about worth the lead. Back soon! Meanwhile … That Fraser goal has tipped the scales as the teams go in for their cuppa/isotonic energy gel. 45 min: But that should be 1-1! Bertrand finds an advanced position on the left, cuts back to a completely unmarked Boufal, and if he gets it on target it’s going to be a goal. He finds row Z! 44 min: What a time to score the opener there – and I think that, on the basis of the last 20 minutes, Bournemouth deserve it. The hosts go ahead! Hoedt will have to take the blame as, pressed by King, he dallies on the ball and is mugged. Now Bournemouth have a man free if they work the move well, and they do – King finds Surman to his left, and he in turn lays off to Fraser, who finishes crisply under the helpless Forster with his right foot! 39 min: Close to a spectacular opener from Daniels. He sizes up a ball that rolls out towards him, a little to the left and 35 yards out, and smashes the cleanest of first-time efforts a whisker wide of the post. It would have rivalled the goal he put just inside the same frame against Man City. 38 min: Begovic claims very confidently after a Ward-Prowse free-kick darts high into the sky off Francis’s head. 37 min: Smith lashes miles over from close to where he drilled in that almost-assist for Defoe. We don’t all agree about that penalty shout ... 35 min: Daniels looks to pick out Stanislas but the cross drifts beyond him. Howe applauds. After those first 15 minutes or so Bournemouth have looked a threat. 32 min: And now Saints claim a penalty! Begovic makes a fine save from Austin’s far-post header and Francis appears to block Tadic’s follow-up with his arm. But that would have been very harsh – it was whacked straight at him from no distance. This derby has really hotted up, with chances and controversy at both ends. 31 min: ... Smith goes down in the box under Boufal’s challenge and is booked for diving by Jon Moss! But Moss is wrong! Boufal clearly caught him, as it seemed in real time and as replays confirm, and Bournemouth should have been awarded a spot kick. We’ll be hearing a lot more about that, I think ... 30 min: A Bournemouth free-kick in a pretty threatening area, about 30 yards out, promises something but Stanislas’s effort is neither here nor there, really, and takes a couple of deflections before Saints clear. The pressure stays on though and Stanislas lets fly again, seeing his blocked shot spin out for a corner from which ... 28 min: Pied shoots ambitiously wide from 30 yards, but more significant was that seconds previously Austin reached a Boufal cross ahead of Tadic and held it up, when leaving it would have given Tadic at least a half-chance 10 yards out. 26 min: ...which is delivered poorly by Stanislas and lumped away at the near post. 25 min: Van Dijk locates Austin with a lovely diagonal ping but the striker is adjudged to have controlled with his hand. He belts the ball wide of goal angrily. At the other end, Bournemouth corner ... 24 min: Lewis Cook now shows some good initiative, emboldened by the Saints midfield backing off and sending a long-range shot dipping over. 21 min: Encouragement now though! Smith drills in a shot first-time on the right corner of the box, Defoe diverts it instinctively towards goal and Forster, who had been diving the other way, diverts it away absolutely superbly, perhaps with his shoulder! Then he bats away a slightly more regulation Ake header moments later. Still a good stop. From offering nothing, Bournemouth have come close twice in quick succession. 18 min: Southampton continue to look quicker to the ball and more inventive, albeit without creating anything clear cut beyond what was a good headed chance for Van Dijk. Bournemouth just haven’t come out with any of the verve they’d have wanted. 15 min: And it’s Pied again, getting forward and checking inside after his initial cross is blocked. He stands up a second delivery on his left foot and Tadic, jumping from a standing start, nods it fairly comfortably over Begovic’s bar. 14 min: A spell of possession from Bournemouth sees Fraser look to turn into space on the edge of the area but Pied, who has started well, is in sharply. 12 min: Pied puts his best foot forward on the overlap and wins a corner with a searching cross. Ward-Prowse can really whip these in ... and the outswinger is headed just wide by a towering, leaping Van Dijk! 11 min: Not exactly a rattling tempo here, but Saints remain the more convincing. The early exchanges have, in truth, been reasonably conservative overall. 8 min: Better from the home team with Fraser and Stanislas looking to combine, but they still don’t get into the box. 6 min: Saints have definitely made the better start here, Davis now miscuing an awkward ball on the edge of the area that always looked too ambitious for a shot. The ball has bobbled around the Bournemouth box for longer than they’d want so far and they haven’t launched a sortie of their own. 3 min: Great first attack from the visitors now, Boufal slipping a lovely pass to Tadic at the byline and the Serbian laying a ball across for Austin ... who would convert if Ake wasn’t on hand at the near post with a superb tackle. 2 min: Not the most breakneck of starts but some high pressing from Saints forces a bit of Bournemouth looseness in possession at the back. Then Ward-Prowse misplaces a pass for Pied and out it goes. The hosts kick off and go right to left on yer telly. Should have mentioned, by the way – right-back Jeremy Pied will make his first Premier League start under Pellegrino, one of six changes for them. Into the lion’s den for the former Lyon and Nice man ... The teams are walking out! It’s a brisk, boisterous atmosphere out there. The key today might be Bournemouth’s early tempo – if they come out fast, they’ll be a real handful. But when they’re flat, they can be quite flat. In today’s team news, by the way, Lewis Cook is a notable name among six changes to the Bournemouth team – good chance for the England U20 captain to make an impact, it’s only his ninth league start since joining in summer 2016 ... Saints fans, what do you think of your team so far this season? The Everton game seemed much-needed, to me. Speaking as an outsider who only covers them on and off it seems to me they don’t really have a *thing* at the moment; do you see an identity developing under Pellegrino? Does that even matter? Eddie Howe turned 40 on Wednesday. 40! It feels as if he’s been around forever. What a career he has had for one so young. Can Bournemouth give him a slightly late present today? Oh, please do send your emails and tweets in – about anything loosely pertaining to this game. The addresses should be above. Bournemouth: Begovic, Adam Smith, Francis, Ake, Daniels, Stanislas, Lewis Cook, Surman, Fraser, King, Defoe. Subs: Boruc, Steve Cook, Gosling, Pugh, Afobe, Callum Wilson, Ibe. Southampton: Forster, Pied, van Dijk, Hoedt, Bertrand, Davis, Romeu, Ward-Prowse, Tadic, Boufal, Austin. Subs: Yoshida, McCarthy, Lemina, Gabbiadini, Redmond, Hojbjerg, Targett. Referee: Jon Moss Welcome to El ... Coastico? Yeah, El Coastico. Although there are a few who don’t believe this is actually anything of the sort. Look, we do this every year nowadays and let’s agree that it’s a derby but a sort of second-ranking one – like Middlesbrough v Sunderland, say. And this year it’s a pretty important one. Southampton, not quite convincing enough under Mauricio Pellegrino yet despite that big win over Everton last week and a decent showing at Man City, would go into the top half with a win and might be able to start gathering some momentum. They have an excuse to go for it – and besides, does Nathan Redmond really want a post-match ear warming from Eddie Howe? Talking of Eddie Howe, he could do with seeing his team bounce back after a good little revival stalled against Swansea and Burnley. They are a pretty healthy four points clear of the drop now – making it seven should erase memories of a slapdash start to the campaign. Plenty to come on – yes – derby day, then. Stay with us, the teams will be announced shortly ..."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2017/dec/06/country-diary-wenlock-edge-shropshire-sleeping-beauty-spindle-lipstick-berries","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T05:30:08Z","webTitle":"Country diary: Sleeping Beauty knew a thing or two about spindle's tempting lipstick berries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/06/country-diary-wenlock-edge-shropshire-sleeping-beauty-spindle-lipstick-berries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/dec/06/country-diary-wenlock-edge-shropshire-sleeping-beauty-spindle-lipstick-berries","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: Sleeping Beauty knew a thing or two about spindle's tempting lipstick berries","bodyText":"Shocking pink in a winter hedge, as if blown from some forever summer place, it is a colour out of season. And yet the spindle berries are perfectly at home in wood margins and hedges on the limestone of Wenlock Edge. It seems the spindle tree – which can grow six metres (20ft) tall but is usually a shrub – has a minor but magical part in ancient woodland and here associates with ash, field maple and dogwood. It has waxy, serrated-edge leaves, greeny-white four-petalled flowers and these extraordinary lipstick berries, each a four- or five-valved pod holding orange fruits that ripen in November-December. Spindle is a square peg in a round hole, or vice-versa: its green stems begin round, develop a corky bark to become four-cornered, then turn rounder with age. It is named after the stick used to spin and wind thread from wool. In the psycho-mytho-panto of Sleeping Beauty, the goddess is deceived, pricks her finger on the spindle of human ambition, and sleeps until she is woken up by the god of rebirth. It is a winter story. The spindle tree’s Latin name, Euonymus europaea, translated as “good name” or “lucky” may be ironic; eating the berries or leaves, and even breathing the sawdust from its wood, could be highly unlucky. The orange fruits in the pink capsule contain alkaloids, theobromine and caffeinethat can induce a Sleeping Beauty coma, or worse; but for birds they offer the most nutritious of native fruits. The orange aril is rich in lipids, nitrogen and has the highest carotenoids content. Perhaps that is why robin redbreasts are spindle’s most effective distributor; eating the fruit and dropping or regurgitating the toxic seed helps it to germinate more successfully.

Named Lechaion, the port was one of a pair that connected the city of ancient Corinth to Mediterranean trade networks. Lechaion is located on the Gulf of Corinth, while Kenchreai is positioned across the narrow Isthmus of Corinth on the Aegean Sea. These two strategic harbours made Corinth a classical period power, but the Romans destroyed the city in 146 BC when conquering Greece. Julius Caesar rebuilt the city and its harbours in 44 BC, ushering in several centuries of prosperity. Recent excavations by the Lechaion Harbour Project have revealed the impressive engineering of the Roman Empire. Caesar’s Corinthian colony developed into one of the most important ports in the eastern Mediterranean. Ships filled Lechaion with international goods and Corinth became so well known for luxury and vice that a Greek proverb stated, “not everyone can afford to go to Corinth.” However, while ancient coins depict a formidable harbour with a large lighthouse, visible remains of Lechaion are scarce. Visitors to the coastline today can see the foundations of two large structures forming the outer harbour, but otherwise the remains are buried under centuries of sediment. The excavations are beginning to reveal the secrets of this largely forgotten port. The team has found a complex harbour that changed over time. In the 1st century AD, Lechaion had a large outer harbour of 40,000 square meters and an inner harbour of 24,500 square meters. The basins, as well as the approach to the harbour, were delineated by large moles and quays constructed of stone blocks weighing five tons each, including one mole that is 45 metres in length and 18 metres wide. A number of monumental buildings once graced Lechaion, such as a lighthouse that is depicted on coins and a monumental structure on an island in the middle of the inner basin. The island monument remains a mystery, but archaeologists speculate that it could be a religious sanctuary, the base of a large statue, or a customs office. However, the island was used for only a brief period. “The island monument was destroyed by an earthquake between 50 and 125 AD. It may well be the first evidence of the earthquake of circa AD 70 under the emperor Vespasian mentioned in ancient literary sources,” says Guy Sanders, who previously directed excavations at Corinth. By the 6th century AD, a new basin measuring approximately 40,000 square metres had to be constructed to service Byzantine Corinth. Sediment had filled areas of the earlier basins and a huge earthquake lifted the area around Lechaion by over a metre. The stone block structures are impressive feats of engineering, but the project is revealing information about the process of harbour construction through wooden caissons and pilings used as foundations. Wooden elements rarely survive the centuries, but buried underwater deposits are one of the few places where organic materials can be preserved. “For almost two decades I have been hunting for the perfect archaeological context where all the organic material normally not found on land is preserved” says director Bjørn Lovén. While much can be inferred from the stone remains, the discovery of wooden elements provides more insight into the ancient engineering process. Wood is the holy grail for archaeologists and some of the artifacts discovered at Lechaion are so well preserved that they appear as though they were cut yesterday. Lovén says, “I was joking that I would rather find a wooden spoon than a statue, and we did find archaeological layers where almost everything is preserved.” Besides wooden infrastructure, the team excavated delicate organics finds including seeds, bones, part of a wooden pulley, and carved pieces of wood. The archaeologists are also finding evidence of everyday life in ancient Corinth. They have found ceramics that transported trade goods that originate from Italy, Tunisia, and Turkey. Maritime items like anchors and fish hooks tell of life along the seaside. The work at Lechaion is located in shallow water, but it presents several significant challenges. It is a highly active marine environment, which causes the excavation trenches to fill quickly with sediment from wave action. Overnight several tons of sand can build up in the excavation areas. The team is also pushing boundaries with the latest methods scientific methods. Geoarchaeologists used core drilling and drone surveys to map the coastal changes in the area, resulting in the surprising discovery of a new harbour basin. The sediment study is showing how the harbour silted over time and which areas would have been accessible in different periods. The project is using DNA analysis to understand the “genetic landscape” of the trees, plants, and animals that inhabited the region 2,000 years ago. The information from these different scientific methods may one day allow for a reconstruction of Lechaion in each time period. The project is a cooperation between the Danish Institute at Athens, University of Copenhagen, and the Greek Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities. It is directed by Dr Bjørn Lovén and Dr Dimitris Kourkoumelis, as well as assistant directors Paraskevi Micha and Panagiotis Athanasopoulos. The excavation is funded by Her Majesty the Queen Margrethe II’s Archaeological Foundation, Augustinus Foundation, and Carlsberg Foundation. The excavation will continue next year and it is expected to reveal more information about ancient engineering. “The potential for more unique discoveries is mind blowing” says Lovén."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/02/media-needs-police-trust-in-public-interest-full-reporting","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-02T22:02:24Z","webTitle":"There’s a line between exposing a crime and shabby behaviour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/02/media-needs-police-trust-in-public-interest-full-reporting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/02/media-needs-police-trust-in-public-interest-full-reporting","fields":{"headline":"There’s a line between exposing a crime and shabby behaviour","bodyText":"Almost every detective, like almost every journalist, likes inside gossip. It is part of the attraction of both jobs: that ringside seat that allows police officers or reporters to inform friends and colleagues what the “real” story is, who’s lying, from what cloth the emperor’s new clothes are actually cut. No wonder the former detective, Neil Lewis, in the current heated atmosphere of sexually tinged accusation and hot denial, felt the need to share his own inside knowledge of Damian Green’s computer activity. The reasons that prompted the original investigation into Green’s computer life do not reflect particularly well on either Green or the civil servant who leaked him Home Office information and was duly sacked for gross misconduct, as Alan Travis explained in the Guardian. But that still does not mean that everything uncovered in the subsequent police investigation, which Lewis suggests included the extensive use of pornography by Green, should necessarily now be used against him. Back in 1973, the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Robert Mark, encouraged his officers to be as open as possible to the media. In a famous memo, he announced that such an approach involved “risks, disappointments and anxieties” but he stressed that “officers who speak in good faith may be assured of my support, even if they make errors of judgment when deciding what information to disclose”. Lewis may well have felt that he was speaking in good faith as he was backing up his former superior, the former assistant commissioner Bob Quick, and challenging Green’s version of events. Lewis has duly received both support and condemnation from his former colleagues. Just as, in our distant past, no man was a hero to his valet, not many public figures whose lives have been examined in detail by a detective will emerge from scrutiny as the sweet and cuddly souls they might see themselves to be. While covering crime for the Guardian, I met detectives with many amazing tales to tell but who felt that there was usually a line that could be drawn between behaviour that was illegal and should be exposed in the media, and behaviour that was just shabby. We would be horrified if a general practitioner felt impelled to announce that, say, a cabinet minister who pronounced on morality was currently being treated for venereal disease, or if a priest tumbled from his confessional to a television studio to report on the dismal philanderings of one of his respectable flock. Peripheral and disputed information from a police inquiry might seem to come under the same heading. The government cannot be too surprised that they have made enemies of the police service. They have wilfully ignored police advice about the vast personnel cuts that have been imposed on the service which they seem to regard with a patrician disdain. We are in a strange time indeed when a leftwing Labour leader and a Labour London mayor seem to have a greater empathy with the police and their concerns than a Tory-led government. A month ago, I attended a gathering in Bristol of journalists, lawyers, academics and journalism students to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the trial of two reporters and a former soldier charged in 1977 under the Official Secrets Act, which became known as the ABC case after the initials of the three defendants. The information that prompted the arrests and trial was, indeed, in the public interest, and it was heartening to hear speakers stressing the importance of defending the whistleblower and the right to shine a light into dark corners. But the sad thing about the recent events is that they may make both serving and former officers even more reluctant to come forward with information which should certainly be in the public domain. In the wake of the illegal phone-hacking activities of a number of News of the World journalists, the relationship between the police and the media was dramatically changed. “There should be no more improper contact… between the police and the media – that which is of a selfish rather than a public interest,” was the baleful conclusion of the then Met commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, in the wake of the Leveson inquiry. As a result, the police have become nervous of talking off the record to reporters on subjects of genuine importance and we are all the poorer for it.

They decide to adopt her and send her to school, and she becomes a big sister to the son, Roger (Rogerio) Graetz, who is the novel’s narrator. Roger – like Goldman himself – has a Jewish-American father and a Guatemalan mother. Clever, beautiful Flor eventually attends Massachusetts’ prestigious Wellesley College. After graduation, she returns to run an orphanage in Guatemala, where she is murdered. She is accused of running an adoption racket, selling Guatemalan orphans – children of people killed by the military – to rich Americans. Roger and his Guatemalan school friend Luis Moya Martinez, now a newspaper columnist – who both loved the enigmatic Flor – embark on a quest to find out who killed her and why. But they’re on dangerous ground as they delve into her life and loves. Goldman vividly captures the edgy Guatemala of the 1980s, as a bloody civil war rages and death squads operate with impunity. The novel melds personal with political as it segues from coming-of-age tale into whodunnit, history lesson, love story and more. It’s an impressive first book. Goldman covered the Central American wars as a journalist in the 1980s. The President by Miguel Angel Ásturias, translated by Frances Partridge This political satire is an impassioned condemnation of tyranny. Asturias conjures up the nightmarish and paranoid world of a totalitarian regime – a system driven by cruelty, cronyism and corruption. The ruthless president surrounds himself with sycophants and has secret police do his dirty work. His basic tenet is “never to give grounds for hope, and everyone must be kicked and beaten until they realise the fact”. When an army colonel is murdered by a deranged beggar, the president sees an opportunity to manipulate the situation and liquidate his perceived enemies. He tasks his favourite henchman, Miguel Angel Face – “as beautiful and as wicked as Satan” – with setting a trap for a rebellious general. But Angel Face betrays his benefactor, abducts the general’s beautiful daughter, and promptly falls in love with her. Tragedy inevitably follows, and reality overlaps with surreality as the regime’s arbitrariness and abuse of power are starkly revealed. Although the story takes place in an unnamed Latin American country, it is generally taken to be Guatemala in the early 20th century. The Guatemalan novelist was a pioneer of both magic realism and the Latin American sub-genre of the dictator novel. He based The President on Manuel Estrada Cabreras, who ruled from 1898 to 1920. Ásturias, who also enjoyed a diplomatic career, won the Nobel prize for literature in 1967. He died in 1974. Silence on the Mountain: Stories of Terror, Betrayal and Forgetting in Guatemala by Daniel Wilkinson On a research visit to Guatemala in 1993, Wilkinson decides to investigate the torching by guerrillas of the landowner’s house on a coffee plantation a decade earlier. His inquiries lead him into the country’s tortured recent history. As he unravels the mystery of events on La Patria plantation, in Guatemala’s western highlands, Wilkinson also tells the broader tale of the 36-year civil war, which ended in 1996. In 1952, the democratically elected Arbenz government instituted land reform to alleviate the misery of displaced indigenous people and coffee workers. It prompted a CIA-engineered “anti-communist” coup just two years later, heralding Guatemala’s long descent into darkness under murderous military regimes. The ensuing civil war left 200,000 dead – more than 90% killed or “disappeared” by the security forces. Wilkinson focuses on those most affected by the violence. Over many years and visits, he peels away the layers of terror-induced silence and forgetting, and lets people tell their stories – heartbreaking accounts of brutalisation, betrayals and massacres. Ultimately, the most deafening silence is Washington’s, during its decades-long support for some of the worst human rights violators in the Americas. Wilkinson’s eye for detail, doggedness and storytelling skills make his book both engaging and enlightening. The New York-based author, a lawyer at Human Rights Watch, served on Guatemala’s post-conflict truth commission in the 1990s."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/03/with-michael-flynn-singing-mueller-investigation-gets-closer-donald-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T00:05:27Z","webTitle":"Mueller investigation takes a big step closer to Donald Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/03/with-michael-flynn-singing-mueller-investigation-gets-closer-donald-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/03/with-michael-flynn-singing-mueller-investigation-gets-closer-donald-trump","fields":{"headline":"Mueller investigation takes a big step closer to Donald Trump","bodyText":"First came the lie. Then came the cover-up. It’s a classic Washington two-step. And the news that Michael Flynn, a former White House national security adviser, has pleaded guilty to perjury means Donald Trump may soon be dancing to the tune of the special counsel investigating the accelerating Russian influence-peddling scandal. Flynn’s guilty plea rained a cold shower on Trump’s victory parade celebrating a rare success in Congress. After 10 months watching his healthcare plan and other ill-conceived policies being shot down in flames, Trump finally managed to get his tax cuts bill through the Senate late on Friday night. Little matter that the tax changes, which will benefit the richest Americans and big corporations, betray the blue-collar voters who put him in office. Little matter they will add an estimated $1.2tn to the already bloated federal deficit. A win’s a win in Trump’s zero-sum book. But the Flynn affair is a different matter altogether. A former general sacked by Barack Obama, Flynn was best known, until now, for his ferocious attacks on Hillary Clinton before last year’s election. He famously led a chant of “Lock her up” at a Republican party rally. . Now it is Flynn who is staring jail in the face. By admitting he lied to the FBI when he had denied holding secret talks last December with the Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak to illegally subvert Obama administration policy, Flynn has raised the lid on a possible illegal conspiracy reaching all the way to the top. Last night Trump said Flynn’s actions had been “lawful” and said on Twitter that he had fired him “because he lied to the vice president and the FBI”. Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, and several other campaign and transition officials have all denied personal contact, or knowledge of contacts, with the Russians before Trump took office in January. Yet Flynn’s sworn evidence states he either discussed or took orders about his meetings with senior figures in Trump’s team. Kushner was reportedly one of those senior figures. Others in the frame include Donald Trump Jr (Trump’s eldest son), Michael Cohen, a lawyer, and Carter Page, a campaign adviser. Another adviser, George Papadopoulos, recently pleaded guilty to lying to investigators. Trump himself has publicly and repeatedly denied prior knowledge of the contacts with the Russians. The future of his presidency now hinges on the veracity of those statements. Kushner, a close confidant inside the family circle, is plainly in the sights of the special counsel, Robert Mueller. Trump named Kushner his senior adviser on Middle East policy last January. Prosecutors say that, in the previous month, Flynn was directed by a “very senior member” of the Trump team to ask the Russians to help oppose a UN resolution unfavourable to Israel, contrary to Obama’s policy at the time. The unfriendly relationship between Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s rightwing prime minister, and Obama is a matter of record. So, too, are Kushner’s pro-Israel stance and his personal links to Netanyahu, a close family friend who once slept in Kushner’s childhood bedroom in New Jersey. Other people who now occupy top posts in the administration have questions to answer. The transition team was led by Mike Pence, the vice-president. Trump and Pence claimed in February to have been misled by Flynn about his contacts with Kislyak concerning Obama’s imposition of sanctions on Moscow for election meddling. Yet court documents relating to Flynn’s guilty plea say multiple members of the transition team coordinated with Flynn to ask Russia not to retaliate. In the event Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, did not take retaliatory action, which was in itself unusual. The day after Flynn met Kislyak, Trump tweeted from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida that Putin was “very smart” not to hit back. The tweet was retweeted by the Russian embassy. Kislyak has since been recalled and elevated to senatorial rank in Russia’s upper house of parliament. After Trump sacked Flynn in February for supposedly misleading him and Pence, he asked James Comey, the FBI director, whether he could “see your way clear to letting this go, letting Flynn go”, according to Comey’s testimony to Congress. Comey refused. His subsequent sacking by Trump led directly to the special counsel’s appointment. In addition to the alleged Russia conspiracy, Mueller is now investigating whether Trump’s firing of Comey and Flynn was part of an attempted cover-up to conceal the original lie. That would constitute obstruction of justice – a charge of sufficient gravity that, if proved, could spell the end for Trump."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/03/hpv-vaccine-fears-women-health-take-up-falls","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T00:05:27Z","webTitle":"Fears for women’s health as parents reject HPV vaccine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/03/hpv-vaccine-fears-women-health-take-up-falls","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/03/hpv-vaccine-fears-women-health-take-up-falls","fields":{"headline":"Fears for women’s health as parents reject HPV vaccine","bodyText":"Health officials have become increasingly alarmed at campaigns aimed at blocking the take-up of the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine, which protects women against cervical cancer. Three leading nations have now seen major reductions in the take-up of the vaccine and a growing number of doctors fear its use could be blocked elsewhere, despite its capacity to provide protection against a condition that kills hundreds of thousands of women a year. Last week, doctors and health officials gathered in Dublin – centre of one of the most vociferous anti-vaccine campaigns – to discuss future tactics. Many believe the use of social media has added new impetus to anti-vaccine campaigners’ protests, and that this factor has been closely involved in the success of the attacks that have been made on immunisation programmes. “Whenever a new vaccine is introduced, there is always a group of people who say it is unsafe,” said Professor Margaret Stanley of Cambridge University. “But the HPV vaccine seems to raise extraordinary levels of hostility.” Japan, Ireland and Denmark have already witnessed sustained campaigns that have seen take-up rates plummet. (UK take-up rates are high.) In each case, the vaccine – which scientists insist is safe – has been linked to alleged cases of seizures, walking problems, and neurological issues. Photographs have been exchanged and video clips uploaded to YouTube. “The vaccine is given at the age of 13 when young people are highly emotional and react to events very strongly,” said Stanley. “In addition, some parents feel they might be encouraging promiscuity by allowing their daughters to be vaccinated against a virus that spreads through sexual contact. Add to this the use of social media and you have quite an explosive mixture.” The controversy about the HPV vaccine was also raised last week when doctor Riko Muranaka – who has stood up to intimidation from anti-vaccine groups in Japan – was awarded the international John Maddox prize for promoting science in the public interest. In Japan, parents have posted videos of their children online, claiming symptoms of seizures and walking problems were caused by the HPV jab. Japan’s health ministry could find no evidence the vaccine was to blame, but take-up rates have plunged from more than 70% to less than 1%. “With this vaccine we could prevent many deaths from cervical cancer in Japan, but we are not taking the opportunity,” Muranaka said. Delegates in Dublin outlined one possible solution that has been adopted in Austria, where doctors now give the HPV vaccine to both girls and boys (who will gain protection against a form of throat cancer in later life). Crucially, the jab is also given at an earlier age: around nine. “The apparent link with alleged promiscuity is not perceived to be so strong at this age and the timing also comes when children tend to be less emotional,” said Stanley. “Giving the vaccine a few years earlier than at present could be very effective.” Responding quickly to claims of links between outbreaks of ill-health and vaccination is also extremely important, said Heidi Larson, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “England reached 87% full-dose coverage in 2014, having averted a potential public public confidence crisis in 2009 when a 14-year-old girl died after being vaccinated. Health officials expressed concern, promptly investigated the girl’s death and found it unrelated to the vaccine.” For their part, scientists insist that the HPV vaccine is safe and effective. It protects against the two strains of the human papilloma virus that are most commonly linked to cervical cancer, and which account for more than 80% of cases. “Globally there are around 528,000 new cases of cervical cancer and 266,000 deaths linked to human papilloma virus a year,” said Larson. “The HPV vaccine has the potential to eradicate the vast majority of these.” This point was emphasised by Prof Helen Bedford of University College London, who said that although the HPV vaccine had only been in use for around a decade, its benefit were already being observed: “Impressive data are already accumulating to show the impact of the vaccine in reducing HPV infections and pre-cancerous cervical lesions.” In 20 years, that reduction should be mirrored in a corresponding drop in deaths from cervical cancer, added Stanley. “Given that cervical cancer often kills women who are relatively young – sometimes in their 20s or 30s – the benefits of this vaccine are particularly sharp.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/03/britain-first-factionalised-rabble-heavy-drinking-plotting-anti-muslim-violence","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T00:04:26Z","webTitle":"Inside Britain First: ex-member tells of petty rivalries, racism and violent anti-Muslim plots","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/03/britain-first-factionalised-rabble-heavy-drinking-plotting-anti-muslim-violence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/03/britain-first-factionalised-rabble-heavy-drinking-plotting-anti-muslim-violence","fields":{"headline":"Inside Britain First: ex-member tells of petty rivalries, racism and violent anti-Muslim plots","bodyText":"Britain First may have been thrust into the centre of global politics by Donald Trump, but those familiar with the inner workings of the far-right political group portray a factionalised rabble, riven by jealously and petty infighting. People who have mixed with the group’s senior echelons also describe mammoth drinking sessions, threats of violence and boasts of inciting conflict with Britain’s Muslim community. Speaking publicly for the first time, Graham Morris, a former boyfriend of Britain First’s deputy leader, Jayda Fransen – whose anti-Muslim videos were retweeted by Trump last week – said he had left the group because it “was out of control” and some members advocated violence. Morris revealed tensions between the group’s leader, Paul Golding, 35, whom he described as a “narcissist” and who was extremely jealous of his relationship with Fransen, 31. Morris, 54, who lives near Hinckley, Leicestershire, and left Britain First several months ago, also revealed how members would plot large-scale anti-Muslim attacks, describing one such plan hatched after a Britain First demonstration in Birmingham in June. “They were talking about damaging mosques up and down the country, targeting them at the same time. I’ve got a young child, I didn’t want to be part of any mosque attacks, that sort of thing,” he said. He also described how the group’s security guards would be told to “kick people’s doors in”, and that despite the group claiming officially to reject “racial hatred in all forms” some members were openly racist. Experts who have followed the rise of Britain First insist that President Trump’s extraordinary intervention will ultimately fail to have an electoral impact. Despite having 1.9m Facebook likes and 27,000 Twitter followers, the group is believed to have attracted fewer than 1,000 members. Matthew Collins, of the anti-fascist group Hope Not Hate, said: “It has internal difficulties and ongoing legal cases that have very little to do with politics and more to do with the culture of the party, which is one of jealousy, drinking and intimidation. There’ll be no political gain and they won’t be standing in more elections, they’ll just intimidate more people and beg for more money.” Collins said that, despite last week’s massive publicity, the party was unlikely to avert what he called a gradual decline. “The nature of Britain First is that during the last six to 12 months it has become more and more extreme, returning to its British National party roots and the relationship between its senior members is unlikely to be repaired.” Morris, who said he became involved with Britain First earlier this year because of his concerns over sharia law, said he quickly became disillusioned with its racist and violent tendencies. On Friday Fransen threatened New York Times reporters who sought to interview her with “home visits of their own”. Morris’s misgivings first began during the Britain First protest in Birmingham in June when Fransen invited his 10-year-old son on to the stage. “She was asking me to bring my son to the demonstration and then she took him on stage, then there was a picture of my son on stage, used in a publicity stunt, like some sort of poster boy. I wasn’t very happy with that and we started falling out,” added Morris, who said that he had contacted the police regarding harassment since he had left the group."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/02/alan-milburn-government-not-comitted-to-social-mobility","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-02T22:22:00Z","webTitle":"The government is unable to commit to the social mobility challenge | Alan Milburn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/02/alan-milburn-government-not-comitted-to-social-mobility","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/02/alan-milburn-government-not-comitted-to-social-mobility","fields":{"headline":"The government is unable to commit to the social mobility challenge","bodyText":"Dear Prime Minister, It is with regret that I am writing to stand down as chair of the Social Mobility Commission with immediate effect. I do so with much sadness. I was appointed chair by the coalition government in 2012 and my term of office has come to an end. I understand the current government will launch an open process for a new chair in 2018. I will not be applying. I am deeply proud of the work the commission has done to champion the case for greater fairness in Britain. Our research and advocacy work has helped put social mobility at the heart of the national debate about the future of our country. All the main political parties now espouse a Britain that is less elitist and more equal, while growing numbers of employers, universities, colleges, schools and councils have developed a shared determination to create a level playing field of opportunity in our country. I would like to pay tribute to my vice-chair Gillian Shephard for her outstanding work over the last few years: similarly, my fellow commissioners Paul Gregg and David Johnston. They have all been a joy to work with. From the outset, all have discharged their role as commissioners in a non-partisan way. I would also like to thank the secretariat team that have supported us throughout. The cross-party and independent nature of the commission has been one of its great strengths. For almost a decade, I have been proud to serve under Labour, coalition and Conservative governments in various social mobility roles. I remain deeply committed to the issue, but I have little hope of the current government making the progress I believe is necessary to bring about a fairer Britain. It seems unable to commit to the future of the commission as an independent body or to give due priority to the social mobility challenge facing our nation. It is disappointing, indeed puzzling, that appointments to key commission roles have been left vacant for almost two years. Nor do the protracted discussions about its role, remit and resourcing show any sign of being resolved. Individual ministers such as the secretary of state for education have shown a deep commitment to the issue. But it has become obvious that the government as a whole is unable to commit the same level of support. It is understandably focused on Brexit and does not seem to have the necessary bandwidth to ensure that the rhetoric of healing social division is matched with the reality. I do not doubt your personal belief in social justice, but I see little evidence of that being translated into meaningful action. The need for political leadership in this area has never been more pressing. Social mobility is one of the biggest challenges facing our country today. It is not just the poorest in society who are losing out. Whole communities and parts of Britain are being left behind economically and hollowed out socially. The growing sense that we have become an “us and them” society is deeply corrosive of our cohesion as a nation. As the commission’s work has demonstrated, the 20th-century expectation that each generation would do better than the last is no longer being met. At a time when more and more people are feeling that Britain is becoming more unfair, rather than less, social mobility matters more than ever. While the government seems unable to devote the necessary energy and focus to the social mobility agenda, I have been heartened that others in civil society – from local councils to major employers – are actively embracing it. So I will be establishing a new social mobility institute, independent of the government and political parties, to take forward the practical work that is needed to make a reality of my belief in a fairer, more open, more mobile society in Britain.

That I should be unnerved about the likes of new improved prototype Harmony and her promise of brushed-plastic erotica. Not that I judge Harmony – what human woman hasn’t shown off to a man in a bar about her gifts for “internal heating” and “self-lubrication”? Hey ladeez, we all use what we’ve got, right? Nor is it Harmony’s fault that she exists. In fact, perhaps there are other women like me, who (whisper it) almost feel sorry for her. It makes sense that women especially might be disturbed by sex-bots. There are vastly more of the female variety and it’s all a bit Stepford Men’s Association: femme machines drafted in to replace the “faulty” (assertive, rebellious, breathing) real versions. In a certain vision of male utopia, instead of real women and their buzzkill notions about equality and self-will, men would return home to find chick-bots such as Harmony clattering around the kitchen, in the manner of an eroticised C-3PO. Perchance Harmony would proffer a chicken ready-meal, purring electronically: “You must maintain energy so that, later, you are able to sexually satisfy me with your unusually large phallus.” And if Harmony accidentally ingested a splash of gravy, her face melted and her breasts started rotating anti-clockwise, then she could always be sent back to the workshop for an upgrade. Or a service man could pop around and fix the boiler at the same time. However, let’s not get too ahead of ourselves – that’s the glorious AI/porn crossover future. Right now, the sex robots that were born out of pornography seem doomed to reflect their source in all the usual derogatory, dehumanising, misogynistic ways, while adding a few more for good measure. It’s telling that these robots only endeavour to be “realistic” when it comes to their techno-squelchy sexual parts, while remaining unrealistic in terms of female beauty and everyday relationship interaction. Or maybe I’m wrong and they’ll be programmed to say: “Take me, big boy… and also take the bins out.” It’s also tragic to think of humans having sex, not with each other, but with something that has more in common with an interactive (albeit very turned-on) Furby. Couldn’t humankind, even at its loneliest, and most damaged, do a bit better than that? Some might say, what about those women who buy realistic baby dolls – isn’t that also satisfying a basic human need? And what about women who buy vibrators? However, from the looks of it, women who buy baby dolls don’t feel angry or controlling towards real babies, nor rejected by them. Nor is anyone claiming that vibrators replace the whole man. This may be the core difficulty with sex-bots – not that they replicate sex, but that they represent how some men want to replace and improve upon real women and not just physically. That they appeal to men who are only interested in almost silent, but always compliant, sexually available “women”, for whom self-will is always a microchip away. Then again (silver lining!), what woman would want to have sex with the kind of men who would buy eroto-bots anyway? This mentality has long existed in some shape or form and, if now these men are going to be busy playing with sex-bots, and no longer bothering, boring, or unnerving real women… well, hallelujah for that! This is why, far from bridling at being replaced, some women may just feel bizarrely, irrationally sorry for Harmony and her porno-bot sisters. We know what’s coming, so to speak. Indeed, considering the types of men who would buy sex-bots, it doesn’t seem too much of a loss for womankind; if anything, it borders on a boon. A case of: “Great, replace us, go ahead!”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/03/trumps-contempt-illuminates-britains-fragile-place-in-the-world","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T00:05:27Z","webTitle":"Trump’s contempt illuminates Britain’s fragile place in the world | Andrew Rawnsley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/03/trumps-contempt-illuminates-britains-fragile-place-in-the-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/03/trumps-contempt-illuminates-britains-fragile-place-in-the-world","fields":{"headline":"Trump’s contempt illuminates Britain’s fragile place in the world","bodyText":"Remember the Taming of the Trump? When his election stunned the planet, there were quite a lot of cool voices on both sides of the Atlantic who contended that the 45th president of the United States would be tempered by power. Appearing to mistake him for a fine wine, they argued that he could be “matured”. Encumbered by the great responsibilities of the office, contained by the institutions of the United States and modulated by the American diplomatic establishment, he would evolve into a president traditional allies of the United States could handle. It wouldn’t be easy – few were foolish enough to believe that – but it would be manageable. That view was especially prevalent in the upper reaches of the British government this time last year. While much of the world reacted to him with fear and foreboding, sanguinity flowed through the blood of much of London SW1. Whenever I expressed scepticism about this taming thesis, members of the government told me to hang on to the idea that he was a businessman. “Always remember that,” said one phlegmatist in the cabinet. “He likes to cut a deal.” Number 10 gambled that Theresa May could keep the relationship special, even with a president as reckless as he was narcissistic, as inconstant as he was inflammatory and as contemptuous of the established norms of international diplomacy as he was of the conventional decencies of democratic politics. Mrs May made a dash across the Atlantic to call at the White House in his first week in residence. There was little in common between a prime minister brought up in an Oxfordshire rectory and Donald “grab them by the pussy” Trump. The vicar’s daughter tried to gloss it as best she could by claiming that “opposites attract”. The ticket price for that audience was far too high. She flattered his vanities by issuing an invitation to pay a state visit to Britain, an honour accorded to very few previous presidents and never so early. “Pimping out the Queen”, as I rather rudely called it, was controversial enough when the invitation was first issued and has since become a hideous albatross around Mrs May’s neck. Another cost of supping with too short a spoon was to her dignity and her country’s reputation. The apologists had an answer to all that. Britain has to have a relationship with the United States, whoever is in the White House. “Hug them close” has been the lodestar of British foreign policy since the Second World War. The perceived imperative to cleave tight to Washington was increased by Brexit. When Britain was separating itself from one historic partnership, it could not afford to break with the president of the United States at the same time. Yet that is happening anyway. Britain is confronted with the simultaneous fracturing of its two most important relationships, on the one side because of choices Britain has made and, on the other, because of choices America has made. Even before the extraordinary rupture of the past few days, Anglo-American relations were in a bad way. It is true that co-operation has continued at an institutional level. I don’t doubt it when Amber Rudd, the home secretary, says that intelligence-sharing about terrorism has saved British lives. At a political level, Mrs May’s misjudged sycophancy has been reciprocated with nothing but grief. Donald Trump has torn up America’s commitment to treaties tackling climate change, a subject into which Britain has put a lot of effort under successive prime ministers since Margaret Thatcher became convinced that global warming was a threat. He has threatened to unravel the nuclear deal with Iran, another issue on which Britain has expended considerable diplomatic energy. This has been accompanied by a series of rows over trade that ought to have exploded the notion that Britain will be rewarded for leaving the EU with a generous deal from the United States. This crisis in Anglo-American relations has been brought into sharp focus by the president’s endorsement of anti-Muslim hate videos manufactured by a far-right splinter of the racist British National party. When his retweet amplified attention for their vile output, you had to suspect that he had no, or little, idea who they were. That makes it even less excusable. Mrs May was right to call Britain First a “hateful organisation”. Saying: “It is wrong for the president to have done this” was the most diplomatic form of rebuke that she could have mustered in the circumstances. It was then a typically Trumpian choice to escalate with contemptuous personal abuse of the prime minister – after he’d first mistakenly directed the attack on a self-described “mum from Bognor” who has a similar Twitter handle to that of the prime minister. This takes us into unvisited territory. There have been plenty of rocky stretches in the Anglo-American relationship, but never before has there been such a vividly public breach between the occupants of the Oval Office and Downing Street. I cannot recall a precedent for the British ambassador in Washington formally complaining to the White House about the behaviour of the president. Demands for him to make an apology are highly unlikely to be satisfied. He doesn’t do sorry. The Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi has sent a letter, volunteering to take Donald Trump on a guided tour of British cities to “see how our Muslim communities live peaceably alongside others, enrich their local areas and contribute so much to society”. That’s a sweet idea, but I can’t see it happening. Labour’s Paul Flynn proposes that the president should be arrested for inciting racial hatred. This will be a popular idea, but it is not a terribly realistic one. The Tory Peter Bone voices the hope that Mrs May can persuade Donald Trump to terminate his Twitter account. Good luck with that. The only practical sanction available to Britain is to cancel the invitation to a state visit, which would win Mrs May plenty of plaudits here, at the cost of intensifying the conflict with the White House. The chances of the state visit happening were anyway receding towards zero. Number 10 does not deny that it could be delayed until 2019, which sounds like a euphemism for never. There is now also a cloud of doubt over whether a “working visit” to open the new US embassy in London in the new year will happen. If there is anything positive to be said about all this, it is that it ought to burn away some of the residual illusions about where Britain is going to be left once it has quit the European Union. One of the arguments advanced by the Brexiters was that we could risk a detached relationship with the EU because there was always America to fall back on, a better friend anyway, in their world view. Loosed from its moorings to Europe, Britain would take to the global high seas and thrive as a member of the “Anglosphere”. Barack Obama, when he was leader of the “Anglosphere”, tried to puncture that myth. He came here during the referendum campaign to warn that a Brexit Britain could not expect any special deals on trade from the United States, which would always look to its own interests first. This caution did not have the effect on public opinion that was hoped for by Remain campaigners, perhaps because people felt he was only saying it to try to do a favour for David Cameron. It has taken Mr Obama’s brutish successor to give a raw lesson to Britain about the realities of the so-called special relationship. America is a very powerful country, with strong historical bonds and contemporary links with Britain, but it is not on the planet to be our patron. It has its ambitions and priorities; we have ours. Sometimes, those ambitions and priorities elide; sometimes, they are in tension. Sometimes, America will have a president most Britons will like; sometimes, it will have a president who appals most Britons, although it has never before had a president who has united MPs of all complexions in such vigorous condemnation. I used to think Britain had handled its retreat from empire and decline from great power status as well as could be reasonably expected. Post-imperial Britain cleverly leveraged additional influence through its alliances with the United States and the EU. We gained traction with each through the relationship with the other and had more weight with the rest of the world from our connections to both. That intricate and subtle matrix, built up over decades of alliance building, has been imperilled in barely over a year. It was not Britain’s choice to have the Oval Office occupied by Donald Trump and his presidency would be a nightmare to navigate for any prime minister. It was Britain’s narrow choice to leave the EU. And it was the May government’s decision to pursue one of the harder – in all senses of the word – versions of Brexit. This is Britain’s self-inflicted snare: to be rupturing its relationship with its traditional partners on its own continent, just as its traditional ally across the Atlantic has gone rogue. Think of this as the latest lesson in the nation’s continuing and expensive education about how lonely life can be for a prosperous, middleweight country without reliable friends in a tempestuous world. The water in the mid-Atlantic is deep and the sea temperature is icy cold."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/03/durham-university-snobbery-elitism-miners-strike","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T00:04:26Z","webTitle":"Sneering at miners reflects a deeper malaise in our universities | Meg Kneafsey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/03/durham-university-snobbery-elitism-miners-strike","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/03/durham-university-snobbery-elitism-miners-strike","fields":{"headline":"Sneering at miners reflects a deeper malaise in our universities","bodyText":"Last week, Durham University’s Trevelyan College rugby team cancelled a miners’ strike-themed party after receiving almost universal condemnation. The event, which encouraged students to don “flat caps [and] filth” in an attempt to depict the Thatcher government’s confrontation in 1984, was derided by the Durham Miners’ Association for trivialising the strike and referring to the miners in derogatory terms. The university, to its credit, joined in, promptly condemning the rugby team. Yet, as a recent graduate of Durham, I can tell you it isn’t the first, and certainly won’t be the last, instance of cultural elitism on campus. One of the great aspects of Durham University is its student-led approach. Students are encouraged to organise everything, from freshers’ week to university balls to college finance. However, this laissez-faire attitude has its downsides. The university allows plenty of appalling behaviour to go unchecked. The underlying problems are not just about flippant students; they go much deeper and reflect a wider issue of the social background of the student body. The collegiate system, for all its obvious benefits, mirrors a boarding school, where you live and eat among your peers, sing tribal college songs and have inter-college rivalry. Within its walls, Durham’s colleges are palaces of decadence: grade-listed accommodation, black tie formal dinners, balls and annual skiing trips. All of this helps to foster an exclusive culture. For the socially privileged, it is business as usual. They have no problem settling in to a culture they are already familiar with. Poorer students, by contrast, are often struck by the difference to their own experience. Additionally, even if they wanted to embrace much of what’s on offer, they couldn’t necessarily afford to do so. For example, balls can cost around £100 a ticket; the skiing trip is at least £399; a compulsory gown to wear at formals costs £53. Of course, students can choose not to go to these events, but this simply means that only those from wealthy backgrounds can participate in the popular social events and networking opportunities. The university also has a habit of raising accommodation fees. In 2011, the university increased accommodation fees by 13.4%. Although it has since agreed to only raise accommodation in line with inflation, the recent 3.5% increase for 2018 means that a term-time catered room is now £7,422 a year. (Many of the colleges are exclusively catered and freshers are required to live in college in their first year.) At the same time, involvement with the community is limited to outreach programmes and the occasional interaction with the catering staff. This is not a problem confined to Durham, but is so much more obvious when the disconnect between the student body and local people is acute. Universities are supposed to be melting pots of ideas and disciplines, bringing together people from all backgrounds in the shared pursuit of intellect and progress. They offer a chance for people to widen their perspective and learn about others. Instead, Durham creates a bubble where the student body is monolithic, reflecting that of its most privileged students. Consequently, the privileged move seamlessly from one echo chamber to the next, never having their world view truly challenged. Young people make mistakes and everyone deserves a second chance. However, while ill-informed events such as Trevelyan’s rugby social might appear trivial now, they are a worrying sign for the future. People from privileged backgrounds continue to dominate top professions disproportionately, from business to the judiciary to the government, and they have often attended top institutions such as Durham. Yet these people are surrounded only by others like themselves for their entire lives, leading to a lack of sensitivity towards those outside their social clique and, perhaps more alarmingly, a narrower intellectual perspective. Until our top universities commit to diversity in education, another generation of privileged graduates will continue to live and rule according to own limited world view. This article was amended on 7 December 2017 to remove two incorrect references: one to student intake from state schools and another on the wages of catering staff."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/03/michael-flynn-plea-agreement-mueller-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T07:00:35Z","webTitle":"Was Michael Flynn asked to wear a wire in Mueller hunt for evidence on Russia?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/03/michael-flynn-plea-agreement-mueller-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/03/michael-flynn-plea-agreement-mueller-russia","fields":{"headline":"Was Michael Flynn asked to wear a wire in Mueller hunt for evidence on Russia?","bodyText":"The least-noticed sentence in Michael Flynn’s plea agreement with special counsel Robert Mueller may also be the most important one. Section eight of the deal reached by Donald Trump’s former national security adviser in the inquiry into Russian meddling in the US election is entitled “cooperation”. It specifies that as well as answering questions and submitting to government-administered polygraph tests, Flynn’s cooperation “may include … participating in covert law enforcement activities”. Long-time students of federal law enforcement practices agreed, speaking anonymously, that “covert law enforcement activities” likely refers to the possibility of wearing a concealed wire or recording telephone conversations with other potential suspects. It is not known whether Flynn has worn a wire at any time. “If the other subjects of investigation have had any conversations with Flynn during the last few months, that phrase must have all of them shaking in their boots,” said John Flannery, a former federal prosecutor in the southern district of New York. “The one who must be particularly terrified is [Trump son-in-law and adviser] Jared Kushner, if he spoke to the special counsel’s office without immunity about the very matter that is the subject of Flynn’s plea. I think he must be paralyzed if he talked to Flynn before or after the investigators debriefed him.” Flynn has admitted that he willfully and knowingly made materially “false, fictitious and fraudulent” statements to the FBI on 24 January 2017 – four days after Donald Trump became president. Former FBI director James Comey has testified before Congress that before Trump fired him, the president asked him to end the investigation of Flynn. Although the date when Flynn began to cooperate with Mueller’s investigation is not yet public, at least one prominent Republican donor was telling friends in July this year that Flynn was already doing so. At the very least, the terms of Flynn’s co-operation raise the possibility that he may have covertly recorded some of his conversations. Flynn’s lawyer, Robert Kelner, did not respond to requests for comment about whether his client had worn a wire or had taped telephone conversations. Since there was no legal requirement for Mueller to include this information about covert law enforcement activities in the plea agreement, Flannery believes it was put there “to put the fear of God” into anyone who may have given the special counsel answers that conflict with Flynn’s information. The main clue in the plea agreement about the importance of the information Flynn has already provided lies in the discrepancy between the maximum penalty for the crime he has admitted and the maximum sentence the special counsel has promised to recommend. According to the document made public on Friday, Flynn could have been sentenced to as much as five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. As long as he cooperates in full with all of the special counsel’s requests, the document says the “estimated sentencing guidelines” range from zero to six months, with a possible fine of between $500 and $9,500. The proposed sentencing reduction also partly takes into account the fact Flynn has no criminal record. “No prosecutor I know would agree to reducing a sentence that dramatically unless the witness had provided very significant information about at least one other target of his investigation,” Flannery said. “You wouldn’t get such a low sentence unless you had implicated a big target. The person that you’re lifting up allows you to sit on the ground.” The plea agreement, dated 30 November 2017, requires Flynn to cooperate “fully, truthfully, completely and with this Office and other Federal, state and local law enforcement authorities identified by this Office in any and all matters as to which this Office deems the cooperation relevant”. If Flynn refuses to cooperate fully, “the agreement will be considered breached by your client.” The agreement says any breach will have a serious impact on Flynn’s sentence. Experts said it was notable Flynn pleaded guilty to a criminal information instead of being indicted by a grand jury. By avoiding the use of a grand jury, Mueller had the flexibility to reach an agreement with Flynn at any time. He also increased the chances that his negotiations would remain secret until he chose to make them public."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27380","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T00:00:16Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,380","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27380","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27380","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,380","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/speedy/1169","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T00:00:07Z","webTitle":"Speedy crossword No 1,169","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/speedy/1169","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/speedy/1169","fields":{"headline":"Speedy crossword No 1,169","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/02/momentum-let-us-choose-candidates-labour-letters","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-02T21:00:22Z","webTitle":"Momentum should let us choose our own candidates | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/02/momentum-let-us-choose-candidates-labour-letters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/02/momentum-let-us-choose-candidates-labour-letters","fields":{"headline":"Momentum should let us choose our own candidates","bodyText":"We are writing in utmost protest concerning the actions of some members of the national executive committee to overturn the decision of the democratically elected selection committee for shortlisted applicants for the PPC of Watford by the unilateral imposition of an applicant, Mike Hedges from Islington. Watford is a key marginal and any perception that a candidate is being imposed on local people by Labour party HQ or an affiliated union will end up handing this seat to the Tories. We lost by 2,000 votes at the last election. We need this seat to form a Labour government under Jeremy’s leadership. As democratically elected members of the selection committee, who took their responsibilities extremely seriously, we are furious that an observer of the panel has behaved in a way which is incongruous with his engagement with us. Prior to the long listing meeting on Tuesday 21 November, we took care to review the procedures to ensure that the process was clear and invested significant time in reviewing applications. We understood that any applicant securing the nomination of one or more of our CLP-affiliated unions would automatically be long listed. We sought confirmation with regards to the need to put any such applicant directly through to the short list and we have it in writing that this was not a requirement, but that the nomination must be given full consideration by the committee. At the shortlisting meeting on Sunday 26 November all the interviews, discussions, and decisions were observed by both the regional representative and the NEC representative. Clarification was sought by a member of the committee as to whether the applicant with affiliated union nominations should be automatically shortlisted, and once again it was confirmed by these representatives that this was not the rule but that his nomination should be given full consideration. This applicant was discussed at length; including his support by the unions and his performance in both his written application and the interview. The fact that the applicant claimed support of other unions, not affiliated to Watford CLP, was also considered by the committee in making its decision. The procedure says that the NEC representative must be satisfied that the shortlist is of the highest possible quality. Adding an applicant who was not ranked ‘by the selection committee’ as one of the better candidates goes counter to this requirement and cannot be right. Both the regional and the NEC representatives confirmed in the meeting Mike Hedges’ nomination had been given full consideration and this is in writing. Both the representatives readily accepted the four shortlisted candidates decided upon by the selection committee. There was little dissent about the four, there was an almost unanimous consensus on the short list and both the Regional representative and the NEC representative complimented the committee, and the procedures secretary, on a well-run process with full discussion of each of the applicants. Every applicant, including Mike Hedges, answered yes to the question “do you believe the procedure to have been conducted fairly”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/23/read-it-and-weep-meet-the-man-waging-a-weekly-protest-at-trump-tower","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-23T09:00:17Z","webTitle":"Read it and weep: meet the man waging a weekly protest at Trump Tower","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/23/read-it-and-weep-meet-the-man-waging-a-weekly-protest-at-trump-tower","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/23/read-it-and-weep-meet-the-man-waging-a-weekly-protest-at-trump-tower","fields":{"headline":"Read it and weep: meet the man waging a weekly protest at Trump Tower","bodyText":"Anti-Trump protest has taken many forms over the past year, but perhaps none have been so consistent and subtle as Jeff Bergman’s Friday lunchtime vigil in the cavernous, echoing lobby of the 58-storey, 664ft-high glass edifice that is Trump Tower. Just past a Secret Service security checkpoint and more or less opposite the site of an Ivanka Trump store that has been scheduled to open this fall, Bergman, founder of Learn as Protest, reads from literature, speeches and editorials he considers an apt counterpoint to the manifest shortcomings of a president notorious for his resistance to the written word. “This is a sustained, non-violent resistance,” he says. “The point is, to learn as a form of protest. So we come here and we read aloud.” When Trump proposed a ban on immigrants from select Muslim-majority countries, Bergman read from Beyond Vietnam, a speech Martin Luther King Jr gave in 1968. At other times, he’s chosen from King’s Letter from Birmingham Jail; William Butler Yates’s Second Coming; Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s We Should All Be Feminists; Langston Hughes’s Let America Be America Again. At one reading, while the Republican party was still drawing up its cuts-for-the-wealthy tax bill, Bergman chose an extract from The Great Gatsby in which F Scott Fitzgerald describes the obnoxious self-entitlement of super-rich, racist Tom Buchanan. As Bergman starts to read, Secret Service officers nearby are nonplussed. “Wish I had the time to protest,” says one. In a second reading, Bergman pulled out a copy of the New York Times editorial on the Republican tax cuts, alongside a photograph of the US treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, and his wife, actor Louise Linton, posing with sheets of newly printed dollar bills. “We could equally stand here and read Eugene Debs, the early 20th-century socialist party leader, or Howard Zinn, author of A People’s History of the United States.” But there is a larger political point to make. The lobby of Trump Tower, the first-floor sky lobby and a fifth-floor balcony are privately owned public open spaces (Popus) and designated as such in a 1978 zoning deal that, in exchange, gave Trump rights to add 20 storeys, including what would become his gaudy, faux Louis XIV-decorated expansive triplex. There are more than 500 Popus spaces in the city, many barely recognized. But in the aftermath of the 2016 election, as Trump Tower became a focus of intense protest, it was ringed by Department of Sanitation dump trucks as a security measure. “It felt more like Trump Tower with a red carpet than the White House North,” says Bergman. “I knew it was my right to be in here, and I wanted to use his space against him as a place to voice opposition.” Anti-Trump protesters never penetrated the lobby, and life continued as it always had. The Trump cafe, the Trump gift shop, the Trump buffet, various cottage industry enterprises relating to Trump children all held spaces within the brass, marble and glass Trump Tower, itself the realization of a Trump childhood dream. “At the beginning, when this was the seat of power between the election and the inauguration, it felt subversive to stand here and hold a book.” A year on, Bergman adds, “it still feels like contested space. But now, instead of protesters, it’s occupied by Secret Service and law enforcement.” Over the course of the year, Bergman stood witness to the strangeness of the Trump environment. He was here when the president-elect handed his sons Eric and Donald Jr control of the Trump Organization. The hand-off was symbolized by a pile of manila-folders stuffed with papers. “More than likely, totally blank,” Bergman says. It’s a theme Bergman likes to follow. He’s spent enough hours in the lobby to have gained a deep appreciation of the emptiness at the heart of Trump’s dystopian dreamscape. “You hear the tinkle of the golden-shower 60ft waterfall, and the Mel Tormé over the speakers, but you don’t really hear it but you know what you’re hearing. It’s an echo of the space, but without any content.” The tower itself is beginning to empty out. At one point in the past year, 10% of the building’s 231 units were for sale or for rent, according to Vanity Fair. Famous (and infamous) residents have included Michael Jackson and Liberace. Aside from the building’s namesake, the most famous resident may now be indicted Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, who offered his apartment, 43G, as collateral for his $10m bail application in November. A high proportion of apartments are registered to corporate or otherwise anonymous owners. “For these residents – who feel safer having their bags checked by police, or being stopped by Secret Service agents on their way back from getting a cup of coffee – the scanners at the entrance, the police and the Secret Service hanging around in the stairwells after Trump’s election have been a godsend,” says the magazine.

Lee Gregory gave Millwall the lead against the run of play, before David Brooks’ spectacular finish made it 1-1 at half-time. Defender Mahlon Romeo and Jake Cooper scored in the second half to seal a surprise win, and leave Chris Wilder’s side six points behind second-placed Cardiff, who beat Norwich on Friday. Bristol City climbed to third in the table on goal difference after a 2-1 win over Middlesbrough in the late kick-off. Joe Bryan opened the scoring for Lee Johnson’s side, who had a suitably festive gif ready for the occasion. Jamie Paterson volleyed the second moments later, and the hosts held on despite Hordur Magnusson’s own goal. City go to Bramall Lane next Friday as both sides seek to catch the top two. Ipswich Town prevailed in a six-goal thriller between two play-off chasing sides at Portman Road. The hosts twice took the lead in the first half but Nottingham Forest bounced back with well-taken goals from Kieran Dowell and Tyler Walker. Mick McCarthy’s side proved too strong after the break, Martyn Waghorn’s 10th goal of the season and a Bersant Celina strike sealing a 4-2 win. Derby County also boosted their promotion hopes with a hard-fought win over local rivals Burton. The visitors held on but Johnny Russell’s 81st-minute winner leaves the Brewers bottom. Burton replace Bolton Wanderers, who climbed out of the bottom three with a 3-1 home win over Barnsley. Gary Madine converted Mark Little’s cross to put the hosts ahead, before the sides exchanged penalties, Madine restoring Bolton’s lead after Tom Bradshaw’s spot kick. Little added a third from the edge of the area with 20 minutes to go. Hull City earned a valuable point – and eased the pressure on manager Leonid Slutsky – after Michael Dawson poked home a stoppage-time equaliser at Sheffield Wednesday. Hull were one of only two sides to get a result on the road in Saturday’s 3pm games – no prizes for guessing the other, as Reading extended Sunderland’s winless run at home in Chris Coleman’s first game in charge. QPR are edging towards the drop zone after a 1-0 defeat at Preston. The visitors held on for more than an hour after Jamie Mackie’s red card, but Jordan Hughill struck with two minutes to go. Alex Baptiste was sent off for QPR in stoppage time as Ian Holloway’s side finished with nine men. Finally, one statistical study this week showed Brentford may be better than their mid-table position. Dean Smith’s team made a start on putting that right against West London rivals Fulham. Sergi Canos and Romaine Sawyers put the hosts in front after Neeskens Kebano’s opener, before Denis Odoi was dismissed for Fulham. Ollie Watkins struck with five minutes to go to make sure of the win. Results: Bolton Wanderers 3-1 Barnsley, Brentford 3-1 Fulham, Derby County 1-0 Burton Albion, Ipswich Town 4-2 Nottingham Forest, Millwall 3-1 Sheffield United, Preston North End 1-0 QPR, Sheffield Wednesday 2-2 Hull City, Sunderland 1-3 Reading. FA Cup Just three years after rising from the ashes of Hereford United, seventh-tier Hereford FC are in the hat for Monday’s third round draw after a 1-1 draw with Fleetwood. The Bulls’ previous incarnation had plenty of FA Cup history, and Calvin Disley continued that tradition by putting the visitors ahead in Lancashire. Devante Cole levelled soon after but the non-league team held on to earn a replay. Two other prospective giant-killers gave league teams a fright before falling short. In the lunchtime game, Oxford City twice equalised against League Two high-flyers Notts County, but were denied by Jorge Grant’s last-gasp winner. National League side Maidstone United took a half-time lead at MK Dons through Magnus Okuonghae, but faded in the second half to lose 4-1. Elsewhere, Forest Green turned a 2-1 deficit in the 88th minute into a 3-2 lead, but were pegged back by Jayden Stockley’s 94th-minute goal as Exeter forced a replay. Shrewsbury put their stuttering promotion bid on hold to progress, beating Morecambe 2-0, and Danny Newton’s double helped Stevenage thrash Swindon 5-2. Results: Notts County 3-2 Oxford City, Bradford City 3-1 Plymouth Argyle, Fleetwood Town 1-1 Hereford FC, Forest Green Rovers 3-3 Exeter City, Gillingham 1-1 Carlisle United, Milton Keynes Dons 4-1 Maidstone United, Port Vale 1-1 Yeovil Town, Shrewsbury Town 2-0 Morecambe, Stevenage 5-2 Swindon Town. League One A quiet day in the lower two tiers on account of FA Cup action, with only two League One matches played, between sides wedged between 12th and 18th in the table at the start of play. Bristol Rovers bounced back from going a goal down to beat Rotherham at the Memorial Stadium, with Ellis Harrison and Liam Sercombe on target for the hosts after Ryan Williams’ opener. Josh Wright was the star of the show for Southend, winning a penalty which Jason Demetriou converted and then volleyed in a second as the Shrimpers climbed to ninth with a win over Oldham. Results: Bristol Rovers 2-1 Rotherham United, Southend United 2-0 Oldham Athletic."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/02/martin-mcguinness-biography-divides-irish-opinion-as-he-did-in-life","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-02T18:23:01Z","webTitle":"Martin McGuinness biography divides Irish opinion – as he did in life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/02/martin-mcguinness-biography-divides-irish-opinion-as-he-did-in-life","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/02/martin-mcguinness-biography-divides-irish-opinion-as-he-did-in-life","fields":{"headline":"Martin McGuinness biography divides Irish opinion – as he did in life","bodyText":"The controversial life of the late Martin McGuinness could stand as an emblem of the extraordinary changes in the recent history of the island of Ireland. The path the politician from Derry took, from giving a funeral oration in praise of a republican who had once shot at Arlene Foster’s father, who was a Royal Ulster Constabulary reservist, to sharing power with the DUP leader in the Stormont parliament, is now described in photographs and words in a book by the Observer and Guardian’s long-time Irish affairs correspondent Henry McDonald. “In this case, for once the cliche term of ‘a journey’ really is apposite, because McGuinness travelled such a long way,” McDonald said this weekend. “To go from IRA commander to deputy first minister, well, you cannot get a clearer message across about how things have altered than that. The book really shows the passage of time. It starts with the black and white grainy shots and goes through to the colour of the contemporary world and to shots of McGuinness with kids while he served as education minister.” The death of McGuinness in March at the age of 66 was viewed as the sad close of a career spent fighting for the freedom of the Catholic and nationalist communities by some, and yet welcomed by others as the end of a former terrorist who had orchestrated widescale violence. “In the end we can say McGuinness did not achieve his war aims. He ended up running an institution he had set out to destroy,” said McDonald. “But when it comes to where we are now, after 33 years reporting this scene, I can say that if McGuinness had lived, the chance of a deal with the DUP would have been much better. The leadership found him easier to deal with. He would, I think, had he not died early, have established that they needed to have a common front. His diplomatic abilities would have helped.” McDonald said his book, Martin McGuinness: A Life Remembered, has already upset those who hoped for a hagiography of their hero, and annoyed others in the dissident republican community who feel McGuinness sold out. “And, of course, people in the Unionist community think he deserves nothing at all. There are a lot of people who loathed him for understandable reasons.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/03/jayda-fransen-tried-to-stop-sex-assault-complaint","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T00:05:26Z","webTitle":"Britain First’s Jayda Fransen ‘tried to halt sex assault complaint’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/03/jayda-fransen-tried-to-stop-sex-assault-complaint","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/03/jayda-fransen-tried-to-stop-sex-assault-complaint","fields":{"headline":"Britain First’s Jayda Fransen ‘tried to halt sex assault complaint’","bodyText":"Jayda Fransen, deputy leader of the far-right group whose posts were retweeted by US president Donald Trump last week, is accused of trying to dissuade the victim of an alleged sexual assault from making an official complaint, the Observer has learned. The 31-year-old deputy leader of the anti-Muslim group Britain First is said to have tried to persuade the victim not to complain after she alleged she was sexually assaulted by the group’s leader, Paul Golding, in July. The alleged attack occurred after one of the group’s demonstrations in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, when members congregated at a hotel after a rally denouncing child sex abuse. Former Britain First member Graham Morris, in the hotel that night, says he witnessed Fransen encouraging the victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, to stay quiet. Morris said: “Jayda was saying, ‘I can give everything you need, a platform. I’ll do this for you, that for you.’ She was offering her all sorts. I’m thinking this is sick, but [the alleged victim] went along with it. I was there and I saw exactly how it went.” Morris, who says he was dating Fransen at the time, then alleged that the Britain First deputy told the victim that she should go back to the hotel bar where other members of the group were drinking. He added: “Jayda said: ‘You’re going to have to come back to the bar and let everyone see you with Paul [Golding] so it looks like a misunderstanding. I was disgusted that a woman could try and encourage another woman not to report what happened.” Fransen did not return the Observer’s calls. Britain First did not comment. The alleged victim did eventually report Golding to police in early September; Morris, 54, from Leicestershire, revealed that he had also contacted police about the claims he makes about Fransen. Despite Fransen’s tweets being retweeted by Trump, Britain First is described by critics as a modest movement riven with infighting. Fransen, who has ambitions to lead the party, is awaiting trial for hate speech at a rally in Belfast. Trump’s retweeting of anti-Muslim videos posted by Fransen prompted a diplomatic spat between the UK and US and resuled inTheresa May rebuking the US president over his sharing of propaganda videos from the far-right group. On Monday, anti-fascist group Hope not Hate along with multi-faith representatives will be handing in petitions containing more than 24,000 signatures to the US ambassador, expressing disgust with Trump’s actions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/04/how-american-womens-growing-power-finally-turned-metoo-a-cultural-moment","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T10:04:33Z","webTitle":"How American women's growing power finally turned #metoo into a cultural moment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/04/how-american-womens-growing-power-finally-turned-metoo-a-cultural-moment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/04/how-american-womens-growing-power-finally-turned-metoo-a-cultural-moment","fields":{"headline":"How American women's growing power finally turned #metoo into a cultural moment","bodyText":"The Harvey Weinstein scandal has prompted a flood of accusations and admissions – but, unlike previous sexual harassment flash points, it has also sparked a moment of national reckoning. Women once silenced by fear are speaking out, and the names of perpetrators keep coming: in recent days, TV hosts Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose were fired, New York Times reporter Glenn Thrush was suspended, and the head of Pixar, John Lasseter, said he would take a six-month sabbatical. The huge number of stories, covering lewd texts to predatory advances to rape, is unparalleled. The power structures that used to protect the harassers are crumbling. Companies are acting more swiftly and punitively than ever before. Anger at men’s behaviour has erupted in the US several times in the past: from the “smash the masher” movement of the early 1900s, where women fought back against street harassers with hatpins and umbrellas, to the feminist “speak-out” sessions of the 1970s to the support for Anita Hill in the 1990s. But what led to today’s tipping point? While the #metoo campaign played a crucial role, other elements also helped create a tinderbox waiting for a Weinstein-like spark. Estelle Freedman, a history professor at Stanford University, said: “It’s not technology alone, it’s also about the other contexts. It’s a gradual, accumulative process and then a tipping point.” Among these factors are the election of a president who once bragged about “grabbing women by the pussy”; the increasing economic and political power of women in recent years; and corporate awareness of the national mood and worries about brand reputation. It is also suggested that because many of the women involved in the Weinstein revelations are famous, powerful and named, their testimonies are more credible and have encouraged others to feel they would also be believed. Freedman says the story of disbelieving women is long and deep. “This works through culture, in Anglo-American law and in popular culture. “It’s privileged men who are protected by this mechanism, more than immigrant men or African-American men. They had a long history of privilege, of being able to say: ‘She’s lying. I didn’t do it’ or ‘We did it. She consented.’ Those men are losing a long legacy of privilege right now.” Anita Hill, a trailblazer against sexual harassment The #metoo hashtag went viral, as women gave voice to decades of latent anger and resentment. Emily Martin, vice-president for workplace justice at the National Women’s Law Center (NWLC), said: “It’s incredibly empowering to hear other women expressing what you have experienced and never expressed.” This was the case too in 1991 when Anita Hill testified before a Senate panel that the supreme court nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her for years. Her credibility was attacked and Thomas was confirmed. Martin said: “There was this cultural moment then as well about sexual harassment and whether we believe women. A lot of women felt activated at that moment. The next year women came into Congress in greater numbers than ever before.” The number of complaints filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission rose from 6,126 the year before Hill testified to 10,578 the year after, a 73% increase. Back then, women showed their support by wearing “I believe Anita Hill” buttons, now they have a means to show solidarity in an instantly accessible and more far-reaching way with #metoo. Martin said: “This [Weinstein] moment is different because we have social media which magnifies and amplifies the power of individuals sharing their stories. It allows women to talk to each other and hear each other in a way that makes you feel less isolated and alone, which is the way harassment works. “The internet can definitely be a harmful and harassing place itself but we’ve seen the capacity here for the opposite, the capacity to build a movement.” Many point to the election of Donald Trump, a man accused of sexual assault, harassment and misogyny, as a time of political awakening. Freedman said: “The fact that a man who feels he has that privilege – ‘I have a right to speak this way, to touch, to feel, to intimidate’ – could be the president of the United States is a wake-up call to anybody who didn’t speak out before.” A surge in female activism followed the election. Martin said: “We can see it from the Women’s March and all the levels of increased political engagement that have happened since, where people report it is women who are calling Congress and who are showing up at the town halls. “When these [sexual harassment] stories broke it happened in a cultural moment when women were all ready to stand up and say: ‘We are not going to accept what is unacceptable. It is not a sufficient response to say this is how the world is. We want to make a change.’” With more women in power, speaking out becomes easier Sexual harassment is as old as US history, a fact of life for slaves and domestic workers in the 18th and 19th centuries. When women started to work in manufacturing and clerical jobs in the early 20th century, their complaints of being harassed were dismissed as trivial. Around this time, a “smash the masher” movement grew up against aggressive street harassers (“mashers”). Women defended themselves against these men, and in Chicago some trained in parks to build both physical strength and confidence so they would be left alone. Female police officers were hired specifically to protect women. Public outrage over the masher fell away after women got the vote in 1920 and the flapper embodied a new sexual era where public “flirtation” was more acceptable. It wasn’t until the women’s liberation movement of the 1960s and 1970s that anger over street harassment emerged again. As increasing numbers of women joined the workforce in the 1970s, the issue of sexual harassment at work became ever more pressing. Women shared their stories at consciousness-raising sessions and a group at Cornell University came up with the phrase “sexual harassment” to define a range of inappropriate behaviors. In 1975 the term entered the national lexicon when journalist Lin Farley, then a lecturer at Cornell, used it publicly for the first time at a Human Rights Commission hearing into women and work, and it was reported in the press. But it was 1980 before sexual harassment was recognized by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as a form of discrimination, and something women could sue over. Freedman, author of Redefining Rape, said that although there was “an eruption of information” about sexual harassment during this time which was documented in the press, memoir, poetry and fiction, women had little political power to effect change. “They were not very represented in state houses or in Congress. They did not have economic clout. They did not run companies,” she said. “Now there are so many more women with access to power and privilege. I’m not saying it’s not extremely hard for them to speak out given there’s still a culture of disbelief and given the stakes, but there’s a bigger, critical mass of empowered women who can do something about this.” Employers now have to deal with the court of public opinion Companies are also rethinking their approach. A zero-tolerance attitude towards perpetrators is apparent, with high-profile figures being fired or resigning following accusations of sexual misconduct. Businesses don’t want their brand sullied by association. Netflix has cut its ties with Kevin Spacey following sexual assault claims by multiple men; Condé Nast has banned the work of photographer Terry Richardson, who is accused of sexually harassing models; and the Republican National Committee has withdrawn financing from the Alabama Senate candidate, Roy Moore, following allegations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls. Elizabeth Tippett, a law professor at the University of Oregon, said: “Nowadays employers have to contend with the real possibility when they’re investigating a harassment complaint that the victim will speak out publicly at some point and the employer will have to account for the decision it made. It has to think about whether it will be able to tell a story that is defensible in the court of public opinion.” There is now a greater incentive for firms to discipline the harasser, she believes. “Courts tend not to inquire very much regarding whether the employer disciplined the harasser, they care more about whether the employer took remedial measures to protect the victim, like whether they offered a change in schedule to accommodate them, or training for the harasser. Courts care a lot about whether there was a complaint process and an investigation process. They care somewhat less about what happens after that process is over. “But now employers have to think: ‘Well, the court might say what we did was OK, but is the average person on the street going to buy our products if we kept this harasser on the payroll?’ Martin, of the National Women’s Law Center, said that when employers feel they have something to lose they are much more likely to prioritize fixing and addressing an issue. “I would expect a lot of employers are thinking about what they need to do to prevent a problem before it happens. If they’re doing training, is it the right sort of training? Are there other things they need to do to identify if there is an issue – whether it’s anonymous workplace surveys, or bystander training so that the entire workplace feels some responsibility to address harassment if they see it happening. “Employers are looking at the current landscape with a certain amount of trepidation and that’s good.” It’s too soon to tell if this is the dawn of a new era of social justice, with sexism replaced by equality and respect. Anita Hill told NBC’s Meet the Press on 26 November that for all the takedowns of icons in Hollywood, politics and the media, there were many other ordinary women – including minimum-wage workers, immigrants, women of color – who still felt too marginalized to speak out. However, there seems no doubt that Weinstein will be seen as a major moment in the history of sexual harassment. As Tom Hanks recently told the BBC, the name Weinstein will become “an identifying moniker for a state of being for which there was a before and an after”.

It is the most pervasive urban invention of modern times, one in which Britain played a leading role. Often, it stays under the radar of urban theorists and policymakers. But it is emerging as a major untapped resource and, therefore, a battleground in the struggle to find somewhere, anywhere, to put new housing. Last week, the mayor, Sadiq Khan, revealed his draft for the new London Plan, the document that will guide the planning decisions of the city’s boroughs. He wants – and who wouldn’t? – more housing, more of it affordable, well designed and energy-efficient, complete with spaces that encourage walking, cycling and the use of public transport. He has limited powers – he can’t, for example, ordain the large-scale public housing programmes that even the estate agents Savills now thinks are necessary – but he can manipulate the planning system to promote some kinds of development over others. His eyes alighted on the suburbs. Between the First and Second World Wars, while London’s population increased by 17%, its land area doubled, a reflection of its rapid suburban expansion at a much lower density than its historic centre. In theory, this means that if suburban densities could be nudged up, very many more homes could be accommodated within London’s boundaries. As Professor Tony Travers, of the London School of Economics, says, Greater London could house 20 million people if it was all built to the same density as the inner borough of Islington. So Khan wants to encourage, within 800 metres of transport links, developments that provide more housing in the same space. In doing so, he hopes to encourage smaller-scale developers and lower-cost housing, in contrast to the luxury towers promoted by his predecessor, Boris Johnson, in the name of meeting housing needs. This might mean building on gardens or building at four storeys instead of two. He has, say Tory opponents, “declared war on the suburbs” and will make them “overcrowded and harder to get around”. Yet making suburbs denser could make them better. In principle, having more inhabitants means more life in town centres and high streets, which makes shops and businesses more viable and makes it easier to sustain such things as local bus services. As the architects HTA suggested with proposals called “Supurbia”, it could make for more pleasant and safer streets than the sparsely populated, car-dominated thoroughfares that tend to occur in suburbs. It’s a reasonable fear that suburbs might lose their essential greenness, but a look at the maps in the draft plan shows that the great majority of outer London would fall outside Khan’s 800-metre circles. In principle, making some parts of suburbs a little more like Islington, whose desirability is reflected in astronomic property prices, shouldn’t be a bad thing. It depends completely on how it’s done and here we have to hope that Khan’s promises on design, affordability and enhanced public spaces come true. Because the enhancement of the suburbs could be good for pretty much everyone and it’s too good an opportunity to waste."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/dec/02/usman-khawaja-ashes-mark-anderson-australia-england-adelaide","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-02T14:14:25Z","webTitle":"Usman Khawaja finally makes Ashes mark but Anderson invites familiar error","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/02/usman-khawaja-ashes-mark-anderson-australia-england-adelaide","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/02/usman-khawaja-ashes-mark-anderson-australia-england-adelaide","fields":{"headline":"Usman Khawaja finally makes Ashes mark but Anderson invites familiar error","bodyText":"These were meant to be words about an Usman Khawaja century as he finally set straight seven years of Ashes false starts in conditions where he has excelled, a century where the No3 replicated the poise and control that underpinned his masterful ton at the same venue 12 months ago to make Joe Root’s decision to put Australia in look disastrous. Instead, his dismissal four balls after the dinner interval exposed the hosts’ collapsible middle order at the most dangerous time in day-night matches as artificial light took over and the wicket’s additional grass stood proud and ready to aid the pink ball’s nip. With a careless waft and an edge, it was over in the most cliched of ways for the stylist on 53. Sure, Jimmy Anderson made the delivery deviate away from the left-hander to invite the error. But it is hardly revelatory that he would be doing just that. He has not picked up 500-plus wickets rolling them down nude. Up to that stage Khawaja had edged or missed a quarter of the England paceman’s offerings to him. If a lairy cover drive on the up to start the dangerous final session was his answer, he was probably addressing the wrong question. Most frustrating was that this is precisely the stroke Khawaja denied himself against South Africa this time last year; a hand of 145 that was by far his best for the national side. Then, he did not strike one boundary off a seamer through the offside. An innings played in the immediate aftermath of the Hobart debacle that prompted a severe overhaul of the top order, he was suddenly the most senior batsman behind Steve Smith and David Warner. He played accordingly and was lauded for his hours of patient denial, just as Smith was in Brisbane for doing the same last week. This shot, by contrast, is the stuff that makes captains crazy. Khawaja’s luck had been in. On 44, he tried to turn an already productive over into a big one by taking on a Chris Woakes bouncer. The top edge flew out to Mark Stoneman in the deep but the England opener could not complete his end of the bargain, shelling a catch that would be taken nine times in 10 at the top level. That moment aside, Khawaja was cashing in square of the wicket with a minimum of fuss against bowling that was too short for too long. Root also elected to hold back Moeen Ali until Khawaja had been at the crease for 32 balls. Given his downfall in Brisbane and well-documented struggles against the turning ball, it bolstered the case that events were breaking his way, a delicate late cut off Moeen taking him to a half-century in 89 balls. It was not fluent by Khawaja’s standards – at times frazzled — but he was where he needed to be to play the defining day-one hand. It is one that has been a long time coming against England. He made his debut against them in 2011 as Australian cricket tore itself apart after giving up the Ashes on home soil. His 37 that day gained attention, but in five Ashes fixtures across three series until this match he had 183 runs to his name at 20, in contrast to a fine overall record (at least when the ball is not spinning) since returning to the fold two years ago. That big one will have to wait. His captain also fell within the first hour of the after-dark session when Craig Overton finally found a route through his defence on 40. It was not the time to expose the out-of-form Peter Handscomb and the perennial feast‑or-famine Shaun Marsh, but to their considerable credit they saw off the final 19 overs of the day without further loss, collecting 48 runs along the way. Things may move quickly in the final hour of day-night cricket but they did the hard yards required to slow the tempo down and earn a second day at the crease. Earlier, Warner was the first Australian leader to give it up at the point where he was positioned to punish. The vice-captain was, in effect, batting for two after running out his opening partner, Cameron Bancroft, after two rain delays frustrated the opening session. Steady accumulation took place between Warner and Khawaja and their stand was exactly what Khawaja’s would later reach with Smith when the opener edged Woakes with a distinct lack of footwork. Even so, it was the first time an England bowler had been responsible for an Australian wicket in 80 overs, so that took the visitors moving vaguely in the right direction after Root took the bold decision to have a bowl first when the coin fell his way. They let him down early by failing to attack the stumps anywhere near enough but got their act together after the successive rain interruptions. Perhaps that was partially informed by wanting to get stuck into Australia’s captain? Stuart Broad needed no encouragement, the two all-but separated by the officials after a willing opening spray. It was much the same when Anderson had a pop later on. Surely a sign of what is to come, with rivers of bad blood now flowing between the rivals. “It was all right,” said Khawaja of the exchange. “It was just Test cricket.” Watch this space. He also acknowledged his disappointment at throwing away the start. “With me getting out and Smithy getting out with starts,” he said, “if one of us went on and stayed and was here at the end of the night, it would have been even nicer.” Not wrong. A good day for the home side, but a missed opportunity to leave a lasting blow."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/03/swansea-uk-city-of-culture","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T00:30:26Z","webTitle":"Can Swansea win the right to wear Britain’s cultural crown?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/03/swansea-uk-city-of-culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/03/swansea-uk-city-of-culture","fields":{"headline":"Can Swansea win the right to wear Britain’s cultural crown?","bodyText":"This is a tense time for Swansea. Like its four fellow shortlisted cities – Coventry, Paisley, Stoke and Sunderland – it awaits a crucial verdict on Thursday, when Britain finds out who is to wear the coveted crown of UK City of Culture in 2021. After months of campaigning, and as Hull’s year in the limelight dims, the competing teams are all nervous. But for Swansea in particular this could be about to get personal. For the city was shortlisted last time around and is understandably reluctant to accept the bridesmaid’s role twice in a row. “Of course we still want to win and think we can but we also don’t want to fall off a cliff if we don’t,” said Tracey McNulty, who has co-ordinated Swansea’s strategy. “We have all enjoyed making it clear that culture is not just something we think about once we have taken care of ‘the important stuff’. We put a lot of thought into what a culture plan means.” With one of Britain’s longest expanses of sand and sea, dramatically backed, this weekend at least, by dark hills in a wintry sunlight , it is hard to see why Swansea’s appeal has historically been neglected. Age-old rivalries and prejudices come into it, of course. Bristol has often looked down on its Welsh competitor ports, while Cardiff, as the Welsh capital, has grabbed more attention. But the bigger picture is the industrial decline and loss of identity that Swansea has suffered. “There is a strong sense of contrast here between the run-down areas and the pretty coastline,” said McNulty. “We have areas of great need here. Some places that are only a mile or so apart have a seven-year gap in life expectancy.” Most of the boarding houses and hotels that line the beachfront, leading up to the quaintness of the Mumbles and then on to the outstanding natural beauty of the Gower peninsula, look neither sweetly old-fashioned nor pleasantly modernised. Instead, a jumble of mock-Tudor beams and 1970s glazing present a motley face to the sea. One of Swansea’s most famous natives, the poet Dylan Thomas, once wrote of his “ugly, lovely town … crawling, sprawling … by the side of a long and splendid curving shore”, and the city faced a similarly mixed reaction when it put itself forward again as a major cultural contender. A string of foundries and a stream of polluting waste on the banks of the river Tawe were the legacy of the copper industry in the 19th century. But Swansea has far from shaken off signs of neglect. When universal credit gradually replaces welfare benefits this month, the council leader has warned that thousands of residents “will be plunged into debt”. The bid team were clear about the scale of change required. “It is right in front of us: there are massive inequalities,” said McNulty. “We want to improve access to culture, access to jobs, even access to transport and mobile phone signals in some areas. We want to build bridges, metaphorically and literally.” And she does believe there is fresh hope. Aside from the publicity created by the City of Culture bid, the annual international arts festival and the growing draw of the local undergraduate scene, Swansea is now the focus of several major redevelopment schemes. “After the last bid we needed to regroup and to learn,” said McNulty, who is also head of cultural services for the city council. “We knew we had to demonstrate what has changed. Then suddenly a whole load of large-scale initiatives came up, including the city centre regeneration and ongoing plans for the world’s first tidal lagoon.” The lagoon, if it comes, will be formed by a curved breakwater constructed out at sea to house a bank of hydro turbines that will generate electricity by harnessing the bay’s especially impressive tides. There is also excitable talk of a high-tech cable car system that would swing visitors from one hill to another, while, as many football fans will know, Swansea City’s Liberty stadium is home to the only Premier League team in Wales. Indeed, to show their support for the bid, last week several of Swansea’s players indulged in a promotional game of cultural charades for the cameras. If the 2021 title does go to Swansea, the £3m Heritage Lottery Fund grant would be spent building on the work done so far in the smart maritime quarter emerging around the Tawe basin, where there is already a jaunty look to the shops and restaurants. A new bar called The Swigg, named after a buoy out in the bay, even offers an unexpected delicacy: Welsh tapas. Behind the revamped wharfside warehouses is the museum zone. The modern National Waterfront Museum sets out the Welsh seafaring story and charts the rise and fall of the merchant class in the surrounding city with map displays, model boats and interactive displays. But the newest jewel in the city’s cultural offer is the Glynn Vivian art gallery, which re-opened a year ago after an expensive redesign. The City of Culture judges sent to Swansea by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport last month will no doubt also have followed in the footsteps of cultural pilgrims to the city by paying their respects to its late, great bard. Entry to the Dylan Thomas centre includes a free exhibition called Love the Words which features the voice of the actor Richard Burton, as well as recordings of Thomas himself. There are also displays that detail his schoolboy sporting prowess and some pages from his teenage notebooks. Across the green from the river basin stands the museum with perhaps the least pretensions and the most individuality. Swansea museum is the oldest in Wales and is a lucky dip of curios, including an Egyptian mummy and a 17th-century Flemish masterpiece by Jacob Jordaens, recently discovered in the storeroom. There is also an annex tramshed which commemorates the street tram that once ran along the edge of the bay to Mumbles pier, while in the summer months there are maritime exhibits in the dock, including three boats. Perversely, though, as McNulty’s team recognised from the outset, it is not just Swansea’s attractive achievements, but the nature of its cultural lack which may either clinch the City of Culture deal for them this Thursday, or not. “It is difficult. All of the cities on the shortlist have a similar story to tell,” she said. “We each have problematic relations to a bigger city nearby, a manufacturing past and several were heavily damaged during the second world war. Swansea had a three-night blitz that changed the city’s nature completely.” Competition for the UK title is likely to grow after last week’s EU ruling that, post-Brexit, British cities will no longer qualify for European City of Culture status in 2023. But at this late stage, Swansea and its rivals can only put their faith in the judges – and in the belief that, if they fail, their bids have at least reminded the rest of Britain of their existence. City of Culture contenders Coventry The bookies’ favourite. Former heart of the motor industry. A bombing raid in November 1940 destroyed much of the city and killed 550. The ruined cathedral remains next to Basil Spence’s replacement. “A once in a lifetime opportunity for Coventry to tell its story of reinvention, of resilience, of peace and reconciliation,” said Laura McMillan, bid team manager. 7/4 at Ladbrokes. Swansea is 10/1 Stoke-on-Trent Ceramics are still a tourist draw but the city suffers from the closure of big potteries and mines. “City of Culture is not just for celebrating what you’ve got now but asking how do you build a credible future,” said Susan Clarke, creative programme director for the bid. Hashtag ”Stoke’s no joke”. 3/1 Paisley Weaving capital of the 18th and 19th centuries. According to Scottish government figures the most deprived area in the country is the city’s Ferguslie Park estate. “The bid is part of a wider plan to transform the town’s fortunes using our unique cultural and heritage story,” said bid director Jean Cameron. 3/1 Sunderland World’s shipbuilding capital a century ago. Its last shipyard closed in 1988, but its Nissan plant builds “more cars than Italy”. Bid themes are “light”, “inventiveness” and “friendship”on an “astonishing scale”. Bid director Rebecca Ball said: “A fantastic opportunity to engage people about the kind of cultural life they want.” 4/1"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/03/robert-worcester-trinidad-tobago-opinion-poll-guru-consultancy-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T08:00:36Z","webTitle":"The opinion poll guru, the Caribbean islands and the $10m consultancy deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/03/robert-worcester-trinidad-tobago-opinion-poll-guru-consultancy-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/03/robert-worcester-trinidad-tobago-opinion-poll-guru-consultancy-deal","fields":{"headline":"The opinion poll guru, the Caribbean islands and the $10m consultancy deal","bodyText":"As the proud owner of a majestic castle in Kent and a luxurious villa in Mustique, the founder of Mori, Sir Robert Worcester, is a man who has clearly done well out of the opinion poll business. Not only have his skills earned him a fortune, it has also seen him feted by politicians around the world. A staunch monarchist, the Kansas-born Worcester was knighted in 2005 for “outstanding services rendered to political, social and economic research and for contribution to government policy and programmes”. The same year Mori was sold to the French polling company Ipsos, a move that netted him a reported £9m. Some might have then been happy to sit back and enjoy the spoils of their labour. But Worcester continued amassing a formidable range of fellowships, titles and charitable positions, including the chair of the Magna Carta Trust’s 800th anniversary commemoration committee, which recognised the charter’s continued influence promoting the rule of law and social justice around the world. He also hired out his political acumen, not least in Trinidad and Tobago where, documents leaked to the Observer reveal, the government agreed a $10m budget for his company to provide it with consultancy services between 2013 and 2015. The huge sum – equivalent to the UK government’s 2015 wage bill for its 96 special advisers – is likely to raise eyebrows on the tiny islands, which have a population of just 1.3 million and where the average wage is just under £12,000. A letter to Worcester from Reynold Cooper, permanent secretary to the prime minister, dated 11 June 2013, says: “Please be informed that cabinet has approved the fees and expenses for the core consultancy, 13 sets of surveys and seven sets of focus groups totalling US$9,793,475, plus your estimated expenses of US$160,000 giving a total sum of US$9,953,475.” A copy of the contract between Government Information Services Limited (GISL), the government’s communications service, and Mori Caribbean, a separate firm that Worcester retained after selling Mori, explains that the two-year project, a continuation of earlier work, was to improve the delivery of public services. Worcester’s firm was also offered a separate contract to help the government develop its strategic communications plan. Worcester, a former president of the Institute of Business Ethics, said that in 2010 he had been approached on behalf of the newly elected prime minister, Kamla Persad-Bissessar. She wanted Mori Caribbean to continue the work it had been doing for her predecessor, Patrick Manning. According to the contract, seen by the Observer and the Sunday Express newspaper in Trinidad and Tobago, GISL was charged with overseeing Mori Caribbean’s projects and ensuring that it was paid within 60 days of the company submitting its invoices. A considerable portion of the money went directly to Worcester. On 5 February 2014 GISL instructed the First Citizens Bank in the capital, Port of Spain, to transfer $1,326,475.55 to Worcester’s private account in Kingstown on St Vincent, an island in the Caribbean where he has citizenship. Worcester said that the money was not paid directly to Mori Caribbean as the company had been closed down “because it was a burden for accounting that we didn’t need and the project had been completed”. He added that some of the money he received was shared with other consultants, including Mark Gill, formerly head of political research at Ipsos Mori. Sources in Trinidad have said that GISL invoiced the government for further payments on behalf of Mori Caribbean the following year. Worcester confirmed that the earlier payment of almost $10m was approved, but insisted that Mori Caribbean received only around $3.2m in the end. He said that, legally, the company could have billed for the full amount but chose not to because the firm had not carried out the full range of services agreed. “It’s [still] a lot of money, I’m not disagreeing with that,” Worcester said. “We subcontracted – about two-thirds of everything we got went to outside contractors. We couldn’t do them because we’re not native Trinnies [Trinidadians]. Of the $3.2m [we billed for] about $2.3m was paid to local contractors.” Documents seen by the Observer indicate that one of the subcontractors – Caribbean Market Research Limited – was paid around $8,000 for carrying out seven focus groups on behalf of Mori Caribbean. Worcester said this was just a fraction of what Mori Caribbeanhad paid out to all the subcontractors. The true amount that the company received in 2015 is difficult to establish: GISL is being wound up and many of its files and invoices have been destroyed. However, documents seen by the Observer show that the government approved $1.35m worth of invoices relating to Mori Caribbean in 2015. A spokeswoman for the government of Trinidad and Tobago said she was aware of the Observer’s requests for comment but was not authorised to respond. Persad-Bissessar, who left office in 2015, did not return an emailed request for comment. Worcester said he and his firm had been caught in “the crosshairs” of a politically motivated leak designed to paint the previous government as “spendthrifts” in the runup to the last election. “Mori Caribbean did nothing but good down there,” he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/02/damian-green-case-police-criticised-making-porn-revelations","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-02T11:54:01Z","webTitle":"Damian Green case: police criticised over pornography revelations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/02/damian-green-case-police-criticised-making-porn-revelations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/02/damian-green-case-police-criticised-making-porn-revelations","fields":{"headline":"Damian Green case: police criticised over pornography revelations","bodyText":"Police should stay out of politics, a former chief constable has said amid a growing backlash against officers who revealed that pornography was found on Damian Green’s Commons computer during an investigation nine years ago. Sir Peter Fahy, the former chief constable of Greater Manchester police, said the raid on Green’s office and the revelation that pornographic images were found on his computer were incidents that should not happen in a democratic country. He spoke out after the now-retired detective who examined Green’s computer contradicted the Conservative MP’s claims that he never used it to look at pornography. Asked whether the officer’s intervention was in the public interest, Fahy said: “I think it’s very dangerous territory for a police officer to be making judgments about whether a politician is lying or not. “That should only happen in a criminal investigation and then, ultimately, is for a court to decide. Police should be extremely careful about making judgments about other people’s morality when it’s not a matter of crime. It’s something really central to our democracy that police are not involved in politics; we are fairly unusual in the United Kingdom in that being the case.” The claim that “extreme” pornography was found on Green’s work computer was first made by Bob Quick, former assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan police, in a statement prepared for the Leveson inquiry that was obtained and reported by the Times last month. Green, the first secretary of state, denied the allegation, but Neil Lewis, the former Scotland Yard officer who examined the computer, told the BBC that the internet history on the device showed pornography had been viewed extensively. He said the images were not extreme, as the earlier report claimed. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Saturday, Fahy said the disclosures made by Quick and Lewis undermined the principle that details uncovered by police in the course of an investigation ought to remain confidential if they are not central to a case. “If you are attacked in the street and, for instance, happen to be with somebody who is not your wife, it’s really important that that is not revealed by the police and they concentrate on what was the incident,” he said, adding that to do otherwise could damage the confidence of victims. His comments came after senior Tories, including the Brexit secretary, David Davis, rallied behind Green, whose future was already threatened by allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards a young Conservative activist, Kate Maltby. The MPs said evidence obtained in a police raid that did not expose illegality should not be used to undermine a politician. Davis, who was Green’s boss as shadow home secretary for a time, let it be known that he would resign in protest were Green to be forced out solely on the basis of the allegations by former Met officers. “The police are using tactics straight out of the mafia playbook,” said a close ally of the Brexit secretary."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/03/marcin-gwozdzinski-immigration-centre-detention-death","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T00:05:26Z","webTitle":"‘Marcin was crying, begging for help’: crisis of EU migrants detained in the UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/03/marcin-gwozdzinski-immigration-centre-detention-death","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/03/marcin-gwozdzinski-immigration-centre-detention-death","fields":{"headline":"‘Marcin was crying, begging for help’: crisis of EU migrants detained in the UK","bodyText":"He was one of B-wing’s most popular characters, although recently other detainees had noticed a sudden darkening in his mood. A little before 5pm on 3 September, two days before his 28th birthday, Marcin Gwozdzinski made a final plea for help. Addressing officials inside the administrative quarters of Harmondsworth immigration removal centre, he told them he could no longer cope. “He was crying, begging for help from the guards, telling them to call an ambulance, that his mental health was an emergency,” said another detainee, Marcin Malicki, who sat beside Gwozdzinski in the meeting. “They told him he would get no help and to stop calling for an ambulance,” said Malicki, 37, who was there as a translator. “He broke down like a baby. Still they did nothing.” Shortly after 7pm, Gwozdzinski asked if he could borrow a Qur’an, a request Malicki thought was peculiar from a devout Catholic, the latest clue, perhaps, that his friend was losing his mind. Other detainees wondered why he was not on suicide watch, or at least antidepressants. At 2.05pm the next day Malicki heard shrieking from inmates huddled outside the door of room 10, B-wing – Gwozdzinski’s cell. Malicki found his friend barely alive. He tried to revive him. “I still carry his face in my head, all the time I see him,” he recalls. Gwozdzinski’s was one of three deaths linked to the UK’s immigration detention estate in the space of a month. This year is the deadliest on record – 10 immigration detainees have died, twice the previous high. News of the latest emerged two weeks ago – another suicide, a 27-year-old Iraqi man inside Lincolnshire’s Morton Hall detention facility. Few other details have surfaced, but critics say such secrecy is the norm. Of the 10 deaths, three of their names are not known. Occasionally, the Home Office fails even to publicise a death. One recent Freedom of Information response found two deaths of which campaigners had no previous knowledge. In keeping with such a clandestine climate, the Home Office has not released Gwozdzinski’s name, or even his age. Until now, who he was or the circumstances of his death were a mystery. Gwozdzinski’s family claim they are being kept in the dark, that his death was preventable but that its circumstances are being covered up. Beyond dispute is that the tragedy arrives during a particularly contentious period for the UK’s immigration detention estate, specifically its ongoing role in the detention and deportation of European Union citizens from the UK following the Brexit vote. Home Office data released on Thursday confirmed 5,321 EU nationals were forcibly removed in the year until September, a 13% increase on statistics already at their highest since records began. Celia Clarke, director of the charity Bail for Immigration Detainees believes Brexit has given the Home Office the green light to target Europeans in the UK, an allegation corroborated by claims that EU citizens are being detained for relatively minor crimes, such as driving offences. “If you have a government that unashamedly vows to create a ‘hostile environment’ then it is no surprise that people are swept up, detained and removed, with little regard to their rights,” said Clarke. Her organisation is fighting the deportation of 70 EU nationals – two thirds of whom have no criminal record and whose average stay in the UK is 11.4 years. Also on Thursday, the former Tory international development secretary Andrew Mitchell became the latest public figure to voice concern over the purpose of the UK’s 11 immigration centres, denouncing them as a “dystopian stain on our democracy”. Another dimension is unfolding that is driving further disquiet: the allegedly systematic clearance of homeless EU nationals from British streets. The numbers affected are unclear – despite FoI requests, the Home Office refuses to publish updated numbers – but Clarke believes the amount of Europeans targeted under this policy may roll into the thousands. A high court judge will rule next month whether the policy is lawful. Gwozdzinski and Malicki were both homeless when detained. More are being swept up all the time. The edict has caused consternation among diplomats. Vali Staicu, third secretary at the Romanian embassy, said her country had raised the issue with the home secretary Amber Rudd last month. “We are very concerned, we have cases where the Home Office say it’s a voluntary return but when we ask, the individual says, ‘I don’t want to go.’” The Slovak embassy was worried about people being detained and deported without “legitimate reason”. Sources at the Polish embassy, which represents 831,000 Polish-born UK residents, making Poles the largest overseas-born group in the country, would only confirm “cooperation” with the Home Office on the issue. Born in the remote town of Cibórz, near Świebodzinin west Poland, Gwozdzinski – the youngest of seven brothers – was an adventurous child. As a boy he explored the surrounding spruce forests, travelling across Poland as a teenager, then Europe, Ireland, eventually arriving in the UK aged 23. Travel, he told his family, helped “keep his spirit free”. His brother Grzegorz, 30, said: “He loved new countries, new people, and although he was a hard worker he enjoyed sleeping rough – squats, empty buildings, anywhere.” In October last year and despite working on a building site in Tooting, south London, Gwozdzinski had elected to sleep rough near Streatham Common. He smoked cannabis to help him sleep and one evening approached dealers near Streatham’s St Leonard’s Church to stock up on supplies. Gwozdzinski was short-changed, a scuffle broke out that was caught on CCTV. The following morning, he was arrested and taken to Harmondsworth. Quick witted and gregarious, he was quickly dubbed by B-wing as Siwy, which translates as light blond in Polish. He had no history of mental illness and was generally happy. His family had never contemplated that he might one day try to kill himself. Three months on and no official account into the events around his death has been issued. The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman (PPO) is investigating but will not comment, while the Home Office says it is “inappropriate” to share statements on an ongoing PPO inquiry. Mitie, the private firm that runs Harmondsworth on behalf of the Home Office, declined to answer questions. However, corroborating witness statements indicate that Gwozdzinski begged for help repeatedly over a period of time. Another Polish detainee on B-wing, Robert Legut, 52, describes Gwozdzinski telling staff on several occasions that his mental health was deteriorating profoundly. “He was saying: ‘Help me please, my head is no good. I might do something, suicidal.’ He told guards five days beforehand, two or three times. They ignored him.” Speaking in the spartan, heavily securitised meeting room inside Harmondsworth, the rumble of flights from nearby Heathrow airport in the background, Legut said Gwozdzinski’s death was avoidable. “He went back to get help but they laughed at him again. He was desperate, why did they not give him a psychologist? His death is the Home Office’s fault.” A written statement, signed by 59 fellow detainees of various nationalities, unequivocally blames the death of their “friend” on the authorities. “For a long time he [Gwozdzinski] asked officers, psychologists and doctors for help. He was ignored,” states the carefully handwritten letter. “Many times he asked for help. Therefore myself and other detainees are very anxious and depressed about the situation. It is a disgrace that nobody has been [made] accountable for such poor care. We are human beings not animals.” In a letter written by Gwozdzinski shortly before his death, he says: “I can’t be here. I want to be free … there is not much time left.” The partner of Gwozdzinski’s brother, Ewa Jany, says detainees have described how Gwozdzinski’s roommate would stand over him at night, reciting Satanic verses. “We heard how his cellmate would stand over Marcin at night talking about witches and Satan. Marcin was having terrible nightmares, it is no surprise.” Days before Gwozdzinski tried to kill himself, he asked the centre’s authorities to be moved. But Jany believes it was too late: the damage had been done. “He needed special supervision, there are staff who follow inmates with psychological problems. They even follow them to the toilet. Why did Marcin get no one?” Wider, structural issues may have played a part. Britain remains the only country in Europe with no time limit on immigration detention. With detainees’ lives in limbo, psychologists agree that the system affects mental health. Two years ago MPs joined campaigners in urging a 28-day limit on immigration detention, and only then as an “absolute last resort”. Legut, who says he was detained for minor motoring offences, has been held since January. Malicki was held for nearly a year, the same as Gwozdzinski. All three registered mental health complaints, but none was given antidepressants or psychological assistance. When the Observer met Legut inside Harmondsworth, his arms were covered in a blood-encrusted latticework of self-inflicted cuts. During our conversation, Legut, who has lived in Scotland for 12 years, ran a finger across his throat to mimic a neighbouring detainee who had cut his throat days earlier. Legut texted twice during the following three weeks with details of others who had self-harmed, and these were just among his 14 Polish friends. Suicide attempts are rising across the immigration detention estate. According to data from campaigners, 132 attempts were recorded during the first quarter of this year, a rate that could eclipse the record of 393 in 2015. Legut believes the rise is bolstered by the prevalence of the synthetic drug spice, linked to psychotic episodes and erratic behaviour. Although spice’s ubiquity inside prisons is widely chronicled, its spread inside immigration centres is not. Malicki says spice was easily obtainable in Harmondsworth and that Gwozdzinski was a user, although its influence in his decline is ambiguous. “I asked staff why they were letting so much Spice inside – people were going crazy – but they said, ‘You stop one dealer and another will take their place.’” Emma Ginn, coordinator of Medical Justice, which works to improve the health of detainees, said her organisation had frequently warned the Home Office that conditions inside would lead to further deaths if not addressed. “Clients call us, petrified that they too might die,” she said. “They say the authorities don’t care whether they live or die. We can’t console them.” Deborah Coles, director of Inquest, said: “Deaths and self-harm are the human consequences of the UK’s dehumanising and unjust detention system.” Gwozdzinski’s seemingly swift decline has been difficult for his family to digest. He had been talking about his future – accepting that he might need some stability according to his brother Grzegorz – but was also in peak physical condition. When his mother, who lost another son in a car accident in Poland seven years earlier, accepted medical advice and turned off her youngest’s life support machine at 6.40pm on 7 September, Gwozdzinski’s heart kept beating unaided for 25 minutes. “Two nurses were there and they were very surprised. His heart must have been so strong, but the brain was too damaged,” said Jany. Since then, the family allege attempts to work out what happened inside Harmondsworth have been obstructed. After Gwozdzinski’s death, key witnesses were deported. Despite nearly 12 months in detention, the prime witness Malicki was sent to Poland within days. Weeks later, when the Observer finally tracked him down, he was in Iceland. Legut said four witnesses had been deported or “ghosted” to other centres. A month after Gwozdzinski’s death, Legut revealed how one witness was flown to Poland at 8am, two hours before a case hearing. “It was too fast a decision to send them away; they are silenced,” he said. Neither Malicki nor Legut have been interviewed by investigators charged with finding out what happened. There are also allegations that the Home Office attempted to keep Gwozdzinski’s suicide bid quiet. Four hours after the attempt, at 6pm on Sunday, Jany and Grzegorz were notified he was in hospital. Throughout the following day, the Home Office refused to confirm claims that a detainee was on a life support machine. That night the BBC aired a damning documentary showing guards at another removal centre mistreating vulnerable people, including those who were suicidal. Another four days would pass before the Home Office confirmed something had happened. Detainees were sent a note citing an “incident” involving a “Polish detainee” who had died. Legut was among those kept in the dark. “They didn’t even tell his friends.” The sense that the Home Office is covering up the deaths of other EU nationals is shared. Eight months after Slovenian Branko Zdravkovic, 43, killed himself in a Dorset immigration detention centre, his partner, Nicola Sanderson, says she is still waiting for answers, but believes he was not given the care he needed. Zdravkovic, she says, was detained following a sweep of east Europeans drinking on a street in central London. Once inside, his wellbeing disintegrated. “They didn’t contact me at all, it’s disgraceful. My Branko was born in a quiet village near Austria and comes to this country, works for years, and this is how he was treated,” said Sanderson, from west London. Other aspects of Gwozdzinski’s case have prompted unease. Two days after his suicide attempt, Jany received a call from Harmondsworth informing her that Gwozdzinski was to be released. The official explained, says Jany, that he was no longer considered a threat to the community. “I actually started laughing, it was so ridiculous. Marcin was brain-damaged in a coma.” Another twist emerges with claims that staff apparently told Gwozdzinski that weeks before his death he was to be released. “The Home Office told him he was free to go. But they didn’t release him,” said Legut. Jany said they were actually preparing for his homecoming. “What was odd is that Marcin called and asked for our address. He said the Home Office would release him if he could provide an address that they could then check.” For three weeks Gwozdzinski called Jany daily, eagerly inquiring if the Home Office had called. “We were ready for them to check our house but nothing happened. I think this eventually broke him down.” Such episodes have left the Gwozdzinskis asking if the death of Siwy, a free spirit crushed by detention, can be tied to Theresa May’s ongoing “hostile environment” against those she believes should not be in the country. Jany said: “The Home Office behaves as if it is scared of Polish people. We need to know why Marcin was detained for so long, why he hanged himself.” In the UK and Republic of Ireland, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/02/what-a-time-to-cut-ourselves-off-from-friends-in-europe-donald-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-02T18:15:19Z","webTitle":"What a moment to cut ourselves off from friends in Europe | Nick Cohen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/02/what-a-time-to-cut-ourselves-off-from-friends-in-europe-donald-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/02/what-a-time-to-cut-ourselves-off-from-friends-in-europe-donald-trump","fields":{"headline":"What a moment to cut ourselves off from friends in Europe","bodyText":"Theresa May is reviled for her weakness. But, as so often, cliches deceive. No British prime minister has found the strength to condemn an American president as she condemned Donald Trump since the Anglo-American alliance began in the Second World War. Anthony Eden maintained a public silence as Eisenhower destroyed his premiership, and Britain’s imperial pretensions, when he stopped the Suez adventure of 1956. Harold Wilson ignored Lyndon Johnson’s pleas to send British troops to Vietnam. But he infuriated the radicals of the 1968 generation by diplomatically refusing to speak out against the war. Thatcher and Reagan, Major and Clinton had their private arguments about Grenada and the IRA. Nothing they said matches the forcefulness of May’s out, loud and proud denunciation of Trump for sharing the “hateful narratives” of British fascists. It has been comic to watch the shock with which politicians greeted Trump’s endorsement of Britain First. They must have known he has spent his life in the grey zone between the right and the far right. If they didn’t, we have a Foreign Office paid to set them straight. Only last week, Trump reminded us where his fanatic’s mind lingers when he revived the bitter, broken fantasy that America’s first black president was an illegitimate African interloper. There is no racist lie he will ever reject or disown. Britain’s leaders will not see it. May’s criticism was unprecedented but it remained a wholly inadequate response to an unprecedented US president. Britain and America are still allies, the PM said, as she tried to repair a shattered relationship. Trump may be a “buffoon” but he is still Britain’s “best friend”, the rightwing press told its readers. Theirs was the authentic voice of the politically left behind, who will never accept the world has changed until it blows up in their faces. Allies stand by their friends when they are in trouble. Trump turned on Sadiq Khan, London’s Muslim mayor, when the capital was being attacked by Islamists, for reasons that are too transparent to waste time on. Intelligence sharing between GCHQ and the US National Security Agency is the one clear benefit of the otherwise hazy “special relationship”. When he needed a fresh lie to feed to his credulous supporters, Trump was happy to trash it by conjuring the fantasy from the pit of his dark imagination that GCHQ had helped the Obama administration tap his phone. Imagine that a US president had retweeted and then defended the Islamist equivalent of Britain First and refused to apologise or retract. I think the reaction of the Tory party and press would not have been so mild. Yet the distinction between neo-fascism and Islamo-fascism is a distinction without a difference. Both share the fundamental conviction that Muslims and non-Muslims cannot live together. Both are violent. (Indeed, in the US, rightwing extremists plotted or carried out nearly twice as many terrorist attacks as Islamist extremists.) And the threat from both has moved online. The “it couldn’t happen here” school of commentary, so powerful in what passes for the “national conversation”, was quick to say that, while Britain First has 1.7m Facebook likes, it barely musters a handful of militants to invade halal butchers. If you wanted to match their complacency, you could add IS is merely a web-based movement now Raqqa has fallen. That is hardly a soothing thought, however, when radicalisation is increasingly an online phenomenon. Thomas Mair was not a member of Britain First. He still shouted “Britain first” when he murdered Jo Cox because he was indoctrinated on far-right websites to hate race traitors as thoroughly as IS indoctrinates recruits who have never left the UK to hate the kuffar. The leader of the free world has not only legitimised Britain First as he has legitimised so many other violently unhinged movements and ideologies. He has driven traffic and attention to its sites. One day, a “lone wolf” who has stared too long and hard at the light from his flickering screen may make us pay. ‘Ally” is a strange word to describe a country whose leader delights in threatening your security. Stranger still when Trump has looked for himself in others when seeking foreign friends and preferred kleptomaniac autocrats over democratic leaders. On climate change, the Iranian nuclear deal and the Muslim travel ban, Britain is not “allied” with Trump’s America but on the other side. We have expressed exactly the same objections as the other leading EU countries, but there’s the rub. For a generation, the European Union has been the British right’s “other”. It has defined itself against the EU and based its utopian dream of a revived greatness on freeing Britain from Brussels. It is not only a nostalgia for 20th-century alliances that stops conservatives from understanding how far away Britain is from Trump’s concerns, but their forlorn hope that the US will save it from the folly of cutting itself off from our true friends in the world’s largest free trade area. The notion that Trump will compensate Britain by offering a generous trade deal with the US does not survive contact with reality. Before he advertised his admiration for Britain First, Trump announced himself a believer in “America First”, a slogan coined by US appeasers of Nazi Germany, as he must know. He does not grant trade deals, he destroys them. He has pulled the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and may walk away from the North American Free Trade Agreement. Were they not lost in magical thinking, Conservatives, diplomats and generals would be hugging our European allies close. Even if they were determined to go ahead with Brexit whatever the cost, they would recognise that the US could not be depended upon and be proposing new systems of European defence co-operation. They would not engage in the wishful thinking that Trump will be out by 2020. They would not keep muttering that falsest of consolations of the past decade that we will “return to normal” and all will be well. They would have the intellectual strength to accept the possibility that “normal” may never return. “To name things wrongly is to add to the misfortune of the world,” said Albert Camus. When Britain names America as its ally, it only heaps more misery on its already considerable misfortune."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"media/2017/dec/12/you-start-to-worry-it-might-keep-readers-awake-gary-younge-on-editing-the-bedside-guardian","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T18:47:21Z","webTitle":"Tragedy, outrage and optimism: Gary Younge on editing the Bedside Guardian","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/dec/12/you-start-to-worry-it-might-keep-readers-awake-gary-younge-on-editing-the-bedside-guardian","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/dec/12/you-start-to-worry-it-might-keep-readers-awake-gary-younge-on-editing-the-bedside-guardian","fields":{"headline":"Tragedy, outrage and optimism: Gary Younge on editing the Bedside Guardian","bodyText":"They call it the Bedside Guardian for a reason. Every year we produce a collection, drawing together our best writing and the big stories of the past 12 months, just in time for Christmas. Its ideal perch is not on your bookshelf, but your nightstand table. Not because it will send you to sleep. But so you can dip in and out of it in the evening – flipping between your favourite writers and the coverage of some huge event; rereading at leisure the pieces you enjoyed in haste or enjoying the articles you missed first time around in sections you maybe never read. Cherry-picking from the cherries that have already been picked. As the journalist charged with editing the collection this year, this was a particularly onerous challenge. The 12 months in question do not span a calendar year, but from October to October. In other words, it’s a year that starts with Trump’s election and ends with the hard-right marching into the Bundestag. Add a series of terrorist atrocities, hurricanes, the Grenfell tragedy and the national sleepwalk into a catastrophic Brexit and you start to worry that it might end up keeping readers awake. “And as a nation with an unrivalled military chose a misogynist leader who could not tell the moral difference between Nazis and their opponents, the ice caps melted, the pound plummeted and austerity ravaged the poor ... Night night. Sweet dreams.” In the end, there were a few things that saved the collection from reading like a well-crafted, unrelenting tale of woe. The first is that, thankfully, this year was more than simply the sum of these grim events. Life goes on. Alys Fowler came out, Lindy West came off Twitter, Steven Thrasher turned 40, Deborah Orr took her first antidepressant, Giles Fraser went off sugar, Tim Dowling moved house. We also have a stable of writers who have made a special talent out of looking at grim and finding funny. John Crace coined the term “Maybot” (“Sometime between July, when she looked like the safest pair of hands amid a sea of idiots, and now, Theresa May’s brain appears to have been hacked,” he wrote in 2016). Marina Hyde gave Katie Hopkins all the respect she deserves (“Katie uses fewer active verbs than even Tony Blair or John Keats. Presumably it’s because she really doesn’t have anywhere to go philosophically”). There is no escaping that the world would be a better place if events had turned out otherwise. But there was resistance. Trump’s election incited a radical response (“Although there are plenty of reasons to be angry, this was not a march of anger,” wrote Jessica Valenti on the Women’s March). And closer to home at least one of those responses bore fruit. A vibrant electoral campaign by Labour, under Jeremy Corbyn, challenged austerity, defied critics (including many in his own party and in this paper) and left the Tory government weaker, more divided and hopelessly fragile. (“Mr Corbyn is on to something resonant, something common and something good,” argued our editorial before the election.) And there was outrage. “That tomb in the sky will be for ever Theresa May’s monument,” wrote Polly Toynbee of Grenfell. “The story of Pontypool is a story of riches squandered, of dynamism blocked, of an entire community slung on the slag heap,” wrote Aditya Chakrabortty. True these are not the kind of lines that will ease you into your slumber. But for those who like their insomnia underpinned with a sense of righteous indignation, we can at least make sure you do not go quietly into the night. One relatively new feature in the Bedside Guardian is the use of the live blog. For those events that it is valuable to see unfold, and at times unravel, in real time, they provide an invaluable means of reliving the moment as it was being reported. So long as the book graces the bedside table I have but two final pieces of advice. First, do not read the live blog of the US election before you go to sleep. To see the confidence of the evening evaporate from 1.24am (“And we’re almost at the tipping point already. Florida is looking very vulnerable for Trump”) to 4.11am (“The big picture right now is simple and clear: Hillary Clinton is in trouble”) has all the restorative joy of hearing the collected speeches of David Davis on a loop. You might as well pour yourself a double espresso and put on Game of Thrones for all the kip you’ll enjoy after getting through that. On the other hand, if it’s shut eye you want, go to the UK election live blog, where you can watch all the emperors of punditry disrobed in all their glory. 9.53pm: “Piers Morgan is happy to tweet his prediction: ‘Conservatives to win by 90-100 seat majority.’” 9.57pm: “From the Sun’s Steve Hawkes: ‘Rumour Tories could be looking at 400 seats.’” 10.01pm: “Exit poll suggests Britain is on course for a hung parliament.” Witness the sense of optimism build through the night along with a sense of astonishment that there is a viable constituency out there for hope and decency.

Nicola Dandridge, the chief executive of the Office for Students (OfS), which will take over regulation of the sector in April, said the public was right to be concerned about excessive remuneration for university leaders and outlined plans for the sector to have to justify all pay above £150,000. “We are waiting to see whether the sector can address this, seriously address this, and address the levels of pay and ensure that they are justified. And if they are not, the OfS will have to intervene,” Dandridge told the education select committee. Her comments in a hearing on value for money in higher education come after intense scrutiny of the pay deals of vice-chancellors, whose salaries and benefits are rising rapidly at a time when wages for other university staff are being pegged back. There has been official criticism of the process by which the vice-chancellor of Bath University increased her pay to the highest of any university leader in the UK, at £468,000, while the average has crept up to about £280,000. “There is a sense in which some senior salaries have got out of kilter and there is a legitimate public concern about the levels of some of the salaries,” Dandridge told the committee. “We are proposing that anyone being paid more than £150,000 per year will be required to justify it, and the OfS will look at that justification to make sure that it is appropriate. “There is an issue that needs to be addressed and it is something that we at the Office for Students, I think, have to take very seriously. If the pay can’t be justified then we will have to get into a discussion with the institution about what happens next. But we have an array of tools and responses available to us to deal with it.” The OfS, set up under recent legislation, does not come into existence until the new year. “I think it’s really critical that they try to sort this out themselves, acknowledging the wider public concerns,” Dandridge said, noting that new proposals for setting senior pay were being drawn up by the Committee of University Chairs (CUC). “We have high hopes that it is going to be robust and deal effectively with the public and political concerns that have been raised. “So yes, we have the powers. Yes, I think there is a problem. Yes, I think at the OfS we’ve absolutely got to be prepared and deal with and tackle this.” The OfS chief executive, who has been criticised for being too close to the sector by the former Labour minister Lord Adonis, also suggested that vice-chancellors’ pay could be linked to the size and scale of each university. “Some of these universities are huge, billion-pound, international operations, and some of them have far fewer responsibilities,” she told MPs. The CUC, which represents the non-executive chairs of universities’ governing councils, said it was preparing proposals for publication next year, including greater transparency in pay setting and publishing a ratio of vice-chancellors’ pay to the median earnings of their workforces. But the CUC’s evidence to the committee defended current pay levels, arguing that UK vice-chancellors are underpaid compared with those in countries including New Zealand and Australia. “Given the data available, the CUC sees no evidence that most vice-chancellors are paid an unreasonable amount for the challenging work they do,” it argued. The MPs also questioned Dandridge over a report last week by the National Audit Office, which criticised universities over value for money and offering little in the way of guidance for applicants. Dandridge said she took the NAO’s report “extremely seriously” but disagreed with some parts. “It would be a mistake to think that everything is a disaster in our higher education system,” she said. Asked about the dominance of Russell Group universities, Dandridge said there needed to be “very much better information, advice and guidance” for applicants to choose the most appropriate places to study. Amatey Doku, the National Union of Students vice-president for higher education, said: “I don’t think just saying that we need more information for students, in terms of trying to dismantle the elitism in the system, goes far enough.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/12/donald-trump-lawyer-special-counsel-russia-investigation","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T15:40:45Z","webTitle":"Trump’s lawyers call for second special counsel to investigate Russia special counsel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/12/donald-trump-lawyer-special-counsel-russia-investigation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/12/donald-trump-lawyer-special-counsel-russia-investigation","fields":{"headline":"Trump’s lawyers call for second special counsel to investigate Russia special counsel","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s lawyers are calling for the appointment of a second special counsel to investigate the special counsel overseeing the federal inquiry into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. According to a report from Axios published early Tuesday, one of Trump’s lawyers, Jay Sekulow, has raised concerns over potential conflicts of interest within special counsel Robert Mueller’s team. Sekulow issued the statement after Fox News reported that the wife of a senior justice department official had worked for Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm behind the the anti-Trump “dossier”, during the 2016 campaign. “The Department of Justice and FBI cannot ignore the multiple problems that have been created by these obvious conflicts of interests,” Sekulow said. “New revelations require the appointment of a special counsel to investigate.” The official in question, Bruce G Ohr, was demoted last week. A reason was not provided for his departure, and the justice department has not confirmed that Ohr or his wife were linked to Fusion GPS. The dossier, which contains many allegations detailing ties between Trump and Moscow, was authored by former British spy Christopher Steele. Although much the dossier has been corroborated by US officials, it has generated significant controversy for containing some unverified and salacious claims about Trump. The dossier became the subject of renewed scrutiny when it was confirmed that Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee provided funding for Fusion GPS. The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website, had funded the group during the Republican primary. It is routine for campaigns to conduct opposition research on their opponents. “The Department of Justice and FBI cannot ignore the multiple problems that have been created by these obvious conflicts of interests,” Sekulow said. “New revelations require the appointment of a special counsel to investigate.” Trump and his allies have decried what they perceive as bias in the Russia investigation and were recently emboldened when a New York Times report revealed that Mueller had reassigned a top FBI agent over potential conflict of interest. The agent, Peter Strzok, was reassigned over the summer after Mueller learned he had sent anti-Trump text messages to FBI lawyer Lisa Page. Attorney general Jeff Sessions has reportedly floated the idea of appointing a second special counsel. Trump has meanwhile called on the FBI to investigate Clinton, while repeatedly denouncing the Russia investigation as “witch hunt”. The president has yet to accept the US intelligence community’s assessment that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election. Mueller has escalated his inquiry in recent months, convening a grand jury in Washington and issuing a series of indictments against former Trump campaign officials. They include former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his deputy, Rick Gates, and Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn. George Papadopoulos, a former foreign policy adviser on Trump’s campaign, has been cooperating with Mueller’s team after pleading guilty for lying to the FBI."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/30/byron-katie-depression-change-joy-secret-stressed-thought","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T06:15:05Z","webTitle":"Byron Katie: ‘Just ask yourself, is that thought really true?’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/30/byron-katie-depression-change-joy-secret-stressed-thought","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/30/byron-katie-depression-change-joy-secret-stressed-thought","fields":{"headline":"Byron Katie: ‘Just ask yourself, is that thought really true?’","bodyText":"For a long time, Byron Katie’s children thought she was having them on. Her character seemed to change overnight, and they didn’t trust her one bit. For 10 years – until that day – she had spiralled into rage, paranoia and despair, becoming so depressed she seldom left her house. She’d stayed in bed for weeks at a time, and her children learned to tiptoe past her door to avoid her furious outbursts. But one morning, when she was 43, she woke up on the floor of a halfway house for women with eating disorders, and everything seemed different. Something in her mind had shifted, and Katie suddenly understood that all the things that had been giving her so much stress were just thoughts. Stressful thoughts, but not reality. So she could let them go. “Laughter welled up from the depths and just poured out,” she remembers. “Everything was unrecognisable.” The change that came over her was astonishing. And everybody at home thought it was too good to be true. Her daughter Roxann was particularly suspicious and used to be scared to be in the same room as her mother. What was she to make of this woman who seemed “joyful and innocent like a child, and filled with love” (as Roxann put it)? Was it a scam? Was Katie pretending to be happy all the time, and sweet and kind? Would there be some kind of payback after a few weeks? Not that quickly, no. In a short time, people who heard about the change started knocking on Katie’s door, asking her to help effect the same kind of transformation on them. Then she started getting invitations to meet small groups in people’s living rooms, then larger groups, in church halls, community centres and hotels. Since 1993, she has been on the road almost constantly, bringing what she calls The Work to anyone who wants it. The “new” Katie was here to stay. Today, on YouTube, you can watch hundreds of videos in which Katie helps people from around the world to dismantle stressful thoughts, using a line of inquiry that seems laughably simple when written down. Just spell out clearly your stressful thoughts, she explains, then ask four questions about each thought in turn: Is it true? Can you absolutely know it’s true? How do you react, what happens, when you believe the thought? Who would you be without the thought? It doesn’t sound like much, but it’s extremely diverting – often actually funny – to watch Katie walking people through these questions, from the brink of rage and despair to some kind of bliss, in front of a live audience. How can that be possible? She explains: “Most people spend a large part of their life thinking, essentially: ‘This shouldn’t be happening. I shouldn’t have to experience this. God is unjust. Life is unfair.’” Katie shows them that it’s much easier to stop struggling with reality and accept whatever is happening. Some people adore her to the point of worship. When I told friends I was interviewing her, a few responded as if I said I was meeting Gandhi, or the Buddha. And that’s not entirely off-whack, because now Katie has published a book with her husband, the Buddhist scholar Stephen Mitchell, exploring similarities between The Work and the Buddhist Diamond Sutra. I interviewed them together, in a recorded video call. Katie and Mitchell sat on a sofa against the same black background you can see on her YouTube videos. And Mitchell described his wife’s special talent: “One of the revolutionary insights Katie’s had is: no one else can possibly cause my problems. The only way that I can have any kind of problem or stress in this world is if I’m believing an untrue thought. “This makes everything extremely simple. Because if the problem is with me, then the solution is with me. “I don’t have to change anybody in my family, my children, my spouse. I can absolutely transform the situation by becoming aware of what it is I’m thinking and then questioning those stressful thoughts.” Many people will find this hard to swallow. They might even say it sounds like victim-blaming. But Katie has helped people do The Work on rape, war in Vietnam and Bosnia, torture, internment in Nazi concentration camps, the death of a child and the prolonged pain of illnesses such as cancer. “Many people think it’s not humanly possible to accept extreme experiences like these,” she says. But she has seen that it is. (You can watch some of those conversations online, and judge for yourself.) Of course, most people’s stressful thoughts are more humdrum. But that’s good, because Katie says the “teachers” we need most are the people we live with: “You can write an entire worksheet on your mother, and later find that your relationship with your daughter has dramatically improved, because you were attached to the same thoughts about her, though you weren’t aware of it.” I ask how long it took for her family to embrace The Work. “One day, after disappearing for three days, Roxann came home and pleaded: ‘Mom, I can’t do this any more. Please help me. Whatever this thing is that you’re giving to all these people who come to our house, I want it.’” Katie obliged. And her older son Bobby came to trust Katie enough to share something that had troubled him for years: “You always favoured Ross [his brother] over me, always loved him the most.” But instead of scolding Bobby for saying this, as she would have done in the past, Katie asked herself if what he said was true. “I’d invited my children to speak honestly, because I wanted to know the truth. So I said, ‘Honey, I see it. You’re right. I was very confused then.’” Family life throws up constant surprises, and opportunities for stressful thoughts – about the tasks we have to do, or the people we live with, she says. We must make a habit of investigating them. It’s a process. It never ends. “Roxann called me one day and said she wanted me to attend my grandson’s birthday party. I said I had a commitment that day in another city. She was so hurt and angry that she hung up on me. Then maybe 10 minutes later she called and said, ‘I’m so excited, Momma. I just did The Work on you, and I saw that there is nothing you can do to keep me from loving you.” • A Mind at Home With Itself by Byron Katie (Rider, £12.99).

He had the keys to a space, Bay 56, in Acklam Village near Portobello Road in west London. “When the Grenfell fire happened, I made a call to the person at the Westway Trust who had given me the keys and I said, ‘You see what’s going on, we need to use this space,’” he says. “They said, ‘Do what you’ve got to do.’” With local and national response almost nonexistent in the days that followed the fire, the community filled the void. The Westway Sports Centre was the focal point for people to get information about missing family members as volunteers grappled with lists and clipboards. Beds were set up there for people to sleep in. Community centres, churches and mosques in the area received mountains of donations, and the streets were full of people trying to help. Bay 56 at Acklam Village, a small space with a weekend market a short walk from Grenfell Tower, became the central point for local donations. “A lot of the other community centres that were helping were right in the middle of the smoke and the debris, so this was close but a little out of the way,” says Hailstones. “We could use this as a safe zone, we could offer counselling, therapy, stuff like that.” Since 14 June, Hailstones has held on to the keys, and the space has become a symbolic hub for the community. “We each had our breakdown moments in here,” says Emzee, a community volunteer. With trust severely damaged between the community, the council and the media, Bay 56, known locally as “the Village”, became a healing space. Throughout July it was full of boxes and local volunteers sorting them. Six months on, they have been cleared away to make room for meetings, film screenings and other events. “The trust came up to see what we were doing,” says Hailstones. “They said it’s great work you’ve been doing, then they asked me how long is a piece of string, and we explained to them we can’t answer that but we’re going to be here for a little while.” For five months, Hailstones even slept at the Village, watching over the space. Hailstones was born and grew up in the area and has been involved in community activism in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC) for decades. He has chaired the Westway 23 community group for several years, seeking to protect the 23 acres of land below the Westway for communal use, rather than see it turned into retail space, as happened in Brixton and Shoreditch. Lots of younger people in the area respectfully refer to him as “uncle”, and seek his advice – so he was the first point of call when Nii Sackey, who had been volunteering at one of the walls in the area where residents documented their experiences of the fire, came forward with a new space. He knew of a former Kensington and Chelsea college building at Maxilla Walk, close to Ladbroke Grove and in the shadow of Grenfell, that was unoccupied. Sackey and his friend had been to look around. “As it happens,” says Sackey, “all the doors were open for us as we got here and we found the box of keys when we went into the office so we didn’t have to force entry.” That happened at the beginning of October, and since then, many of the people who were involved in the Village have been working across the two sites. Rubbish has been cleared from the yard, repairs have been done to the inside of the building and community members of all ages are helping develop the occupied space. A sign at the entrance reads: “This is not a squat.” It’s referred to locally as “the City” and is a work in progress. A recording studio has been decorated with materials donated by Ms Dynamite. There’s a space where yoga classes are held. Several rooms have been labelled as community spaces and local people are regularly passing through to help. Senait, 28, lost family in the Grenfell fire and is one of the people working in the City. “People haven’t been reached out to,” she says of the government response. “There’s been no followup on my mental health, nothing. For me, my healing was in Acklam Village. I was traumatised and it was the community who helped me get through that.” Now, the new space is helping to fill the “big gap in what the community needs”. These feelings are echoed elsewhere in an area where trust between the council and those most affected by the economic disparity in the area has completely eroded. The RBKC’s deputy leader, Cllr Kim Taylor-Smith, was invited along to the City by those working on it several weeks ago. Following his visit, on 28 November, Taylor-Smith wrote an email to Hailstones in which he said that, while the council intended to seek a court order to protect its interests, it did not intend to take enforcement action. He wrote: “I was impressed with what has been achieved in such a short period of time and there is something that we can work on.” “It’s too late to shut us down after all the work we’ve done now,” 24-year-old Usama says. “Each and every one of us here wholeheartedly believes that what we are doing is right,” says Senait. “We’ve got no money motivation; our motivation is strictly the enrichment of our community.” The current circumstances have presented an unprecedented situation. “We’re getting to some of the harder-to-reach people in the area,” says Hailstones. “We’ve got them engaged, working together in an intergenerational way painting walls and building this space for the community. Something very special is happening here and preventing that from happening will only be detrimental in the long run, because those same people are not happy with the situation that they’re living in, and they do still want justice in terms of what happened at Grenfell, so they’re not going to be fobbed off.” In a statement, Taylor-Smith admitted that the council faces a dilemma. “People have taken over a large council building that is designated to be a purpose-built adult social-care hub ... On the one hand we have squatters who have set up a community-led but unregulated operation. On the other, we have vulnerable young adults, some with severe disability, for whom we had dedicated this space to support their needs. “We have lots of requests for community space and so we have commissioned an independent review in the borough to see how this can be provided in an organised and coordinated way, rather than in an ad hoc fashion. I have met the groups occupying the former college twice and am discussing the options with them so we can find the right way forward for all of the community.” This Thursday marks six months since the Grenfell fire, and the first formal sessions of the inquiry began this week. Four out of five families made homeless by the fire still don’t have homes, and, according to the support group Grenfell United, 118 households will still be in emergency accommodation or with friends over the holiday period. A silent march is planned on 14 December after which the doors of the City will be fully opened to the public. Hailstones and the others working in the space are keen to show people what they have achieved by themselves. “That’s the key, self empowerment, an uplifting story six months after the fire that it’s not all failure, it’s not all what isn’t getting done, that this community is taking control of its destiny and making sure that there’s a different future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/16/baking-for-christmas-recipes-claire-ptak-steffi-knowles-dellner-ruby-tandoh","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-16T10:00:02Z","webTitle":"Top Christmas bakes from Claire Ptak, Steffi Knowles-Dellner and Ruby Tandoh | Baking","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/16/baking-for-christmas-recipes-claire-ptak-steffi-knowles-dellner-ruby-tandoh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/16/baking-for-christmas-recipes-claire-ptak-steffi-knowles-dellner-ruby-tandoh","fields":{"headline":"Top Christmas bakes from Claire Ptak, Steffi Knowles-Dellner and Ruby Tandoh","bodyText":"Claire Ptak’s figgy mulled wine honey cake (main picture) Dried figs are plumped with the remains of leftover red wine – so the perfect thing to make on Boxing Day – and steeped in spices, then drenched in honey. The texture and stickiness of this one makes it my favourite. Makes 1 cake 400g dried figs 165g unsalted butter 75g brandy 300ml red wine Zest of 1 orange, and 25ml freshly squeezed orange juice 250g honey, plus a little extra for drizzling 1 egg 1½ tsp ground cinnamon ¼ tsp ground cloves 200g wholemeal wheat or wholemeal spelt flour 1½ tsp baking powder ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda 1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4 and line a 23cm cake tin with baking parchment. 2 Trim the rough stems off the figs, then chop into 1cm pieces. Cut the butter into small pieces and allow it to soften to room temperature. 3 Put the brandy, wine and dried figs in a heavy-based saucepan and simmer over a medium-low heat to plump the figs. After 15 minutes, remove the pan from the heat and cool for 20 minutes. 4 Add the orange zest and juice, then stir in the butter and honey. Leave for 15 minutes, then whisk in the egg. 5 In a separate bowl, whisk together the cinnamon, cloves, flour, baking powder and bicarbonate of soda. Slowly whisk this mixture into the wet ingredients, then transfer everything into the prepared tin, and bake for 45 minutes. 6 Cool the cake in the tin for 10 minutes, then turn out on to a plate. To serve, drizzle with a little extra honey and serve warm with yoghurt. Steffi Knowles-Dellner’s sticky buns Perfect for Christmas morning, and lazy afternoons thereafter. You could use nuts, such as almonds, in the caramel for some extra crunch, though the contrast of pillowy softness with the simple crunch of sea salt also works a treat. Makes 16-18 For the dough 150g butter 500ml whole milk 50g fresh yeast 125g caster sugar 2 tsp ground cardamom or 1 ½ tsp cardamom pods, split open and seeds bashed 1 tsp salt About 800g strong white bread flour 1 egg, beaten For the filling 125g butter, softened 150g light brown sugar 3 tbsp golden syrup 180ml double cream A pinch of salt 50g almonds, chopped (optional) 3 tsp ground cinnamon 75g caster sugar 1 To make the dough: melt the butter in a pan, pour in the milk and heat intil just warm to the touch. Crumble the yeast into your largest bowl with a little of the buttery milk. Stir until the yeast has dissolved, then add the remaining liquid. Add the sugar, cardamom and 1 tsp salt, then about 700g of the flour. 2 Mix into a wet dough, then tip on to a lightly floured surface and knead it together. It will be a bit difficult to handle, but moving it vigorously around or slapping and folding it will have an impact. Add a bit more flour if absolutely necessary. Return to a clean bowl and sprinkle with flour. Cover with a tea towel and allow to rise in a warmish place for 1 hour, or until doubled in size. It should now be smooth as “a baby’s bottom”, as my mormor used to say, with a fond pat. Knock the dough back a bit while still in the bowl, then tip on to a floured surface. Knead for a few minutes, adding more flour if the dough seems very wet. It is ready when it releases from the surface easily and, if you slash into the dough with a very sharp knife, there are evenly distributed small air bubbles. Cut the dough in half and roll each half out to form a rectangle, roughly 30 x 40cm. 3 Line a large high-sided baking tin with baking parchment. 4 While the dough is rising, melt half the butter in a small saucepan, then add the brown sugar and golden syrup. Simmer over a low-medium heat until the sugar has dissolved then add the cream and bring to the boil for 5 minutes. Add a pinch of sea salt and allow to cool until just warm to the touch, tasting to see if more salt is necessary. Sprinkle the almonds, if using, into the prepared baking tin and pour the caramel sauce over the top, spreading it out evenly. 5 Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas 6. Knead the dough, then divide in half and roll into 2 rectangles. Spread with the remaining butter, cinnamon and caster sugar. Roll up the rectangles and slice into buns – you should have enough for about 16–18. 6 Arrange these on top of the caramel, about 1cm apart. Cover with a tea towel and let it prove for 30 minutes. 7 Brush the buns with the beaten egg, and bake for 15–20 minutes, then remove from the oven and allow to cool a little before flipping over. You may find that some of the caramel sticks to the baking parchment, but you should be able to scrape it off and disperse it over the buns. Cool completely on a wire rack set over a baking sheet to catch any dripping caramel, before sprinkling with a little extra sea salt. Pull apart to serve. Ruby Tandoh’s easy fig and ale Christmas cake This is a last-minute affair compared with many Christmas cakes – but you should still soak the fruit overnight or at least for a few hours. It is still moist, dark and rich, and made in a fraction of the time it might usually take. To soak 200g prunes, chopped 300g currants 100g glace cherries, chopped 150g dried figs, chopped 175ml stout For the cake 175g unsalted butter, softened 175g soft light brown sugar 4 large eggs 2 tbsp black treacle Zest of 1 orange 125g dark rye flour 50g plain flour 2 tsp mixed spice 1½ tsp baking powder ¼ tsp salt 75g blanched hazelnuts, finely chopped 1 The day before you make the cake, combine the fruit in a bowl and douse with the stout (a good porter or, at a push, brown ale will suffice, but the mellow, chocolatey depth of stout is best). Cover the bowl with clingfilm and leave overnight – or at least for a good few hours – until the fruit has absorbed most of the liquid. 2 The next day, when you’re ready to make the cake batter, preheat the oven to 150C/300F/gas mark 2, line a deep, 20cm round cake tin with baking parchment and wrap the outside in a couple of layers of foil to prevent the cake’s edge from drying during the long baking time. 3 Cream the butter and sugar together until completely smooth then, one by one, add the eggs. The mixture is likely to curdle a little at this point, but don’t panic: just add 2 tbsp or so of plain flour to smooth the mix. Stir in the treacle and zest. In a separate bowl, combine the flours, mixed spice, baking powder and salt. Add these dry ingredients to the wet mixture and stir until roughly combined. 4 Add the hazelnuts to the batter along with the soaked fruit mixture (including any stout left unabsorbed). Combine thoroughly. Spoon the mixture into the prepared tin and place on the middle shelf of the oven. Bake for 3½-4 hours, or until a small knife inserted into the centre of the cake emerges clean. If the top of the cake begins to darken too deeply during the baking time, just cover with foil. 5 Once baked, let the cake cool completely in its tin before decorating. It could take overnight to cool, but it’s crucial to wait until it’s stone cold before slicing. It will continue to firm, set and mellow as it approaches room temperature. Decorate it (or not) however you please. •This article was amended on 2 January 2018 to specify where to add the beaten egg in step 7 of the method for Steffi Knowles-Dellner’s sticky buns."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/12/palmer-harvey-lose-jobs-weeks-christmas-administrators","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T17:42:39Z","webTitle":"Palmer & Harvey: 400 more workers lose jobs weeks before Christmas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/12/palmer-harvey-lose-jobs-weeks-christmas-administrators","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/12/palmer-harvey-lose-jobs-weeks-christmas-administrators","fields":{"headline":"Palmer & Harvey: 400 more workers lose jobs weeks before Christmas","bodyText":"More than 400 more people have lost their jobs at the groceries wholesaler Palmer &amp; Harvey less than a fortnight before Christmas as administrators’ attempts to sell part of the business failed. The group, which delivered goods to 90,000 grocery and convenience stores, including Tesco, Sainsbury’s and the Costcutter chain, called in administrators last month, resulting in 2,500 immediate redundancies. P&amp;H had been scrambling to shore up its finances since the spring amid a shake-out in the grocery wholesale market. Tesco won provisional approval of its takeover of Booker last month, while the Co-op’s buyout of Nisa recently won the backing of shareholders and it has now taken on distribution to the Costcutter chain. The Guardian also uncovered that P&amp;H directors, former directors and other shareholders had extracted about £70m in cash from the grocery wholesaler over the past nine years despite ongoing losses. Matthew Callaghan, a joint administrator and PricewaterhouseCoopers partner, said the team had hoped to find a buyer for P&amp;H’s businesses, which sell confectionary and drinks direct from vans to convenience stores. He said there had been interest from potential buyers but no successful deal, resulting in another round of redundancies. He said: “We will be working with those being made redundant, as we have with those made redundant previously, to assist and provide support where possible.” Mark Todd, a national officer for the Usdaw union, said: “Our members are devastated that administrators have not been able to find a buyer for the Palmer &amp; Harvey van delivery business, particularly as these redundancies fall just before Christmas.” About 450 people are still left in the remaining businesses at P&amp;H. The P&amp;H job losses come as administrators for the furniture chain Multiyork said they would be making 112 people redundant and beginning a wind-down process after failing to find a buyer. The roles are all at the group’s head office in Thetford, Norfolk, while its 50 stores will continue to trade. Allan Graham of Duff &amp; Phelps, the joint administrator, said some offers had been made for the business but “they were not at a level that either produced an acceptable outcome for the company’s stakeholders or could guarantee the future stability of the business”. “We will continue efforts to sell all – or parts of – the business; but during this period of managed wind-down, the process of selling in-store display items and other business assets will begin. We will also continue to fulfil customer orders,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/12/potty-training-messy-pay-surrey-toilet","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T13:30:37Z","webTitle":"Potty training gets messy.

But I wouldn’t pay anyone else to do it","bodyText":"A couple from Surrey are finding themselves the subject of public scrutiny after they placed an advert on a childcare website seeking a professional to potty train their three-year-old child for £50 an hour plus a “handsome bonus”. Thus far, a bit weird – but not off the scale. The professional potty trainer has, after all, been a thing in America for some time. Read on, however, and it becomes truly bizarre and somewhat disturbing. In something akin to an intensive-driving course, the couple want the whole thing done and dusted in time for the mother-in-law to pop round for sherry on Christmas Eve, and suggest that two hours a day over five days might do the trick, showing a basic lack of understanding about how small children or human bladders and bowels work. I’m all for live and let live, let he who is without sin cast the first stone and all that, but the advert made my eyes widen in disbelief. Perhaps it’s the arbitrary deadline set to please a relative, or maybe it’s the references to the family dog Rex (possibly known as Rexy-Wexy) which give the distinct impression that he comes somewhat higher in the pecking order than the unnamed three-year-old daughter. Maybe it’s the daughter being labelled as “somewhat difficult and doesn’t respond well to authority”. Isn’t that all three-year-olds? The advert states that the poster and her husband work “full time, demanding” jobs and therefore simply don’t have the time required to undertake potty training with their only child, who day-to-day is under the care of a housekeeper, not equipped to take on (or perhaps not paid enough for) the role of potty-training mentor. As a mother of two, I completely understand that working full time and parenting is a very tough gig indeed. Even when, like me, you have the flexibility provided by being a freelancer, there are so many pressures from all angles that you can’t possibly give 100% to your work and 100% to your children at all times. You should take all the shortcuts you can for your own sanity, and if you’re going to outsource a parenting job, why not make it the messiest and most unglamorous of them all? With potty training round two on the horizon, I can imagine the lure of paying someone else to tackle the task on your behalf. Unless you’re one of those people who claims you potty trained your child in 17 minutes and they never had a single accident (in which case I believe the advert is still live, if you’d like to apply) you will come out the other side with stories that will make child-free friends gasp in disgust and/or sympathy. I have suffered the burning humiliation from having to dash into a Wetherspoon’s toilet with a child under my arm who is shouting loudly that their poo is coming out RIGHT NOW, and demanding their reward sweetie. I have felt that sinking feeling upon consigning a favourite pair of shoes to the bin, covered in unspeakable substances after a swerving into a layby for a roadside emergency wee. I have scrubbed surfaces, and clothes, and apologised, and cried into wine in frustration. But, when it comes down to it, I believe that teaching a child to use a toilet is a job for a parent or familiar and trusted caregiver. Even if I could afford to hand my son over to a stranger, waving a cheque smugly in the knowledge that I won’t be the one cleaning up poo, I probably wouldn’t. Apart from anything else, after four years of parenting I’m basically immune to bodily fluids now. Actually, given the fact that I do indeed have some experience in this area (maybe not 10 years’ worth, but everyone lies on their CV, right?) I am sorely tempted to put in an application. It’s Christmas and all that and £50 an hour isn’t too shabby. • Fran Taylor is the tired creator and owner of two small people.

Emblazoned with flashing lights or more tasteful alpine motifs, the festive apparel is so popular that about £220m will be spent on them in the run up to Christmas this year. New research by environmental charity Hubbub also reveals that for many owners, last year’s look will not do; one in three under-35s buy a new Christmas jumper every year. The survey of more than 3,000 UK consumers shows that 24% do not want to be seen in the same jumper as previous years while 29% say they are so cheap that they might as well get a new one every year. One in four jumpers purchased last year were either binned or are unlikely to be worn again. More than a third (35%) of people admit they only wear their jumper once in the festive period, so many are as good as new. “The Christmas jumper phenomenon is now a firm part of our Christmas celebrations in the UK and it has raised a lot of money for charity,” said Hubbub’s Sarah Divall. “However, it’s also the perfect opportunity to reflect on our addiction to fast fashion which is having a devastating impact on the environment. I’d urge people to think twice about whether they really need to buy a new jumper this year. Instead let’s dig out all those Christmas jumpers hiding away in wardrobes and swap with a friend or donate them to charity shops or even refashion something you already own.” The Ellen MacArthur foundation recently exposed the scale of the waste generated by the fashion industry, and how its throwaway culture generates greenhouse emissions of 1.2bn tonnes a year – more than international flights and shipping combined."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/dec/13/polish-up-your-pecs-women-prefer-strong-men-say-scientists","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T00:01:04Z","webTitle":"Polish up your pecs: women prefer strong men, say scientists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/dec/13/polish-up-your-pecs-women-prefer-strong-men-say-scientists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/dec/13/polish-up-your-pecs-women-prefer-strong-men-say-scientists","fields":{"headline":"Polish up your pecs: women prefer strong men, say scientists","bodyText":"Some women may claim that chiselled abs and giant biceps are not what they are seeking in a man. But a scientific study suggests that if your female partner tells you this, she is probably just being kind. The study, on the subject of male bodily attractiveness, has found that the most Herculean bodies were universally the most appealing, according to the 160 women doing the rating. “We weren’t surprised that women found physically strong men attractive ... what did surprise us was just how powerful the effect was,” said Aaron Sell, a senior lecturer at Griffith University, Queensland, Australia, who led the work. “Our data couldn’t find even a single woman that preferred weaker or feminine male bodies.” The findings runs counter to a theory that has been gaining traction in the field of male attractiveness research, that there exists a “sweet spot” for brawn, and that beyond a certain threshold too much strength becomes unappealing. This view is wrong, the team behind the latest study claim. Aaron Lukaszewski, an evolutionary psychologist at California State University, said: “The theory is that, yes, there would have been benefits ancestrally, in terms of the ability to acquire resources, protecting offspring, hunting and so on. But at a certain point, mating with highly dominant men, they can exert all this aggressive coercive control and there might be costs.” The paper, published in the Royal Society journal Proceedings B, highlights the further potential downside that physically formidable men might be “better able to invest resources in a family [but] less willing to do so than weaker men of poorer quality”. However, the empirical evidence suggests that if there are downsides to being muscular, this fact is not reflected in female preferences. Lukaszewski said the field appears to have been misled by studies which used line drawings of the male body, rather than photographs. “Most of the studies have been done using line drawings, which have shown hulk-like freaks of nature, that are at the borderline of looking like a human,” he said. In the latest study, 160 women were shown photographs of male bodies, with the head blanked out and asked to rate them for attractiveness. One set of photographs showed male university students and a second set showed men recruited from a gym, who worked out between three to five times each week. The men were also given a strength test. The strength of a man was by far the strongest predictor of whether he was rated as attractive - it explained 70% of the difference in scores. Being tall gave men a small boost of a few percentage points, while being overweight incurred a few negative points. “Our results suggest that even if you’re a bit overweight, looking strong can buffer that. Basically, being a strong, fat guy is OK, which I think would bring comfort to many.” The team said they now intend to turn their gaze to the question of why the results differ to studies on facial attractiveness where women have shown a preference for feminine male faces. “It looks like the face is being analysed differently by women, and we’re not sure why yet,” said Sell. • This article was amended on 13 December 2017 to correct the spelling of Aaron Lukaszewski’s name"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/18/guardian-bbc-legal-action-paradise-papers","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T16:39:19Z","webTitle":"Guardian to fight legal action over Paradise Papers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/18/guardian-bbc-legal-action-paradise-papers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/18/guardian-bbc-legal-action-paradise-papers","fields":{"headline":"Guardian to fight legal action over Paradise Papers","bodyText":"The Guardian is to defend robustly a legal action seeking to force the disclosure of the documents that formed the basis of its Paradise Papers investigation. The offshore company at the heart of the story, Appleby, has launched breach of confidence proceedings against the Guardian and the BBC. In legal correspondence, Appleby has also demanded that the Guardian and the BBC disclose any of the 6m Appleby documents that informed their reporting for a project that provoked worldwide anger and debate over the tax dodges used by individuals and multinational companies. Appleby is also seeking damages for the disclosure of what it says are confidential legal documents. The documents were leaked to the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, which shared them with a US-based organisation, the Pulitzer-prize-winning International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). The ICIJ coordinated the Paradise Papers project, which included 380 journalists from 96 media organisations across 67 countries. The consortium included the New York Times, Le Monde, the ABC in Australia and CBC News in Canada. The project revealed details of the complex arrangements and offshore activities of some of the world’s richest people and companies. It has already provoked a formal inquiry by the Australian tax office, a review by HMRC into VAT schemes on the Isle of Man, and calls from the EU finance commissioner, Pierre Moscovici, for changes in the law to stop “vampires” avoiding paying tax. Appleby has said the documents were stolen in a cyber-hack and there was no public interest in the stories published about it and its clients. It has brought legal action against only the Guardian and the BBC, both UK-based media organisations. The Guardian said it intended to defend the legal action. A spokesman for the Guardian said the claim could have profound consequences, and deter British media organisations from undertaking serious, investigative journalism in the public interest. He said: “We can confirm that a claim has been issued against the Guardian. The claim does not challenge the truth of the stories we published. Instead it is an attempt to undermine our responsible public interest journalism and to force us to to disclose documents that we regard as journalistic material. “This claim could have serious consequences for investigative journalism in the UK. Ninety-six of the world’s most respected media organisations concluded there was significant public interest in undertaking the Paradise Papers project and hundreds of articles have been published in recent weeks as a result of the work undertaken by partners. We will be defending ourselves vigorously against this claim as we believe our reporting was responsible and a matter of legitimate public interest.” A BBC spokesperson said: “The BBC will strongly defend its role and conduct in the Paradise Papers project. Our serious and responsible journalism is resulting in revelations which are clearly of the highest public interest and has revealed matters which would otherwise have remained secret. Already we are seeing authorities taking action as a consequence.” Appleby said it was “obliged to take legal action”. It said: “Our overwhelming responsibility is to our clients and our own colleagues who have had their private and confidential information taken in what was a criminal act. We need to know firstly which of their – and our – documents were taken. “We would want to explain in detail to our clients and our colleagues the extent to which their confidentiality has been attacked. Despite repeated requests the journalists have failed to provide to us copies of the stolen documents they claim to have seen. For this reason, Appleby is obliged to take legal action in order to ascertain what information has been stolen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/dec/12/fossil-hunters-find-man-sized-penguin-on-new-zealand-beach","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T16:48:29Z","webTitle":"Fossil hunters find bones of human-sized penguin on New Zealand beach","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/dec/12/fossil-hunters-find-man-sized-penguin-on-new-zealand-beach","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/dec/12/fossil-hunters-find-man-sized-penguin-on-new-zealand-beach","fields":{"headline":"Fossil hunters find bones of human-sized penguin on New Zealand beach","bodyText":"The remnants of an ancient penguin that stood as tall as a human have been found encased in rock on a beach in New Zealand. Fossil hunters chanced upon the prehistoric bones in sedimentary rock that formed 55m to 60m years ago on what is now Hampden beach in Otago in the country’s South Island. Measurements of the partial skeleton show that the flightless bird weighed about 100kg and had a body length of 1.77 metres (5ft 10in), equal to the average height of an American man. Emperor penguins, the tallest penguin species alive today, reach only 1.2 metres when fully grown. Penguins evolved from flying birds tens of millions of years ago, but lost the ability to get airborne and became accomplished swimmers instead. Once grounded, some penguin species became much larger, growing from about 80cm tall to twice the size. The pieces of the latest skeleton, including wing, spine, breast and leg bones, were first discovered more than a decade ago, but the rock holding the fossilised bones was so hard that it has taken until now for researchers to prepare and study the remains. Rather than the usual black-and-white colouring, the ancient penguin was probably brownish and had a longer beak than its modern-day cousins. “It would most likely have been slimmer too and not so cute looking,” said Gerald Mayr at the Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History Museum in Frankfurt. “It’s one of the tallest penguins that has ever been found.” Researchers named the new species Kumimanu biceae, after the Maori words “kumi”, meaning a large mythological monster, and “manu” for bird. The second part of the name honours Beatrice Tennyson, known as “Bice”, the mother of Alan Tennyson, a senior researcher on the team. The fossilised remains of giant penguins have been found from 20m to 50m years ago, but older examples are extremely rare. The latest specimen, reported in Nature Communications, suggests that some penguins became giants soon after penguins first evolved and switched from flight to diving. At the time the newly discovered species was alive it would have shared the warm subtropical environment with other sea birds, turtles and sharks. Giant penguins went extinct about 20m years ago ,when marine mammals arrived in the form of toothed whales, seals and other creatures. What spelled the end is unclear, but the big birds may have struggled to compete with marine mammals for food, or may have become the meal of choice for the new predators. Another species of giant penguin, discovered in Antarctica in 2014, may have been even taller than Kumimanu biceae. Bones from the 37m-year-old “colossus penguin”, or Palaeeudyptes klekowskii, suggest the animal stretched two metres from beak to foot and weighed 115kg."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2017/dec/13/tanzania-pardons-two-child-rapists-arrest-pregnant-schoolgirls-president-magufuli","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T06:30:12Z","webTitle":"Tanzania pardons two child rapists and calls for arrest of pregnant schoolgirls","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/dec/13/tanzania-pardons-two-child-rapists-arrest-pregnant-schoolgirls-president-magufuli","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2017/dec/13/tanzania-pardons-two-child-rapists-arrest-pregnant-schoolgirls-president-magufuli","fields":{"headline":"Tanzania pardons two child rapists and calls for arrest of pregnant schoolgirls","bodyText":"Activists accused Tanzania’s leaders of “promoting a culture of human rights violations”, as the release of two high-profile child rapists this week coincided with calls for pregnant schoolgirls to be arrested. John Magufuli, the Tanzanian president, pardoned the two men, who were convicted of the rape of 10 primary school children aged between six and eight, along with thousands of other prisoners, in his independence day speech on Saturday. News of their release emerged as a government official in the east African country called for pregnant pupils to be taken into custody. On Monday, John Mongella, the regional commissioner of Mwanza, said the move would force girls to testify against those who impregnated them. This followed calls from the president earlier this year to ban pregnant girls from school. The released rapists are singer Nguzu Viking, known as Babu Seya, and his son, Johnson Ngazu, known as Papii Kocha, who were pardoned by the president after serving 13 years of their sentence. They had been convicted in 2003 of raping the children, pupils at Mashujaa primary school in the Kinondoni district of Dar es Salaam. Fazia Mohamed, the director of Equality Now’s Africa office, said: “While President Mungafuli is pardoning convicted child rapists, regional commissioner John Mongella is calling on pregnant school girls to be arrested and taken to court. Tanzania’s leaders are promoting a culture of human rights violations in which young victims of sexual violence are being punished while perpetrators are going free.” She said the policy of banning pregnant schoolgirls, often victims of rape or sexual coercion, failed to address the issue of who impregnated them. “It is unacceptable that convicted child molesters walk free by order of a president who simultaneously denies victims of assault access to education if they become pregnant. “After seeing their attackers sentenced to life for rape, now these survivors and their families are dealing with the pain of witnessing the president freeing the men who violated them. Where is the justice in that?” she said. Petrider Paul, of Youth for Change, in Tanzania, said the pardons sent a “terrible” message to perpetrators of sexual violence and devalued their victims. “It is unfair to the victims of these crimes and it sends a bad message to perpetrators that they can get away with it,” said Paul. The release of the men caused outrage on social media, with many posting the statements of the young girls who were violated, she said. Children’s rights groups say this is just the latest example of the president’s lack of understanding of violence against children. Kate McAlpine, the director of Community for Children’s Rights in Tanzania, told the BBC she was “horrified but unsurprised” by Magufuli’s decision or the call to arrest pregnant schoolgirls. “This story is indicative of a failure at the top level of political will to end violence against children,” she said. “Pregnant schoolgirls are pregnant because they are victims of violence. He has a blind spot when it comes to recognising children as victims. There seems to be a punitive attitude towards young children.” She said the fact the two men were jailed in the first place was unusual in a country where most rape cases are resolved within families. A change.org petition calling for schoolgirls who are pregnant in Tanzania to be allowed to complete their education has attracted 66,000 signatures. Magufuli, who came to power in November 2015, is a popular figure, nicknamed the “the bulldozer” for his energetic road-building programme as former works minister and for his solutions-based approach. His war on corruption and wasteful spending has earned him admiration from many quarters. However, he has come under fire recently for using repressive legislation to silence the media, civil society and opposition groups. In October, the Mwanahalisi newspaper became the second to be banned in Tanzania in a year, after publishing articles criticising the president."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"healthcare-network/2017/dec/14/faced-burnout-doctor-struggling-nhs-quit","type":"article","sectionId":"healthcare-network","sectionName":"Healthcare Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T11:56:45Z","webTitle":"I didn't train as a doctor to prop up a struggling NHS – so I quit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2017/dec/14/faced-burnout-doctor-struggling-nhs-quit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/healthcare-network/2017/dec/14/faced-burnout-doctor-struggling-nhs-quit","fields":{"headline":"I didn't train as a doctor to prop up a struggling NHS – so I quit","bodyText":"Almost a year ago, I sat in the office of a counsellor, the third in five years, in another attempt to “learn how to cope” with the working life of a junior doctor. I was ready to hang up my stethoscope, which had become a noose around my neck. The storm had been brewing since my early days as a junior doctor. On paper, I was blossoming: I had spent five years at university and six in acute specialties, building a CV shining with national prizes and publications. However, a crumbling NHS forcing doctors to compromise care and the inflexible path for mothers in part-time training led to my departure. After battling both for six years, I faced burnout and was directed to a counsellor to help me, in the words of senior male colleagues, “toughen up and comply with the system”. Efficiency measures combined with increasing patient demands and a lack of social care mean there are not enough staff, beds or provisions to meet current needs. I faced two options: comply and lower my standards or fight the system and stay a little longer, working a little harder to maintain the level of care I trained to provide. But the latter comes with a personal sacrifice and often results in burnout; mental health problems within the profession are rife, but seldom discussed. Life on the wards felt like being on the frontline of a war zone, and there were nights when three doctors were on call for over 1,200 medical patients, when if the patient wasn’t nearing cardiac arrest, they weren’t sick enough to be seen. There were days when I was solely responsible for a list of 50 patients and had to manage the ward round. These incidents are no longer the exception. My own response was to fight for more senior cover and to change the system. But I was handed the number for occupational health and told it was my problem for being unable to cope with the pressures. There was no acknowledgement of a desperately failing system. After having a child and going part-time, I decided to move into general practice. Suddenly I was faced with another problem: I was unable to get appropriate training. I had two years’ experience in A&amp;E and obstetrics; I identified that I would need more time in psychiatry, elderly care and paediatrics, specialties requiring more work in the community. Instead, I was informed by my training provider that I was required to work in A&amp;E again as this was where there was most need. And, despite being part-time with a one-year-old child and a husband training in a hospital 50 miles away, I was expected to work the full range of shifts and weekends. Due to doctor shortages, working part-time wasn’t an option; I was pressured to work longer hours than I felt able, or face moving 50 miles in the opposite direction to my family. The stress of this unsupportive environment left me close to emotional burnout and revisiting a counsellor to find out “what was wrong with me” and why I couldn’t mould my attitude to the requirements of the service. Sitting in her office and reflecting, I realised that wanting to care for patients and do the job I had trained to do was normal; wanting to live with my family, raise my own child and work part-time wasn’t far-fetched. That’s when I decided to quit. The sense of relief in that moment far outweighed any guilt for abandoning the sinking ship. The current climate within the NHS and doctors’ training is dire. Professional training needs to be more flexible to encourage a balanced approach for working mothers, and to reflect the needs of trainee GPs, not acute hospital staff shortages. The situation is not sustainable and compromised care is a burden on patients and doctors alike. I have swapped my stethoscope for paintbrushes and school runs as I build my own art and design business and continue being a mum and wife. Leaving the NHS was the hardest decision of my life. Recently, I was stopped in the street by a former patient who thanked me for my care in her hour of need. I can at least walk away knowing that my time as a doctor was not wasted. I was good at what I did, but the fight of being a doctor in a struggling NHS is not what I trained to do.

Our cat Goliath had a fetish for silken baubles and would go to great lengths to grab one – bringing down the whole tree if need be – a source of merry mayhem for us youngsters. R M Fransson, Wheat Ridge, Colorado, US • Growing up in Sweden, it was all those small Swedish flags on Christmas trees. We had arrived after the war as Estonian refugees and those small flags became symbols of peace and freedom. We continued with the flags even after we had emigrated to Canada. Reiner Jaakson, Oakville, Ontario, Canada • The Christmas elf that was nestled in the branches of the Christmas tree. Ann Scarfe, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada • The delicate coloured glass balls on the large, front-room-filling spruce Christmas tree, selected for perfection by my farmworker father. Steve Thomas, Yarralumla, ACT, Australia • Snow, snow, heaps of snow! David Tucker, Halle, Germany • The empty pillow slip on the end of my bed on Christmas Eve, ready for Santa Claus. Ted Webber, Buderim, Queensland, Australia • Unquestionably the real candles on the Christmas tree in our living room with the lights out. How the house didn’t burn down I never fathomed. Perhaps the magic was working both ways! Martin London, Christchurch, New Zealand • The now bedraggled-looking star that has always decorated our Christmas tree and that I remember being placed there since I was a very young child. It’s now at a minimum of 75 years old and, before they flew the coop, was enjoyed by our children as well. As to why, I can only attribute it to the emotionally charged atmosphere a young child experiences when confronted with the Christmas gifts piled at the base of the tree; put another way, childhood avarice cannot be discounted. Terence Rowell, Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada • The Christmas tree – when we eventually got one! Our house in Wales was very small, too small for a tree apparently, but all the Christmas cards we received showed beautifully decorated trees and it seemed to me a tree was an essential “decoration” for the special season. The trees we eventually had were live but small enough to be put on a table. Each year the tree was not decorated until a day or two before Christmas. This increased the magic – and excitement – for me. The fairy we put on the top of the tree, which was finally pensioned off when she became too dusty and creased, was my second-favourite decoration. Avril Taylor, Dundas, Ontario, Canada • The coloured strips that you made into circles and then chains; when the grandparents came around you proudly stated “I did that”. Rhys Winterburn, Perth, Western Australia • A very small model Christmas tree – because it sat in the centre of the icing on what appeared to be a huge Christmas cake. Philip Stigger, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada • A present, because it was something I wanted. Edward P Wolfers, Austinmer, NSW, Australia • Mine reminds me of the early adult years my husband and I spent in tropical Papua New Guinea – a glass ornament of a gekko on a papaya. Christine Hendriksen, Basel, Switzerland • The tiny robin sitting on a spring on a tiny log, which stayed on our Christmas log until the last slice. This was in the late 1940s. Tom Priestly, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada • Countless strands of tinsel, each one lovingly hung by my five older sisters on a huge lighted tree. Richard Orlando, Westmount, Quebec, Canada • Those many-coloured gummed slips that one used to place between the tongue and the lip, lick, stick in a ring, forming a long linked chain with which to deck the halls. Because idle hands are the devil’s workshop and idle lips his mouthpiece; and I liked the gum flavour. Anthony Walter, Surrey, British Columbia, Canada • The tree; the smell. Charlie Pearson, Portland, Oregon, US • We had little candles in holders that clipped on to the branches of the Christmas tree. Unlit candles on a Christmas tree made no sense to my young self, but fortunately I failed to set either the tree or the house on fire. Margaret Wyeth, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada • My twin brother and I connived to depose the smug little angel on the top of the tree. To us, the rest of the decorations were mere baubles. David Isaacs, Sydney, Australia • My Danish advent wreath (Jule Krans), with its hand-made ring of evergreen sprigs, red bows and four candles, one of which was lit each of the four Sundays before Christmas, giving a gradual crescendo of expectation before the big night of December 24th. Heddi Lersey, Surrey, British Columbia, Canada • Paper chains. Made with strips of coloured paper, and a paste of flour and water. Kept us kids quiet and out of mum’s hair for a couple of hours. Avril Nicholas, Crafers, South Australia • My Father Christmas doll, made by my much loved Granny over 70 years ago. He rides a wooden reindeer pulling a wooden sledge with a small log on it, made by my Great Uncle. They are displayed on a cotton wool (snow). They bring back long ago memories of the people I loved and the cold English winters I still miss so much. Jenefer Warwick James, Paddington, NSW, Australia Any answers?

The scarred grey bark of its bole has the colour and texture of pachyderm skin. Its moss-covered surface roots seem to be melting into the earth under the massive burden they support. Over decades they have grown and coalesced, creating hollows between them that retain water, fed by rivulets of rainwater trickling down the trunk. There is a name for these mini-ponds that form on the surface of plants and are habitats for small aquatic organisms: phytotelmata, which translates from the Greek root as “plant ponds”. The best studied are those contained by leaf bases of urn plants or bromeliads that live on branches in rainforest tree canopies. They are breeding sites for frogs, dragonflies and even land crabs. Beech root phytotelmata rarely host anything larger than fly larvae, but the microscopic organisms that live in them all year round are no less remarkable. I scooped out a sample of stagnant water from one and took it home for a closer look. When the water cleared I could see minute crustaceans, wriggling nematode worms, the larvae of midges and a fuzzy mist hovering over the surface of the settled sediment. I pipetted a drop of that cloud on to a microscope slide. As I focused, at a magnification of 100 times, an astonishing spectacle swam into view. The mist was a dense swarm of Colpidium colpoda, a single-celled organism propelled by rows of rhythmically beating cilia. Colpidium feeds on bacteria, so perhaps something had died in this phytotelma and created a nutritious bacterial soup. To see so many of these minute organisms moving so fast in such a confined space was akin to watching manic funfair bumper cars, endlessly colliding and reversing. Colpidium is about 20 thousandths of a millimetre long. One million of these tiny organisms laid end to end would reach from the roots of the century-old beech that hosted them to its uppermost twig. The other-worldly beauty of such life forms, whose individual existence is measured in hours, and which no one would have been aware of before the invention of microscopes, never ceases to amaze.

The sector is beset by many challenges, and usually only makes the headlines when things go wrong. Ofsted has been clear about what needs to improve in local authorities’ children’s services departments and, as we set out in our annual report on Wednesday, the overall picture is encouraging. There is no doubt that the sector is in a markedly better place than at the start of the most recent programme of inspections four years ago. The trend is one of progress and each and every improvement, however incremental, represents the efforts of many determined social work professionals. We have now inspected the quality of children’s social care in almost every local authority. More than one third were found to be good or outstanding, compared with around a quarter in March 2016. Even those local authorities that require improvement to be consistently good are demonstrating areas of excellent practice. Children’s homes also fare well, with the proportion of good and outstanding homes increasing four percentage points to 83%. And we have seen an improvement in support for care leavers, which has grown as our inspection programme has progressed. Across the providers we inspect, only secure training centres have declined. While secure children’s homes are doing well for children and young people, the standard of care for children in young offender institutions and secure training centres is an urgent cause for concern. What has changed? Local authorities are paying far greater attention to getting basic social work practice right and creating the best environment for social workers to do their jobs well. It might sound obvious, but the importance of this cannot be stressed enough. Where social work thrives, practice improves and, with it, outcomes for children. Any social worker knows that reasonable caseloads are absolutely central to this. The constant worry of an unrealistic workload is detrimental to staff and children. This year, data on caseloads was published for the first time and it is encouraging to see that local authorities are making efforts to reduce them. Other steps forward include better and more innovative use of technology to make the job easier. Some commissioners genuinely understand the business of social work and make good decisions about services, which is complemented by supportive and challenging line management. Some authorities have embraced the need for change. They have focused on standards and ensured that social workers can do their jobs well. Areas such as Leicester and Knowsley – which were previously rated inadequate – have been rated good for leadership, management and governance this year. Inspections of children’s social care reveal that help and protection are still the aspects that most often need to improve. A good “front door” – the first point of contact when someone is concerned about a child – is key to this. The local authorities doing this best are those that support their social workers; they foster a healthy culture that supports the roles of different kinds of professionals, but places the child at the centre. Local authority provision for vulnerable children could be better. Some 29 authorities are still rated inadequate, meaning that some of the most vulnerable young people are often left without vital support and intervention. Next year, Ofsted will begin a more risk-based, proportionate approach to inspecting children’s services, with more opportunities to identify concerns and help authorities take swift action to address them. Ofsted is a force for improvement in these places. When we identify and report on issues in an area, we are a catalyst for change.

Admittedly, the competition wasn’t exactly cut-throat. George Michael not only sang on the Band Aid single, but also donated the royalties from Last Christmas to the same cause. Yet the Christmas single saturation that year did lead to a chart curiosity: Band Aid’s victory meant that one of the most beloved and brilliant festive songs never reached No 1. The years, however, have only seen Last Christmas’s ubiquity grow: 3.7m copies sold and countless cover versions later (by everyone from Taylor Swift and Whigfield to Ariana Grande and Good Charlotte), it’s now the best-selling single to never reach the top of the UK charts. But this year, on the first anniversary of Michael’s death, with a fan campaign returning the song to the charts, that may be about to change. There is something inherently mercenary about a Christmas song – a successful one can sustain a musician for a lifetime, and Wham!’s decision to create their own was unsurprising. Mark Ellen, who edited Smash Hits while the band were in their prime, remembers that many in the music press then “loathed Wham! and viewed them as vacuous heat-seekers, surfing the new booming economy”. But despite appearing like a sickly sweet and cynical chart commodity, in reality Last Christmas was practically a DIY production. The song was recorded in August, 1984, at London’s once-fashionable Advision studios (by the time Wham! got there, its technology was rudimentary and dated). Earlier that year, Michael had wrested control of Wham! – and his burgeoning solo career – from a dodgy record contract. He had also started building himself up as a serious creative force from less-than-serious foundations. The 21-year-old wrote, produced, performed and painstakingly played every single instrument on the track. Having gradually rid the recording process of interfering producers, managers, record company executives and even his bandmate Andrew Ridgeley, the only people admitted into the Last Christmas studio were Michael’s engineer, Chris Porter, and two assistants – not that they had much input. Porter remembers “desperately wanting to play sleigh bells”, but like everything else, they were jangled only by Michael himself. Porter had begun working with the duo on their debut single Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do) – an odd, hip-hop-inspired track that celebrated life on the dole in a politically confusing way – and remembers the pair walking into the studio “literally in shorts”. “I thought these two just don’t stand a hope – they seemed so naive,” he says. It wasn’t long, however, before he started to notice Michael’s precocious self-possession. “He wasn’t afraid to go up against very experienced record businessmen,” says Porter. “He recognised the power of his creativity and the power that gave him in the business.” The seed for Michael’s one-man production style was sown as he and Porter travelled back from recording sessions in the south of France for Wham!’s second album Make It Big. Booked into a studio in Paris, they found themselves recording Everything She Wants with no band and no producer. “I think this was when George started to realise that if he wanted to, he could do everything himself,” says Porter. “He could cut out all these other people and their ideas.” Later, on Last Christmas, what had been accidental became deliberate. Accompanied only by a LinnDrum drum machine, a Roland Juno-60 synth and those Christmassy sleigh bells, Porter and Michael began recording a Christmas song in high summer, in a studio the assistant had adorned with paper chains and Christmas lights. But the process was more painstaking than heady. “George wasn’t a musician,” says Porter, “he had no training on instruments at all.” He nevertheless insisted on doing everything himself. “It was a laborious process, because he was literally playing the keyboards with two or three fingers,” he says. Part of the reason for Last Christmas’s success is that it sounds like nothing and everything. The backing music is extremely simple, verging on the generic. “It’s one of those rare songs with the same tune and chords for the verse and chorus, and no middle-eight section, but with a strong enough melody to sustain it,” says Ellen. The music itself was deliberately nondescript, says Porter. “One of the really clever things about George was that he realised that he wanted the focus of the listener to be his voice and not musicianship. So the music’s often very stark. On Last Christmas, there is a very simple foundation for the vocal and the melody to sit on.” Despite that simplicity, Michael was also striving to sound unique. Normally when artists are in the studio, says Porter, they use other musical references as touchstones – but despite a love of Motown and an audible debt to Chic, Michael never did that. Unfortunately, Last Christmas did resemble a number of other songs. It sounds remarkably like Kool &amp; the Gang’s 1983 track Joanna, and Barry Manilow thought it was so similar to his 1978 hit Can’t Smile Without You, that he took Wham! to court. Porter says the case was thrown out when a musicologist presented 60-odd songs from the past century that had a comparable chord sequence and melody. Lyrically, however, Last Christmas is far more distinctive: a hugely sophisticated song that teems with mixed signals and the potent illogic that defines the best pop. There’s a tension between the music and lyrics (“you’ve got the happiness of the rhythm track, but against that you’ve got the sadness of the unrequited love,” says Porter), but the real cleverness can be found in the words themselves. Not only does the nursery rhyme-style chorus take an acerbically bitchy turn (“This year to save me from tears, I’ll give it to someone special”), but also an inherently contradictory one – the narrator is trying to undermine his ex by dedicating an entire song to how crushed he is by their breakup. But Last Christmas isn’t just about the lies we tell ourselves in order to cope with rejection – it’s also about the cognitive dissonance of obsessive love. At the end of the first verse, Michael pithily sets out this kind of doublethink: now he knows “what a fool I’ve been, but if you kissed me now, I know you’d fool me again”. It’s just one heart-rending epigram in a song full of them, capturing the way defiance masks hope, and how easily love and desire can delude us into forgiveness. As a band, Wham! were Janus-faced, dealing half in ridiculously exuberant pop songs (Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go, Club Tropicana) and half in quietly devastated ballads. Nothing Looks the Same in the Light, from their debut album Fantastic, belongs firmly in the latter category, and seems to be Last Christmas’s most obvious predecessor. Yet a seam of shame – and an obsession with cold, noncommittal love – runs through many of their songs, irrespective of their BPM. Seemingly straightforward love song I’m Your Man, for example, is littered with references to wrongdoing and secrecy (“Baby, your friends do not need to know!”). In hindsight, it’s easy to read the undercurrent of transgression and rejection in Wham!’s back catalogue as a reference to Michael’s then-closeted homosexuality. However conscious this was, Last Christmas’s video certainly brings home the idea of Michael living parallel lives – the public one and the twilight one with the lovers who leave at daybreak – as the scene of a jolly Christmas holiday is overlaid with wistful memories about past romance. Wham!’s manager at the time, Simon Napier-Bell, says the song was always envisaged by Michael as part of a “Christmas package”, alongside a “snowy video and Wham! playing Wembley at Christmas Eve – all a huge Wham! Christmas party”. Despite that ambition, the shoot was only organised at the last minute. Director Andrew Morahan, who was given the brief by Michael to create a “Christmas-themed version of Club Tropicana”, was sent around Europe to scout for “premier neige”, as he puts it. Eventually, in late November, the band, plus friends and family members (including backing singers Pepsi and Shirlie, and the latter’s boyfriend, Martin Kemp) were flown out to a Swiss resort called Saas-Fee, along with a model, Kathy Hill, who plays the frosty ex-girlfriend. Hill remembers the filming as boozy and very relaxed: “I wouldn’t normally drink on a shoot, but during that scene at the dinner table it was all getting a bit silly.” Despite playing the “bitch”, Hill bonded with Michael on the shoot. “I was dating the composer Vangelis at the time and George was so interested in his music, so he kept asking me about that,” she recalls, as well as recounting how Michael made her laugh constantly. “He had an amazing sense of humour. There’s a scene when we’re walking up the hill and every time we went up he just fell down, so every time I burst into laughter. That shot where we’re rolling around and he ends up sitting on me, I’m genuinely laughing my head off. It was great.” Yet, like his domination of the recording process, there was also the sense that Michael was taking things increasingly seriously. Hill noticed that he didn’t drink as much as the rest of the group and frequently left the frivolities to check shots. This was at a time when Wham!’s demise was on the horizon, and Michael was beginning to plan his solo career. Last Christmas was written by Michael in his childhood bedroom (“the room in which we had spent hours as kids recording pastiches of radio shows and jingles”, as Andrew Ridgeley recently recounted), while his bandmate was downstairs watching television. Apart from geographical proximity, Ridgeley had little to do with the song itself – yet he was still a key part of the Wham! brand. For the band’s Christmas Eve show at Wembley, they dressed up as Father Christmases, classic Wham! shtick that fitted more with Ridgeley’s personality than Michael’s. “Without Andrew, I don’t think George would have had the confidence to do what he did,” says Porter. “Andrew didn’t have any fear – he wasn’t nervous about going on Top of the Pops, making a fool of himself, dressing up, learning dance routines.” Even during Wham!’s heyday, Michael remained uncomfortable with the trappings of pop star life, especially being on camera. The Last Christmas video saw his insecurities flare again. After the shoot, Hill remembers speaking to Wham!’s other manager, Jazz Summers, who was worried “people wouldn’t know what was going on” after Michael “made Jazz cut so many scenes out because he was so adamant that there were certain angles that he didn’t like on his face”. Straight after the shoot finished, Michael headed to the recording of Do They Know It’s Christmas?, joining 80s pop stars such as Sting, Tony Hadley, Bono, Boy George and Phil Collins. It would keep his own offering off the No 1 spot, but the charts that year could not predict Last Christmas’s bright future – one that has seen it become a treasured, complex Christmas classic in a way that the Band Aid single, for all its star power and media frenzy, never quite managed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/12/samantha-fox-glamour-model-fame-16-stalkers-david-cassidy","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T15:50:03Z","webTitle":"Samantha Fox on fame at 16, stalkers and David Cassidy: ‘I kneed him and told him where to go’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/12/samantha-fox-glamour-model-fame-16-stalkers-david-cassidy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/12/samantha-fox-glamour-model-fame-16-stalkers-david-cassidy","fields":{"headline":"Samantha Fox on fame at 16, stalkers and David Cassidy: ‘I kneed him and told him where to go’","bodyText":"In a small, unloved hotel, the receptionist greets me and Samantha Fox with pursed lips: “There will be no interview here,” she says. I feel as if I’ve wandered into the pages of Fox’s new autobiography, Forever, which is littered with bizarre anecdotes of best-laid plans going awry. From her ill-fated presenting partnership with a spaced-out Mick Fleetwood at the 1989 Brit awards, to a secret naked horseback photo shoot in Antigua – during which her steed galloped off with her to a busy tourist beach – not much has gone as expected in Fox’s life. Not least the day she worked with her childhood idol David Cassidy, who died earlier this month, which she says culminated in being sexually assaulted by him. Despite these, and many other setbacks, she says she is a “lucky girl”. Fox was just 16 when her mother entered her for the Sunday People’s Face and Shape of 1983 competition – her wholesome, girl-next-door image made her the most popular Page 3 girl ever, and one of the most photographed women of the 1980s, alongside Princess Diana and Margaret Thatcher. By 21, she had made her first pop record and retired from modelling, going on to break the US and sell 30m records worldwide. Her mother had wanted to be a model herself but didn’t have the money for the requisite clothes and portfolio. Fox went to theatre school as a child – Anna Scher and then Mountview – but there’s no telling if her profile would have risen so high if, she says (after the receptionist relents and lets us book a room), “that photographer hadn’t chosen me out of 20,000 girls”. During her shoot as a finalist in the Sunday People competition, the photographer told her that “having such ample bosoms and such tiny hips was so unusual”. Summing up her appeal, he told her: “You have the face of a child and the body of a woman. “When I think about it now, it sounds a bit creepy, to be honest, but he liked that I was very natural, no makeup,” she says. She puts her success as a Page 3 model down to her professionalism and enthusiasm as well as her looks. Towards the end of the shoot, the photographer encouraged her to do a few topless pictures, promising they weren’t for publication – just to show the editors. Her father took a little convincing, but her mother, she writes, “was about to burst with pride and had no doubts”. Fox was grateful for the opportunity. “You only had to look around where I lived,” she writes. “There were plenty of people who had kids young. Plenty who were unemployed. Plenty who had rough, low-paying jobs.” Her only other ambition had been to join the police; unfortunately, she was too short. Fox came second in the competition, but despite the photographer’s promises, her bare breasts were printed on the Sunday People front page. Her headteacher was not amused, but Fox was asked to sign autographs by boys at school (this was a contrast to the bullying she had suffered at primary school, when she wore calipers and a platform boot to treat a hip problem). She was offered a three-year contract with the Sun’s Page 3. Fox says nothing sleazy happened during her time as a glamour model. “I was signed to the Sun exclusively, and I would only work with the photographer Beverley Goodway,” she says. “If I ever did shoots at his swimming pool, his wife would make me dinner and my mum would accompany me. I knew who the sleazy photographers were and I wouldn’t work with them.” “I would never pose for the Sunday Sport because I found that newspaper rude. There’s a line that you don’t cross in glamour modelling and I never went across the sleazy line,” she says. To her mind, Page 3 was so tasteful that you even had to make sure you didn’t hold any props suggestively. “If it was snooker week for example, you had to think about how you held the cue,” she says. Was she sad when Page 3 came to an end (the Sun dropped the daily picture in 2015)? “Not really,” she says, pointing out that she retired 30 years ago. While 16 sounds young for glamour modelling, she says: “I was pretty astute after going to drama school and acting with adults, and I had already been in a band. I grew up early and came from a working-class market-trader family, who are very streetwise.” Sexual harassment had become part of everyday life before she started modelling. Boys used to follow her to the bus from school, and teachers would make smutty remarks. She says the incident with Cassidy happened in 1985, when she was hired to star in a video for his comeback record, Romance. In her book, she writes that Cassidy pressed his erection against her throughout filming, and at a restaurant later he barged in on her while she was washing her hands in the loos. He pushed her up against the wall, groping her all over, and when she told him to get off, he shoved his tongue in her mouth. “Straight away, I just kneed him in the bollocks, and told him where to go,” she says, before she returned to her father at the dinner table, acting as though nothing had happened. A similar incident happened in a restaurant in Mauritius with a man she didn’t know. “I did the same to him. I did martial arts from a young age, so my reactions are really quick,” she says. Those are the only sexual assaults she says she has experienced, although she did have to hire bodyguards from the age of 18. “I’ve had a few stalkers,” she says. One tried to kill himself outside her house. She says: “I realised how fanatical people could be. He was French, and in his letters, he said that I was his wife and he was going to kill himself if I didn’t come out and talk to him.” There was another man, she recalls, “who changed his name to Sam Fox, sold everything he had back home in America and stayed at a bed-and-breakfast around the corner from me, so he could watch me”. She has seen her posters stuck on the ceilings above the bunks of a warship. She went to Lemmy’s house in 1985 to collaborate on a song and his walls were plastered with images of her. Did it make her feel uncomfortable that men all over the world were fantasising about her? “I used to think: ‘Wow, my god, my posters are everywhere,’” she says. “I think it’s fantastic.” Her parents vetted her fan mail when she was younger, to spare her the details. In the book, she describes record signings that attracted uncontrollable crowds of men. “None of them wanted to grab me in the obvious places,” she says. “It was hysteria, just to get near me. Most of them would touch my hair. You’d see them all breaking windows, and risking their own lives, and I had to escape in helicopters off roofs. Sometimes I used to chuckle to myself and think: ‘I can’t believe what’s happening to me.’” These days the fans are not all blokes. After a recent show in Russia, she recalls that a crowd were waiting in her hotel lobby. “This young girl, she must have been 23, said: ‘Samantha I love you, you’re so beautiful, I love your movies.’” She’d seen the 1995 Bollywood film Fox starred in, called Rock Dancer. “They’re all ages when you do retro shows,” she says, referring to the 80s-revival tours with Kim Wilde, Rick Astley, Bonnie Tyler and others, that are her stock in trade these days. “A lot of young people are into 80s music now,” she says. “It was an exciting time. The songs always had a story and the choruses were anthemic.” In Britain, Fox struggled to be seen as a musician rather than a model. “At the beginning,” she says, “many people didn’t believe it was me on the record.” Her record label suggested she pose on a bed in the video for her first single, Touch Me (I Want Your Body). “Going forward,” she writes, “every single record label representative would suggest that exact scenario.” She had envisioned more of a Debbie Harry-style video, with her singing on stage, and that is what she did. She learned to write songs while touring her first album (she is working on her seventh), and co-wrote the song Dreams, which appeared on All Saint’s William Orbit-produced album Saints &amp; Sinners, released in 2000. Although they had agreed to split the writing credit, the band didn’t want Fox’s name on the record. Fox reluctantly agreed to use her mother’s maiden name. “I earned about £60,000 from the song,” she writes, “so maybe it was worth it after all.” The saddest story involves her father’s betrayal. He was her manager from early on – a controlling character who increasingly spent more time drinking and taking cocaine than doing his job. “If Dad wanted me to sign something, I signed it. And if I wanted to buy anything, I had to ask him for money,” she writes. During her childhood, her mother kept a suitcase packed in case the arguments escalated and he became violent. Eventually, in 1991, he beat up his daughter, leaving her bleeding with a black eye. This gave her the resolve to sack him and take control of her business, only to discover he had been embezzling her money and hadn’t paid a scrap of tax on her behalf for three years. She sued him for £1m, but it all went on the tax bill and she had to start from scratch. Years later, her father got back in touch, but he didn’t apologise. It turned out he had been offered a book deal for their story and wanted to be able to write that they had “found our way back to one another and put all that shit behind us”. They never spoke again, and he died in 2000. He was one of a number of men who sold stories about her over the years. Fox had been attracted to women since childhood, but for many years felt confused about her sexuality. “I don’t think it’s until you meet the right person that you really know for sure,” she says. She certainly felt more at ease with women. “When I was with a woman,” she writes, “I didn’t have to step into the role of Samantha Fox, either in bed or in my everyday life. Being myself was enough.” She was first introduced to her long-term partner, Myra Stratton, as a potential new manager in 1999, and they lived happily together until Stratton died of cancer in 2015. Having kept her previous relationships with women quiet, she says: “I was scared to come out. But then I thought: ‘I’m not a pinup any more ... I can’t live a lie.’” The couple went on to appear on Celebrity Wife Swap together. She was pleasantly surprised by the public’s reaction. “It was no big deal,” she says (although there was a stalker who threatened to kill Myra and break into their home). Coming out has politicised her a little, and she has joined forces with Ian McKellen, among others, to promote the Albert Kennedy Trust, which supports gay people who become homeless after being thrown out by their families. During her Page 3 days, she writes: “It was probably the feminists who least appreciated what I was doing.” She recalls a female politician blaming Page 3 for a rise in rapes – an argument she thought “insane”, especially when “Glenda Jackson could be topless in a film and it would be seen as art”. Has her outlook become more feminist as she has got older? She nods cautiously. “I’ve always been a strong woman. And Myra was my manager – a woman in the male-dominated music business. She never took no shit from any man, and that made me stronger. I’ve never let anybody take advantage of me and I was never pushed into anything, or made to do anything I didn’t want to do.” She wouldn’t advise women to go into the glamour industry now. “It used to be a proper job,” she says, “but it’s over now because of the internet.” She used to say that if she looked good at 50, she’d do Playboy again, “but there is no more Playboy, because young boys or anybody can go on their phone and look at anything they want to look at”. If she had a son, she says: “I’d rather him buy a tasteful glamour magazine than going on the internet.” • Forever by Samantha Fox, with Martin Svensson and Leif Eriksson (Backbeat Books) is out now (£20).

Hats and gloves, coal, logs and screenwash were flying off the shelves as the temperature plunged in the Shropshire village to -13C, the lowest in the UK this year. “We’re doing pretty well,” said Gwen Brown, who was serving behind a counter. “People have been stocking up on woollies and fuel. It’s also been lovely walking around and looking at the snow in the trees. The stars have been brilliant too. It’s not so good if you have to drive anywhere but it’s been great for the children. They have been loving it.” Brown had an extra helper in the service station because the village school was closed: five-year-old Eva, who was enjoying her first taste – literally – of snow. “It’s cold and crunchy,” she said. “I ate some – it tasted like ice.” The village bakery was a cosy place to while away a few minutes. Its owner, Mark Lee, said the locals were comfort-eating pasties, pies and hot vegetable soup. “We also sell a lot more bread. I suppose it’s partly because people can’t get to the supermarket. It’s good for the local shops, at least.” A few doors up at the Elephant and Castle, the bar has also been heaving over the past few days. “The roads are a nightmare so people are staying off work and enjoying themselves,” said a bar worker, Victoria Keeling. Sixteen-year-old Ben Houlihan had been roped in to work a shift at the pub as a waiter because his college was shut. Actually, he would have preferred to be in the classroom. “I’d rather not miss a couple of days of education,” he said. For the older locals of Shawbury (population 2,872), this was a good time to remember harsh winters past. The cold snap in the winter of 1947 was harsh and long – and clothes and food were still rationed, making it all the more miserable. Villages in Shropshire were cut off for many days and farmers lost stock. Others shiver at the memory of the winter of 1981-82, when a few miles down the road in Newport, Shropshire, the temperature dropped to -26.1C – the record for England. To mark this cold snap, the Shropshire Star produced a four-page snow special and carried a black-and-white photograph of local people venturing out on to the frozen mere (lake) at Ellesmere. Oli Claydon of the Met Office said the “albedo effect” was one of the reasons Shawbury was so chilly – the thick snow bounces the sunlight back into the atmosphere, preventing the temperature from rising at ground level. The clear skies that have produced sunny days and bright nights mean clouds have not kept any heat in. And because Shawbury is landlocked, the sea does not warm the village up. Bad news for Joe Grant, 70, who was struggling to stay upright on the icy pavement. “It’s OK for the kids; it’s pretty terrible for us oldies,” he said. Sandra Morgan was also not amused. Her gas fire had stopped working and her water supply had frozen. “No heat, no water, no fun,” she said. “I can’t wait for it to warm up again.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/dec/22/six-minutes-in-may-how-churchill-unexpectedly-became-pm-nicholas-shakespeare-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T09:01:49Z","webTitle":"Six Minutes in May: How Churchill Unexpectedly Became Prime Minister by Nicholas Shakespeare – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/22/six-minutes-in-may-how-churchill-unexpectedly-became-pm-nicholas-shakespeare-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/dec/22/six-minutes-in-may-how-churchill-unexpectedly-became-pm-nicholas-shakespeare-review","fields":{"headline":"Six Minutes in May: How Churchill Unexpectedly Became Prime Minister by Nicholas Shakespeare – review","bodyText":"The six minutes in May that give Nicholas Shakespeare his title are those in 1940 during which the House of Commons voted on the debate following Britain’s disastrous failure in the brief Norway campaign. The prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, was not defeated in the division, but his usual majority was slashed as discontented Conservative MPs abstained or voted against him. The idea of these minutes as critical is nonetheless misleading. As Shakespeare makes clear in this lively and well-informed rerun of how Winston Churchill became prime minister, there were many other hurdles to overcome before the change was complete, and other moments when a few minutes counted for more than the outcome of the debate. The story Shakespeare tells is at once a familiar one. Churchill seemed an unlikely candidate to succeed. His reputation as a maverick politician, an unstable ally and an imperialist reactionary made him many enemies in parliament and left him in the political wilderness in the 1930s. In 1940, Churchill once again championed a strategic disaster. The Norway campaign was an ignominious failure, like the Dardanelles campaign in 1915. He might well have expected it to end his brief career in Chamberlain’s war cabinet. In the end, the country and the Commons blamed Chamberlain and an uncoordinated movement began aimed at unseating the prime minister and installing a replacement. Churchill in the end was the choice, but almost by default. There were so few men with the experience and talent to replace Chamberlain. Once Lord Halifax, the foreign secretary, had ruled himself out of the running because he feared the consequences of having to lead the war effort from the House of Lords (no one even in the first world war had had to do that), Churchill was Chamberlain’s reluctant choice. Even then the king, George VI, had a strong antipathy to Churchill and in the half hour between accepting Chamberlin’s resignation and seeing Churchill he could have changed his mind and called for Halifax. He did not, and that night, 10 May 1940, Churchill, as he later recalled, “walked with destiny”. That the outcome might have been different is certainly possible. Shakespeare is good at reconstructing, blow by blow, the intricate negotiations and intrigues that ruled out the others and favoured Churchill. A good deal had to happen before Chamberlain’s awkward six minutes made a Churchill premiership likely. Not least the role of the Labour party leadership in sabotaging Chamberlain’s second thoughts as the Germans broke through into Holland and Belgium that perhaps he should stay after all. Even Labour was divided, and certainly no fan of Churchill, but in the end the party executive, meeting in Bournemouth for the annual conference, voted against supporting Chamberlain, sealing his fate. Labour also confirmed that they would serve in a national government under another leader, but did not name Churchill. What has Shakespeare brought to the established narrative? The answer lies in the microscopic detail that he has unearthed from diaries, unpublished memoirs and private papers, all of which help to make clearer the broader processes at work and to correct established errors. He gives decent walk-on parts to characters usually absent from the history of the succession – “Baba” Metcalfe, whose relationship with Halifax, platonic or not, gave him an outlet to release his anxieties about the situation he faced; Clement Davies, the Liberal MP who organised the All Party Action Group in 1939 to try to get a new wartime leadership; and the Conservative MP Paul Emrys-Evans, who ran the “Watching Committee”, an informal cabal. Shakespeare’s profile of Halifax helps confirm that he would have been a woeful choice as war leader, though in fairness that was Halifax’s own private view. That he was the man widely tipped to succeed seems more difficult now for historians to explain than the eventual success of his rival. Shakespeare cites Clement Attlee’s judgment: “Queer bird, Halifax, very humorous, all hunting and Holy Communion.” Chamberlain’s position had seemed solid even by March 1940, but Shakespeare’s rebels were tunnelling under the walls. Churchill did not necessarily expect the succession, though he no doubt longed for it. He had too many enemies, and too much accumulated distrust. But his eventual achievement of the premiership was not quite the surprise that Shakespeare implies. He had a strong following in the country, was admired by many for his stirring bellicosity in contrast to Chamberlain’s more restrained leadership, and as a potential war leader, he towered above those in high office around him. Faced with Churchill alongside him, Halifax balked at taking the premiership. Churchill became premier faute de mieux, but had there been a more obvious candidate, Churchill would have had to wait, perhaps forever. Though he felt he was walking with destiny, his wartime leadership was not preordained. Shakespeare tells the whole story well, with sound historical sense and engaging style, but it will be a patient reader who ploughs through the detail to make out the larger narrative. At more than 500 pages, it is hard to think of any other six minutes served by so lengthy a history. • Six Minutes in May: How Churchill Unexpectedly Became Prime Minister is published by Harvill Secker.

Telling of everyday life, from ice fishing to the amputation of gangrenous fingers, the chronicle is the only autobiographic account of life on the islands, located 670km north of Antarctica. It was written by José Manuel Moneta, a technical officer in Argentina’s National Meteorological Service who spent four winters on the archipelago in the 1920s, and was published in Spanish between 1939 and 1963. “Although not the ﬁrst, I was one of the earliest Argentines to spend long, drawn-out years surrounded by Antarctic ice thousands of years old. We lived in a small, basic wooden hut, with a simple diet supplemented by local seals and penguins. We had no company other than four or ﬁve companions thrown together by chance, with no news of anything, or of anyone, during our interminable year of voluntary exile,” writes Moneta, in a translation by Kathleen Skilton and Kenn Back, published this week in English for the first time by Bernard Quaritch under the title Four Antarctic Years in the South Orkney Islands. Moneta writes of the penguins and the seals that the team would hunt, of collecting ice to melt for fresh water, of travelling through the highlands over glaciers and waiting for the annual arrival of a relief ship. Daily life was challenging; Moneta’s living quarters were “a two and a half metre-long space in which bunks, table, chairs and wash stand all have to ﬁt. Not so much a living room or bedroom, more like an actual prison cell”. He gives an account of the amputation of one man’s fingers after gangrene sets in: “He was not given any anaesthetic, there was none to give, not even any local one to dull the pain.” And he tells of the “infinite solitude” of the islands, which means that “the most trivial incident, of no signiﬁcance whatever in any other part of the inhabited world, was reckoned here, in the circumscribed conﬁnes of our regimented life, to be an extraordinary event”. “On one day it occurred to me to open one of my trunks in which I kept books, clothes and other personal eﬀects. Much to my astonishment I saw a moth ﬂy out from between the folds of a woollen jersey. My voice sounded like the alarm, the same tone that I would have used in a genuine emergency ‘A moth, a moth!’ ‘Where? Where is it?’ they all shouted. All my companions wanted to see that minute lepidopteron whose larvae, concealed in some garment, had come from the mainland, and continued to survive sustained by the warmth from the stoves.” The book’s editor, RK Headland, said that Moneta’s diary was “an exceptional record of the period of Antarctic history”. “Such detailed records from remote polar regions are sparse and valuable as current [climatic] changes become increasingly significant. The style of life, almost a century ago, with the adoption of the very new technology of radio communication, is comprehensively described by a young man while he gained almost five years of Antarctic experience,” said Headland, a senior associate of the Scott Polar Research Institute at the University of Cambridge, and recipient of the Polar Medal in 1984. “British and Argentine relations in the Antarctic have not always been good, but from 1959 – when the Antarctic Treaty was made with the South Orkney Islands in the region it covers – scientific and, to some extent, logistical cooperation has been effective. This applies generally to all countries involved in the Antarctic – and historical understanding is a general benefit in understanding these still very remote locations,” he added. Moneta’s daughters, Dora Moneta de Landívar and Martha Moneta de López Naguil, said they were “deeply touched” to see the English translation of their father’s work. “The Antarctic was his lifelong passion and he kept his special interest in the South Orkney Islands continuously, visiting them to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his ﬁrst expedition just a month prior to his death,” they said. “We hope the English version will contribute to the knowledge and understanding of the heroic age of Antarctic exploration of which our father was a part.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"science/datablog/2017/dec/21/royal-statistical-society-christmas-quiz-have-you-got-what-it-takes","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T16:03:38Z","webTitle":"Royal Statistical Society christmas quiz: have you got what it takes?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/datablog/2017/dec/21/royal-statistical-society-christmas-quiz-have-you-got-what-it-takes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/datablog/2017/dec/21/royal-statistical-society-christmas-quiz-have-you-got-what-it-takes","fields":{"headline":"Royal Statistical Society christmas quiz: have you got what it takes?","bodyText":"The Royal Statistical Society has published a wickedly difficult Christmas quiz to entertain puzzle fans over the festive break for the past 24 years, and this year’s challenge, set by Dr Tim Paulden, may well be one of the toughest yet.

PRESENT PERFECT [7 points] Following a catastrophic admin error at the grotto, Rudolph learns that he must make 25 last-minute present drops in the early hours of Christmas morning. (See diagram below.) Rudolph stands initially on the square D4. On each move, he is allowed to either jump like a chess knight, or jump any number of squares ‘up’ the board (northwards). In other words, from his starting square D4, Rudolph could move next to any of the following eleven squares: B3, B5, C2, C6, E2, E6, F3, F5, D5, D6, or D7. (As a second example, if Rudolph were stood on A6, he could move next to B4, C5, C7, or A7.) Naturally, Rudolph must land directly on a square to visit it – for instance, if he were to jump from D4 to D6 with his first move, he could tick off the present on D6 as ‘delivered’, but not the present on D5. What is the smallest number of moves required for Rudolph to deliver all 25 presents and then return home to the North Pole (square D7) – and what route should he take? Please be sure to include in your answer not only the number of moves in your shortest route, but also the sequence of squares that Rudolph visits along the way.

I’d seen him play a few years earlier at the House of Blues and knew I had to make a film about this guy. His good friend Haydee Ellis took me over to his house and I explained what I wanted to do. He wasn’t committing one way or the other, but the seed was planted. Fats is one of the great American icons. Rock’n’roll just kind of formed around him. Even Elvis called him the King. Up till 1955, he sold records to the black audience, but his hit Ain’t That a Shame crossed over and brought him to the attention of a white audience. This guy was a major star. The only person who sold more records in the 50s was Elvis. But Fats was happy living a quiet life at home in the neighbourhood he was born in. He lived in a double shotgun, which is a house with all the rooms in a row, so if you wanted to go from the living room to the kitchen, you had to walk through Fats’s bedroom. There was a big room at the back where he had all his memorabilia, his silver-dollar bar and his couch in the shape of a pink Cadillac. There was a beautiful, modern house next door where his wife lived, but Fats, the great star, was happy living in that little double shotgun. When he finally agreed to do the documentary, he wasn’t good at remembering incidents in his career. But I could say, “Fats, play Swanee River Boogie,” and without missing a beat he’d play it beginning to end. He used to change the words, so Blueberry Hill would become “I found my thrill / Just drinking this beer” – and he’d take a swig of beer. It was just charming. Every time he finished a song he’d stick his hand out like, “Pay me now”. He loved bright colours. I’ve photos of Fats in hot-pink jackets and purple pants. Even as an elderly man, he had diamond rings on his fingers and bright Hawaiian shirts on, very dapper-looking. He was the epitome of New Orleans. Everything he did – his patois, his creole accent, the beats he used – reflected the city. He was on the road for probably 50% of his adult life, but he always came back home. In the early days, he hated being away so much he would carry food with him on tour. He had little hot plates so he could make his beans and rice in the hotel room. His band members would sometimes steal his supplies for a joke and that would really mess him up. Before the hurricane, his house was buzzing with activity, his friends would be around playing cards and hanging out, and big cases of food would arrive – I remember a box full of cans of New England clam chowder. All of that ended when Katrina hit. His house was rebuilt after the storm but he never moved back to the Lower Ninth Ward, because nobody else moved back. He moved in with his daughter, Adonica, who cared for him for the rest of his life. When my film The Big Beat: Fats Domino and the Birth of Rock’n’Roll premiered last year at the New Orleans film festival, I wasn’t sure he’d come. But he did, and when the film started his eyes never left the screen. At the end, he said nothing but he grabbed my hands and squeezed them. That moment was it for me. I didn’t care if no one else saw the film and it flopped, so long as he liked it. That was the last time I saw him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2017/dec/16/stephen-collins-on-david-davis-cartoon","type":"interactive","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-16T06:00:54Z","webTitle":"Stephen Collins on David Davis – cartoon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2017/dec/16/stephen-collins-on-david-davis-cartoon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2017/dec/16/stephen-collins-on-david-davis-cartoon","fields":{"headline":"Stephen Collins on David Davis – cartoon","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/12/steven-mcguirk-grenfell-expert-alleged-support-cuts-fire-union","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T13:09:04Z","webTitle":"Fire union calls for 'compromised' Grenfell expert to stand down","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/12/steven-mcguirk-grenfell-expert-alleged-support-cuts-fire-union","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/12/steven-mcguirk-grenfell-expert-alleged-support-cuts-fire-union","fields":{"headline":"Fire union calls for 'compromised' Grenfell expert to stand down","bodyText":"The Fire Brigades Union has called for one of the key experts appointed by the Grenfell Tower inquiry to stand down because of his alleged support in the past for cuts to emergency services and deregulation. Martin Seaward, a barrister representing the FBU, told the inquiry that Steven McGuirk, a former chief fire officer in Greater Manchester, would be “conflicted” and “compromised” in giving evidence. The FBU, he said, believed the emergency response to the Grenfell blaze was affected by previous cuts to the fire service in London. McGuirk, Seaward said, had always been at the “opposite end of the table” from the FBU whenever there had been negotiations over staffing levels for the fire service. “The FBU wants this inquiry to consider the effect of deregulation, closures and cuts to the response on 14 June [at Grenfell Tower],” he said. “That’s part of the big question of how this happened in London. We say that Mr McGuirk is conflicted in advising on this team. He has also been the principal adviser to local authorities on fire safety guidance.” McGuirk would be unable to help on several issues, Seaward said. “For example, he was in charge of Greater Manchester when recommendations were made from the Lakanal fire [in London] and one question would be whether those recommendations were carried out.” He said McGuirk would be compromised in his duty to be impartial and independent. He should replaced by a senior officer from Scotland, Seaward suggested. McGuirk is one of seven expert witnesses appointed by the inquiry. Firefighters were also victims of the Grenfell Tower fire, Seaward told the inquiry. “Those who attended and those who took the harrowing calls are victims who were exposed to trauma. “They were exposed to trauma again and again when they went back in. Nearly all the firefighters were traumatised and some were injured by the traumas. Late-onset PTSD, as in the military, is becoming a recognised condition.” Earlier James Maxwell Scott QC, representing the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC), revealed that it had handed over copies of more than 1.5m documents to the criminal investigation being conducted by the police. Almost 13,000 have been disclosed to the inquiry. Alice Jarratt, counsel for Kensington and Chelsea tenant management organisation (TMO), which ran Grenfell Tower, said it had offered to hand over its entire records to the inquiry. Due to the overwhelming volume of material, however, the inquiry preferred to obtain responses to questions “as and when they arise”. Some housing files handed over by the TMO on a memory stick have turned out to be “corrupted” but readable versions are expected to be disclosed to the inquiry before Christmas. A petition calling for an overhaul of the inquiry was handed in to Downing Street by bereaved families and a survivor on Tuesday. Signed by 16,000 people, it calls on Theresa May to appoint a panel of people reflecting the diversity of the local community to sit alongside the chair of the inquiry, Sir Martin Moore-Bick. The prime minister has powers under the Inquiries Act 2005 to opt for a panel-led inquiry, rather than relying on one chair. At the end of Tuesday’s hearing in Holborn Bars, central London, the counsel to the inquiry Richard Millett QC said the inquiry intended to involve those affected by the tragedy as much as possible while also pursuing a “ruthlessly independent and effective investigation”. He added: “However, the question of the composition of the panel does give rise to rather different considerations. We would suggest … that it is properly a matter for the prime minister, as the sponsoring minister, to decide under the act whether she wishes to appoint other members to sit as decision-makers with [Moore-Bick] on the panel.” There were calls throughout the two-day hearing for the venue to be switched to a site closer to north Kensington for future sessions so that more local residents could attend. May is due to attend a memorial service being held at St Paul’s Cathedral on Thursday to commemorate six months since the fire on 14 June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/12/minister-outlines-how-eu-nationals-will-apply-for-uk-settled-status-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T13:22:40Z","webTitle":"Minister outlines how EU nationals will apply for UK 'settled status'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/12/minister-outlines-how-eu-nationals-will-apply-for-uk-settled-status-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/12/minister-outlines-how-eu-nationals-will-apply-for-uk-settled-status-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Minister outlines how EU nationals will apply for UK 'settled status'","bodyText":"The registration of 3 million EU nationals for “settled status” in Britain will involve an online application form with six to eight questions, a cost of no more than £72, and a decision delivered within two weeks, the immigration minister, Brandon Lewis, has said. Lewis told peers on Tuesday that the simplified online application process to register the 3 million EU nationals living in Britain would go live from the second half of next year. Those who qualify for settled status, giving them the indefinite right to live in Britain, will have to demonstrate five years’ continuous residence and pass a criminal record test. The immigration minister also defended the increasing pace of deportation of EU nationals from Britain since the referendum, saying “it is good news for the British public because we should be doing everything to remove foreign national offenders”. He said a court case this week would clarify the legality of deportation of rough sleepers who are EU nationals. The full details of the settled status application process will be published after Christmas but the immigration minister made clear to the Lords justice committee that proof of continuous residence was likely to be provided by checks with HMRC/DWP databases for those applicants who have worked in Britain. The details of the Brexit deal announced last Friday include agreement with the EU that the cost of a settled status application will be no more than the current cost of a British passport: £72. It also spelled out that the hundreds of thousands of EU nationals who had already successfully applied for UK permanent residence documents would not be charged a further fee when they converted to “settled status”. Those whose applications are rejected will have a right of appeal, with the final decision to be taken by the British courts. The UK courts will follow EU case law in the run-up to Brexit and will take account of the views of the European court of justice on citizens’ rights for up to eight years afterwards. Lewis confirmed to peers that the Home Office’s default position would be to grant settled status applications. “The only circumstances in which they will be refused is either the criminal record check shows they are a criminal and if somebody who tries to claim they are an EU citizen and they are not, ie a fraudulent application,” he said. He confirmed that the current requirements to secure permanent residency status in Britain, including a requirement for comprehensive sickness insurance, would not apply in the new process. Lewis said the application form should consist of six to eight questions rather than the current 85 pages and a decision should normally be provided within two weeks of it being submitted online. He compared it to the current online application process to renew a British passport. The agreement reached on Friday also spelled out that a “proportionate approach” must be taken by those who failed to apply within the two-year deadline and that applications made by families together would be considered at the same time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/17/carla-bruni-remembers-johnny-hallyday-observer-obituaries-2017","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T08:00:25Z","webTitle":"Johnny Hallyday remembered by Carla Bruni","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/17/carla-bruni-remembers-johnny-hallyday-observer-obituaries-2017","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/17/carla-bruni-remembers-johnny-hallyday-observer-obituaries-2017","fields":{"headline":"Johnny Hallyday remembered by Carla Bruni","bodyText":"I met Johnny Hallyday for the first time as a teenager – I was at school with his son David and sometimes I would see him at David’s parties. I met him a few times over the years but didn’t get to know him properly until I got married. He was a good friend of my husband [former French president Nicolas Sarkozy], who knew him for years – he went to his first Johnny Hallyday concert when he was 13, at the Olympia in Paris, with Jimi Hendrix as the opening act. When we got married, I got to see Johnny quite a lot. He was a very simple, kind man with a lot of charisma – he was big, strong, tall and very handsome. On stage he was really amazing. He was one of these artists who burns, like Elvis or Edith Piaf. He would sing like he was going to die the very next minute. He was a good actor too – the only problem was that his presence was so strong, it was hard to forget it was him. Offstage, he was a very shy person. When he was not partying, he was almost childlike. Johnny was abandoned as a child, and you could really feel that when you met him. His father left the minute he was born and his mother was very fragile, so he was brought up by his aunt. He performed from a very early age, which meant he had no real adolescence. He had no time to be normal, but that was good for him, because I don’t think he would have been happy being normal. He had something broken in his soul, something damaged, and being on stage, being a superstar artist, made him very happy. A good friend once told me that when Johnny wasn’t touring, he just used to turn round and round, like a tiger in a cage. He didn’t like normal life. He had a lot of fun. He liked women, he liked food, boats, motorbikes, music. He had a great life, but I believe that the reason French people loved him so much was that he was a lost child – and a strong man at the same time. He sold more than 100m albums. When he died, people in the street were saying: “He was with me at the worst time of my life. When I was depressed, when I lost my job, when I got divorced, I listened to Johnny.” He was that kind of artist. Even though he was famous and rich and handsome, I think people could feel the gap he had inside. It also helped that he came from a very simple background. He was popular like the Tour de France is popular, like football is popular, and people loved him almost like he was part of their family. The last time I saw him was last week lying in his coffin. That was a very sad and strange thing because he looked like he was going to wake up and walk. Before that, I saw him on stage during his final tour, about a year ago. He didn’t fight the cancer for very long. He hated death, hated the thought of dying, and he died the way he lived: quickly and strongly. One day, six or seven years ago, when my husband was still in office, Johnny invited me to sing with him for a TV show. I was so thrilled to be asked. We sang this very beautiful song called Quelque chose de Tennessee, about Tennessee Williams. There is a talking part at the beginning, which I did. And then he started singing, and really it was like a storm coming into the studio. He was not so young then, and not so well, but his strength was completely intact. His voice actually got better as he got older, it was lower and had more blues in it – it was like a burning forest fire. It was a magical experience."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/12/fears-damian-green-may-escape-sanction-for-alleged-inappropriate-behaviour","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T21:43:32Z","webTitle":"Damian Green may be cleared 'because he wasn't minister at time'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/12/fears-damian-green-may-escape-sanction-for-alleged-inappropriate-behaviour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/12/fears-damian-green-may-escape-sanction-for-alleged-inappropriate-behaviour","fields":{"headline":"Damian Green may be cleared 'because he wasn't minister at time'","bodyText":"Friends of Tory campaigner Kate Maltby fear Damian Green may escape official sanction for alleged inappropriate behaviour towards her because it took place before he was a cabinet minister. The Guardian understands Maltby’s supporters are concerned at the possibility Theresa May’s deputy may be allowed to stay in post because he will be deemed by a Cabinet Office investigation not to have breached the ministerial code, given the events in question took place after July 2014, when he was not a minister. Maltby, who is 30 years younger than Green, has told the inquiry she believes Green appeared to solicit sex from her in exchange for political mentoring. She declined to comment on Tuesday, with the investigation into Green set to be released in the coming days. In an article for the Times, which prompted the inquiry, Maltby said she met Green in a Waterloo pub, where she said the MP offered to help her take steps towards becoming a Conservative candidate. She alleged that Green had touched her knee during the meeting, as he mentioned that his own wife was “very understanding”. Maltby described a conversation that she said touched on affairs of acquaintances, then she said she “felt a fleeting hand against my knee – so brief it was almost deniable”. The activist said she avoided Green after their encounter but, in 2016, subsequently wrote a piece for the Times where she was pictured wearing a corset. Green then texted her unprompted, she said, saying: “Long time no see. But having admired you in a corset in my favourite tabloid, I feel impelled to ask if you are free for a drink anytime?” After the message from Green, Maltby said she did not reply but that day she privately messaged a number of friends expressing concern, including an Evening Standard journalist who published the messages earlier this month. Green denies the allegations. After the article was published, he said the meeting was “two friends agreeing to meet for a regular catchup – and nothing more ... This untrue allegation has come as a complete shock and is deeply hurtful, especially from someone I considered a personal friend”. Maltby declined to comment before the investigation was concluded. The inquiry into Green, who remained in post, has been since expanded to take in claims that pornography was found on his House of Commons computer when it was raided in 2008 as part of an inquiry into Home Office leaks. Green has denied accessing or viewing pornography on his computer. On Monday, the Guardian reported that the inquiry by the Cabinet Office’s Sue Gray, the director general of the propriety and ethics team, is understood to have been asked to examine whether Green or his allies later influenced a Daily Mail article about Maltby that followed her piece accusing Green. After Maltby’s allegations were published, she was profiled by the Daily Mail’s Andrew Pierce in a piece that called her “one very pushy lady” and said she was “determined to make it in politics – whatever the cost”. The article, which drew significant criticism after it was published, suggested Maltby’s parents were “aghast at what she had done” by accusing Green, which she denies. It said she had a “flair for self-promotion” and was “keen to make her mark in politics”. Maltby did not reply to Green’s text message but after he became work and pensions secretary in 2016, the pair exchanged friendly texts where Maltby congratulated him. Several MPs expressed concern about the wider implications if the ministerial code ends up being the clinching point. Labour MP Stella Creasy said: “For the men and women brave enough to come forward, what message would it send if the powerful close ranks rather than recognise change needs to happen?” MP Jess Phillips, chair of the women’s parliamentary Labour party, said if Green was found not to have breached the ministerial code it would be a “weak argument about why we have a different standards to other people.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/12/jim-mallinder-sacked-director-of-rugby-union-northampton-saints","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T11:31:47Z","webTitle":"Jim Mallinder sacked as director of rugby at Northampton Saints","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/12/jim-mallinder-sacked-director-of-rugby-union-northampton-saints","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/12/jim-mallinder-sacked-director-of-rugby-union-northampton-saints","fields":{"headline":"Jim Mallinder sacked as director of rugby at Northampton Saints","bodyText":"The abrupt downturn in English club fortunes in Europe this season has prompted an immediate reaction at Northampton, who have sacked their director of rugby, Jim Mallinder, with immediate effect. Mallinder enjoyed a good deal of success during his decade at Franklin’s Gardens but his team have now lost their past eight games in major competitions. While it is only three and a half years since Northampton were crowned champions of England, the Saints have suffered some dire recent results and Saturday’s painful home defeat by Ospreys proved the final straw. Northampton were 43-8 down at the start of the final quarter, prompting many supporters to leave the stadium early. Saints have also lost their last five Premiership games and have slipped to 10th in the table, with only Worcester and London Irish beneath them. Under Mallinder, however, the club reached the 2011 European Cup final against Leinster and also lifted the European Challenge Cup and the Anglo-Welsh Cup. Alan Dickens, their attack coach, will take over as interim head coach but with a permanent replacement for Mallinder unlikely to arrive before next summer, the club are also seeking a fresh coaching voice for the remainder of this campaign. “We will look to bolster our existing coaching group with some additional leadership and experience on a short-term basis for this season,” said the Saints chairman, John White. Finding a world-class successor for Mallinder will not be a straightforward process, as Saints’ east Midlands rivals Leicester discovered last season having parted company with the long-serving Richard Cockerill. White, however, acknowledged recent results had forced the club’s hand. “This is not a decision that has been taken lightly but the board and major shareholders felt that the time was right for some change,” he said. He also said that Mallinder’s departure was “in the best interest of the club”. With popular former players such as Pat Lam and Gregor Townsend having only just taken over at Bristol and Scotland respectively, it will be interesting to see in which new direction the club opt to go. One possible name in the frame could be Stuart Lancaster, the former England coach currently assisting Leo Cullen at Leinster, unless the club tap into the extensive knowledge of their former head coach Wayne Smith and recruit a top New Zealand coach. The former Saints players Ali Hepher and Rob Hunter have both been integral cogs in Exeter’s successful coaching setup but they would take a lot of prising away from the Chiefs. With Saints having only recently installed White as chairman and appointed a new chief executive, Mark Darbon, a wind of change is certainly blowing through a club that endured a similar period of upheaval, including relegation, before Mallinder’s appointment in 2007. Complicating the situation further is the fact that Harry Mallinder, the highly rated son of the departing director of rugby, recently signed a new contract to remain at the club until at least 2020. The England captain, Dylan Hartley, also signed a new contract in the summer and Saints have spent a sizeable chunk of next season’s salary cap already on the Wales fly-half Dan Biggar, who has agreed to join from Ospreys. It also raises the uncomfortable issue of the shrinking shelf-life of Premiership head coaches. With Cockerill and Mallinder having now moved on within a year of each other and Worcester also looking for a new permanent director of rugby to replace the departing Gary Gold, the Midlands coaching landscape has rarely been more fluid. It remains to be seen, however, whether Northampton will be bold enough to hand over control to an up-and-coming young English coach with no head-coaching experience."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2017/dec/14/eu-must-not-burn-the-worlds-forests-for-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T12:01:06Z","webTitle":"EU must not burn the world's forests for 'renewable' energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/14/eu-must-not-burn-the-worlds-forests-for-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/dec/14/eu-must-not-burn-the-worlds-forests-for-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"EU must not burn the world's forests for 'renewable' energy","bodyText":"The European Union is moving to enact a directive to double Europe’s current renewable energy by 2030. This is admirable, but a critical flaw in the present version would accelerate climate change, allowing countries, power plants and factories to claim that cutting down trees and burning them for energy fully qualifies as renewable energy. Even a small part of Europe’s energy requires a large quantity of trees and to avoid profound harm to the climate and forests worldwide the European council and parliament must fix this flaw. European producers of wood products have for decades generated electricity and heat as beneficial by-products, using wood wastes and limited forest residues. Most of this material would decompose and release carbon dioxide in a few years anyway, so using them to displace fossil fuels can reduce the carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere in a few years too. Unfortunately, the directive moving through parliament would go beyond wastes and residues and credit countries and companies for cutting down additional trees simply to burn them for energy. To do so has fundamentally different consequences because the carbon released into the air would otherwise stay locked up in forests. The reasoning seems to be that so long as forests re-grow, they will eventually reabsorb the carbon released. Yet even then, the net effect – as many studies have shown – will typically be to increase global warming for decades to centuries, even when wood replaces coal, oil or natural gas. The reasons begin with the inherent inefficiencies in harvesting wood. Typically, around one third or more of each tree is contained in roots and small branches that are properly left in the forest to protect soils, and most of which decompose, emitting carbon. The wood that is burned releases even more carbon than coal per unit of energy generated, and burns at a lower temperature, producing less electricity – turning wood into compressed pellets increases efficiency but uses energy and creates large additional emissions. A power plant burning wood chips will typically emit one and a half times the carbon dioxide of a plant burning coal and at least three times the carbon dioxide emitted by a power plant burning natural gas. Although regrowing trees absorb carbon, trees grow slowly, and for some years a regrowing forest absorbs less carbon than if the forest were left unharvested. Eventually, the new forest grows faster and the carbon it absorbs, plus the reduction in fossil fuels, can pay back the “carbon debt”, but that takes decades to centuries, depending on the forest type and use. We conservatively estimate that using deliberately harvested wood instead of fossil fuels will release at least twice as much carbon dioxide to the air by 2050 per kilowatt hour. Doing so turns a potential reduction in emissions from solar or wind into a large increase. Time matters. Placing an additional carbon load in the atmosphere for decades means permanent damage due to more rapid melting of permafrost and glaciers, and more packing of heat and acidity into the world’s oceans. At a critical moment when countries need to be “buying time” against climate change, this approach amounts to selling the world’s limited time to combat climate change under mistaken claims of improvement. The effect on the world’s forests, carbon and biodiversity is likely to be large because even though Europe is a large producer of wood, its harvest could only supply about 6% of its primary energy. For more than a decade, the increased use of biomass has been supplying roughly half of Europe’s increase in renewable energy. To supply even one third of the additional renewable energy likely required by 2030, Europe would need to burn an amount of wood greater than its total harvest today. This would turn a likely 6% decrease in energy emissions by 2050 under the directive through solar and wind into at least a 6% increase. Europe’s own demand for wood would degrade forests around the world, but if other countries follow Europe’s example, the impacts would be even more dangerous. Instead of encouraging Indonesia and Brazil to preserve their tropical forests – Europe’s present position – the message of this directive is “cut your forests so long as someone burns them for energy”. Once countries are invested in such efforts, fixing the error may become impossible. To supply just an additional 3% of global energy with wood, the world needs to double its commercial wood harvests at great costs to carbon and wildlife. Neither a requirement that forests be managed sustainably nor any other “safeguards” in the various working drafts would stop this. For example, the directive would ban wood if harvests undermined “the long-term productivity capacity of the forest”. Although that sounds good, preserving the capacity of trees to grow back still leaves more carbon in the air for at least decades. Restricting wood harvests to countries with net growing forests – another idea – would still take carbon that forests would otherwise add to their storage and instead put it in the air without meaningful global limits. The solution is to restrict eligible forest biomass to its traditional sources of residues and waste. Legislators will likely be able to vote on such an amendment in the parliament’s plenary. By 1850, the use of wood for bioenergy helped drive the near deforestation of western Europe even at a time when Europeans consumed relatively little energy. Although coal helped to save the forests of Europe, the solution is not to go back to burning forests. As scientists, we collectively have played key roles in the IPCC, in advising European governments, and in forest and climate research. We encourage European legislators and other policymakers to amend the present directive because the fate of much of the world’s forests is literally at stake.

But who decides where the line is drawn?\r\n","bodyText":"Few would deny the importance of tackling online hatred or child abuse content. The internet, after all, has become a key weapon for those who disseminate and incite hatred and violence against minorities, and for those who pose a horrifying threat to children. It is difficult, though, not to feel discomfort about three rightwing newspapers – the Sun, the Daily Mail and the Times – all leading on the perils of social media. The Daily Mail’s dramatic headline reads: FACEBOOK ‘RIPPING SOCIETY APART’: this, from the newspaper that routinely whips up hatred against minorities and denounces those deemed opponents as “Enemies of the people”, “saboteurs” and “collaborators”. There is another fear, though. Where will the crescendo for online regulation end? As the Times reports, the government’s independent ethics watchdog is recommending fines or prosecution if social media companies fail to remove racist, child abuse or “extremist” content. Many have noted the double standards of Facebook’s policy on removing content: deleting, for example, the famous Vietnam war image of a child burned by napalm, while permitting all manner of misogynistic, antisemitic and racist posts. Some form of action is clearly needed. But where is the line drawn? It’s worth noting precedents from the past. In the aftermath of the Battle of Cable Street – when anti-fascists confronted Oswald Mosley’s fascist Blackshirt mobs under the banner of “They Shall Not Pass” – the Tories passed the Public Order Act. It introduced, for example, the need to get police consent before demonstrations and banned “political uniforms” from being worn in public. And yet this legislation ended up being deployed against the left, including during the miners’ strike nearly 50 years later. Similarly, we’ve seen sweeping anti-terrorism legislation enacted in the face of opposition from critics who raised concerns about civil liberties, only to be dismissed as namby-pamby sandal-wearing terror-appeasing liberals. And yet such legislation has repeatedly been deployed against peaceful activists, my own twin sister among them. Another example: when the Tories were hit with a lobbying scandal in 2013, David Cameron introduced the so-called lobbying bill. It became known instead as the gagging bill: rather than targeting the wealthy individuals and corporations which the Tory party relies on, it instead went after non-government organisations and trade unions. All of these crackdowns were sold with laudable intentions. But note what happened in practice. We already have rightwing commentator Toby Young – a poundshop Katie Hopkins, though repeatedly wheeled out on television – who disgracefully compared democratic socialist movement Momentum to a far-right thuggish organisation like Britain First, whose leading members have convictions for their criminality. A press that routinely whips up hatred and bigotry repeatedly portrays the left as the perpetrators of online abuse, ignoring the open sewer of rightwing hatred online. You don’t have to wear a tinfoil hat to see how this could all end. Yes, we need action to deal with online hatred and abuse. But let’s make sure there are clear safeguards, or history will repeat itself, and peaceful opponents of an unjust status quo will suffer the consequences. • Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/12/tories-green-michael-gove-fracking-renewables-ecology","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T12:28:17Z","webTitle":"The Tories’ rebranding won’t wash: being green is about more than fluffy bunnies | Molly Scott Cato","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/12/tories-green-michael-gove-fracking-renewables-ecology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/12/tories-green-michael-gove-fracking-renewables-ecology","fields":{"headline":"The Tories’ rebranding won’t wash: being green is about more than fluffy bunnies","bodyText":"Up to their necks in Brexit chaos and with Corbyn’s Labour snapping at their heels, the Tories are trying again with a somewhat tired strategy to escape the label of the “nasty party”. They are having another go at acting like environmentalists, this time combining it with being nice to animals. At the helm of this more caring narrative is environment secretary, Michael Gove, tasked with resurrecting the idea that blue is the new green. The public have come to regard the Conservatives as people who believe it is fine for hounds to catch and tear apart a fox because animals don’t have feelings anyway. The manifesto commitment to overturn the foxhunting ban and more recently refusing to back Caroline Lucas’s amendment to the EU withdrawal bill on recognising animals as sentient beings, have left the Tories looking cruel and heartless and has led to a huge public backlash. In response we have had a plethora of new “pro-environment” policy announcements from the man who has promised a green Brexit, and it would be churlish not to admit that these are welcome. There has been the outlawing of the trade in ivory; reversing the manifesto pledge to hold a vote on foxhunting; a promise to ban bee-killing neonicotinoids; and backing the reintroduction of beavers to the British countryside; as well as explorations into a deposit scheme for bottles and the outlawing of microbeads in cosmetics. This has been backed up by Theresa May writing for the Guardian and some manic and repetitive tweeting from Tory MPs about how much they love animals, while endlessly repeating the refrain that the idea that Conservatives don’t regard animals as sentient is fake news. The Tories even seem to have succeeded in wooing some conservation and wildlife groups. The commitment to a new post-Brexit environment watchdog has been particularly well received – ignoring the fact that it was the Tories who abolished exactly this sort of public body seven years ago. The problem for the Tories is that being green is about so much more than fluffy bunnies. While individual policies on animal protection are welcome, in a nation full of animal lovers they are easy wins. They also ignore the central lesson of ecology, a lesson that Gove and his fellow Tories have never been able to grasp: that life on Earth is one system. Nature abhors not only a vacuum but also compartmentalisation. Those lovely beavers and polar bears need somewhere to live; more than compassion and concern they need a habitat. And if you let a fracking company pollute the waterways or throw subsidies at fossil fuels then the beavers will die and the polar bears will starve. When Michael Gove first started down his green Brexit route I suggested we put him in special measures. As Greens we find it hard to trust him to protect the environment because he is part of a government that has introduced so many damaging policies over so many years. There is a long way to go from special measures to outstanding, but if that’s where he wishes to move to I suggest he is assessed on three key issues. First, will he persuade his government to ban fracking and go all out for renewables? Fracking poses huge threats to some of our most fragile and treasured landscapes and will expose communities and wildlife to noise, air, light and water pollution. The government remains committed to this destructive industry and in the recent budget, Philip Hammond left Britain’s renewable energy industry out in the cold with no new subsidies for low-carbon electricity generation until 2025. Second, will he phase out toxic glyphosate, Europe’s most used herbicide, linked to cancers and other health problems as well as having damaging impacts on soil and biodiversity? Banning neonicotinoids was easy, especially since the latest extensive study that confirmed their devastating impacts was mainly funded by two major neonicotinoid producers. Banning, or, as the European Parliament recently voted for, phasing out glyphosate, is an altogether more testing challenge for Gove. Especially so since his government recently voted to support the renewal of the license for glyphosate for a further five years. Third, a genuine test of the Tories newfound love affair with animals, will be to see if Gove can persuade the government to end the badger cull, described by a government appointed Independent Expert Panel (IEP) in 2013 as “ineffective and inhumane”. The government recently gave the go-ahead for further badger culls in Gloucestershire and Somerset. But Gove’s true colours cannot be tested against a series of discrete policies. Green politics just doesn’t work that way. The biggest test is whether Gove and the Conservative government are able to understand that the whole is bigger than the sum of the parts; whether they can see the wood as well as the trees. If Gove and his Tory colleagues can’t grasp that they will never be awarded a green star."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/12/james-vince-drives-england-batsmen-flaws-cricket-ashes-the-spin","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T12:59:00Z","webTitle":"James Vince drives us crazy but other England batsmen’s flaws also maddening | Andy Bull","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/12/james-vince-drives-england-batsmen-flaws-cricket-ashes-the-spin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/12/james-vince-drives-england-batsmen-flaws-cricket-ashes-the-spin","fields":{"headline":"James Vince drives us crazy but other England batsmen’s flaws also maddening","bodyText":"Vince’s vicissitudes Way back when Duncan Fletcher had a column in the Guardian, I used to do his ghostwriting. It was an education in how a coach thinks, parcelled up into a 30-minute conversation about whoever was in the headlines that week. And as we went on, I learned there were a handful of players who would always exercise Fletcher, touch him off as surely as if you were tapping his kneecap with a reflex hammer. James Vince was one of them. Fletcher’s gruff voice would turn into something more like a purr on the odd occasion Vince’s name came up. He had seen him batting in the nets down at Hampshire and been seriously impressed. That was the better part of a decade ago. If Fletcher’s first impression of Vince has become so well known that it features in almost every other piece that’s written about him, it’s because (hard truth this) Vince hasn’t earned any higher praise since. Fletcher, who has a good eye for a batsman, was beguiled by that cover drive, as handsome as Sean Connery, as smooth as Roger Moore. It’s a shot he plays with such sweet timing, such power and grace, that he makes grown men sigh. Writing on his blog the Old Batsman, Jon Hotten recently described it as batting’s Rorschach Test. Fletcher wasn’t the only one who saw a seductive promise in it. Vince came up through the age-groups with England, at U17 and U19 level, and some of the men who played with him then still have a lingering admiration for his talent. When Ben Stokes was first called up to the England performance programme he said the only reason he’d been picked ahead of Vince was because he’d happened to score a century in a county match that was on TV. “If James Vince had scored 161 on television it would have been him instead of me. I’m convinced of that.” The trouble is that these days, when quicks look at Vince, they tend to see a ready wicket, as Mike Selvey, who has a bowler’s soul, put it when England were playing Pakistan last year: “The seamers have taken on the persona of fishermen, baiting their hooks and casting them out in the knowledge that there is a shoal out there that will bite sooner rather than later. Time after time Vince has nibbled and nicked: all too easy.” It’s a simple trick, and it didn’t take Australia long to figure it out. Since his 83 in the first innings at Brisbane, Vince has been caught behind for two, caught behind for two, and caught behind for 15. Altogether, Vince has been out caught by ‘keeper or slips nine times in 15 Test innings now, and eight in his last 10. Lured, hooked, and reeled in by a succession of quicks: Shaminda Eranga, Wahab Riaz, Rahat Ali, Mohammad Amir, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc. Trouble is, as Cricinfo’s statisticians have pointed out, Vince also scores over a third of his runs through the covers. So he can hardly cut the shot out. His strength is also his weakness. And unless he can master the problem, he’s damned if he does play the drive, and damned if he doesn’t. These aren’t qualities you’d necessarily look for in your No3. England’s conundrum, though, is that they’ve no ready replacement. So many of the other batsmen they have around their Test squad have their own glaring flaws. Gary Ballance has that habit of moving both feet back and playing from deep inside his crease, which leaves him vulnerable to the full ball that moves away from him, especially from a left-handed bowler. Easy to forget, now, that Ballance averaged 62 in his first 15 Test innings. Then he was bowled, for the very first time in Test cricket, and since that match, he’s averaged 19 in 25 Test innings, and been bowled eight more times. It’s not just Ballance and Vince. Keaton Jennings struggled as the summer wore on, seemed so stiff and upright that Graeme Smith said he looked like he was playing with a pole up his back. He became so unsure of his defence on the back foot that he was caught behind off a back-of-a-length ball five times in seven innings. Ben Duckett’s defence was unpicked by India’s off-spinners last winter, and Tom Westley’s way of playing wonky straight drives was figured out by the West Indian quicks. He was out driving five times in seven Tests. Which, you could argue, is the nature of Test cricket. New players are subjected to a merciless degree of scrutiny. It’s up to them to adapt and overcome. And it’s sure a lot easier to say this stuff than to live it. But it is beginning to feel as though there is a deeper problem here. It could be that modern coaching has moved too far away from the orthodoxies, as if the methods honed over decades of play, passed down in MCC manuals, don’t have a place in the modern game. There is, after all, a lot of talk about encouraging players to express themselves and play their natural way. But when five batsmen with such obvious flaws fail in such a short space of time, that looks less like a coincidence, and more like a pattern. • This is an extract taken from The Spin, the Guardian’s weekly cricket email.

Efunshile was the only one of five candidates for Channel 4’s board rejected by Karen Bradley in November 2016. Ofcom is responsible for finding, vetting and appointing Channel 4 non-executive directors, with the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport usually rubber-stamping its decisions. Bradley’s unusual move to step in to reject Efunshile, which at the time meant three of Channel 4’s 13 board members were women and all were white, embarrassed the government. The announcement came on the same day as a green paper on corporate governance was published that highlighted the importance of “improving the diversity of boardrooms so that their composition better reflects the demographics of employees”. Theresa May was forced to defend Bradley’s decision after the Labour MP David Lammy used prime minister’s questions to ask whether she thought there “isn’t a woman or a black person in the country worthy of being on the board of Channel 4?” The DCMS said at the time that it approved only the candidates who “met the specific skills and experiences set out in Ofcom’s advertised job descriptions”. However, the regulator said all five candidates it put forward were of a “high calibre”. Efunshile, who was appointed deputy CEO of ACE in 2012, received a CBE in June 2016 in the Queen’s birthday honours for services to arts and culture. She was also made the first chair of the National College for the Creative and Cultural Industries. A dozen of the most respected female figures in the arts and creative industries, including the playwright Bonnie Greer, the former culture secretary Tessa Jowell, the former cabinet minister Valerie Amos and Gail Rebuck, the chair of Penguin Random House UK, called on the government to explain its decision. On Tuesday, the DCMS announced Efunshile as one of four new non-executive directors on the Channel 4 board. Industry sources told the Guardian after the rejection last year that Efunshile would be included in the next wave of appointments. Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, called on the government to explain why it had “wasted a year” appointing Efunshile. “Althea Efunshile is a very good appointment to the Channel 4 board, but she would have been a very good appointment a year ago, too, when ministers blocked her,” he said. “After she was blocked, Matthew Hancock [digital minister] attacked ‘tokenism’ and said that board members had to be appointed on merit. The government should explain what has changed, and why they wasted a year making this decision.” A DCMS spokesman defended Bradley’s decision-making, saying Efunshile met the criteria for a different non-executive role at Channel 4, one that required a person with “experience working and/or engaging with young people, for example from an organisation with an educational purpose”. An Ofcom spokesman said: “The secretary of state approves candidates on the basis that they meet the specific skills and experiences set out in Ofcom’s advertised job descriptions. “Althea’s experience in the educational and cultural sectors will help make sure the interests of young people are represented at board level, and she was the best candidate for this particular role.” The DCMS also approved Ofcom’s selection of Tom Hooper, the director of the King’s Speech, Fru Hazlitt, a former senior executive at companies including ITV, Yahoo and Virgin Radio, and Uzma Hasan, a producer and co-founder of Little House Productions. The number of members on Channel 4’s board is flexible, with the four new appointments replacing three departures in Josie Rourke, MT Rainey, and Paul Potts. The Channel 4 chairman, Charles Gurassa, said: “I am delighted to welcome Althea, Fru, Tom and Uzma to the Channel 4 board. “They bring an impressive track record of creative and commercial leadership in both the public and private sector. I know that they all share great admiration and enthusiasm for the work of Channel 4 and the importance and value of its public service remit.” Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"gnm-press-office/2017/dec/12/the-guardian-and-the-observer-win-three-prizes-at-the-british-journalism-awards","type":"article","sectionId":"gnm-press-office","sectionName":"GNM press office","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T11:29:00Z","webTitle":"The Guardian and The Observer win three prizes at the British Journalism Awards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/2017/dec/12/the-guardian-and-the-observer-win-three-prizes-at-the-british-journalism-awards","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/gnm-press-office/2017/dec/12/the-guardian-and-the-observer-win-three-prizes-at-the-british-journalism-awards","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian and The Observer win three prizes at the British Journalism Awards","bodyText":"Three Guardian and the Observer journalists have won British Journalism Awards at a ceremony held in London yesterday (Monday 11 December 2017).

Helen McEntee, Ireland’s Europe minister, said a “huge amount of work” had been done over the weekend to try to iron out proposals for a future Irish border, one of the issues that must be addressed before Brexit talks can move on to discussing a future trade relationship. The Irish cabinet was meeting on Monday morning before Theresa May’s crunch meeting at lunchtime in Brussels with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. “Unfortunately I don’t think that we will have an absolute final text that we will be able to approve,” McEntee told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “However, for us there are a number of key issues that we have wanted to see progress on that I know progress has been made over the weekend.” May will be joined by David Davis, the Brexit secretary, in Brussels. Speaking before he departed, Davis told the BBC that it was “an important day”. “We’ve put seven months of work, both sides, into getting to this point, and we’re hoping that Mr Juncker, today, will give us sufficient progress so we can move on to trade talks,” he said. “The decision, of course, won’t be taken until 15 December, but that’s what we’re hoping for. Trade talks are of enormous importance in the United Kingdom and Europe.” Ireland’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said a deal on the Irish border was still achievable. He confirmed no deal had been struck on how to avoid a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland but said talks were at a “sensitive” stage and there was still time for an agreement. “We are not quite yet where we want to be, but it is possible to do that [agree] today,” he told Morning Ireland on RTE national radio. He added: “The Irish government has to remain firm on the key issues.” Coveney told RTE that the special Irish cabinet meeting called on Monday morning would discuss a draft proposal from May. He said: “A text has been looked at by our negotiating teams and the EU taskforce negotiating teams.” He said a draft proposal had been achieved last Thursday but there had not been agreement by Ireland on all issues and, despite conversations continuing until late on Sunday night, there was still an impasse over some unspecified aspects. The Brexit focus on Monday will be split between Dublin and Brussels. The Irish cabinet met on Monday morning but no statement was expected until further last-minute talks with British negotiators. Meanwhile, May will have lunch with Juncker and then see the European council president, Donald Tusk, before returning to London. If there is progress, the UK and EU could issue a joint statement on Monday afternoon, with May expected to update MPs on Tuesday. May will be delivering the UK’s final offer on the three main issues in the first round of Brexit talks – citizens’ rights, the financial settlement and the Irish border, with the latter proving the most intractable. She had been given a deadline of Monday 4 December to table offers before a European council summit on 14 December, when EU leaders would decide if “sufficient progress” had been made to proceed to the next phase of talks, on a future trading relationship. Asked what else Ireland was seeking as reassurance that a hard border could be avoided after Brexit, McEntee said more work was needed from the UK. “My belief – and I think we would all agree in the government in Ireland – is we need to have something that is much clearer than we’ve had to date,” she said. “What has been very welcome is to have that commitment that there can be no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland. “However, we have always said in order for that to happen there cannot be any divergence in the regulatory framework.” Asked if she was seeking the impossible from the UK, McEntee said all the Irish government was asking for was “for the UK government to fulfil their commitment” to no hard border as set out in May’s Florence speech. McEntee said it was “not just a customs issue”, but also had to be tackled to avoid any future unrest. “We’re talking about a return to something of the past where there were huge troubles,” she said. “We do not want anything that would trigger any kind of a return to the difficulties of the past.” Asked whether she was optimistic, McEntee said: “I do believe that we are nearing closer progress, and sufficient progress. We are not there yet. That is why we are meeting as a cabinet this morning to look at where we are, to assess where we are, to look at what is being presented and to see what we need to do to move forwards. “If there is not enough that has been given to us yet, it is up to the UK government to produce that, to provide that.” Owen Paterson, one of a quartet of senior Conservative hardliners on Brexit who set out a series of “red lines” for May at the weekend, warned that he would accept “no special arrangements” for the Irish border. Paterson, who was formerly Northern Ireland secretary, told Today: “It would be disastrous for the Belfast agreement to put a line down the Irish Sea and to have Northern Ireland hived off with some separate standards, as some people in the Dublin political establishment are asking for. That would be really very damaging.” He said a “soft” border could be maintained by carrying out customs checks at the point of shipment, with technology tracking goods crossing the frontier."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/05/labor-pledges-to-introduce-10-days-of-paid-domestic-violence-leave","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T20:19:56Z","webTitle":"Labor pledges to introduce 10 days of paid domestic violence leave","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/05/labor-pledges-to-introduce-10-days-of-paid-domestic-violence-leave","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/05/labor-pledges-to-introduce-10-days-of-paid-domestic-violence-leave","fields":{"headline":"Labor pledges to introduce 10 days of paid domestic violence leave","bodyText":"Labor has joined calls for all employees to get 10 days paid domestic violence leave, in line with a campaign from the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Bill Shorten will announce on Tuesday that, if elected, Labor will legislate for 10 days paid domestic and family violence leave in the national employment standards. Paid leave gives employees time off to meet legal, medical, counselling, relocation and other administrative commitments to deal with or exit abusive or violent relationships. The workplace entitlement would be available to all employees if they or an immediate family member experience family or domestic violence. At the 2016 election Labor promised five days’ of paid leave, but the commitment to 10 days brings it in line with the ACTU and the Greens, who promised last week to introduce a bill for 10 days. Shorten said Labor had upped its commitment because “we recognise the need to improve workplace support for survivors of family violence”. “We’ve listened to victims, frontline workers, business, and organisations that deal daily with domestic violence,” he said. “Their clear message is that people who have experienced domestic violence need more support in the workplace.” In 2017, 45 women have been killed through domestic violence and it is the leading cause of death, disability and illness among women aged 15 to 44 years of age. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates that around two out of every three women who experience domestic violence are in the workforce. In a joint statement with the shadow minister for women, Tanya Plibersek, and shadow employment minister, Brendan O’Connor, Shorten said that workers should not have the stress of seeking legal advice and medical treatment “compounded by fear of losing your job or the financial disadvantage of going without pay”. Labor accused the Turnbull government of “vacating the field” because they do not support paid domestic violence leave. “They see domestic violence leave as a cost to business and, in a terrifying display of how out of touch they are, argue that it will make women less attractive to employers,” they said. In July the Fair Work Commission rejected the ACTU’s bid for 10 days’ paid domestic violence leave to be included in all modern awards but left the door open to the possibility of unpaid leave. Employer organisations opposed the new entitlement. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry claimed it could cost employers as much as $205m to create just one day of domestic violence leave per worker per year. Unions dispute the figure and suggest the cost would be closer to $11.8m, based on estimates that 2% of female workers and less than 1% of male workers take the leave each year when it is available to them. Labor said domestic violence leave would help businesses prevent loss of productivity, and increases employee retention and reduces unpredictable absenteeism. About 1.6m workers currently have access to paid family and domestic violence leave through enterprise bargaining or company policy. Labor acknowledged the many employers that already provide family violence leave, including Medicare, CUB, Telstra, NAB, Virgin Australia, IKEA and Qantas.

Asked whether a leadership change would make them more or less likely to vote for the Liberal party, 18% of the Guardian Essential sample said they would be more likely to vote for the government at the next election, 13% said less likely, and 54% said it would make no difference. Among Coalition voters, 29% said they would be more inclined to vote for the government with another leader, 16% said less likely, and 46% said it would make no difference. The new survey of 1,836 voters also confirmed the Turnbull government was closing out the torrid 2017 political year trailing Labor by 10 points, with the opposition ahead on the two-party preferred measure 55% to 45% – meaning the ALP would easily win any election held today. The new poll comes as the Turnbull government pushed through what is expected to be the final sitting week for the year, with parliamentary debate over same-sex marriage and new citizenship declarations from MPs dominating proceedings. Malcolm Turnbull has attempted to use Barnaby Joyce’s victory in the weekend byelection in New England to stabilise the government’s fortunes, and the government is also continuing to pursue the strife-prone Labor senator Sam Dastyari about his dealings with Chinese business leaders, targeting him in the parliament – although Labor is attempting to return fire. While the prime minister entered the final sitting week batting off leadership speculation, the new poll suggests Turnbull remains the top choice as Liberal leader, although his support has dropped 4% since August, and the foreign minister, Julie Bishop is only just behind the prime minister on a ranking of six contenders. While Turnbull attracted 21% support and Bishop 19%, 15% of the sample nominated “someone else” other than the list they were given – which was Turnbull, Bishop, Tony Abbott, Christopher Pyne, Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton – while 27% of the sample, the highest percentage, replied “don’t know” to the question. Abbott, the former prime minister, who says he will only return to the Liberal party leadership if he is drafted, was favoured by 10% of the sample. Dutton, a favourite of up-and-coming conservatives, was supported by 4% and Morrison and Pyne by 2% each. Turnbull was also the clear choice of Coalition voters, with 40% preferring him as party leader compared to 20% for Bishop and 13% for Abbott. Given a clique in the National party has been engaged in open warfare with the Liberals and with Turnbull over the past couple of weeks as Joyce has campaigned to hold his electorate of New England, voters were asked this week whether the Liberal and National parties should continue in Coalition, orbecome more independent of each other. In the wake of the Liberal National party’s disappointing result in the recent Queensland state election, some Nationals have been talking openly about more assertive product differentiation from the Liberals. But the poll sample was split – with 38% thinking the Liberal and National parties should continue to work together and 34% thinking they should become more independent of each other. The view among Coalition voters was much clearer – 73% thought the parties should continue together, and 13% believed they should separate. Given the knife-edged result in the recent Queensland poll, with voters evidently intent on lodging a substantial protest vote despite the risk of returning a minority government, and given the finely balanced parliaments in Canberra in 2010 and 2016, voters were asked for their views on which type of government they preferred. Over half of the sample (54%) said they preferred a majority government, while 25% would prefer a government with more minor parties where no single party had a majority. The views were skewed by voting intentions. A clear majority of Coalition voters (69%) favoured a majority government, while 48% of Greens voters preferred a government where no single party had a majority. Voters also took a dim view of politicians resigning from their party and then continuing to sit in parliament on the crossbench, with most (51%) arguing that politicians who resigned from their party should be forced to resign from parliament. Only 24% thought defectors should be allowed to continue in parliament. Voters were also asked this week about sexism. A majority of respondents believed there was a lot or some sexism in the media (64%), politics (60%), advertising (60%), workplaces (57%) and sport (56%). Women were more likely than men to think there was a lot or some sexism in all areas – but especially in workplaces (women 67%, men 46%) and politics (70% to 49%). There have been small recorded differences in the figures since the questions were asked last January. Sexism in workplaces has dropped 4%, media has risen 6%, sport fallen 4% and schools has gone down 8%. There is, however, a more significant change in the differences between men and women on some issues. On sexism in the workplace, the gap between perceptions of men and women increased from 12% to 21%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/04/cathay-pacific-flight-crew-saw-north-korean-missile-test","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T08:39:04Z","webTitle":"Cathay Pacific flight crew say they saw North Korean missile test","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/04/cathay-pacific-flight-crew-saw-north-korean-missile-test","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/04/cathay-pacific-flight-crew-saw-north-korean-missile-test","fields":{"headline":"Cathay Pacific flight crew say they saw North Korean missile test","bodyText":"The crew of a Cathay Pacific flight from San Francisco to Hong Kong reported seeing a North Korean ballistic missile break up and fall out of the sky last week, the airline has said, highlighting an unforeseen danger of Pyongyang’s weapons tests. Flight trackers put the plane close to Japan around the time of Pyongyang’s Hwasong-15 missile test on 29 November. The missile fell into the Sea of Japan. Pyongyang claimed its latest intercontinental ballistic missile was capable of striking anywhere in the US. North Korea has not yet proved it can mount a miniaturised nuclear warhead on its missiles, but the latest test is likely to strengthen its negotiating power with Washington. “The flight crew of CX893 reported a sighting of what is suspected to be the re-entry of the recent DPRK test missile,” an airline spokesman said, referring to North Korea’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. “Though the flight was far from the event location, the crew advised Japan [air traffic control] according to procedures.” The flight was not affected and the company had no plans to change existing routes, the airline said. Mark Hoey, Cathay Pacific’s general manager of operations, recounted the message from the crew of the passenger plane to ground staff. “Be advised, we witnessed the DPRK missile blow up and fall apart near our current location,” the pilots said, according to a report in the South China Morning Post. A Cathay Pacific cargo plane – CX096 – may have been even closer to the missile, at a lateral distance of a few hundred metres, Hoey added, according to the report. That flight was bound for Alaska and was also over Japan at the time of the missile test."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/dec/05/abc-radio-programs-pm-and-the-world-today-to-be-halved-in-length","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T17:00:12Z","webTitle":"ABC radio programs PM and The World Today to be halved in length","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/dec/05/abc-radio-programs-pm-and-the-world-today-to-be-halved-in-length","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/dec/05/abc-radio-programs-pm-and-the-world-today-to-be-halved-in-length","fields":{"headline":"ABC radio programs PM and The World Today to be halved in length","bodyText":"The flagship ABC radio current affairs programs PM and The World Today will be halved in length next year and Business PM will be axed, staff have been told. PM and The World Today will both be reduced from hour-long programs to 30 minutes, radio current affairs employees were told at a meeting on Monday by Tanya Nolan, the managing editor of audio current affairs. From 22 January The World Today, hosted by Eleanor Hall, will end at 12.30pm instead of 1pm to make way for a new “entertaining” national program on ABC Local Radio hosted by the former Triple J presenter Myf Warhurst. Warhurst’s show, which is designed to attract 30- to 40-year-olds with a “lighter” offering, will run until 2pm. Staff were told the rationale behind the changes was research showing there were significant increases in audiences consuming on-demand audio and digital content and a drop in the numbers listening to linear broadcasts on the ABC. The under-55 audience was not coming to the ABC as it once did, and something had to be done to reverse the trend. Nolan, who also oversees RN Breakfast, AM, Background Briefing and RN Drive, told staff the shortened 30-minute PM and The World Today “would leave the audience wanting more”. The head of spoken content, Judith Whelan, told staff the new local radio schedule would be unveiled on Wednesday and most of the time slots were changing. From next year PM will air at 6.30pm on local radio so Drive can be extended from 6pm to 6.30pm in each state. Afternoons will run from 2pm to 4pm and Drive will run from 4pm to 6.30pm. The changes mean the output of programmed radio current affairs will be reduced from two and a half hours a day to 90 minutes. But reporters will be expected to do more live crosses into local radio programs because Nolan said there was “an over-reliance on packages” which can “kill the energy” of a program. Nolan said she would prefer reporters in the field did more live crosses into Drive than longer reported stories for dedicated programs. PM, hosted by Mark Colvin from 1997 until his death in 2017, is the sister program to AM, which turned 50 this year. First heard on 7 July 1969, PM is broadcast across the ABC’s local radio network after the 6pm news until 7pm. Business PM is a 10-minute dedicated business slot from 6.50pm to 7pm hosted by Elysse Morgan. A shorter version of PM is also broadcast on Radio National after the news at 5pm. Journalists will also be encouraged to brush up on their conversational and informal talking skills so they can make podcasts and do more live chats. The changes will fuel fears that Radio National – and linear radio in general – are increasingly under threat as resources are diverted to digital services. The ABC’s managing director, Michelle Guthrie, has unveiled a restructure of content divisions that will see Radio National broken up and responsibility for its programs scattered around the corporation. The major changes come just days after radio current affairs journalists shone at the Walkley awards for journalism. Jane Bardon’s coverage of Indigenous affairs for ABC Radio, Matt Brown’s international coverage of Islamic State for AM and ABC Radio’s senior business correspondent Peter Ryan’s coverage of the Commonwealth Bank scandal for ABC Radio were all honoured on Friday night. Other ABC news programs to be decommissioned in 2017 include Lateline and Stan Grant’s The Link."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/dec/04/seattle-seahawks-philadelphia-eagles-nfl-sunday-night-football","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T09:00:06Z","webTitle":"The limping Seattle Seahawks simply refuse to go away","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/04/seattle-seahawks-philadelphia-eagles-nfl-sunday-night-football","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/04/seattle-seahawks-philadelphia-eagles-nfl-sunday-night-football","fields":{"headline":"The limping Seattle Seahawks simply refuse to go away","bodyText":"Last week, with the Seattle Seahawks weakened by injuries and the NFL’s best team coming to town, Seahawks linebacker KJ Wright uttered the phrase that might ring through the final stages of this NFL season. “Don’t sleep on us, man,” he told The Seattle Times. “This team is still good,” he continued. “We are still talented. We can be the best of the best. We are the best of the best. And so just because we have injuries don’t mean that things will change.” On Sunday night, the Philadelphia Eagles came into Seattle on a run few teams ever experience. Their offense had been so explosive, their defense so intimidating they were looking to be the first team in 18 years to win five straight games by 20 points. They hoped to leave with the NFC East title wrapped up a month early. Given the way they had been playing and the way the Seahawks were limping, it seemed a logical conclusion both would happen. By now the NFL should know the Seahawks might be the league’s grittiest team, surviving more on belief than talent these days. Instead of winning by 20, the Eagles only scored twice, losing 24-10. Carson Wentz, assumed by many to be the 2017 MVP, was harried all night. His 348 yards passing were mostly garbage yards. When Seattle’s defense needed to make a stop, Wentz was pressured by swarms of players in blue, sacked three times and knocked to the ground several others. Even his two best throws – in the Eagles’ only touchdown drive – came under great duress. It was as if the Seahawks were the Seahawks again … if only for a night. Injuries have been especially cruel to Seattle. Their famed Legion of Boom has been torn apart. Richard Sherman, their great defensive star, watched from under a blue jacket, his season done with a torn achilles. Kam Chancellor, their biggest intimidator, wore a stocking hat instead of a helmet. They have pieced together an offensive line and are on their sixth running back. Even with Russell Wilson having an MVP-level season of his own, there has been little about these Seahawks to say they can make another Super Bowl run. Except that they won’t go away. “They didn’t waver,” Wilson said about his team’s defense after the game. “We can’t waver. This is playoff football, you can’t waver.” This is probably the biggest question as the season heads into the final month – and many of the NFC’s top teams lack the Seahawks’ playoff experience. The Vikings (the new top seed), Eagles and Rams are unaccustomed to being good this time of year. They have all been on magnificent runs but much as the Eagles discovered in Seattle, they may not be prepared for nights like Sunday when an experienced team comes at you with a frenzy you’ve never encountered. Seattle have now played themselves into a wildcard spot with four games to play. They are 8-4 and just a game behind the Rams who come to Seattle in two weeks. Given the way the defense rattled Wentz and the Eagles and the way Wilson keeps making plays when no plays seem possible, there is every reason to believe Wright. Don’t sleep on the Seahawks. They may just be waking up for their time of year. Fantasy player of the week Blake Bortles. Imagine the Jacksonville Jaguars at 8-4 and in seeming control of a playoff spot – perhaps even a division title? Imagine too the Jags’ embattled quarterback Blake Bortles throwing for 309 yards and two touchdowns without any interceptions as he did Sunday in Jacksonville’s 30-10 victory over Indianapolis. Yes, he did this against the Colts who are 3-9 in this year without Andrew Luck, but Bortles has been more efficient as the team has developed an aggressive defense and solid running game around him. There is a belief the Jaguars will look for another quarterback next season but if Bortles keeps playing as he did Sunday, the search might not be necessary. Stat of the week Eight. The number of consecutive games Denver have lost since starting the season 3-1. Given the way the Broncos have tumbled, with a sluggish offense and dreary quarterback play, it’s hard to imagine they once looked like serious contenders to win the AFC West. That was back in early October, right after Denver had beaten Oakland 16-10 and the offense seemed strong enough to win games. Then everything fell apart. The Broncos, who scored 42 and 28 points in their first two games, have scored more than 20 only once since and as they have bounced between Trevor Siemian, Brock Osweiler and Paxton Lynch at quarterback. None have looked impressive as evidenced by Siemian’s three interceptions in a 35-9 loss to Miami on Sunday. It’s safe to say none of the three will be Denver’s starting quarterback next season. The question is who will? The Broncos defense is too good for this team to be 3-9 less than two years after winning a Super Bowl. Video of the week Last week, this space wondered if the Kansas City Chiefs would be best served by benching Alex Smith and replacing him with Patrick Mahomes, the quarterback they took with the 10th pick in last spring’s draft. Given the way Smith had failed miserably in third-down situations and given the way the Chiefs had stumbled in the season’s second-half a quarterback change seemed likely. Instead, Kanas City coach Andy Reid gave up play-calling duties, handing them to offensive coordinator Matt Nagy. Then on Sunday Smith looked more like the Smith of the early season completing 19 of 36 passes for 366 yards and four touchdowns. But most impressive was this 70-yard run that showed off Smith’s speed. Still, Smith’s performance on Sunday was not enough to keep the Chiefs slide from ending. That’s because … Video of the week II … Kansas City’s defense could not slow the might Jets and so the Chiefs found themselves in an 11-play goalline stand that twice would have held the Jets to a field goal in a one-point game, only to have New York be awarded a fresh shot at the end zone with Chiefs penalties. When the Jets did finally score – barely – to go up by six, a two-point conversion failed. Except Kansas City was called for (what else?) another penalty. Fed up, Kansas City cornerback Marcus Peters picked up the flag and heaved it into the stands. The NFL tends to frown upon their players throwing penalty flags, especially because those little yellow handkerchiefs actually have small weights sewn into them. You can laugh and say such a thing could take an eye out, but that almost happened in a game back in 1996 when an official’s flag caught Cleveland’s Orlando Brown in the eye causing Brown to miss the rest of the season. Fortunately, the flag Peters threw did not hurt anyone. In fact the fans in the stands took selfies of themselves with penalty flag, but the Chiefs were unable to come back, losing their sixth game in seven weeks, 38-31. Quote of the week “Throw him out!” – Chant from Bills fans aimed at Rob Gronkowski. The sight of the 265lbs Gronkowski plunging onto the back of a helpless Tre’Davious White as White lay on the ground was shocking. The Bills cornerback clearly not expecting contact, he held the ball he had just intercepted against his stomach and when Gronkowski jumped on him it appeared to knock his breath out. Gronkowski, who grew up in Buffalo, had reason to be angry, however. White had been holding his jersey on the previous play, keeping him from getting open and allowing the ball to be intercepted. Gronkowski appeared frustrated by the fact no penalty had been called but leaping on a defenseless player was simply dirty – a fact he acknowledged after the game when he apologized for what he did to White. None of this made a difference in the final score, a 23-3 New England victory, the Pats’ eighth straight win. Elsewhere around the league --Aaron Jones ran 20 yards for a touchdown in overtime to give Green Bay a 26-20 victory over Tampa Bay and keep the Packers’ flickering playoff hopes alive at 6-6. --The Baltimore Ravens are back in postseason contention with a 44- 20 victory over Detroit behind Joe Flacco’s 269 passing yards and two touchdowns.

It also found that a greater market share held by a smaller number of firms does not necessarily lead to greater levels of profits. The report however does confirm that our supermarket sector is overly concentrated and policies can be implemented to ensure greater competition including a move already under way by the government to make it easier for consumers to switch between providers and control their own data. One of the more common consumer complaints is that there is not enough competition in major industries. The banking, supermarket and petrol retail sectors especially come under fire. A lack of competition and domination by a few firms can lead to implicit collusion – such as is often suggested occurs with petrol prices seeming to go up in unison on Thursday. The issue is not just a dry economic one. The shadow assistant treasurer, Andrew Leigh, has written extensively on the issue, arguing that a lack of competition is damaging the economy. The report by the Grattan Institute’s Jim Minifie, Competition in Australian, examined this issue and found somewhat surprisingly that while a lack of competition did hurt our economy, the damage was not as great as might be expected. Minifie argues that “large firms are not unusually dominant in Australia given the size of its economy” and they “do not have an unusually large share of Australian output and employment”. Take for example the banking sector. The market share of the top three banks is actually quite low compared with the rest of the OECD. While the market share of the top five is above average, it is “not much more concentrated than it is in other high-income economies of about the same size”: But at least here the signs of increased market concentration are evident. As a result of mergers that were allowed to occur in the aftermath of the GFC, the market share held by the top four banks is significantly higher than it was at the start of the century: The issue is whether or not this impacts on reduced competition and thus hurts the economy as consumers end up having to pay more for services and goods that they otherwise would have. The problem Minifie found is that you can’t just assume market concentration leads to higher profits. What is important is not just how many firms dominate an industry but also why they dominate. If – as in the case of banks – the reason for the concentration is mostly due to regulation, then the industry does not see a greater proportion of “super-normal profits” (which are those that are greater than the expected shareholder return) than in other industries with low barriers to entry (such as builders, accommodation services or restaurants). But industries, which are either natural monopolies, where only a few firms can actually carry out the service (such as electricity generation or airports), or scale economies, where the cost of doing business is such that bigger has an inherent advantage (such as supermarkets, domestic airlines or petrol retailing), are much more likely to see above expected profits: Thus among the most concentrated industries, those which have the greatest share of the profits coming from “super-normal profits” are those with either scale economies – ISPs, internet publishing, supermarkets, or are natural monopolies such as wired telecommunications. The Grattan Institute report on the other hand found banks report a lower share of super-normal profits than highly competitive industries such as motor vehicle retailers and childcare services. The report also found the largest businesses in Australia have not over the years taken a greater share of the overall revenue – with the biggest 20 firms since the early 1990s usually accounting for around 54% of total revenue received by all firms listed on the Australia stock exchange: This, however, does not mean there are no issues. Our supermarket sector is one of the most concentrated among high-income countries. Our two biggest firms in the sector (Woolworths and Coles) account for 69% of the market compared with 52% in Canada, 44% in Germany, 43% in the UK and 32% across the United States: However over the past decade the two big supermarkets have actually lost market share as Aldi and Costco have begun competing. Minifie suggests once Amazon Fresh and the German company Kaufland enter the market, the share held by Woolworths and Coles will continue to fall, which will lead to “greater diversity and lower prices”. The report also recommends relaxing zoning restrictions that can limit the entry of competitors: By contrast thetelecommunications sector – both ISPs and mobile communication – while being very concentrated is not unusually so. The report notes that “high-income countries tend to have only three or four mobile networks, and their three-firm market shares typically exceed 80% – in Australia currently Telstra, Optus and Vodafone account for around 90%: But this is one area where the report notes policy progress can be made, and which the government is already making moves to introduce changes. The report argues that strong regulation aimed towards lower prices appears necessary for natural monopolies such as electricity distribution and transmission, ports and wired telecoms, given the level of their super-normal profits. But it also argues that consumers should have the power to “take their data with them to another provider” to encourage competition in telecommunications, banking and other industries. Last week the assistant minister for cities and digital transformation, Angus Taylor, announced that next year the government would seek to legislate a “consumer data right” which would enable customers “open access to their banking, energy, phone and internet transactions”. This would make it much easier to compare the cost of different services and crucially reduce the burden of switching banks or utility providers. The Grattan Institute report highlights that while market concentration can lead to excess profit-taking by firms, this mostly occurs in industries where the barriers to entry – either due to cost or the nature of the business – are high. In such cases the government needs to ensure firms are not taking advantage of consumers, but the report also makes clear that while firms have too much market power in a few industries, overall Australia’s economy is little different from most nations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/04/doesnt-make-sense-incredulity-trumps-lawyer-john-dowd-take-blame-for-flynn-tweet","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T12:41:57Z","webTitle":"'I feel badly for General Flynn': Trump sympathizes with disgraced former aide","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/04/doesnt-make-sense-incredulity-trumps-lawyer-john-dowd-take-blame-for-flynn-tweet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/04/doesnt-make-sense-incredulity-trumps-lawyer-john-dowd-take-blame-for-flynn-tweet","fields":{"headline":"'I feel badly for General Flynn': Trump sympathizes with disgraced former aide","bodyText":"Donald Trump said on Monday he “feels badly” for his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty last week to lying to the FBI, and claimed without evidence that Hillary Clinton “lied many times” to the agency without consequences. The president spoke after John Dowd, a lawyer who sought to take the blame for a Trump tweet which analysts said indicated the president was guilty of obstruction of justice over Flynn’s firing, offered a new defence of Trump’s actions: the president cannot obstruct justice. Trump’s remarks to reporters before a trip to Utah were the latest in a series of outbursts over the investigation into his campaign’s alleged collusion with Russia, after Flynn’s guilty plea and admission that he is cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller. “I feel badly for General Flynn,” the president said. “I feel very badly. He’s led a very strong life, and I feel very badly about it. I will say this: Hillary Clinton lied many times to the FBI and nothing happened to her. Flynn lied, and it destroyed his life, and I think it’s a shame.” Trump added: “Hillary Clinton on 4 July weekend went to the FBI, not under oath – it was the most incredible thing anyone has ever seen – lied many times, nothing happened to her. Flynn lied, and it’s like – it ruined his life. It’s very unfair.” Trump did not provide details about his accusation against Clinton, who answered FBI questions in July 2016 about her use of a private server while she was secretary of state. The FBI never asserted that Clinton made false statements. Flynn, a retired general who was a senior adviser in Trump’s campaign and his first national security adviser, has pledged to cooperate with Mueller’s investigation into whether Trump’s associates coordinated with Russian efforts to sway last year’s election in the Republican’s favour. As part of the deal, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, during the presidential transition. Experts told the Guardian the wording of his plea agreement suggested he may already have been wearing a wire or recording conversations with other figures in the investigation. Trump took aim at the FBI over the weekend, accusing it of bias in favour of Clinton during its investigation of her, which resulted in criticism but no charges. He questioned the direction of the agency and wrote that after director James Comey, whom Trump fired in May, the FBI’s reputation is “in Tatters worst in History!” He vowed to “bring it back to greatness”. Flynn was forced to resign in February after it emerged that he misled vice-president Mike Pence over discussions with Kislyak about sanctions on Russia. Trump said in a tweet on Saturday that he fired Flynn “because he lied to the vice-president and the FBI” about his conversations with the ambassador last December. The tweet could signal the president took part in the obstruction of justice. If Trump did fire Flynn for lying to the FBI, that would mean the president knew Flynn had committed a serious crime when, according to the Comey, the president asked Comey the next day to halt an FBI investigation into Flynn. Dowd, the lawyer who said he had written the tweet, told Axios on Monday: “The president cannot obstruct justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer under [the constitution’s article II] and has every right to express his view of any case.” Any suggestion the Trump tweet had admitted obstruction of justice, whoever wrote it, would he said be “an ignorant and arrogant assertion”. Bob Bauer, a New York University law professor and former White House counsel to Barack Obama, was quoted by Axios as saying: “It is certainly possible for a president to obstruct justice. “The case for immunity has its adherents, but they based their position largely on the consideration that a president subject to prosecution would be unable to perform the duties of the office, a result that they see as constitutionally intolerable.” In his original attempt to contain the fallout from the Saturday tweet, Dowd told Reuters “the mistake was I should have put the lying to the FBI in a separate line referencing his plea. Instead, I put it together and it made all you guys go crazy. A tweet is a shorthand.” Dowd said the first time the president knew for a fact Flynn lied to the FBI was when he was charged. It was the first and last time he would craft a tweet for the president, he said. “I’ll take responsibility,” he said. “I’m sorry I misled people.” Talking to NBC, he added: “I’m out of the tweeting business. I did not mean to break news.” The suggestion that Dowd wrote the tweet was met with incredulity by Democrats and legal experts. Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor, wrote: “Anyone who buys Trump’s lawyer’s alibi for his corruptly treacherous client is a complete fool.” Richard Painter, chief ethics lawyer in the White House of George W Bush, said: “A lawyer who writes a tweet like that incriminating a client should be disbarred. He can tell Mueller he wrote it.” To some critics, Dowd’s denial that the president can obstruct justice carried echoes of Richard Nixon’s assertion, to David Frost in 1977, that “when the president does it, that means it is not illegal”. Others pointed out that the articles of impeachment against Nixon opened with the charge that he “obstructed, and impeded the administration of justice”. The White House has yet to comment. Trump denies that he pressured Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, told reporters on Monday it was “absurd” to suggest that Flynn’s conversation with the ambassador could have influenced Putin’s thinking."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/04/coalition-considering-all-options-to-cut-university-spending-birmingham-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T05:15:43Z","webTitle":"Coalition 'considering all options' to cut university spending, Birmingham says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/04/coalition-considering-all-options-to-cut-university-spending-birmingham-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/04/coalition-considering-all-options-to-cut-university-spending-birmingham-says","fields":{"headline":"Coalition 'considering all options' to cut university spending, Birmingham says","bodyText":"The education minister, Simon Birmingham, is “considering all options” to trim higher education spending amid reports high-end research funding and programs for disadvantaged students could go if the government is unable to pass the $2.8bn in funding cuts that are stalled in the Senate. The government ramped up its war of words with the university sector over changes to tertiary funding, with Fairfax Media reporting the government is targeting non-legislative changes to funding, including axing the Higher Education Participation and Partnerships Program, or Heppp, which helps students from low-income families access university. More worryingly for universities, the government is reportedly also considering a funding freeze for student enrolments at 2017 levels, which would in effect pause the demand-driven funding system. Birmingham did not deny the story on Monday, saying the government was “considering our options for higher education policy” in light of the decision by Labor, the Greens and the Xenophon party to block its budget measures. “Labor, the Greens and Xenophon blocked $2.8bn of budget savings in favour of yet more spending,” he said. “Their unacceptable approach would further grow the taxpayer-funded student debt burden and deliver even faster revenue increases for universities. “It beggars belief that Labor, the Greens and Xenophon parties are unwilling to make even modest reductions in the rate of spending growth, which under our reforms would still increase university funding by 23% over the next four years. “With taxpayer funding to universities having grown at essentially twice the rate of the economy since 2009, it’s fair and reasonable to continue to expect a modest contribution to budget repair.” His comments represent the latest salvo in an increasingly hostile battle over the proposed changes to higher education funding, which are opposed by the university sector. The government’s higher education bill would impose a two-year 2.5% efficiency dividend on universities, lower the Help debt repayment threshold to $42,000 and increase fees by a cumulative total of 7.5% by 2021. It would also introduce performance contingent funding aimed at increasing graduate outcomes. But the opposition from tertiary lobby groups including Universities Australia and the Group of Eight has prompted the minister to ramp up his language on the need for funding reform. In October, he warned that demand-driven funding for the tertiary education system would come under “increasing question and pressure” unless universities focused more on graduate outcomes. Tim Pitman, a higher education researcher from Curtin University, said that while any cut to the Heppp would be “damaging”, the demand-driven system was the “elephant in the room”. “Decades of statistics show that the most surefire way of increasing representation of disadvantaged students is to expand the sector,” he said. He said recent equity statistics show that after a period of the growth in enrolments from students from low socioeconomic background following the introduction of the demand-driven system, the figure was starting to plateau. That meant any change to the system now could send enrolments into reverse. “If the demand-driven system was to be paused the sector would, if not contract, it would stop growing and the first students to take a hit would be those disadvantaged students,” he said. The Universities Australia chief executive, Belinda Robinson, said the threat of non-legislative changes would be “in direct defiance of the will of the Australian people and the parliament”. “Both the public and lawmakers would quite rightly take a dim view of any bid to go around the legislative process for investment in higher education,” she said. “There was a clear message from the Senate on proposed cuts to universities and that was ‘don’t do it’.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/04/aacta-awards-2017-lion-and-alis-wedding-sweep-early-categories","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T06:48:30Z","webTitle":"Aacta awards 2017: Lion and Ali's Wedding sweep early categories","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/04/aacta-awards-2017-lion-and-alis-wedding-sweep-early-categories","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/04/aacta-awards-2017-lion-and-alis-wedding-sweep-early-categories","fields":{"headline":"Aacta awards 2017: Lion and Ali's Wedding sweep early categories","bodyText":"The internationally acclaimed film Lion has swept the early prizes of Australia’s biggest film and TV awards, winning seven of eight feature film categories at the industry luncheon on Monday, before the main award announcements on Wednesday. The spectre of sexual harassment allegations in the industry loomed over the luncheon, which was held two days after Geoffrey Rush stepped down as president of the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts. Last week, the Sydney Theatre Company revealed to the Daily Telegraph that Rush had been subject to a complaint of “inappropriate behaviour” during a production of King Lear two years ago, an allegation the actor denies. “In the current climate of innuendo and unjustifiable reporting, I believe the decision to make a clean break to clear the air is the best for all concerned,” Rush said when announcing his decision to step down. While no mention of Rush was made on stage at Monday’s event, and the actor didn’t attend, the Aacta CEO, Damian Trewhella, used his opening remarks to draw attention to an upcoming Safer Workplace Strategies event in Sydney organised by Women in Film and Television (Wift). “Health and safety are paramount in a modern Australian screen industry,” Trewhella said, encouraging industry professionals to attend the event. Lion, a co-production between the Weinstein Company and Screen Australia, stars Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman, and tells the true story of a man who used Google Earth to track down his childhood home. It was nominated for six Academy Awards and won two Baftas earlier this year, and on Monday won every category in which it was nominated: for best adapted screenplay, best editing, best cinematography, best sound, best costume design, best original music score and best production design. Lion’s producer, Emile Sherman, told Fairfax in October that it was “incredibly distressing” to learn about the allegations against Harvey Weinstein, whose production company co-produced Lion. “Hopefully, this is a turning point not only in our industry but also for men in power in general,” he said. The only remaining category for a feature film, best original screenplay, was won by Osamah Sami and Andrew Knight for Ali’s Wedding. “It means nothing and it means everything,” Sami said after winning the award, paying tribute to his father who died after a trip abroad with Sami four years ago. “That trip was me winning everything, so nothing will ever come anywhere close. I would swap 10 of these [awards] to spend an hour with him.” Sami is also nominated for the best lead actor award, which will be announced at the main event on Wednesday night. Monday’s luncheon also covered awards in the television industry, which were led by Seven Types of Ambiguity, the six-part drama based on the novel by Elliot Perlman. That series won three of the five awards it was nominated for: best direction in a television drama or comedy, best cinematography in television, and best editing. “It’s a great honour for this particular show,” said producer Tony Ayres after accepting the award in lieu of director Glendyn Ivin. “We sweated blood for it. It took a long time in development, it took a long time to get it right.” Bonnie Elliot was named best cinematographer for the series, only the second woman working in TV to win that award, the last being Mandy Walker in 1996 for Parklands. “It’s been a slow process for us getting here,” said Elliot, who also said she explicitly aims for gender parity among her camera crew. “As Mandy Walker inspired me I hope to inspire other women to get behind the lens.” She was not the only female cinematographer awarded on Monday: Jody Muston took the best cinematography gong for documentary, for Blue, with Jon Shaw. No women have ever won the award for best cinematography in film. Another television adaptation, Wake in Fright, took out the awards for best sound and best original score for what composers Antony Partos and Matteo Zingales called a “visceral, psychological score; it combined a lot of recorded elements and was quite experimental in some degree”. Partos said the score was designed to give an insight into the protagonist’s state of mind. In the documentary section, the Brett Whiteley documentary, Whiteley, took out four of the five awards it was nominated for, including best direction, best editing, best original music score and best sound. Cleverman took home the best hair and makeup award for television for the second year in a row, and War on Waste won best documentary television program. Utopia won best TV comedy series for the second time, while Casting JonBenét won best feature film documentary. Kitty Green, director of Casting JonBenét, said she hoped her win would inspire other young women to push for recognition in the industry. “People take one look at you and assume you don’t know what you’re doing,” she said. “You come up against that [resistance] a lot and eventually what I did was put my head down and made my own stuff.” The Aactas also introduced a new best online video or series category this year, which was won by RackaRacka, a YouTube channel run by 24-year-old Adelaide twins Danny and Michael Philippou, known for their bizarre battle videos, one of which recently included a lightsaber combat sequence in a supermarket car park. Other winners included Little Lunch for best children’s television series and Australian Survivor for best direction in a television light entertainment, lifestyle or reality series."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2017/dec/04/retailer-to-sell-food-past-its-best-before-date-in-bid-to-cut-waste","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T10:55:28Z","webTitle":"Co-op to sell food past its 'best before' date in bid to cut waste","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/04/retailer-to-sell-food-past-its-best-before-date-in-bid-to-cut-waste","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/dec/04/retailer-to-sell-food-past-its-best-before-date-in-bid-to-cut-waste","fields":{"headline":"Co-op to sell food past its 'best before' date in bid to cut waste","bodyText":"A major retailer has become the first to start selling food that is past its “best before” date in a drive to reduce food waste. From this week, the East of England Co-op – the biggest independent retailer in East Anglia – will sell tinned goods and dried food such as pasta, crisps and rice for a nominal 10p once they reach their best-before date. The offer will not apply to fresh and perishable foods, however, which carry a “use by” date indicating when a product is safe to eat. The move by the retailer, which is independent of the Co-operative Group, follows a three-month trial in 14 stores that found that the 10p items generally sold within hours of being reduced. Despite concerted efforts to reduce food waste through the entire supply chain, the government’s waste advisory body, Wrap, says £13bn-worth of edible food is thrown out in Britain every year. Wrap is overseeing a major simplification of labelling with consumers often unaware of the difference between a use-by and a best-before date. The East of England Co-op hopes to save at least two tonnes of food from being wasted annually with the initiative. As part of the Co-op Guide to Dating campaign, shoppers will be told “Don’t be a binner, have it for dinner!” and “It’s not nice to get dumped”. “We are committed to reducing waste in our business and the Co-op Guide to Dating is one of many initiatives we have instigated to make the East of England Co-op as efficient as possible, reducing our impact on the environment,” said Roger Grosvenor, the company’s joint chief executive and head of its retail division. “During our trial we found our 10p items went within hours of being reduced, sometimes quicker,” said Grosvenor. “The vast majority of our customers understand they are fine to eat and appreciate the opportunity to make a significant saving on some of their favourite products. This is not a money-making exercise, but a sensible move to reduce food waste and keep edible food in the food chain. By selling perfectly edible food we can save 50,000-plus items every year which would otherwise have gone to waste.” The Food Standards Agency advises that products past their best-before date are safe to eat but may not be at the optimum quality intended by the producer. The products will remain on sale for a month past their best-before date. The East of England Co-op has also launched a new “reduced to clear” policy, offering bigger discounts earlier in the day on foods nearing their use-by dates. The 10p discounted food cannot be donated to charities such as food banks as they do not accept items past their best-before dates."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/03/thousands-protest-in-honduras-in-chaos-over-contested-presidential-election","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T22:27:30Z","webTitle":"Thousands protest in Honduras in chaos over contested presidential election","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/03/thousands-protest-in-honduras-in-chaos-over-contested-presidential-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/03/thousands-protest-in-honduras-in-chaos-over-contested-presidential-election","fields":{"headline":"Thousands protest in Honduras in chaos over contested presidential election","bodyText":"Tens of thousands took to the streets across Honduras on Sunday, demanding a new president and an end to a week-long election debacle which has plunged the volatile country into its worst political crisis since a coup in 2009. “Out with JOH” was the unifying chant, sung by protesters who accuse Juan Orlando Hernández of meddling with the vote count in order to deny victory to the opposition Alliance leader, Salvador Nasralla. The country’s beleaguered electoral commission (TSE) made a long-awaited announcement on how it plans to resolve the crisis just as the marches got under way. After a week of delays, negotiations and accusations of bias and incompetence, the chief magistrate of the TSE, which is controlled by the ruling National party, announced that the election winner would be declared after a recount of just 1,000 suspicious voting tallies. The Alliance, which has a list of 11 demands it believes are necessary to ensure a fair and transparent vote count, slammed the decision as inadequate and said it would not attend the recount or accept the results. As the news spread, protesters grew louder, blowing horns and throwing firecrackers. “The latest decision is one of a conglomerate of actions during the electoral process that we refuse to recognise … we won’t permit allow this to happen, just like we won’t allow another Hernández government,” said Dina, 34, an anthropologist marching in Tegucigalpa. Some protesters wanted fresh elections. “We need new elections so the people know who really won … the constitution doesn’t allow it but now maybe the constitution doesn’t matter at all,” said Freddy, 26, an industrial engineering student. In the capital, protesters were blocked from the presidential residence by soldiers. Demonstrators carrying white flowers to signify peace marched to the vote-counting centre (Infop) singing pro-Nasralla and anti-Hernández songs. Watched by rows of navy, army and police officers carrying riot shields, Nasralla climbed on to a truck to read to the crowd a letter that was delivered to the TSE, rejecting its latest decision. From the country’s second city, San Pedro Sula, Jesuit human rights leader Ismael Moreno, known as Padre Melo, told the Guardian the TSE decision could lead to mayhem. “Unless there is a tally by tally count, any announcement by the TSE will not be credible,” he said. “If Juan Orlando Hernández is declared the president-elect in these conditions, the situation will get out if control.” Eight deaths have been linked to election unrest reported by local media. Scores more are feared to have been injured and detained. On Saturday night, the deafening sound of households banging on pots and pans blared out across Tegucigalpa, as part of an organised act of defiance against a curfew which the president says was requested by business and church groups worried about looting. The government has ordered security forces to arrest anyone breaching the 6pm to 6am curfew, including journalists, and suspended constitutional rights for 10 days. The opposition and human rights groups say peaceful protests may have been infiltrated by criminals and government-aligned provocateurs. Civil liberty lawyers are preparing to challenge the legality of the curfew – which was signed by the vice-president, not the president – in the supreme court. The judiciary, like congress and the armed forces, is controlled by the National party."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2017/dec/04/markets-rally-trump-tax-reform-brexit-uk-construction-pound-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T21:25:52Z","webTitle":"US stock market hits record high after Trump tax bill success - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/dec/04/markets-rally-trump-tax-reform-brexit-uk-construction-pound-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2017/dec/04/markets-rally-trump-tax-reform-brexit-uk-construction-pound-business-live","fields":{"headline":"US stock market hits record high after Trump tax bill success - as it happened","bodyText":"So, not the most convincing rally we’ve ever seen. And who can blame traders? There’s plenty of reasons to be cautious, frankly - the stalling Brexit talks, the Michael Flynn situation, and the ongoing North Korean tensions for starters. Plus the fact that stock valuations do look a little high..... So we’ll find out tomorrow whether the Trump bump continues, or if markets take a breather. Until then, goodnight, and thanks for reading. GW NEWSFLASH! America’s Dow Jones industrial average has closed at a new record high, thanks to optimism over Donald Trump’s tax reforms. But....the rally did threaten to fizzle out. In the end, the Dow only gained around 58 points to 24,290 - a gain of 0.25%. That takes the blue-chip index to a new closing peak, extending the rally sine Trump won the US presidential election 13 months ago. Tech stocks had a bad day, dragging the Nasdaq down. The S&amp;P 500 also lost its early sparkle, and closed a little lower. Traders may have decided to ‘sell the news’ and bank profits, especially with other issues swirling over the White House.... Now this wasn’t in the script. With 15 minutes to go, the rally is running out of puff. The S&amp;P 500 is now pretty-much flat, and the Dow is shedding some of its gains too - now up just 0.3%. The tech selloff seems to be responsible. Technology stocks are still refusing to join the rally. The tech-focused Nasdaq index is down almost 1% today, partly due to big names like PayPal (down 5.8%), Adobe (down 5.6%) and NVIDIA (down 5.1%). The chatter on Wall Street is that investors are moving out of tech, and into financial stocks, consumer-focused companies and industrial companies today. With around 90 minutes trading to go, the Dow Jones industrial average is toying with a new closing high. The Dow is up 160 points at 24,391, as traders keep giving the tax reforms push a thumbs-up (despite the reservations we’ve already flagged up). Disney is the top riser, up almost 5%. That’s due to reports that talks have resumed with Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox to buy some of Fox’s entertainment assets. Boeing are next on the Dow risers chart, up 3%, followed by chemicals giant DowDuPont (+2.6%) and JPMorgan Chase (+2.5%). Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, isn’t terribly impressed by today’s stock market rally. It’s all so terribly short term, he writes... Once the sugar rush fades, expect investors question the long-term economic benefits of cutting corporate taxes. If investors truly believed that the US economy was now set on a course towards higher growth, you would expect a reaction in the market for US government debt. Investors might start to predict higher inflation, for example. But that is not happening. Instead, short-dated and long-dated US Treasury stocks are trading at very similar yields, which traditionally signals economic trouble ahead. Funnily enough, Trump never tweets about that. Here’s Nils’ column: The US stock market rally could head even higher, if the two houses of Congress can agree a final tax bill. Mike Bell of JP Morgan believes the tax trade has more legs, adding (via the FT): We estimate that the market is only pricing in about a 50% probability of tax cuts and that if a tax plan is finalised this would push US equities higher. The Dow Jones continues to enjoy a good day, up around 200 points at 24,430. Financial stocks are still leading the charge, up 1.7%. But tech stocks aren’t coming to the party. Facebook and Google are both down 0.5% while Microsoft has shed 2%. European stock markets have closed higher tonight, led by Germany: The eurozone’s finance ministers have elected a new leader - Portugal’s Mario Centeno. So his predecessor Jeroen Dijsselbloem really did give the game away earlier when he described Centeno as his successor, before the vote had even taken place..... It’s official - no Brexit breakthrough today. The pound is now dropping back, after DUP leader (and Theresa May ally) Arlene Foster warned that her party wouldn’t accept any regulatory divergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. That could be a spanner in the works for May’s Brexit breakthrough..... It has nudged sterling back below $1.35, and wiping out most of today’s gains. Wall Street investors are hoping that a final tax deal can be done soon (ironing out differences between the Senate and the House of Representatives). Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab, explains (via Marketwatch): “Getting the tax plan done will still be a challenge, but it doesn’t seem as impossible as it once did, and now there’s optimism that it could happen before the end of the year, which means it could be made retroactive and change the liability for companies and individuals for this year as well as next, which would be a positive. Here’s a sobering thought. Former Treasury secretary Larry Summers has predicted that thousands of Americans will die early, if the tax changes approved by the Senate go through. CNBC has the details: About 10,000 Americans will die every year from lack of health coverage if the tax reform bill goes through as proposed, Larry Summers, the former Treasury secretary and White House economic advisor under Barack Obama, said Monday. Citing studies on what happens to people who go from being insured to uninsured, Summers said the estimate is likely conservative. “I think this bill is very dangerous,” he said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” program. “When people lose health insurance, they’re less likely to get preventive care, they’re more likely to defer health care they need, and ultimately they’re more likely to die.” Reports are coming through that the Eurogroup has approved the policy package agreed over the weekend by Athens and its creditors. The county’s leading daily, Kathimerini, says Euro group chairman, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, welcomed the deal ahead of the meeting telling the assembled media “it was exceptional” it had been agreed in time. The deal paves the way to Greece receiving fresh rescue funds from its current and third international bailout pushing the country inexorably towards self-finance when the €86bn rescue programme officially expires next August. Stocks are racing higher in New York, as traders cheer the US Senate’s tax vote. The Dow Jones has now gained an impressive 300 points, or 1.2%, to 24,532. That shows that Wall Street is applauding the prospect of corporation tax being cut from 35% to around 20%. Walt Disney is the biggest gainer, up 3.8% (readers should insert their own joke about the financial markets being a Mickey Mouse operation). Aeroplane maker Boeing are up 3.3%, with financial stocks and basic materials companies also having a good day. Before we get carried away, let’s remember that barely half of all Americans own stocks (either individual shares or through retirement accounts). Inevitably, they will be the wealthier members of society -- who are also in the front line to benefit from Trump’s tax changes (as this charts showed). Gallup reported earlier this year that stock ownership has contracted since the financial crisis, especially among younger and less-wealthy Americans. But share ownership has held firm among Adults aged 65 and older and those with an annual household income of at least $100,000. Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average has hit a fresh record high in early trading. The Dow jumped by 244 points to 24,475, a gain of around 1%, as New York traders applaud the prospect of tax reform legislation hitting the statute book. The S&amp;P 500, which tracks a broader group of US companies, is also at record levels. Arnaud Masset of Swissquote bank says corporate America approves of Trump’s efforts: Tax reform is popular with US businesses. The proposed law could reduce corporate tax rates to 20% (compared to 35% currently) and cut individual taxes too. Today, the honour of ringing the Wall Street opening bell goes to Groupon, the deals website.... There’s quite a festive mood on Wall Street today, partly thanks to the impressive Christmas tree outside the New York Stock Exchange. New York traders should prepare for a lively opening, when trading begins on Wall Street in 30 minutes. A fresh record high looks nailed on, following the Senate’s tax approval vote. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explain: The Dow Jones is set to strap a rocket to its back after the bell, with the futures pointing to a 220 point surge. That’d leave the Dow at – what else – a fresh all time high of around 24450, already making last Friday’s FBI-revelations inspired panic a distant memory. The pound has now hit a six-month high against a basket of currencies. Elsewhere in Brussels, eurozone finance ministers are gathering for a eurogroup meeting. They’ll be electing their next president, to succeed Jeroen Dijsselbloem. Officially it’s a close contest, with four candidates throwing their caps into the ring: Although, the chat may be out of the sac.... It could also be a big day for Greece, with the leftist-led government presenting the deal it has reached in ongoing bailout negotiations with creditor. Athens officials hope for a warm reception from the euro group, marking the beginning of the end of international surveillance for debt-stricken Greece. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: With a compliance review completed in record time over the weekend, the Greek finance minister Euclid Tskakalotos will present the deal (referred to as staff level agreement) to euro area finance ministers today. The policy package, a key part of the country’s third bailout programme review, must be approved by the euro group before another tranche of aid worth €5bn can be released to Greece. If rubber-stamped today – less than two months after talks began - the disbursement could be made in January. “Although a lot of the measures are sensitive the real news is that the agreement was concluded in record time,” said one insider. “It is recognised that we are committed to exiting the [bailout] programme.” It’s not all plain sailing. Under the deal, which covered issues ranging from energy and labour market reforms, bad loans and privatisations and tax measures, Greece will have to implement around 100 ‘prior actions’ or reforms by January. The demand that Athens presses ahead with more foreclosures – a necessary evil if banks are to deal with the highest non-performing loan ratio in the euro zone – is particularly sensitive. Many Greeks, unable to keep up with bank payments, fear they could lose their homes. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras’ government is especially keen to wrap up the review (and negotiations more generally with creditors) so it can exit the €86bn bailout programme, the country’s third, next summer. Only one more bailout review remains and once that is concluded debt relief talks can begin. The government is betting on debt relief helping it win a fresh term in office (despite lagging drastically in the polls). Here’s a neat chart, showing how morale in Britain’s construction and manufacturing sectors picked up in November. Tomorrow we discover if the service sector also had a good month. The pound has now hit a one-month high against the euro, at €1.1415, thanks to those reports of a deal over the Irish border. Hamish Muress, currency analyst at OFX, says investors are hoping for a significant Brexit breakthrough: “It is understood that Prime Minister Theresa May has conceded ground to the EU around the Irish border and the final divorce bill for leaving the EU, which have been sticking points for both sides for months. Despite the fine details of a draft agreement unlikely to be resolved until next week, the pound will be buoyed by the news that, for the time being, it looks like the EU will vote in favour of progressing talks to the next phase.” But.... there’s confusion over whether Britain is really offering “no divergence” on regulations, as some MEPs said, or simply “continued regulatory compliance”. The final decision will be crucial. The Guardian’s Business Today email has expanded its property coverage.

For your morning shot of financial and property news, sign up here: The president is up, and predicting a Wall Street rally today: Sterling is pushing higher against the euro and the US dollar, following reports that Britain and the EU are close to a breakthrough. After a slow start, the pound is now up half a cent against the dollar at $1.352. Against the euro, it’s gained three-quarters of a eurocent at €1.14. It follows reports that Britain has made a key concession over the Irish border. According to MEPs, the UK has offered no divergence between Northern Ireland the Republic over single market and customs union rules. Irish broadcaster RTE says it would have “far-reaching implications”. But it’s not clear that Northern Ireland’s DUP party would accept it -- which is significant, as they’re currently propping up Theresa May’s government. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is tracking all the action in his Politics Live blog: The loudest complaint against Trump’s tax ‘reforms’ is that the richest Americans will benefit the most. And yesterday, the bi-partisan Congressional Budget Office showed very clearly that this is true: Economics professor Nouriel Roubini is concerned that the US budget deficit could spiral to $1 trillion by the end of the decade, thanks to Donald Trump’s tax shake-up. He fears it will precede a squeeze on government spending, potentially hurting welfare spending. Economics lecturer Stephen Kinsella of Ireland’s University of Limerick agrees that the fiscal axe will soon fall on US government spending. A bit of work still needs to be done before Donald Trump can sign off a tax reform bill. That’s because the Senate and the House of Representatives (America’s upper and lower chambers) have both passed different legislation. The two versions now need to be merged, starting today - creating an opportunity for lawmakers to raise objections. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: It is by no means a done deal given that the Senate bill is different to the one passed by Congress in November which means any final version is likely to be revised, and then passed by both houses, before being sent for signature by the President. What is unlikely to change are the headline numbers, which means that we can expect to see the corporation tax rate number reduced substantially from its current 35% to as low as 20%. After a stellar year, world stock markets are closing in on a new record -- $100 trillion! Over in New York, Wall Street traders will be waking up to predictions of another record-breaking open in four hours time. The Dow Jones industrial average is forecast to jump by over 200 points, following the Senate’s approval of US tax reforms over the weekend. It means the long rally since Trump’s shock election win will continue.... Barbara Kollmeyer of Marketwatch puts it: The gains came as investors shifted their focus away from political tensions in Washington and cheered weekend news that Senate Republicans passed a sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax code..... Hopes that the Trump administration and Republicans would usher in a business-friendly tax overhaul have been a driver for the stock market’s record-setting streak over the past year. The House and Senate now must agree on a single tax bill before it can be sent to Trump to sign. Blane Perrotton, managing director of the national surveyors Naismiths, says UK housebuilders are feeling more upbeat. “After the Autumn Budget, developers feel like they have the Government behind them and that is further boosting confidence and activity levels. “Residential development is certainly the most active it has been since before the Global Financial Crisis. “On the frontline we’re seeing a huge amount of activity, especially among small and mid-sized developers, who are making the most of the vastly increased finance options available. This jump in the UK’s construction PMI is a little surprising, says Max Jones of Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. Jones reckons confidence among builders is quite ‘brittle, adding: “Anecdotal feedback indicates that margins are coming under pressure with competition increasing amid the ongoing economic uncertainty. Larger firms also feel caught in the middle between clients pushing for fixed-price contracts and investors hungry for fatter margins. Construction bosses are also worried that the might struggle to find enough skilled labour after Brexit, Jones adds - although others are keen to invest in their UK workforce. Breaking: Britain’s construction sector grew at its fastest rate in five months in November. Markit’s latest PMI survey shows that housebuilding picked up last month, bringing some relief to Britain’s builders after an autumn slowdown. That pushed the construction PMI up to 53.1, up from October’s 50.8. Any reading over 50 shows growth, so this is an encouraging signal. Here are the key findings: Residential work drives modest construction rebound in November Commercial and civil engineering activity continue to decline Business optimism picks up from October’s near five-year low Tim Moore, Associate Director at IHS Markit, blames political uncertainty for the slowdown in commercial construction activity and civil engineering work: “UK construction companies experienced a solid yet uneven improvement in business conditions during November. Once again, resilient house building growth helped to offset lower volumes of commercial work and civil engineering activity. “Survey respondents noted that residential projects underpinned the rebound in total new order growth to its strongest since June, helped by strong demand fundamentals and a supportive policy backdrop. “Construction firms reported that heightened economic and political uncertainty continued to hold back commercial development activity. The latest drop in civil engineering was linked to a recent lack of tender opportunities for infrastructure-related projects. Trump’s push to cut America’s corporation from 35% to 20% could encourage US companies to repatriate some of their immense overseas cash piles. Fortune Magazine says this is a victory for tech giants, who have lobbied hard on this issue: Tech companies like Apple and Microsoft have for a long time balked at the 35% corporate tax the current tax code requires them to pay on worldwide profits returned to the U.S. To avoid paying, the companies have parked as much of their profit as possible in overseas subsidiaries in countries like Bermuda and Ireland, where tax rates are low. The Big 5 tech companies–Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft–currently have a combined $457 billion held in overseas subsidiaries. Apple holds more profits overseas than any other company, with Microsoft not far behind.

Rebecca O’Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, explains: “European markets are playing catch up after closing at the depths of the Friday market meltdown on Michael Flynn concerns and embracing the weekend’s senate tax bill success. The pro-business tax cuts look set to boost US economic growth and have provided further impetus for US and global valuations. Every sector of the FTSE 100 is up this morning. Multinational equipment rental firm Ashtead Group is leading the way, up 3.5%, followed by cruise company Carnival and plumbing and heating firm Ferguson. Ashtead and Ferguson both have big operations in America, so would benefit if Trump’s tax reforms do deliver a growth burst. All the major European stock markets are up this morning, after the US Senate approved the tax reform package over the weekend. The German DAX is leading the charge, up over 1%, with Britain’s FTSE 100 and the French CAC close behind. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says: The U.S. Senate’s approval to pass the tax cut bill on Saturday overshadowed the continuing investigation into connections between U.S. President’s inner circle and Russia. The US dollar has jumped by 0.5% against a basket of currencies this morning, reports Reuters. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets in Europe and America are set to rally today, after Donald Trump took a massive step towards shaking up the US tax system. In Trump’s first legislative triumph, the Senate finally passed the president’s long-awaited tax reform bill. The move means the president can look forward to signing off a final bill on tax reform soon. The reforms include a hefty cut to US corporation tax, down from 35% to 20%, bringing America into line with other advanced economies. There are also sweeping changes to individual tax rates - which Trump claims will make people “very, very happy’. But...the “once-in-a-lifetime” plan to cut taxes for “average Americans” has been criticised by experts who say it’s a shameless giveaway of wealth to the richest 1%. Republicans claim that the $1.4tn package of cuts can be funded through growth; but an independent committee found it could add $1 trillion to the national debt. Democrats, though, slammed the changes as a giveaway to corporate America and the wealthy. Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, declared: “In the waning hours, this bill is tilting further towards businesses and away from families. “Every time the choice is between corporations and families, the Republicans choose corporations.” But the financial world is welcoming the Senate vote, despite the pressure building on the White House over links with Russia. Today, Wall Street is tipped to open strongly, possibly driving the Dow Jones to a new all-time high. The FTSE 100 has already reacted, jumping by 60 points to 7360 at the start of trading in London. But sterling is under pressure this morning as Theresa May heads to Brussels for crunch talks with the EU. The pound has shed almost half a cent at $1.343, amid reports that London and Dublin haven’t (yet) reached an agreement on the Irish border. As my colleague Lisa O’Carroll reported last night: Theresa May and the Irish government have failed to reach a deal on the crucial Brexit issue of the Northern Ireland border ahead of a crunch meeting on Monday lunchtime with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. Despite intense efforts over the weekend to agree a proposal on how to avoid a hard border in Ireland, Irish officials revealed at midnight on Sunday that “there is still a way to go” to achieve a meeting of minds on the issue. But there could be plenty of drama in Brussels, as Britain pushes for a breakthrough that would pave the way for trade talks. Also coming up today, we get a new health check on Britain’s builders (who have been struggling in recent months) plus the latest eurozone investor confidence index and US factory orders figures.

We must act now","bodyText":"Our collective minds are stuck on this idea that talking about food’s environmental impact risks taking something very intimate away from us. In fact it’s just the opposite. Reconsidering how we eat offers us hope, and empowers us with choice over what our future planet will look like. And we can ask our local leaders – from city mayors to school district boards to hospital management – to help, by widening our food options. On Monday and Tuesday, the city of Chicago is hosting a summit for the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy to discuss climate solutions cities can undertake. Strategies to address and lower food’s impact should be front and center. Animal agriculture is choking the Earth, and the longer we turn a blind eye, the more we limit our ability to nourish ourselves, protect waterways and habitats, and pursue other uses of our precious natural resources. Raising livestock for meat, eggs and milk generates 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, the second highest source of emissions and greater than all transportation combined. It also uses about 70% of agricultural land, and is one of the leading causes of deforestation, biodiversity loss, and water pollution. On top of this, eating too much meat and dairy is making us sick, greatly increasing our risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, several major cancers (including breast, liver and prostate) and obesity. Diets optimal for human health vary, according to David Katz, of the Yale University Prevention Research Center, “but all of them are made up mostly of whole, wholesome plant foods”. So what gives? Why can’t we see the forest for the bacon? The truth can be hard to swallow: that we simply need less meat and dairy and more plant-based options in our food system if we’re to reach our climate goals. This can start with individual action. Five years ago, our family felt hopeless about climate change, and helpless to make meaningful change. But when we connected the dots on animal agriculture’s impact on the environment, coupled with the truth about nutrition, we took heart because it gave us something we could actually do. To create change at the scale needed, this will take more than individual choice – we need to get climate leaders on board about the impact of food. Cities and counties have used their buying power to transition fleets from diesel to electric, and we need to do the same with how we purchase food. We have done this in our own community, moving the lunch program of Muse School, in Calabasas, California, and the Avatar movie set to plant-based menus. Scaling up initiatives like these can make a big difference: if the US reduced meat consumption by 50%, it’s the equivalent of taking 26 million cars off the road. We think that’s damn hopeful. Decision-makers on all levels can make it easier for us to eat better, by expanding access to food options that are good for our health, affordable, and climate-friendly. Nationwide, cities and school districts have adopted food purchasing policies that include environment, health and fair labor standards. The city of Chicago is a recent adopter of this Good Food Purchasing Program, and so the solutions-focus of the summit is the perfect place to discuss how food can move us toward climate goals. In the same breath that we discuss fossil fuels, we should be talking animal ag, or we’re missing a big part of the problem – and a big part of the solution. Yes, food is inherently personal. It’s the cornerstone of holidays, it fuels high school athletes and long workdays, and it nourishes nursing mothers and growing children. And yes, Americans love meat and cheese. But more than that, we love our majestic national parks, family beach vacations and clean air and water for our children and grandchildren. As individuals, we can make choices on how to better nourish our families, and as citizens, we can encourage local leaders to make choices that will allow us to enjoy our land and natural resources now and in the future. • James Cameron is a film-maker and deep-sea explorer.

Writing in the New York Times on Sunday, the television host says: “Of course he said it.” Bush, who was recorded listening to Trump making lewd comments about grabbing women “by the pussy”, said that recent reports that the US president was denying the remarks “hit a raw nerve in me”. He also said that he believed at the time that Trump’s remarks were “a crass standup act ... Surely, we thought, none of this was real”. Bush added that after reading the accounts of many of the nearly 20 women who accused Trump of sexual misconduct, he now believes “the ‘grab ’em by the pussy’ routine [was] real.” The tape, which was published by the Washington Post on 7 October 2016 sent shockwaves through American politics. In addition to boasting about grabbing female genitalia, Trump said “when you’re a star they let you do it. You can do anything”. Although a number of major Republican figures withdrew their support for Trump after the tape was published, he managed to overcome the revelations and win the presidency despite losing the popular vote. Although Trump apologized for his remarks at the time, there have since been several reports that he has told others that he doesn’t believe the tape is real. The New York Times op-ed marks a rare return to the spotlight for Bush, who was fired from his position as a co-host at the Today Show after the tape was released in October 2016. He has since left the public eye and has taken up pursuits such as yoga and meditation. Bush is also scheduled to be interviewed by late-night talk show host Stephen Colbert on Monday. His intervention comes at a moment where there has been increased focus on allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct. A number of prominent men in politics, media and the arts have faced significant allegations including producer Harvey Weinstein, actor Kevin Spacey and television host Matt Lauer. The White House stood by its position that all of the women who have accused Trump of misconduct were lying. Trump also backed the candidacy of Roy Moore for Senate in Alabama, who is facing several credible allegations of sexual assault against teenage girls from the 1970s."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/04/principals-urged-to-throw-one-nation-senators-anti-islamic-letters-in-recycling-bin","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T04:05:28Z","webTitle":"Minister tells principals to throw One Nation senator's anti-Islam letters in the bin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/04/principals-urged-to-throw-one-nation-senators-anti-islamic-letters-in-recycling-bin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/04/principals-urged-to-throw-one-nation-senators-anti-islamic-letters-in-recycling-bin","fields":{"headline":"Minister tells principals to throw One Nation senator's anti-Islam letters in the bin","bodyText":"The New South Wales education minister, Rob Stokes, has urged school principals to throw anti-Islamic letters from One Nation in the nearest recycling bin, saying “perhaps then some good may still come from it”. Stokes is the latest to denounce One Nation senator Brian Burston for letters he sent to NSW schools last week, warning principals their children risked becoming “terror-endorsing Islamists” whose religion required the killing of westerners. The letters, obtained by Guardian Australia, drew immediate condemnation for their wild inaccuracies, divisiveness and tendency to incite hatred against Muslims. Stokes condemned Burston’s letter as “hate mail”. He said it ran contrary to two hallmarks of western liberal civilisation Burston purported to protect: tolerance and inclusion. “I strongly suggest to principals that they place all correspondence from the One Nation senator in the nearest recycling bin when it arrives,” Stokes said. “Perhaps then, some good may still come from it.” Burston’s letter claims Islam is incompatible with the Australian way of life, and attaches a brochure titled Islam Exposed. The security and intelligence expert John Blaxland warned the letter would simply serve to fuel the messages of Islamic State and help the terror group’s recruitment efforts. The letter came to the attention of the NSW Greens MP Mehreen Faruqi last week. She has now written to the Australian Human Rights Commission requesting an investigation. “The letter is divisive and offensive and has no place in our communities and schools,” Faruqi wrote. “I am referring this letter to you and would be grateful for your advice as to whether or not the letter breaches any federal human rights laws.” The letter used the Senate letterhead. No reference to One Nation was made. Stokes said the letter was a waste of taxpayer funds, and would not help to deradicalise students. “The best way to suppress the potential for extremism is not to divide us, but to promote the Australian values we all share,” he said. “By celebrating our history and the culture of our country, we want to focus our young minds on values such as upholding democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, equality and mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/05/australias-citizenship-saga-uncovers-gut-wrenching-stories-for-indigenous-mps","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T17:00:12Z","webTitle":"Australia's citizenship saga resurfaces 'legacy of pain' for Indigenous MPs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/05/australias-citizenship-saga-uncovers-gut-wrenching-stories-for-indigenous-mps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/05/australias-citizenship-saga-uncovers-gut-wrenching-stories-for-indigenous-mps","fields":{"headline":"Australia's citizenship saga resurfaces 'legacy of pain' for Indigenous MPs","bodyText":"Requiring Indigenous politicians to prove their Australian citizenship has been an upsetting and anger-inducing process that resurfaced a colonial “legacy of hurt and pain”, two federal parliamentarians have said. Some were unable to say when or where their family members were born because the Australian government never registered the births or recognised them as citizens. Linda Burney, a Wiradjuri woman, was not considered an Australian citizen until she was 10 years old, and in her maiden speech described her experiences of “racism and exclusion”. Being forced to justify her place in Australia again, as the federal parliament sought clarity on everyone’s citizenship status, was “gut-wrenching”, Burney told Guardian Australia. In an attempt to end the continuing parliamentary chaos over breaches of section 44 of the constitution, all parliamentarians have been required to lodge declarations and evidence of their citizenship. The forms request the date and place of birth for parliamentarians, their parents and their grandparents, as well as any evidence required to show any citizenships to other nations were renounced. “I have been made to feel quite angry about what I had to go through to find out about my father and his parents,” said Burney. “The only way that we could find out anything was to go to what was left of the old Aboriginal Protection Board records, and there was a document written by my grandfather to the mission manager on Brungle reserve, requesting permission to build a home. “To go and have to do that, to go to the old Protection Board records, to realise the best they could do was a letter requesting permission to build a roof over their heads, it really stirred up a lot of deep emotions. Some of that was just disgust and an understanding of the way our people were treated.” Burney said she understood there had to be a “circuit breaker” in the citizenship crisis and she hoped this process would achieve it. “Somehow or other this issue needs to be dealt with, intelligently and sensitivity, because I suspect there are people – not just Aboriginal people – who are going to find out some very difficult family histories.” The NT Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy told Guardian Australia there were “moments of outrage” as she sat in her office trying to complete the questionnaire. “Because just a simple act of filling out this document reminded me of how far our country still has to go in recognising First Nations people in our country, and the legacy of previous policies and the impact they still have today,” she said. “It brings up a lot of hurt, the legacy of hurt and pain, because we reflect on very real circumstances on the past that impact on the present.” McCarthy was raised on Yanyuwa country, near Borroloola in the Gulf of Carpentaria, to an Indigenous mother and a father of Irish descent. She is a traditional owner of Yanyuwa land and uniquely has declared as much on the parliamentary registry. “The difficulty for my maternal side of the family is that we don’t know the dates of when my grandparents were born on Yanyuwa country and Garawa country, or even the dates of my mother’s birth, although we’ve always guessed it was around 1950,” she said. “My maternal grandmother we guessed around 1930. “I don’t know [details for] my maternal grandfather and that’s largely because statistics and birth certificates were just not part of the way of Australia and the policies of the time didn’t include us.” McCarthy said she had no concerns about an unknown second citizenship in her background, but added the Labor party’s vetting was strict. Other parties appeared to be more lax. Among those to have been found ineligible is Jacqui Lambie. The former Tasmanian senator is Indigenous, but her father’s Scottish heritage bestowed upon her dual citizenship, overriding her place as a First Nations Australian. Western Australian senator and Yawuru man Pat Dodson declined to be interviewed but in a speech to farewell Lambie he decried the system which “put to one side” her Indigenous heritage. “It’s an absolute tragedy that our constitution was written by all these white folks that never bothered to consider and incorporate the First Peoples in it,” he told the Senate. McCarthy said: “This is what the non-Indigenous men of the day, when they wrote this constitution, this is what they determined for this country. “The question is do we want to change that?” To change it would require a referendum. Referendums are difficult to win – something Malcolm Turnbull recently cited to justify his total rejection of an Indigenous voice to parliament. McCarthy said constitutional recognition of First Nations people must come before any changes to section 44. “If there is a genuine approach to [the concerns of First Nations people], and if First Nations people can see and will believe that, then any steps towards changing the constitution would probably follow suit,” she said. “But until there is a genuine engagement and sincere respect with First Nations people, this will always be something that claws at our country and it won’t matter what politicians will want to do to change it – if they want to change section 44 – because the First Nations people will still be demanding equality.” Labor’s deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, said the process was raising issues “across the board”, including for MPs whose parents fled war-torn countries to come to Australia. Plibersek told ABC Radio National on Tuesday it was “awful” and traumatic for Indigenous MPs, probably more so than for others. “When this [constitution] was written there was no such thing as Australian citizenship, we were subjects of the British empire. It just shows what an anachronism this is. Nevertheless the rule is there and the rule has to apply equally to all.” She said it would cost tens of millions of dollars to hold a referendum and it was much easier to just follow the rules."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/04/us-senator-military-families-should-leave-south-korea-as-threat-of-war-grows","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T04:14:40Z","webTitle":"US senator: military families should leave South Korea as threat of war grows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/04/us-senator-military-families-should-leave-south-korea-as-threat-of-war-grows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/04/us-senator-military-families-should-leave-south-korea-as-threat-of-war-grows","fields":{"headline":"US senator: military families should leave South Korea as threat of war grows","bodyText":"The Republican senator Lindsey Graham has called on the Pentagon to move the families of US military personnel out of South Korea, as a senior Trump administration official warned that the potential for war with North Korea was growing by the day. The South Carolina senator, who is a member of the Senate armed services committee, also opposed sending any more military dependents to South Korea, which hosts 28,500 US soldiers. “It’s crazy to send spouses and children to South Korea, given the provocation of North Korea. South Korea should be an unaccompanied tour,” Graham said on CBS’s Face the Nation. “So, I want them to stop sending dependents, and I think it’s now time to start moving American dependents out of South Korea.” Tensions have risen on the Korean peninsula after more than two months of relative quiet. Last week, North Korea test-fired a powerful intercontinental ballistic missile it claims can strike any city on the US mainland and later declared itself a nuclear state. That test came days after Donald Trump had restored North Korea to Washington’s list of state sponsors of terrorism. On Monday, North Korean media warned that nuclear war could break out “at any moment” as the US and South Korea began their biggest-ever joint air drills. The Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of the ruling Workers’ party, said the five-day Vigilant Ace exercises, which involve more than 200 aircraft, were “an open, all-out provocation against the DPRK, which may lead to a nuclear war any moment”. “The US and South Korean puppet warmongers would be well advised to bear in mind that their DPRK-targeted military drill will be as foolish as an act precipitating their self-destruction,” it added, using the country’s official title the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. While Washington and Seoul insist their military drills are purely defensive, North Korea regards them as a rehearsal for invasion. Graham said he was confident Trump could manage the growing crisis, despite his failure to prevent the North from conducting missile and nuclear tests since becoming president. In recent months, Trump has exchanged personal insults with the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and issued threats to “totally destroy” the country if the US or its regional allies Japan and South Korea were forced to defend themselves. “He’s got the best national security team of anybody I have seen since I have been in Washington,” Graham said of Trump, who has vowed to deny North Korea the ability to strike the US with nuclear weapons. “Denial means pre-emptive war as a last resort,” Graham said. “The pre-emption is becoming more likely as their technology matures. I think we’re really running out of time.” The senator said attempts by China – North Korea’s main ally and economic partner – to pressure the Pyongyang regime into abandoning its weapons programme had been ineffective. If North Korea conducted another nuclear weapons test, he added, “then you need to get ready for a very serious response by the United States”. Graham’s comments came a day after Trump’s national security adviser, HR McMaster, described North Korea as “the greatest immediate threat to the United States”. Speaking at the Reagan National Defense Forum in California, McMaster said the risk of war with the North was “increasing every day, which means that we are in a race, really, we are in a race to be able to solve this problem”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
