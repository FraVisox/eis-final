Ugh, Keira Knightley’s in a corset again! Get all of that out of your system now because I’m here to tell you that Wash Westmoreland’s Colette is exhilarating, funny, inspiring and (remember: corsets!) gorgeous, too. The first third of this story is pretty traditional. Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette (Knightley) is a country girl waiting to get whisked away into marriage by the worldly literary “entrepreneur” known simply as Willy (Dominic West). When the new bride is presented at the salons, Parisian gossips are stunned. The notorious libertine Willy is to settle down? While his admiration of his new bride is sincere, his desires are not entirely stunted. But Colette (as she is not yet known) doesn’t exactly sit idly when she learns of his infidelity. She demands honesty in their marriage and, for a time, she gets it. She also saves the family’s finances when her book that Willy initially rejected for publication is reworked, branded “a Willy novel” and becomes the talk of all Paris. Much of what makes this film so fascinating is the not-quite-villain-but-certainly-not-hero role Willy plays. It’s a very juicy role for Dominic West, and undoubtedly the best film performance he’s ever given. (I’ve never in my life seen a man look dashing even while flatulating.) The obvious read is that Willy exploited Colette in ways bordering on cruelty. (He even locks her in a room and shouts “write!” when her initial Claudine novel demands a follow-up.) Westmoreland’s film doesn’t exactly excuse him, but does offer context about his contributions to Colette’s initial success as well as a realistic portrayal of how women writers were perceived at the time. That doesn’t make it any easier for Colette as her husband steals all her glory. Luckily, they each have activities that keep them busy – for a stretch, the activity is sleeping with the same woman. Willy encourages Colette to link up with a bored Louisiana millionaire, but he doesn’t tell her that he’s visiting her apartment on alternating days. This leads to a kind of understanding, or at least a delay for the inevitable reckoning. Willy’s indulgences lead to a depletion of funds, but what ultimately bankrupts him is producing a play featuring Colette and her new lover (the transgender pioneer “Missy”, the Marquise de Belbeuf). This failure forces Willy to sell the rights to the extremely popular Claudine character, and kickstarts Colette’s career as a vaudevillian. There’s no shortage of domestic drama (and Knightley and West do fine work with the sharp screenplay Westmoreland co-wrote with Richard Glatzer and Rebecca Lenkiewicz) but the delay in building to a final knockout row is something of a revelation. We so often look to the lives of artists for meaning, but when dramatized they regularly end up being just another bit of soap opera. Colette’s life is deserving of nuance and care, and that’s what she gets in this film. She also gets Keira Knightley is top form: luminous, clever, sexy and sympathetic. The scenes of physical intimacy are tasteful and few, but have quite an impact. Much of what drove Colette was a need to be recognized. Knightley will not suffer the same fate when this film is viewed by wider audiences. Colette is showing at the Sundance film festival"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/22/pauline-hanson-fraser-anning-one-nation-seat","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T21:43:37Z","webTitle":"Pauline Hanson moves against Fraser Anning in bid to regain One Nation seat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/22/pauline-hanson-fraser-anning-one-nation-seat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/22/pauline-hanson-fraser-anning-one-nation-seat","fields":{"headline":"Pauline Hanson moves against Fraser Anning in bid to regain One Nation seat","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Pauline Hanson will reportedly ask the Senate to refer rebel One Nation senator Fraser Anning to the high court over a dropped bankruptcy case that may bring his eligibility into question. On Monday the Australian reported that Hanson would write to Scott Ryan questioning Anning’s eligibility, a bid to retain control of One Nation’s fourth Senate seat which Anning has dismissed as “frivolous”. Anning won the Queensland Senate seat previously held by Malcolm Roberts in a recount after Roberts was found to be a dual British citizen. He separated from One Nation on the day of his swearing-in, and has since been courted by the Nationals and Bob Katter. Hanson’s letter to Ryan reportedly suggests Anning may not be eligible to sit in the Senate because he was an “undischarged bankrupt or insolvent” or had benefited from “any law relating to bankrupt or insolvent debtors”. Before his selection, Anning and his wife Fiona Ruth Anning were the subject of bankruptcy proceedings in the federal circuit court filed by a Bendigo and Adelaide Bank subsidiary, ABL Nominees, which claimed they owed $239,393.49. On 3 October the petition was dropped after a confidential settlement which cleared the way for Anning to enter the Senate. Hanson acknowledges in her letter that Anning avoided bankruptcy but challenges the legitimacy of the settlement, questioning whether he was able to settle only when it became apparent he could replace Roberts in the Senate and be paid a salary of $200,000. Anning has responded that he has never been bankrupt or insolvent and therefore cannot be disqualified. Any reference to the high court would be “frivolous”, he said. “I was the subject of a bankruptcy application by ABL Nominees. After negotiations, ABL Nominees withdrew their application. “Specific details of the settlement are confidential and will not be released or discussed.” A reference from the Senate would require majority support, meaning one or both of the major parties would have to support Hanson’s push. If Anning were found ineligible, Hanson’s sister Judy Smith would be his likely replacement in the Senate, bringing One Nation’s seat count back up to four. Rosalind Dixon, a constitutional law expert at the University of New South Wales, told the Australian the 1987 Nile v Wood case suggested Anning was not an undischarged bankrupt or insolvent because he was not found to be so by the court."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/21/harry-mallinder-career-northampton-england-alan-gaffney","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T21:59:32Z","webTitle":"Harry Mallinder’s career depends on finding best role, say Northampton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/21/harry-mallinder-career-northampton-england-alan-gaffney","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/21/harry-mallinder-career-northampton-england-alan-gaffney","fields":{"headline":"Harry Mallinder’s career depends on finding best role, say Northampton","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Harry Mallinder, one of the eight uncapped members of England’s Six Nations squad, risks having his career “destroyed” if he is not allowed to concentrate on a specific position, according to the Northampton interim coach Alan Gaffney. Mallinder started Northampton’s 62-14 thrashing by Saracens at fly‑half on Saturday but was withdrawn at half-time after a torrid opening 40 minutes. The 21-year-old began the season in the No 10 shirt before moving to full‑back – which he considers to be his best position – but returned to fly-half after Piers Francis was sidelined through concussion, while he spent long parts of last season at inside-centre. He has also had to deal with the sacking of his father, Jim, after 10 years at the club but Eddie Jones, who considers Mallinder a full‑back, has included him in England’s Six Nations squad, having watched him orchestrate the victory against Clermont eight days ago. “The one thing we can’t do is keep swapping him between these positions,” Gaffney said. “I’ve been guilty of that in the past and probably destroyed people’s careers by using them as utility players and not concentrating on one slot. I think Eddie will decide what he wants to do with the English side. We’re happy to talk with Eddie about that but we’ve got to work out what is best for us and at the same time what’s best for Harry. “He’s only a lad, he’s only a kid. He’s got a lot of learning to do. He’s a boy whose got potential who I think will go on with it. It’s a case of Harry and the coaches working out the best place for him to play, whether it be at 15 or 12 or at 10. Harry’s got a huge future in the game and it’s a question of us looking after him.” Mallinder was part of the England party who left for a training camp in Portugal on Sunday but it remains to be seen what involvement Henry Slade has on the Algarve after he was taken off during Exeter’s defeat by Glasgow on Saturday with a shoulder injury. Kyle Sinckler, meanwhile, pulled out of Harlequins’ defeat against La Rochelle before kick‑off after failing a late fitness test. Manu Tuilagi endured a minor setback in his comeback from his latest long injury lay-off after sitting out Leicester’s defeat by Racing 92 with a tight calf. The Leicester head coach, Matt O’Connor, decided not to risk Tuilagi in dreadful weather conditions. Tuilagi was not named in England’s Six Nations squad last week but Jones said he would be considered later in the championship if he could rediscover his “sharpness”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/23/grenfell-fire-survivors-urge-council-not-to-axe-volunteer-therapists","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T09:58:59Z","webTitle":"Grenfell fire survivors urge council not to axe volunteer therapists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/23/grenfell-fire-survivors-urge-council-not-to-axe-volunteer-therapists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/23/grenfell-fire-survivors-urge-council-not-to-axe-volunteer-therapists","fields":{"headline":"Grenfell fire survivors urge council not to axe volunteer therapists","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire have expressed dismay after the local council said it would axe the services of 15 volunteer complementary therapists who have been supporting victims for the past seven months. The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea has told the therapists that they must leave their positions at the Curve community centre in west London by Friday 26 January. The therapists belong to Complementary Support Teams UK (CSTUK), a service that provides support for victims of disasters, which has been helping around 150 survivors of the Grenfell fire. It is unclear exactly what services will replace those provided by CSTUK, though a number of therapists remain at the Curve. A draft strategy document from the council says the aim is to have a single lead provider of regulated complementary therapy services, linked to the NHS, for Grenfell survivors and that the council will be recruiting therapists between now and April. The council says the volunteer therapists are welcome to apply for jobs at the Curve. However, Jane Lawson, who set up CSTUK and volunteers with survivors, said that many of the volunteer therapists combine their help for Grenfell survivors with day jobs in clinics, teaching and other commitments. “We have 150 survivors and other residents on our books who we are currently providing therapies to. They are in the middle of a programme of therapies and this programme is going to be cut on Friday,” said Lawson. “We have built up relationships of trust with the survivors. Many survivors don’t want to use services provided by the council. Is the council not listening to what survivors want?” CSTUK also says the council intends to restrict future complementary therapy treatments to just four sessions per person. Lawson says her team currently tailor sessions to each individual survivor and do not have a limit. Distrust between survivors of the Grenfell fire and the local authorities is strong, and those being supported at the Curve did not wish to be named when speaking to the Guardian. One survivor said: “Since the fire, my partner hasbuilt a relationship of trust with her specific therapist. She finds it hard to trust anyone after being let down so many times. I find it very disturbing that they want to take this as well from us. They have already taken everything else from us.” A second survivor said: “I lost everything, my house and someone I love. The only thing keeping me more focused are the regular therapies I’ve had. I love these guys. To see them go is a great loss.” A third survivor urged the council to reconsider: “These volunteers have given up their time to support us. It’s not right that these generous volunteers are being prevented from continuing. I’m asking that they are allowed to continue to support us.” The council insists that despite the 15 volunteer therapists having their assistance terminated in the next few days, therapy services will continue uninterrupted. The draft strategy document states that there are four lead therapists and three other therapists at the Curve. It is not clear if they will be immediately able to absorb all the work done by the 15 volunteer therapists or whether the 150 people currently receiving therapy from the CST volunteers will be happy to transfer to them. A council spokesperson said: “Therapy services continue uninterrupted at the Curve – we are standardising our early-years service, which is delivered by paid professionals, with our adults’ service, which was delivered by volunteers. We thank the volunteers for the fantastic work they have done and we very much welcome their application should they wish to be part of this new service, which is closely integrated with the NHS and other partners.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/22/houston-sabercats-us-pro-major-league-rugby-uruguay","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T11:49:58Z","webTitle":"Houston?

No problem – SaberCats bullish about latest US rugby venture","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It is arguably one of the few professional rugby venues in the world with a carousel at the 50-metre line and a splash pad behind the technical zones. It is certainly the only one with a giant video board in the shape of Texas. Yet these oddball surroundings may be the best evidence so far that high-level club rugby union has a promising future in America. Constellation Field is the temporary base of the Houston SaberCats ahead of the debut season of Major League Rugby, the latest attempt to glue the sport to the American consciousness. About 20 miles from downtown Houston, it is the home of the Sugar Land Skeeters, a minor-league baseball team in one of the country’s wealthiest and most ethnically diverse counties. Like many clubs of their ilk, the Skeeters have built a stadium that evinces a certain pessimism about the appeal of their product, hence the playground behind the outfield wall and many other distractions. At Saturday night’s SaberCats exhibition against Uruguay, though, most spectators seemed to be spectating. The merry-go-round and splash pad were deserted. Even the 15ft inflatable dartboard had few takers. The attendance – about 3,500 tickets were sold – justified the SaberCats’ gamble that demand to see a new team in an obscure sport is strong enough to warrant hiring a premium venue and charging high prices. The grass changes from lush to thin and yellowish as the pitch extends from what will be the infield when the Lancaster Barnstormers and Southern Maryland Blue Crabs face the Skeeters this summer. Still, the place has smart facilities and presentation slick enough to make a strong first impression. A cartoon explainer flickered on the video screen before kick-off, informing spectators that the ball is egg-shaped and that the sport is replete with British jargon. “Please respect the kicker” flashed up during attempts at goal. Rather than oil industry expats from rugby nations, the crowd appeared to be mostly native-born Americans – something that chimes with the team’s demographic analysis. The SaberCats performed creditably in a 32-24 defeat by a nation ranked 18th in the world and warming up for a World Cup play-off with Canada. It was the third of nine pre-season games at Constellation Field, ahead of the April launch of Major League Rugby, which has a deal with CBS Sports and also features teams from Austin, New Orleans, Salt Lake City, Glendale (Colorado), San Diego and Seattle. Houston signed up for the ballpark when research suggested strong demand. The first match, a win over Seattle Saracens, drew about 5,000. Their second, a defeat by the UBCOB Ravens of Vancouver in adverse weather, about half that. “We’ve been bowled over by the support, both from the rugby community but probably more importantly from people that aren’t familiar with rugby,” said Justin Fitzpatrick, the former Ulster and Ireland prop who is the SaberCats’ head coach. “I think what we’ve done is hugely carefully researched,” said Jeremy Turner, the CEO. “Even the step into Constellation Field was based on research. Some of it empirical, that’s for sure, because it’s rugby, which is a lesser-known sport, but basically we worked very hard on making this professional.” The club will need to find a new temporary venue in the spring but intend to announce a permanent location for next year. Turner said the team was “committed to building a just-over-3,000-seat stadium with all the mod-cons that you need, but we might revisit that in light of the experiences we’re having now”. Houston has hosted international fixtures and was even proposed last year as the site for a quixotic Pro14 expansion. The SaberCats are backed by a wealthy consortium. Still, the predators who inspired their name ultimately suffered extinction. The last attempt to birth a US pro league, PRO Rugby, had teams in Denver, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco and near Columbus, Ohio. It staged a solitary season in 2016. “I think there is a genuine belief or we wouldn’t be spending this kind of money, I think that’s really the bottom line,” Turner said. “Clearly it’s in the seven-figures-plus when you include the capital investment, setting up the team and all the million things you have to do to make it work.” The SaberCats are charging far more for tickets and parking than their landlords. Against Uruguay, the most expensive seats – which sold out – saw 80 people pay $250, including a meal and drinks. An adult ticket for a seat on a grassy bank is $15. “I think the difference is that the previous attempt was just really quickly thrown together, they just tried to put it out there, there wasn’t any marketing done, they just kind of hoped everything would work out,” said Kyle Sumsion, the SaberCats’ captain. “The difference is not necessarily what the players are doing, it’s what the people in the back office are doing to really drive this and let us be successful.” Long before kick-off, Brent Shradar, a 34-year-old season ticket holder, was among the tailgaters in the parking lot, where dozens grilled food and guzzled beer while a band played. “The ground level, the youth level, is really big right now,” he said. “It’s growing exponentially. And I think it’s gonna surpass American football, in my opinion.” His dad, John, liked the smaller scale and cheaper prices compared with Houston Texans NFL games. Their friend, Kyle Wilson, a youth pastor, discovered rugby eight years ago in South Africa and was hooked. “Finding out the SaberCats were here, man, I’m really excited about it,” he said. “Americans, we love the physicality of it and finesse and the beauty of it. The barbaric-ness of it and the beauty of it all in the same moment. “When Americans can latch into it, I think it’ll grow big time.” Brent Shradar agreed. “It’s a mix of soccer, American football and creaming people,” he said. “I think it’s gonna make it, honestly.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/21/hartlepool-national-league-wrexham","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T18:17:48Z","webTitle":"Hartlepool receive a helping hand from the neighbours to stay afloat | Louise Taylor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/21/hartlepool-national-league-wrexham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/21/hartlepool-national-league-wrexham","fields":{"headline":"Hartlepool receive a helping hand from the neighbours to stay afloat","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Maybe David Cameron’s “big society” does exist after all? It certainly seems to be alive and kicking in Hartlepool. A genuine sense of community, connectivity and cooperation filled the frosty streets surrounding Victoria Park as 3pm approached on Saturday and a bumper crowd of almost 7,000 filed in to watch Hartlepool United face Wrexham in the National League. Most purchased a special match programme. Designed by David Carless, a local art teacher, its front cover depicted a Middlesbrough footballer holding out a helping hand to a Hartlepool counterpart. The pair were set against an abstract impression of a mountain of fans also linking hands as they supported each other during an arduous climb to the summit. An inspiring, evocative, image, it harked back to 1986 when a then deeply indebted Middlesbrough staved off the threat of extinction, partly thanks to their near neighbours lending them Victoria Park. With Hartlepool now the ones facing liquidation, financial support from Boro fans loomed large in a fund-raising initiative which has ensured that the wages of players and staff – totalling around £140,000 – will be paid on Thursday. There is real optimism that the club where Brian Clough cut his managerial teeth will be under the new ownership of an unidentified local businessman by payday. After attracting too much tenuous interest from publicity seekers, club officials seem reassured by this mysterious Mr X’s insistence on anonymity and discretion until the deal is done. Encouragingly he has provided proof of funds amounting to £3m. If all proceeds to plan, one of his first tasks will be liberating the squad’s training kit from a local laundrette where it is being held hostage because of unpaid bills. Then there is the managerial situation to confront. Craig Harrison, a former Middlesbrough defender who left the Welsh Premier League side The New Saints to become Hartlepool’s 32nd successor to Clough, is floundering. Indeed Wrexham’s 2-0 win ensured the earlier air of camaraderie was soured when fans surrounded the home dugout at the end, calling for Harrison’s head. “Inexcusable”, “clueless,” and “unacceptable” were some of the politer assessments from fans exiting the Cyril Knowles stand as late afternoon temperatures turned distinctly icy. Those who have dug deep to leave Hartlepool on target to bank the £200,000 demanded to stave off administration appear slightly hurt by the team’s failure to rise to the occasion. Two goals from Wrexham’s Scott Quigley following badly defended counterattacks ensured that a team relegated from League Two last spring have won just one of their past 13 matches and are only six points above the relegation zone. “There’s disappointment and anger,” said Harrison, who is operating under a transfer embargo. “Again we conceded stupid goals at stupid times. It’s ridiculous.” Not that he is to blame for the problems. Twelve months ago the former chairman Gary Coxall appointed the admittedly experienced Dave Jones as manager. Jones won only three games, in effect ending Hartlepool’s 96‑year Football League residency. With the current reluctant owners, Sage Investments, wanting out, Pam Duxbury, the club’s chair, has endeavoured to clean up an awful financial mess before sealing the mooted sale. “The support, locally and from afar, has been overwhelming. I’ve learnt the huge pull this club has and how much people want to get involved,” says Duxbury, who stands by her decision to retain a large, fully professional squad rather than turning semi-professional. “Everyone expects the players to go out and give their all. But football’s a mental game and players have been affected by what’s gone on. Can they pay the mortgage? Can they pay the bills? “Our aim was promotion at the start of the season. I think everyone, players, management, will admit we should have done better. It’s been disappointing. We stayed full‑time, fully professional to gain an advantage over rivals. In hindsight we could have stripped everything back but then we’d have always wondered what if …” Providing the takeover really does happen, Hartlepool fans may soon dare to dream again. More importantly the club’s enduring power to pull visitors (both home and away fans) into the town will continue to boost the struggling local economy by as much as £10m a year. If newcomers are initially underwhelmed by some rather drab architecture – not to mention a surfeit of bingo halls, fast‑food joints and working men’s clubs – they can hardly fail to be impressed by the town’s carefully restored Historic Quay and handsome Marina Development. The jewel in the crown is HMS Trincomalee, Britain’s oldest floating warship. On Saturday Wrexham supporters emerged from the waterside National Museum of the Royal Navy to gaze in awe at her as she sat serenely on a cobalt blue, deceptively calm North Sea. Built in Bombay, named – and first blooded – in Ceylon, HMS Trincomalee spent the 1800s variously helping quell riots in Haiti, stemming an invasion of Cuba and spearheading anti-slavery patrols. Those Hartlepool United fans who admire her from the Niramax stand every home game are evidently made of similarly stern stuff."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/22/government-shutdown-republicans-daca-minor-immigration-deal-to-end-deadlock","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T14:50:21Z","webTitle":"Government shutdown: Republicans float deal to end 'Dreamers' deadlock","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/22/government-shutdown-republicans-daca-minor-immigration-deal-to-end-deadlock","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/22/government-shutdown-republicans-daca-minor-immigration-deal-to-end-deadlock","fields":{"headline":"Government shutdown: Republicans float deal to end 'Dreamers' deadlock","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The US government shutdown edged closer to a resolution on Sunday night with a minor concession from the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who said he would allow a vote on immigration reform in February if Democrats agree to fund the government. However, one Democratic source cautioned that no deal had been reached. McConnell’s proposal was the fruit of an effort among moderates in both parties to resolve the shutdown, which began at midnight on Saturday. The shutdown was spurred by the inability of Congress to reach a deal to resolve the status of “Dreamers” – undocumented migrants brought into the US as children protected from deportation until September 2017, when the Trump administration ended the Daca program, created by Barack Obama. Trump allowed a six-month grace period for Congress to give Dreamers permanent legal status. Democrats, facing heavy pressure from immigration advocates, pledged not to fund the government until a deal was reached. McConnell’s proposal would allow the Senate to debate and vote on an immigration deal if a broader bipartisan compromise was not reached in the next three weeks. Speaking on the floor, the top Senate Republican said he would push for a Monday vote on a short-term deal to fund the government through 8 February, as well as extending for six years a popular health insurance program, Chip, that provides healthcare coverage to nine million children. Republicans used Chip as leverage in the failed vote on Friday night, which sought to fund the government for four weeks. They ultimately wooed four Democrats to support the proposal. A hardline stance on immigration has been a priority of the Trump administration and support for the popular healthcare program was a way to lure Democrats without making concessions on Dreamers. However, four Republicans opposed the bill and it failed to reach the 60-vote supermajority needed to avoid a filibuster in the Senate. Republicans had expressed concern about the government being funded by a series of short-term bills since September, as well as what they thought was inadequate spending on defense. On Sunday, as leaders of both parties sought to apportion blame and the White House took a hardline position on the shutdown, Trump and key advisers urged that McConnell take the “nuclear option” and remove the 60-vote threshold, an option the majority leader does not support. On Monday morning, Trump went back on the attack on Twitter, writing: “The Democrats are turning down services and security for citizens in favor of services and security for non-citizens. Not good!” He added: “Democrats have shut down our government in the interests of their far left base. They don’t want to do it but are powerless! At least one Republican dissenter indicated on Sunday that he would support McConnell’s move. Jeff Flake, an ardent anti-Trump conservative from Arizona, said he would support a three-week funding bill after opposing the four-week proposal on Friday. Doug Jones, a Democrat from Alabama who participated in the bipartisan talks, tweeted on Sunday night that he was “encouraged” by McConnell’s comments. Any immigration deal reached by the Senate would however need to be approved by the House of Representatives. House speaker Paul Ryan has committed to supporting a spending bill that runs through 8 February, as opposed to the one the House passed last week, which would have run through 16 February. However, he has steadfastly refused to negotiate on immigration while the government is in shutdown. “Open the government and then we’ll resume negotiations, it’s just that clear,” Ryan said on Fox and Friends on Monday. Mark Meadows, the head of the hard right House Freedom Caucus, threw cold water on the idea that a Senate deal would bind the lower chamber. The North Carolina Republican told reporters Ryan had to understand “the will of his conference and of the majority of the majority”, should drive any vote on immigration reform."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/22/las-vegas-rally-marking-womens-march-anniversary-puts-focus-on-voting","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T12:42:57Z","webTitle":"Las Vegas rally marking Women's March anniversary puts focus on voting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/22/las-vegas-rally-marking-womens-march-anniversary-puts-focus-on-voting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/22/las-vegas-rally-marking-womens-march-anniversary-puts-focus-on-voting","fields":{"headline":"Las Vegas rally marking Women's March anniversary puts focus on voting","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The first anniversary of the Women’s March was celebrated in a Las Vegas stadium on Sunday with a “#PowerToThePolls” rally, intended to harness and direct the so-called “resistance” against Donald Trump. There were chants of “Today we protest, tomorrow we vote”. Dozens of female political leaders spoke about the fight for equality. And thousands of women registered to volunteer or vote, waved signs and donned pink knit “pussy hats”. “I’ve always voted but now it’s more important to be active,” said Tiffany MacDonald of Henderson, Nevada. Her oldest daughter had a sign stating “cheese and crackers, this matters!” MacDonald’s mother carried a placard that read: “Now you’ve pissed off nana.” “My grandmother fought for some of these rights and now we have to fight for them again,” MacDonald said. Capping a weekend on which thousands of protesters returned to the streets in Washington, New York, Los Angeles and hundreds of other cities in the US and around the world, the Las Vegas event had the air of a mission. “We marched in Washington DC last year and had such a profound experience that we wanted to do it again,” said Kathy Goodman, a Chicagoan who flew in with her sister. “Politically, I never paid that much attention before. But this administration just scared us to death with its stance on women’s rights, immigrants’ rights, healthcare – everything – so we’re trying to make a difference volunteering. “I’m about 30 minutes’ drive from [House speaker] Paul Ryan’s district, so I’m going to volunteer for the Democrat running against him in the midterm.” With the federal government shut down over immigration reform, Nevada representatives stuck in Washington welcomed the crowd via Skype. “Women … including from those so-called ‘shithole’ countries, welcome to Nevada,” said congresswoman Dina Titus. Before her, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto told the crowd: “The fight continues … la lucha sigue.” Holding the rally in southern Nevada ensured a sunny day, but the event’s organizers mostly hoped the location would translate into political momentum in a key state. Control of the US Senate could hinge on who Nevadans choose to represent them in November 2018. “We have an incumbent who’s a gentleman [Dean Heller] and is being challenged by a woman [Jacky Rosen], so there’s extreme interest in this race,” Elaine Wynn, honorary co-sponsor of Sunday’s event, told the Guardian. “Last year the march was more of an outpouring of emotion. Now this year it’s a bit different. It’s about a call to action, and a call to action of course in a peaceful democracy is to do it at the polls. “Women have been coalescing all across the country to not only register more women to vote, but to encourage women to run for office and we’ve seen a lot of success.” One of the rare states to see a Democratic wave in 2016, Nevada represents the party’s hope for the future – and women’s equality in particular. Hillary Clinton won the “Battleborn” state comfortably; it is tied for first in the nation for the largest percentage of female legislators; the mayors of Las Vegas and Reno are women; and in electing Cortez Masto it sent the first Latina to the US Senate. “Overall, we need more women in Congress because we have unique challenges that only we face,” said Amy Vilela, a woman campaigning for a congressional seat currently held by Rubén Kihuen, a Democrat who will not seek re-election after being accused of sexual harassment. “I started off as a single mother working a job full time,” Vilela continued, “taking care of my children full time, I had to be on Wic [Women, Infants, Children food program], Medicaid, food stamps, while trying to make it up through a career field where I get paid pennies on the dollar. “That is a unique experience to a lot of women, so when we talk about how we’re going to be fixing programs, we need to have women sitting at the table being able to share their experience.” In the stadium bleachers, organizers representing every cause from immigration reform to Black Lives Matter and reproductive rights collected names and phone numbers: “activation”, as they called it. Several generations of voters were on hand, united by a mutual loathing. One woman’s sign used “TRUMP” as an acronym for “Terrible Racist Unstable Maniac Predator”. Another had a poster reading “Vaginas brought you into this world &amp; vaginas will vote you out!” Yet the mood was consistently hopeful. “This is a birthday party for a movement that has only begun to flex its power,” said Anna Galland, executive director of MoveOn.org, a political action group. Requesting then that the crowd share its enthusiasm via social media, she added: “This is the one rare moment when what happens in Vegas shouldn’t stay in Vegas.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/22/shane-warne-says-womans-day-a-disgrace-using-made-up-stories","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T03:15:32Z","webTitle":"Shane Warne says Woman’s Day a ‘disgrace’ using ‘made-up stories’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/22/shane-warne-says-womans-day-a-disgrace-using-made-up-stories","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/22/shane-warne-says-womans-day-a-disgrace-using-made-up-stories","fields":{"headline":"Shane Warne says Woman’s Day a ‘disgrace’ using ‘made-up stories’","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Retired cricketer Shane Warne has labelled Bauer Media’s Woman’s Day a “disgrace” and called for action against “made-up stories” after the gossip magazine published an unsourced article claiming his ex-wife was “tearing her hair out” over their adult son’s interest in gambling. On Monday Warne called for a “media watchdog” to take action over what he said constituted “constant harassment” aimed at his family. It came after the magazine published an article which claimed Warne’s ex-wife, Simone Callahan, was unhappy that the couple’s 18-year-old son Jackson Warne had attended a poker competition with the ex-cricketer. Under a headline that claimed Callahan was “furious” and “horrified” at Warne’s influence over their son, the magazine cited unnamed “friends” as a source. But Warne – whose love life has long been a favourite subject for Australia’s gossip magazines – issued an angry statement denying the story. “Woman’s Day you are a disgrace,” he wrote on his Instagram page. “I’m not sure what possess you to continue this attack &amp; making up lies about me, my family or my private life. What is the media watchdog doing about this constant harassment &amp; continual lies about made up stories with no substance whatsoever?” It comes a few months after Australian actor Rebel Wilson was awarded more than $4.5m in damages in her libel case against Bauer Media relating to a series of articles accusing Wilson of being a serial liar about her age, real name and childhood. While Warne did not threaten legal action, in a subsequent post he claimed Callahan was “also furious” about the story and had provided him with a quote to publish on her behalf. Warne has both courted and complained about the media spotlight in the past. In 2012 he and then-partner Liz Hurley sold their “exclusive” holiday photos to Woman’s Day, and he is a prolific social media user."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/22/an-evening-with-deplorables-inside-the-far-right-party-in-manhattan","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T13:35:10Z","webTitle":"An evening with 'deplorables': inside the alt-right party in Manhattan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/22/an-evening-with-deplorables-inside-the-far-right-party-in-manhattan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/22/an-evening-with-deplorables-inside-the-far-right-party-in-manhattan","fields":{"headline":"An evening with 'deplorables': inside the alt-right party in Manhattan","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"On Saturday night hundreds of self-described “deplorables”, arch-conservative internet personalities, trolls-turned-citizen journalists, and conspiracy theory enthusiasts put on their best suits and cocktail dresses to drink, dance and toast the Trump presidency at an exclusive rightwing social gala called A Night For Freedom. It’s unclear if there was an element of trolling in the decision to hold a pro-Trump bonanza in Manhattan, the same day several hundred thousand people participated in a city-wide “women’s march”, but if there was, then the party’s masterminds were almost foiled at their own game. Despite elaborate security precautions to prevent infiltration by journalists, protesters and other troublemakers, the event came close to collapsing at the last moment when, in what the event organizers described as a “set-up”, the scheduled venue abruptly canceled the day before. Organizers scrambled behind the scenes to secure a new venue to accommodate their 750 guests – only for the second venue to also back out at 1am the morning of the event. A Hell’s Kitchen nightclub finally agreed to host, apparently only after one of the event organizers offered to pay $20,000 in cash up front. Outside the nightclub, black-clad protesters taunted arriving guests while a heavy cordon of police stood watch. But stepping inside felt like entering a separate universe. The atmosphere was somewhere between a political fundraiser – with lots of red, white and blue and, at one point, a spoken-word ode to the American flag – and a high school prom. Music thumped in the background. Men wearing Trump-style red ties were everywhere. Guests were giddy with the cathartic high that comes from being in the presence of like-minded people. Many had flown in, and one man told me he had driven five hours to attend. Outside was a hostile world of haters, losers, cucks, globalists, social justice warriors, betas, libtards, and soyboys – but inside was a haven where deplorables could speak freely. Fans geeked out as they took selfies with their favorite rightwing YouTube stars. The evening’s most unexpected guest was Chelsea Manning, who dropped by briefly during the earlier part of the evening to the surprise of those present and the confusion and consternation of leftist social media users, who heard the news on Twitter. Manning later uploaded a picture of herself making a thumbs-down sign, announcing that she had just “[c]rashed the fascist/white supremacist hate brigade party”, but others disputed her characterization of her presence there. “Yes I literally shook hands with Chelsea Manning [tonight], the left is freaking out, it was not a big deal,” Mike Cernovich, the event’s main organizer, wrote on Twitter. Cernovich, a rightwing muckraker, occasional men’s rights advocate, and self-described “mindset” guru, said he was “glad she stopped by. All are welcome to party with me.” “Twenty years ago the idea that anyone can get their own [social media] account and troll any senator to their face would be regarded as an absurdity,” Michael Malice, a fixture of the alternative media sphere, told a cheering crowd. “The gatekeepers who are controlling our information are falling. Twenty years ago there were three channels [sic]. Today there are literally infinite YouTube channels. Infinite Twitter profiles. Infinite Facebook profiles. You can’t silence people any longer.” At last year’s “DeploraBall” members of the anti-establishment movement then known as the “alt-right” celebrated the inauguration of Donald Trump, a man they credited themselves with having “memed” into the White House over the resistance of a hostile political and media elite. Even then, few Americans had heard the term “alt-right”, and the political establishment was only belatedly recognizing the influence exercised by a network of online alternative media outlets and rightwing social media personalities. A lot can happen in a year. Today, the movement has a Super Pac. Gateway Pundit, a far-right blog that has been criticized for spreading hoaxes, has been accredited to the White House press corps. Recently Cernovich partnered with BuzzFeed News to release revelations about sexual harassment claims against Michigan representative John Conyers. As they have moved from the darkest corners of the internet to the white-tableclothed banquet halls of Washington and New York, pro-Trump online provocateurs, famous for their hatred of political correctness, have also been forced to engage in their own project of respectability politics. Members of the repackaged and somewhat sanitized movement consider themselves populists and nationalists, not bigots. As they see it, one can support, say, hardline immigration policies without being racist. As Gavin McInnes, the co-founder of Vice and founder of the Proud Boys, a “western chauvinist” and anti-feminist group, explained last year to the New Yorker’s Andrew Marantz: “They [white nationalists] care about the white race. We care about Western values.” ‘Do you want to make us look professional, or sloppy?’ In emails to guests leading up to the event, Cernovich laid out strict rules for decorum, dress code and security protocol. “By attending the event, you become a brand ambassador,” he wrote. “Do you want to make us look professional, or do you want us to look sloppy?” Any journalists requesting press passes would be denied (“I’m bored of the media lying about me and us, and have no interest in press coverage”), and, he added, undercover security personnel would be mingling with the guests to keep an eye out for “negative or toxic people”. But if “A Night for Freedom” was an opportunity to show off the rebranded and increasingly mainstream alternative right wing, it was also a reminder that “mainstream” is a relative notion. While the “alt-lite” may have successfully distanced itself from the worst extremists, it can sometimes seem unclear exactly how “lite” the new movement is. A prolific livestreamer who rails against Democrats, the establishment GOP and the “fake news”-peddling media to his hundreds of thousands of Twitter and Periscope followers, Cernovich is known for reflexively accusing his detractors of pedophilia, and he was one of the propagators of “Pizzagate”, the wholly discredited conspiracy theory that high-ranking Democrats were operating a child sex-ring out of the back of a Washington DC pizzeria. Joining Cernovich as the evening’s headline acts were McInnes; reality TV star and Trump supporter Anna Khait; “political operatives” Jack Posobiec and Ali Alexander; and Stefan Molyneux, a far-right podcaster who advocates “anarcho-capitalism” and racial IQ theories. (Molyneux, who encourages followers to break off contact with their families, has also been accused of operating a therapy cult, a charge he denies.) In a series of panels the speakers, some of whom seemed rather tipsy, offered their thoughts on a greatest-hits list of favorite topics including Hillary Clinton (“she’s gonna get her time, you guys just wait”), cryptocurrency, the dangers of socialism, George Soros (“the head of the snake”), and the media (“leftist propaganda machine”). As a group of Proud Boys stood behind him in matching Fred Perry tennis shirts, McInnes argued that women would be happier under traditional gender strictures, using a vulgar physical analogy to describe how he sees young single women as being exploited by men. He went on, “Why do [progressives] have a problem with traditional people? You’re the ones being left with cats and dogs for sons and daughters.” This brought McInnes to one of his recurring preoccupations, natalism. He described his pride at being a father and encouraged listeners to have lots of children. “Remember, one [child] is for losers. Two is for fags.” The evening wore on and the drink flowed freely. In the men’s room a drunk man ranted bitterly about the Women’s March. “Bunch of fucking pussies out there. And fags. All I know is I ain’t getting none!” he added, for anyone wondering. Up on the roof, groups of people clustered on a smoking patio. Conversation frequently came back to the deep state, Antifa and when Hillary will face justice for her crimes. One person was complaining about the protesters outside, some of whom had allegedly attacked guests as they entered. What do you think is behind that sort of behavior? I asked. “Divorce,” he said. Back inside, people danced to the musical stylings of DJ duo Milk N Cooks. On the stage two professional dancers, with identical short blonde hair and American flag leotards, shimmied back and forth. People flooded to the dancefloor. Men loosened their ties. The DJs cycled through various 90s and early 2000s club hits and bar-mitzvah standards – In Da Club, Can’t Touch This. An older couple slow-danced sweetly to Africa by Toto. As it neared midnight, Chumbawamba came on – “I get knocked down, but I get up again” – and the crowd shouted triumphantly along: “You are never gonna keep me down.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/22/british-billionaire-eyes-electric-car-plan-for-former-holden-factory","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T21:58:44Z","webTitle":"British billionaire eyes electric car plan for former Holden factory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/22/british-billionaire-eyes-electric-car-plan-for-former-holden-factory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/22/british-billionaire-eyes-electric-car-plan-for-former-holden-factory","fields":{"headline":"British billionaire eyes electric car plan for former Holden factory","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Fresh from rescuing the Whyalla steelworks from receivership, Britain’s “man of steel” Sanjeev Gupta is now eyeing an ambitious plan to build electric cars at the former Holden site in South Australia. The Advertiser is reporting that the British billionaire and GFG Alliance boss has approached General Motors Holden to buy assets from the closed Elizabeth factory. The newspaper has obtained a letter written by the South Australian treasurer, Tom Koutsantonis, asking GM Holden to support Gupta’s plans. It states that the GFG Alliance “intend to develop the site as a manufacturing base for an electric vehicle, utilising the innovative i-Stream technology”. The letter says that the company had lodged a bid to buy “certain assets from the former General Motors Holden site” before a public auction opened last Friday. “We are incredibly excited and supportive of the GFG Alliance’s bid and subsequent plans to ensure the continuation of our very proud history of automotive excellence and innovation in South Australia,” Koutsantonis wrote in the letter dated 17 January. “We believe that the GFG Alliance’s plans would put South Australia at the forefront of the inevitable transition of the Australian market to electric vehicles and ask that all due consideration be given to their bid and the potentially significant benefits to the automotive industry and broader community in South Australia.” On Monday the energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, said that he, the prime minister and a number of other ministers had met Sanjeev Gupta. “He has some exciting plans for South Australia, and if he wants to invest in creating more jobs then of course we would always welcome that,” Frydenberg told ABC Radio National. Asked if those included building electric cars from the Holden factory, Frydenberg replied Gupta had “a lot of plans”. “I don’t know how advanced those plans are. But certainly he’s focused on steelmaking, he’s focused on energy for those plants and he’s proven himself internationally to be an entrepreneur who’s got results,” he said. Asked about reports that Coalition members including Craig Kelly, Andrew Broad and John Williams had warned against industry assistance for electric vehicles, the energy and environment minister said the federal government would cooperate with state and local governments to resolve “logistical issues”. “What we need to see is some of the infrastructure issues resolved, because when people come to make a decision about the vehicle that they purchase they want to be sure if they do purchase an electric vehicle that they can plug it in when they go on a long road trip,” he said. Frydenberg said the government was consulting with industry about vehicle emissions standards but refused to nominate a timeframe for introduction of such standards in Australia. Gupta has become synonymous with corporate rescues in Britain. His company has bought up over 20 steel, car and engineering plants in Britain that were slated for closure. In August last year he bought the Whyalla steel works from the receivers of Arrium, ensuring that the Spencer Gulf town’s major industry would continue. He then bought 50.1% of Adelaide battery company Zen Energy, and has announced plans for the company to invest in a major renewables project to power the steel manufacturing operations. The $700m investment will be the largest solar and power storage investment in Australia, and is intended to provide one gigawatt of additional dispatchable renewable energy assets to major industries on the Eyre peninsula, including Gupta’s OneSteel. The Holden site was sold to Melbourne-based industrial property group, Pelligra in December. It plans to turn the site into a hi-tech manufacturing hub, and is planning to rename it Lionsgate Business Park. About 30% of the site has been leased back to Holden so it can continue its parts and servicing operations, but the company is looking for other tenants. The Holden plant and equipment were due to be sold off shortly. • Additional reporting by Paul Karp"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/21/wasps-ulster-saracens-england-big-picture-bleak","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T19:52:13Z","webTitle":"Wasps win salvages English interest but big picture remains bleak | Robert Kitson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/21/wasps-ulster-saracens-england-big-picture-bleak","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/21/wasps-ulster-saracens-england-big-picture-bleak","fields":{"headline":"Wasps win salvages English interest but big picture remains bleak","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In the end it could have been worse. At no stage in the history of European club rugby have England’s clubs endured a leaner pool return in Europe but a dismal January afternoon in Coventry did belatedly yield some solace. Whatever Saracens do in the knockout phases they owe a big debt to their former local rivals Wasps for supplying their passport into the tournament’s latter stages. But for Wasps’ hard-earned 26-7 victory against an outgunned Ulster on a gluepot of a pitch at the Ricoh Arena there would have been no Premiership interest whatsoever in the last eight. The upshot is that Sarries will now travel to Dublin to face the top seeds, Leinster, in the quarter-finals, still clinging to their hopes of winning a hat-trick of European crowns. Not even the thickest-skinned of little Englanders, even so, would remotely portray the last‑eight draw as a triumph given the Premiership had five entrants at this stage just two years ago. While the Scarlets deserve special recognition for becoming the first Welsh region to reach this point since 2012, it is impossible to ignore the bigger picture of Pro14 sides staging three of the four quarter-finals. By comparison, Premiership sides have mostly flattered to deceive. Saracens were unrecognisably poor at home against Clermont before Christmas and would have paid the price had Wasps not bailed them out. Exeter, by their high standards, were not sufficiently clinical at crucial moments and were punished in a way they rarely are domestically. Northampton, Harlequins, and Leicester all finished bottom of their pools and only Bath, with an Italian side in their pool, managed even to win two-thirds of their pool games. Not that it did them much good qualification-wise. The question of why the collective return has been so modest could just as easily be: “Why not?” English clubs have never had a divine right to Champions Cup immunity and, as stated in these pages back in October, pre-tournament expectations this season were not especially high, Saracens apart. Wasps and Quins kicked off under a heavy injury shadow, Northampton were at sixes and sevens on and off the field and Bath remain reliably inconsistent. Leicester? They showed more fight against Racing 92 at a snowy Welford Road, having gone 14-0 down early on, but their eventual 23-20 defeat still left them at the foot of Pool 4. George Ford’s post-match assessment – “We’ve been nowhere near good enough” – was hard to dispute. At one stage it also appeared they were shoving Saracens over the edge, turning down a kickable late penalty that would have spared their compatriots before Wasps even kicked off. Luckily for Saracens there was to be a last-gasp reprieve. Their director of rugby, Mark McCall – as well as Eddie Jones – will now be hoping that Saturday’s latest 62-14 thrashing of Northampton suggested his players’ midwinter slump is now behind them. “I think that performance was the culmination of the last six weeks since the Monday night when we played Clermont and we were in a tough situation,” McCall said. “We’ve shown ourselves that if we can get into knockout games, we’ll be tough to play against. It doesn’t really matter where it is, I know that on our day and when we play like that we’re very difficult to beat.” Those tempted to blame the inclement weather for Saracens’ relative underachievement – what if the fateful home game against Clermont in December had not been postponed until the following afternoon? – are missing an essential truth. Excuses are like belly buttons: everyone has one but they swiftly lose any relevance. Yes, England’s Lions have played more rugby than their Celtic counterparts this season but it is only mid-January – surely that should have more effect between now and June? Of course they have endured injury disruption but so too have many others. The most glaring difference lies in the continuing ability of the big Irish sides to hold their players back for their big European games. Even Leinster’s head coach, Leo Cullen, is contracted to the Irish Rugby Football Union, rather than his province. This also helps players, mentally, to target Europe more effectively. Leinster have won only one fewer pool game away from home this season – against Glasgow, Exeter and Montpellier – than all the English sides put together. But then along comes a team such as Scarlets, who gloriously buck every trend. It is remarkable to recall now that they lost their opening two pool games; those of us in west Wales on the monsoonal Friday night when they were beaten up by Bath’s big forwards drove home suspecting their obvious attacking promise was not quite going to be enough to elevate them to the next stage. How thrillingly they have rebounded from that disappointment: Tadhg Beirne is among Europe’s most influential forwards and Gareth Davies, Dan Jones, Hadleigh Parkes, Scott Williams and Rhys Patchell have all been terrific behind the scrum. The last time the west Walians – then still playing as Llanelli Scarlets – reached the knockout stages, in 2006-07, they ended up reaching the semi-finals and, as Toulon discovered on Saturday, this is not a team short of spirit or self‑belief. Their reward is a potentially thrilling duel with La Rochelle at Parc y Scarlets, with away quarter-final wins likely to be at a premium when the tournament resumes over the Easter weekend. Leinster and Clermont, however, remain the tournament frontrunners, with the semi-final draw set to keep them apart. There is also continuing Welsh interest in the Challenge Cup, where Cardiff Blues have made the last eight, generating further overdue oval-ball Welsh optimism in Europe. Between now and the end of the season there will be plenty of glasses raised to absent friends across the Severn Bridge."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/jan/21/henrikh-mkhitaryan-arsenal-arsene-wenger","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T19:02:00Z","webTitle":"Henrikh Mkhitaryan may rediscover the old spark amid Arsenal energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/jan/21/henrikh-mkhitaryan-arsenal-arsene-wenger","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/jan/21/henrikh-mkhitaryan-arsenal-arsene-wenger","fields":{"headline":"Henrikh Mkhitaryan may rediscover the old spark amid Arsenal energy","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"One game – or, more accurately, one half‑game – dominates the memory of Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s time at Manchester United. In the league derby at Old Trafford last season, the first meeting in England of José Mourinho and Pep Guardiola, the Armenian looked lost. He was partly responsible for the opening goal because of the way he initially did not press Pablo Zabaleta and then finally went far too late, and he was withdrawn at half-time. He did not play for two months after that. That seems to have contributed to a general sense that Mkhitaryan was somehow lightweight, unsuited to the defensive demands Mourinho makes of his players. It is true that Mkhitaryan is not as robust as many in this United squad, which is, after all, the tallest of any team in Europe’s five major leagues. It is also true that, although he had occasional flurries of good form, most notably in the Europa League towards the end of last season, there were far too many games in which he wandered about uninvolved, looking dispirited and vaguely confused. The accusation was that Mkhitaryan was flaky, not quite up to it. Given the struggles of Shinji Kagawa and Nuri Sahin to impose themselves on the Premier League, was there something about Borussia Dortmund that meant their alumni were unsuited to English football? There is, of course, always an issue when a player leaves an environment as idiosyncratic as Dortmund was under Jürgen Klopp, but the idea that Mkhitaryan did not fancy the defensive side of the game makes little sense given the success he had both with Dortmund and Shakhtar, teams whose style was rooted in hard pressing, in which there is no place for shirkers. In his three seasons in the Bundesliga, Mkhitaryan regained possession through tackles and interceptions 2.7 times per game, 3.2 times per game and 3.2 times per game. The Ukrainian league perhaps would not offer a fair comparison, even if the data were readily available, but in three Champions League campaigns at Shakhtar, albeit that being a small sample size, he regained possession 4.0, 6.1 and 4.4 times per game. And yet, at United, he regained possession just 1.9 times per league game last season and just 1.5 this. That suggests the issue is not an inherent failing, but perhaps to do with how he was used. United under Mourinho do not press in anything like the consistent or concerted way that Dortmund and Shakhtar did. Only occasionally – as for spells in the Europa League final last season, when Mkhitaryan was excellent – do they play with a high line. Often Mkhitaryan found himself having to provide the creative link between a deep-lying rearguard and holding midfield and a distant striker. It was then that he seemed uncomfortable. Arsenal probably do have a policy on pressing, although it has not been readily discernible for some time. Given Arsène Wenger’s obsession with the Ajax team of the early 70s, Arsenal’s glut of technical players and their lack of players with traditional defensive qualities, they should be a high-tempo, high-line side. But there have been times recently when they have been almost as lax in that regard as they are with extending players’ contracts. But their best recent performances – in the FA Cup semi‑final and final last season, at home against Tottenham this season – have been based on an energetic press and Mkhitaryan should fit comfortably into that. Precisely where he fits in a formation is a little trickier to say. Arsenal this season have used 3‑4‑2‑1 and 4-2-3-1. On Saturday, in the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace, it was 4-3-3. Although Mkhitaryan can play wide – in the Europa League final, for instance, he started on the left of a 4-3-3 – the general perception is he is more comfortable through the middle, which could potentially create problems if Mesut Özil were to agree a new contract and stay. Could you play Mkhitaryan and Özil together? Potentially, in a 3-4-2-1. With one of them wide, though, there may be a lack of dynamism on the flanks. Certainly with Mkhitaryan and Özil in tandem, there should be no lack of supply to a central striker (albeit there is a danger that an approach based on through-balls falters against a deep-lying opponent). It is a measure of how detached Mkhitaryan often seemed at United that, having registered 15 assists in his final campaign in the Bundesliga, he set up only six goals in his season and a half at Old Trafford, five of them in the first three games of this season. In a sense Mkhitaryan is an indulgence. There are far greater priorities at Arsenal than another technically gifted attacking midfielder.

Israeli media reported concerns among officials that the group would noisily walk out at the start of Pence’s speech to the Knesset. The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has praised Pence as a “great friend” and said it was “disgraceful” that members of the Knesset planned a boycott. Pence is the highest-level US official to visit the region since Trump made his Jerusalem declaration on 6 December and promised to move the US embassy to the city, an announcement that prompted Palestinians to reject the US as a peace broker. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, rescinded an invitation for Pence to visit the West Bank following the declaration. In Jordan on Sunday, Pence tried to reassure King Abdullah the US was committed to restarting peace talks and to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, if both sides agreed. Trump’s policy shift posed a dilemma for Abdullah, a staunch US ally who derives his political legitimacy in large part from the Hashemite dynasty’s role as guardian of a key Muslim site in Jerusalem. Any perceived threat to Muslim claims in the city is therefore seen as a challenge to Jordan, where a large segment of the population is of Palestinian origin. Pence told Abdullah the US has committed “to continue to respect Jordan’s role as the custodian of holy sites, that we take no position on boundaries and final status”. It was a message Pence also relayed on Saturday during talks with the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, in Cairo. After meeting US troops in Jordan, Pence told reporters he and Abdullah had “a very frank discussion”. “Look, friends occasionally have disagreements and we agreed to disagree on the decision by the United States to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,” he said. “But what we agreed on was the need for all parties to come back to the table. “The Palestinian Authority has been absent from direct negotiations since 2014. And I hope I impressed upon King Abdullah our earnest desire to restart the peace process.” Abdullah described the Pence visit as a mission “to rebuild trust and confidence” in getting to a two-state solution, in which a state of Palestine would be established in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, lands captured by Israel in 1967. With the Palestinians boycotting Pence, the Israel visit provides little obvious opportunity to build bridges. But it does give Pence, a conservative Christian, and Netanyahu, a rightwinger who has hailed US evangelicals for their support, an opportunity to shine a spotlight on their warm relationship. Addressing his cabinet on Sunday, Netanyahu said Pence was a “great friend of the state of Israel” and said they would discuss US efforts “to halt Iran’s aggression, the Iranian nuclear programme, and ways to advance peace and security in the region”. “Anyone who truly wants to fulfil those goals knows there is no substitute to the United States’ leadership,” Netanyahu said. Abbas, who called Trump’s declaration a “slap in the face”, left for an overseas visit before Pence arrived. The Palestinian foreign minister, Riad al-Malki, said Abbas would on Monday ask the European Union to officially recognise the state of Palestine when he meets foreign ministers from the bloc “as a way to respond” to Trump’s decision to recognise Jerusalem."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/22/carillion-privatisation-myth-councils-pfi-contracts","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T06:00:42Z","webTitle":"It’s not just Carillion.

The whole privatisation myth has been exposed","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The era of “private good, public bad” is drawing to a close. Unshakeable faith in Margaret Thatcher’s privatisation creed is being killed off not just by counter-ideology, but by the sheer irrationality, expense and failure of so many private contracts. Carillion’s spectacular collapse makes big headlines, but out of the spotlight local councils, under extreme stress from cuts, are cancelling contracted-out services. Why? Because it saves them money and improves services. I have been talking to councils around the country where in-sourcing is how they best cope with savage budget reductions. Start in Thurrock: there is nothing leftist about this council, controlled by minority Conservatives propped up by Ukip. In 2015 they bought out their Serco contract, bringing office services back in-house. Lyn Carpenter, the council’s chief executive, is blunt: “The contract was a disaster. Nothing was flexible, everything set in stone. If we wanted anything done differently, they said ‘That’ll cost you.’” In that inflexible 15-year contract, Thurrock says, everything was still done on paper, as Serco had no incentive to modernise. Escaping it was “quite a fight”. Thurrock paid £9.9m to buy out a £19m-a-year contract, but the cost was recouped through extra efficiency and saving “the £3.6m a year profit they were taking – money not spent locally”. I talked to some of the 300 staff brought back in-house, who described how frustrating it was to sit next to council colleagues yet never be able to cooperate or answer their phones for fear of affecting Serco key performance indicators. “We could never suggest better ways, as everything was done to contract.” Street cleaners brought back in-house “as part of our team” now monitor potholes and fly-tipping. Everywhere, council budget cuts of between 40% and 50% mean losing staff and services, yet they can’t touch anything fixed in a contract. Time and again, councils report the results of outsourced work to be out of date and inflexible. Nick Forbes, the Labour leader of Newcastle council, tells how in 2010 Gordon Brown forced Tyneside to put its metro system out to tender. DB Regio, a German government-owned company, won the contract but it was “a disaster”, he says. “When they couldn’t make a profit they cut services and complaints soared. On Great North Run day, when 55,000 runners rely on the service to get them back again at the end, they failed to put on any extra trains.” The local transport executive found the company was budgeting for the fines brought about by failure. They took the metro back in-house two years early at no extra cost. Forbes boasts of “a significant improvement in reliability”, an excellent relationship with unions and replacing old trains instead of leasing them. When North Tyneside was Tory-run, it was a Conservative flagship for massive outsourcing. But now the Labour-run council is taking services back, as “the contractors added cost, not value”. One bad contract has years more to run: “But we can’t afford £40m to buy it out, as there are punitive penalty clauses.” Again, they talk of private contract inflexibility and refusal to invest. Councils say neither writing nor trying to escape contracts is ever a level playing field, as they find themselves up against super-sharp company lawyers. In Redbridge, the council’s cabinet voted last week to bring back in-house their waste disposal services: the current Amey contract allows no waste food collection, and they complain about one badly drawn-up 25-year contract with “zero flexibility”. In Blackpool their Onyx contract runs out next year and they are taking waste disposal back: “No flexibility, not to collect Christmas trees or cardboard. They cost £3.8m and we can deliver better for £3.5m, and pay staff the real living wage, with money staying in our community.” West Sussex, Birmingham, Slough and scores more spanning political parties are now in-sourcing. Why? They complain of cost, and “red tape” – the traditional rightwing objection to the state. Talk to Reading and they boast of how, along with Nottingham, only they managed to hold onto their bus service in the monstrously misguided Thatcher deregulation. Both cities see rising bus use, falling almost everywhere else. Their profits are up, paid back into improvements. Other cities eye their success with envy.On Monday the Smith Institute launches a timely report, Out of contract: Time to move on from the “love-in” with outsourcing and PFI. It calls for an immediate pause in all public service contracting, plus a regulator to oversee a “Domesday Book” audit of all existing deals. It estimates £100bn is contracted out, but no one knows which contracts are good or bad value. Public managers are contracting in the dark, often with companies that are tax avoiders, and refuse to contribute to the state from which they cream profits. Last week the National Audit Office judged PFIs a dereliction of public value for money. Add to that the many famous failures of the near-cartel of big outsourcing providers: the probation service; G4S and Serco, fined over dishonest electronic tagging; the G4S Olympic security calamity; hospital cleaning, neither clean nor responsive; Capita failing GP back-office services; the failed courts translation service; shudders of alarm at Virgin Care taking over entire children’s and adult services. Stagecoach and Virgin will exit early from the East Coast mainline and will not pay the government as much as originally forecast, though when state-owned it made a good profit. Learndirect has failed apprentices. Look at how privatising care has led to the collapse of care homes. The UK does by far the most outsourcing in the EU, often to EU state-owned companies – yet it has worse services. Where is the border between sensible and senseless private involvement in public services? That’s always a wobbly line – no one expects the NHS to manufacture beds or drugs – but the old “private best” dogma has run out of road. Carpenter of Thurrock talks eloquently not just of money saved, but of Thurrock council as the largest local employer plugged into its community through its workforce: “They know the area, they are our eyes and ears and we need them to feel valued by us. I want them all – street sweepers, everyone – to be the friendly face of the council wherever they go.” Contracting out sees that public ethos swallowed up in boardrooms controlled by shareholders with no interest in the public good. No wonder renationalisation of utilities and rail has 80% support in polls. The questions will be how it’s done, at what cost and with what guarantees of future state investment. But those who imagine that Venezuela beckons if the state becomes preferred provider should listen to those councils struggling with the financial and social costs of runaway privatisation. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist • This article was amended on 23 January 2018 to clarify details relating to the Virgin/Stagecoach early exit from the East Coast mainline contract."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/21/sarah-ferguson-claims-45m-in-damages-from-murdochs-news-group","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T18:02:44Z","webTitle":"Sarah Ferguson claims £45m in damages from Murdoch’s News Group","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/21/sarah-ferguson-claims-45m-in-damages-from-murdochs-news-group","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/21/sarah-ferguson-claims-45m-in-damages-from-murdochs-news-group","fields":{"headline":"Sarah Ferguson claims £45m in damages from Murdoch’s News Group","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Sarah Ferguson has reportedly demanded about £45m from Rupert Murdoch, claiming the now defunct News of the World wrecked a series of business opportunities for her when its former reporter Mazher Mahmood caught her in a sting. The sum is significantly greater than the £25m the Duchess of York was said to have claimed when she initially sued News Group Newspapers, the former publisher of the paper, in 2016. In newly surfaced court documents, Ferguson reportedly claimed to have lost out on a deal with a private equity firm and work on a film project that would have made her millions of pounds.Additionally, Ferguson reportedly claimed to have had book deals in the works, while sales of an existing book were hit when she faced “international humiliation” after the sting. In 2010, Ferguson was secretly caught on camera apparently agreeing to set up a meeting between the undercover reporter, who was posing as a wealthy Indian businessman, and her ex-husband Prince Andrew. The footage, recorded by the reporter known as the “Fake Sheikh”, apparently showed her accepting £27,600 in advance, telling Mahmood: “I can open any door you want.” The Duchess of York has claimed Mahmood, who was later jailed for tampering with evidence relevant to an unrelated issue, tricked her into offering to introduce him to Prince Andrew for £500,000. According to the new court documents, seen by the Mail on Sunday, Ferguson claimed to have lost a deal with the British film executive Graham King to raise “funds for new projects of $125m [£90m]. The commission that would have been payable on funds raised was … £4,373,250”. But the deal fell though after the story ran. The paper quoted a source close to King as saying Ferguson’s recollection of the deal was “exaggerated”. King did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday. Ferguson also reportedly claimed to have lost out on a deal to find investors for a private equity firm that was “working to accomplish the merger of the Jaeger and Aquascutum fashion brands”, for which she expected to get a commission between £1m and £1.5m. She also planned to make millions working as a celebrity endorser and launching products under the name House of Ferguson, working on the animation project Sofi On Safari and a cartoon, Fergie’s Farm. Both News UK and Ferguson declined to comment on Sunday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/jan/21/how-best-to-leave-the-world-of-work-behind","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T17:39:17Z","webTitle":"How best to leave the world of work behind | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jan/21/how-best-to-leave-the-world-of-work-behind","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jan/21/how-best-to-leave-the-world-of-work-behind","fields":{"headline":"How best to leave the world of work behind","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Andy Beckett’s long read was elucidating and possibly prescient (Post-work: is the job finished?, 19 January). However, it’s not just a matter of whether workers can survive having the time and freedom of post-work but also how to manage the transition from one to the other. As a retiree of almost 70, most of my friends and I fill our days with meaningful activity alongside pleasurable family and leisure time. Nonetheless, some of them found it hard to make the switch. Fortunately the health service allowed me to cut down my job to half-time working at first, and this helped the process of letting go. Then, when leaving the NHS, I was fortunate to still have a private practice for a further six years, for which some of my friends envied me. They told me of the near trauma of stopping work being like falling off a cliff before they found new roles with which to challenge themselves and utilise their talents. Maybe what’s needed is a greater use of and tolerance towards job-sharing, in the private as well as the public sectors, where there is strong evidence that people are more productive when engaged in a range of purposeful activities. These can include mentoring the next generation of workers, in trying to achieve a viable work-life balance that suits each individual’s needs, as well as society’s. Ya’ir Z Klein London • A striking omission exists in Andy Beckett’s analysis of a post-work world, which also neatly illustrates the parallel universes that women and men often appear to inhabit. For years, ever since the 1980s when women again began to flood into the workplace, pioneers such as Anna Coote, Tess Gill and Harriet Harman have argued that part-time work, flexibility and job shares to fit around family commitments (and the high cost of childcare) shouldn’t have to mean that a woman forfeits aspirations and a career. So far, employers, in the main, have proved resistant. Again, in 2011, in Future Work, Alison Maitland and Peter Thomson demonstrated how in the corporate world a much-reduced working week and flexibility is healthier, more sustainable and as profitable as an addiction to work. Yet, workaholism rules. If Beckett had drawn on more women’s experiences, the extent of the battle against workaholism might have been better illustrated. If part-time work, now more than ever, too often means low pay and zero-hours contracts in a dead-end job with no career ladder, what real chance does post-work have? Yvonne Roberts London • Andy Beckett’s wonderful essay hit most of the essential issues in the discussion: the maldistribution of work, the culture and psychology of work, the radical political implications of workers with time on their hands, and the gendered nature of work and work resistance (though he was a little thin in that department). He missed one crucial consequence of reducing work, which is also a driving reason to move towards work reduction as quickly as possible, namely the ecological brink of collapse that the earth teeters on. To pull back from that abyss, we must drastically reduce the planet’s level of material production, as well as change the way work is accomplished and redistribute the wealth that production creates. That means slashing the amount of work the globe’s population does. Anything less will push Earth over the edge, if it hasn’t toppled already. Eva-Maria Swidler Faculty Goddard College, Vermont, US, Author of Radical Leisure • A problem when talking about human activity is that we have just the one word – “work” – to name several distinct types of endeavour. For example, Andy Beckett’s article itself, an essay that gave its author satisfaction and contributed to our culture, was exchanged for an income on publication. Yet this work is fundamentally different from the type of labour that no one aspires to, yet still provides an income. Art, science, sport, hobbies, tidying up after ourselves, mowing the lawn – all these activities, paid or not, prosaic or profound, we cover with the blanket term “work”. We do lots of different things; reaching for the stars cannot have the same name as that which destroys us. Peter Ostrowski Wickford, Essex • The radical thinkers imagining a world without work might have time on a Friday to read a 5,000-word article, but some of us have jobs to do that most certainly won’t be finished otherwise.

So the decisions of a school’s governing body responding to a grievance where the employee has been abused are unchallengeable, so long as the governors follow the school’s set procedure – which they have put in place themselves. The teaching unions know the best they can usually do is to get their member some pay-off to leave, including a gagging agreement, in return for a reasonable reference; no redress, no change.

The suggestion was that Smith was applying an illegal substance to the ball, something he denied after being shown a video of the incident during the post-match press conference. “It was all spit,” the 28-year-old said. “It’s the way I get spit from the side of my mouth and on the ball. “People said something about lip balm. If you look at my lips, they’re pretty dry!” Smith also called for changes in the way on-field umpires “soft signal” after he was on the wrong end of a contentious caught-behind decision. With Smith (45) and Mitchell Marsh (55) going well and Australia 181 for three in the 34th over chasing England’s 302 for six, man-of-the-match Jos Buttler took what looked a smart low catch to his right. Smith stood his ground but when the umpire Chris Gaffaney called for the video review, he indicated, with a “soft signal”, that his decision was out. Smith believes the process should be reviewed and more responsibility handed to the third umpire. “I’m not sure I’m a big fan,” he said. “It’s hard to overturn anything. The fielder goes up and sort of celebrates and they’re usually given out. I’d like for the third umpire to have to make the decision. He [Buttler] obviously thought it was out. He’s a pretty honest guy.” Buttler said: “I was pretty sure it was out. I think any wicketkeeper would tell you when they’ve got their fingers under it.” Meanwhile, Eoin Morgan believes England’s performance in the third ODI has shown his side are peaking towards the 2019 World Cup. On a pitch that challenged their dynamic batsmen, a score of 302 for six was posted and defended to seal victory by 16 runs and a 3-0 series lead. After coming unstuck on a similar surface in Cardiff during the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy semi-final, Morgan pointed to the contrast in displays then and here in Sydney. “Cardiff was a place versus Pakistan where reverse swing played a bit part,” the captain said. “And it did today as well. They got it going quite early. We responded exceptionally well. As a group, we gave a lot more.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/21/our-new-president-review-fake-news-buffet-slyly-links-trump-with-putin","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T16:08:58Z","webTitle":"Our New President review – fake news buffet slyly links Trump with Putin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/21/our-new-president-review-fake-news-buffet-slyly-links-trump-with-putin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/21/our-new-president-review-fake-news-buffet-slyly-links-trump-with-putin","fields":{"headline":"Our New President review – fake news buffet slyly links Trump with Putin","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Russian-American director Maxim Pozdorovkin delivers a sly slow-burning oddity in this documentary about Russia’s love for Donald Trump, made up entirely of state news clips and bizarre user-generated videos. It’ll annoy many with its refusal to take a stance beyond the absurdity of it all, but that lack of easy outrage makes it a true original. An important documentary for our times too, taking us deep into the heart of a bubble far from our own. Pozdorovkin has a structural purity to his film which is admirable, even if it doesn’t always make sense. Essentially an essay on Russian media and pop culture, he splits it into discrete chapters that are interchangeable and near-identical. Each makes the same point that Putin sees news broadcasting as a tool for ensuring love for the country, and in 2016 the main message he wanted to convey was that Clinton was bad and Trump was great. The film doesn’t attempt to speculate on why Putin might have done this so forcefully, and indeed suggests that the reasons don’t matter. In Putin’s Russia, what matters is that broadcasting is a medium for ensuring unity and the message itself doesn’t matter very much. There’s a lot of fun to be had – the terrible songs about Trump are highlights, especially a university lecturer whose military march composition would probably appeal to the man himself. Many Russians like to put on Trump masks and have a dance. Some toast his victory at home with vodka and elaborate speeches. There’s a lot more going on than laughing at the obscure corners of the Russian internet, however. The chutzpah of news anchors’ twisting of stories about Clinton makes the blood boil, and there’s layer upon layer of questioning of Russia Today’s veneer of respectability. There’s no doubt left that for Putin, RT is a key modern tool of genteel propaganda. Indeed, the most successful sections of the film might be when we leave the media intended for Russian audiences and see RT’s international channels. Correspondents and commenters with admirable careers of journalistic credibility appear to go weak at the knees when given the opportunity to present a Russo-centric analysis on the channel. Many viewers of the film won’t watch the channel regularly, they’ll come away fearing its influence and wondering how so many of its contributors are so easily used. Although Our New President advertises itself as being a film about Trump’s election, it’s saying something bigger and more frightening – we may think we are laughing at the naivety of Putin’s domestic audience, but he’s worked out how to dictate to an international audience as well. Those wanting a straightforward documentary listing Trump’s flaws or finding a smoking gun about Russian hacking will be disappointed, and for this reason it will divide opinion. There are some missteps, especially the opening and closing sections about the discovery of the bones of an ancient Russian princess – a confusing, if audacious, sideline which went over my head completely. For the most part, however, the strangeness of the film’s editorial choices is an asset – an irrational documentary for irrational times. As suggested in an opening quote from Philip K Dick, Putin’s Russia and Trump’s America rely not only on fake news, but also fake humans consuming it who are happy with the fakeness if it’s a good spectacle and a laugh. For making smart observations like this that creep up on one slowly, and maintaining constant interest in a film crafted with such complexity, Pozdorovkin is to be congratulated.

A loud buzzer: they don’t. “In our final round,” she says, “you guys write down things you think would matter … and while you’re writing, I’m just going to drink.” Cecily Strong writes: “Trump punches Pope.” Kate McKinnon: “He kills Olympics because flags are ‘gay’.” Kenan Thompson: “Sex tape with Don Jr.” Chastain: “Fox News would just report that he’s a family man.” Troye Sivan sings My My My! He looks like he just came in out of a rainstorm, but he dances beautifully. “Congratulations to Donald Trump, who managed to keep our government open for almost one year!’ says Colin Jost. It’s Weekend Update. Jost compares the government to production on House of Cards, which kept going when Kevin Spacey got fired: “In that fake government they got rid of the sexual predator president and got a female president instead.” Jost continues: “This week I got to Google Stormy Daniels on my work computer!” “The worst part about that Stormy Daniels story is that it was so lame,” Michael Che says. “The craziest thing that we got is that he was spanked with a magazine and he’s afraid of sharks. Well, of course he’s afraid of sharks: the man has the body of a seal.” Stormy Daniels (Strong) is here! “You’re kind of an unlikely ally for critics of Donald Trump,” Jost says. “Things are so bad right now,” she says, “women are trying to figure out how to be empowered by me … guess what America, I’m the hero you deserve right now.” Che turns to Trump’s tweeted claim that “black unemployment is at an all-time low”. He frowns. “I’m pretty sure before the civil war black unemployment was at, like, zero.” McKinnon joins as Robert Mueller, and her makeup job – intense contouring, or are those prosthetic cheekbones? – is hilarious enough before she starts speaking. “You just wait … you’ll see … we’re good. You gotta remember … I have actual footage … I wanna tell you SO bad, I can’t. It’s gonna be fun … the guy didn’t leave me a trail of breadcrumbs, here. He left me … full loaves.’ Next sketch: Jeff Bezos (Kyle Mooney) is talking to Alexa, interviewing cities for the next Amazon HQ. The Bezos impression is quite funny but the sketch isn’t. Another skit about women being stupid: Heidi Gardner and Chastain are two blondes at a Mexican restaurant who have resolved to be smarter in 2018 but can’t handle ordering two-for-one tacos. “I’m like so confused,” Chastain says. They consult an app. The punchline: they’re surgeons! How dare anyone assume otherwise? Ugh. In the final sketch, Leslie Jones and Chastain are lawyers in a movie. Thompson is their director and he has some notes, drawn from his time performing on The Jeffersons, playing “a tramp”. It’s weak, which is no doubt why it got this final slot. And that’s Saturday Night! Chastain closes the show in a Time’s Up T-shirt. That’s great, but couldn’t someone have written some sketches for her that laughed with women, not at them?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/21/the-guardian-view-on-sporting-diplomacy-scoring-not-shooting","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T17:55:13Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on sporting diplomacy: scoring not shooting | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/21/the-guardian-view-on-sporting-diplomacy-scoring-not-shooting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/21/the-guardian-view-on-sporting-diplomacy-scoring-not-shooting","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on sporting diplomacy: scoring not shooting","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Will a flag and half a dozen ice hockey sticks solve the nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula? Of course not. If, as planned, a joint North-South women’s team strides forth under a pro-unification flag at next month’s Winter Olympics in the South, it will be a very small step forwards. But that is one of the paradoxes on which all sports diplomacy rests – it matters because it does not matter. The idea of using sports to improve fraught relations dates back at least to the Olympic Truce reached in Ancient Greece, supposedly on the advice of the Oracle at Delphi. The monarchs of Elis, Pisa and Sparta agreed that the hosts, athletes and accompanying parties would be able to participate in the games without any risk. In the modern age, ping-pong diplomacy helped thaw cold war tensions between the US and China. Sport is powerful as a symbol of national identity and vigour that engages the public, often passionately. Yet set beside bigger conflicts it is comically irrelevant – and therefore much safer. A nation may feel embarrassed at a loss, but no one dies. A second paradox is that sports are about both competition and cooperation. George Orwell, writing a few years after the 1936 Berlin Olympics, took an exceptionally bleak view of international contests. Serious sport was “bound up with hatred, jealousy, boastfulness, disregard of all rules and sadistic pleasure in witnessing violence: in other words it is war minus the shooting,” he concluded. True, the symbolic power of sport can highlight breaches (like the US and Soviet Olympic boycotts in the 1980s) or even enlarge them (as when football hooligans trash a foreign city). Famously, the sporting boycott of South Africa during apartheid – wrongly defied by some British teams – helped bring about change. But you cannot unilaterally declare a match: you take on another nation only after they agree that you will do so. All sporting discord rests upon an underlying accord. And in the case of the Koreas, they are collaborating in competing against other nations. Despite an unexpectedly frosty reception from young people in the South, a joint team may yet create more sympathy for warming relations. Citizens whose cultures and economies have diverged so dramatically will join against a common foe. Sporting engagements do not create change; they happen when a shift is already under way. But they can provide a nudge, helping to sound out the other side, and prepare the public for a different kind of relationship. Kim Jong-un’s remark that he might send a team to the Winter Games indicated he was ready to de-escalate the crisis. The South, as host as well as participant, hopes the North’s involvement will prevent a provocation that would overshadow the event. In such calculations – rather than the bombastic pledges of international amity – lie sports diplomacy’s value. It creates a modest space for the pragmatic pursuit of national interests in a way that may, in the end, benefit others too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/21/tommy-fleetwood-abu-dhabi-rory-mcilroy-golf","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T13:55:20Z","webTitle":"Tommy Fleetwood defends Abu Dhabi title after holding off Rory McIlroy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/21/tommy-fleetwood-abu-dhabi-rory-mcilroy-golf","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/21/tommy-fleetwood-abu-dhabi-rory-mcilroy-golf","fields":{"headline":"Tommy Fleetwood defends Abu Dhabi title after holding off Rory McIlroy","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Nobody can accuse Tommy Fleetwood of doing things the easy way. Whereas 12 months ago the Southport man held off the challenge of Dustin Johnson to prevail in Abu Dhabi, this time it was Rory McIlroy who could not keep pace. Attention will fall on McIlroy not achieving the victory that looked highly likely for so long on his return to competitive action but Fleetwood’s brilliance when it mattered most should not be underestimated. Yet again. The Race to Dubai champion of last year secured a third tournament victory since the start of 2017 in a style that epitomised his stunning rise. In blustery winds, Fleetwood produced a Sunday 65 – including an inward half of 30 – to take the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship by two at 22 under par from Ross Fisher. McIlroy’s 70 meant a share of third with Matt Fitzpatrick at minus 18. That inspired back-nine run was key to Fleetwood’s success, with a sequence of five birdies in seven holes from the 10th proving more than McIlroy could handle. Fleetwood, who has identified putting as a professional weakness, holed out from 25ft and 35ft respectively at the 15th and 16th greens. Fisher needed an eagle on the last to force a play‑off, which proved beyond him. Fleetwood had spoken in effusive terms about McIlroy and Johnson, whom he partnered over the first two tournament days. Talk about having the last laugh; the perfect defence may catapult Fleetwood into the top 10 in the world rankings. Fleetwood, who has enjoyed marriage and fatherhood over the past year, may question if this fairytale is ever likely to end. “I feel a lot more emotional than last year,” Fleetwood said. “I don’t know why. I just really wanted to win this one. I had the year of my life last year. It’s a weird feeling coming to defend a trophy because it’s yours and you don’t want to give it away. Keeping hold of it for another year is very nice.” McIlroy’s dream scenario of victory on this, his return to action following an injury absence, was not to happen. Still, there was sufficient evidence over four days to suggest the Northern Irishman will end that barren run – which stretches back to September 2016 – before the Masters. On Abu Dhabi greens that have always proved a challenge to him, McIlroy was simply unable to convert enough fourth-round chances but was among the first to congratulate the 27-year-old Fleetwood. “It’s incredible,” McIlroy said of Fleetwood’s surge. “To put that round of golf together out there today; 65 in those conditions is seriously impressive and six under on the back nine when he needed to. He’s a great addition to the world of golf, a great addition to the European Tour and will be a great addition to the Ryder Cup team in September. “I’m really happy with how I played this week. My game is in really good shape and I saw some really, really positive signs. So I’m looking forward to next week in Dubai and obviously looking forward to the rest of the season.” McIlroy began the day one shot from the lead but found himself in a four‑way tie after making a birdie at the 2nd. In what was to prove a gripping afternoon, it was Fisher who thereafter grabbed the initiative. The former Ryder Cup player – who has legitimate aspirations of returning to that fold – reached the turn in 32 to lead by four. Trouble arrived for Fisher at the 10th, where he was forced into an excellent bogey save. He actually did little wrong thereafter, with Fleetwood pressing on the accelerator at precisely the right time to leave the others trailing. “Hats off to Tommy,” Fisher said. “I don’t feel like I’ve lost a tournament. Tommy’s gone out there and shot 65 and he’s won it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/21/gambling-ministers-urged-to-be-bold-with-curbs-on-fobts","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T16:03:28Z","webTitle":"Gambling: ministers urged to be bold with curbs on FOBTs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/21/gambling-ministers-urged-to-be-bold-with-curbs-on-fobts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/21/gambling-ministers-urged-to-be-bold-with-curbs-on-fobts","fields":{"headline":"Gambling: ministers urged to be bold with curbs on FOBTs","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Campaigners have urged the government to be bold in its response to the problem of fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) amid reports that a consultation on the issue closing this week will recommend slashing the maximum single bet from £100 to £2. The consultation, ordered by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) in October, is due to close on Tuesday. It will examine what reduced maximum stake should be imposed, with a stated range of between £50 and £2. While some bookmakers have said a £2 maximum could cause shops to close, campaigners have called for this amount to limit the losses from a highly addictive form of gambling in which 233,000 FOBT users each lost more than £1,000 in one sitting in 2016. The review was launched by Karen Bradley, but she became Northern Ireland secretary in this month’s reshuffle, with Matt Hancock, one of her junior ministers, promoted to replace her as culture secretary. Some anti-FOBT campaigners had feared this could see a less robust attitude taken towards gambling. Hancock’s West Suffolk constituency includes Newmarket racecourse, where he raced as an amateur jockey, and he has previously voted against tighter regulation. The Sunday Times said Hancock had now been persuaded by an “overwhelming” response to the consultation in favour of a £2 limit, with an unnamed ally of the minister saying he felt the machines took money from more mainstream betting. However, a source in Hancock’s department said no final decision had yet been taken. Carolyn Harris, the Swansea East Labour MP who leads an all-party group on the issue and has long campaigned for tougher limits, said she welcomed the signals that the government “looks set to finally see sense” on the issue. “A reduction in the stake to £2 would not just be a victory for common sense. It would be a victory for the thousands of people whose lives are blighted daily by these toxic machines,” she said. Harris has put together a cross-party letter to Theresa May to coincide with the end of the consultation, signed by her and other MPs from Labour, the Conservatives, SNP and DUP, as well as peers, the bishop of St Albans and experts and academics. The letter to be copied to Hancock and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, calls for the £2 limit and casts doubt on the reliability of data in a report sponsored by the Association of British Bookmakers detailing the supposed impact of a low limit on the industry. The letter says: “This government has stated its commitment to social justice. These machines are creating social injustice. They are having a direct impact on people and families across the country. They are harming the young and vulnerable in our society, whom we have a duty to protect.” John White, the chief executive of Bacta, the trade association for the amusement and gaming machine industry – which opposes FOBT machines – said he did not know whether a final decision had been taken. He said: “But it is hard to see on any objective assessment of the evidence that the government could reach any other conclusion than dropping the stake to £2 is the right decision. I have struggled to find any politician that doesn’t think that this reduction in stake on FOBTs is warranted.” A DCMS spokeswoman said: “We are clear that FOBT stakes will be cut to ensure we have a safe and sustainable industry where vulnerable people and children are protected. We are currently consulting on what the exact cut should be, and will make a final decision in due course once all the evidence has been considered.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2018/jan/21/uk-courts-service-spending-sees-tenfold-rise-since-2010","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T14:29:11Z","webTitle":"UK courts service spending sees tenfold rise since 2010","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/jan/21/uk-courts-service-spending-sees-tenfold-rise-since-2010","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2018/jan/21/uk-courts-service-spending-sees-tenfold-rise-since-2010","fields":{"headline":"UK courts service spending sees tenfold rise since 2010","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The courts service spent £50m last year on agency and contract staff, a more than tenfold rise since 2010 when it spent less than £4m, while courts have been closing at an unprecedented rate. The annual cost of temporary staff has rocketed over a period when the Ministry of Justice has suffered the deepest cuts of any Whitehall department and closed more than 220 courts across England and Wales. Part of the increase appears to be linked to a £1bn court modernisation programme aimed at transferring more court hearings online or operating them through remote video-links. More than £30m is being spent on external management consultants including PwC. The figures obtained by the shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, show that in the financial year 2010-11 when the coalition government came to power, the HM Courts and Tribunal Service (HMCTS) spent £3.7m on agency and contract staff. That figure has risen consistently and in 2016-17 stood at £50.6m. The scale of the expansion in external expenditure has been revealed through written parliamentary questions as the government faces criticism over outsourcing services after the collapse of Carillion. Burgon said: “Given that the MoJ is facing the deepest budget cuts of any government department, spending tens of millions of pounds more on agency staff is a false economy and a reckless use of resources. “A huge amount of staffing expertise and experience has been lost by axing thousands of courts staff and this simply cannot be replaced by becoming increasingly reliant on agency staff. As the Carillion case shows, it is time that the MoJ ended its reliance on outsourcing, privatisation and the use of agency work.” The numbers of HMCTS agency and contract staff in the period between 2011 and 2017 increased from 270 to 2,005. In a written answer, the MoJ said the expansion was due to the reform programme and a strategy to “maintain appropriate levels of workforce flexibility”. It anticipated that the numbers would decline. Last week the MoJ revealed that a further eight courts had been earmarked for sale. These are Wandsworth county court and Blackfriars crown court in London, and magistrates courts in Cambridge, Northallerton, Banbury, Maidenhead, Chorley and Fleetwood. The new justice minister Lucy Frazer said: “As we increase the use of digital services, it makes sense to consider the wider role and need for court buildings and assess whether some are still necessary to provide effective access to justice. Every penny raised will be put back into funding changes which will make justice easier to access for all at the same time as offering protections for the most vulnerable.” The announcement provoked dismay among legal professionals. John Bache, the chairman of the Magistrates Association, said: “Justice should, wherever possible, be administered locally and a significant programme of court closures in recent years has meant that many courts are already quite remote from the communities that they serve. Further court closures risk exacerbating this situation. “Video technology has a role to play but it is important that courts remain genuinely accessible to victims, witnesses and defendants who may want to attend in person, as well as to magistrates themselves, who cannot be expected to travel unreasonable distances to court on a regular basis.” Joe Egan, the president of the Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, said: “The government is spending a great deal of public money making the court estate fit for 21st-century justice, but the absence of a strategy is all too evident. Every time a court is closed, further pressure is placed on those courts, personnel and judiciary that remain.” Andrew Walker QC, the chair of the Bar Council, which represents barristers in England and Wales, said: “In light of the scale and pace of change, there are real concerns about the cumulative impact. If we are to ensure that we maintain effective access to local courts, then these further proposals must not be assessed in isolation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/21/observer-sudoku","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T00:01:05Z","webTitle":"Observer sudoku","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/21/observer-sudoku","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/21/observer-sudoku","fields":{"headline":"Observer sudoku","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Click here to access the print version Fill the grid using the numbers 1 to 9.

Age: Dates back to the 17th century, but in its present incarnation has been going since 2001. A pub, I assume. More gastronomic institution than pub: renovated by broadcaster Michael Parkinson and his son Nick; festooned with awards; Michelin-starred; and with a sous chef, Craig Johnston, who won last year’s MasterChef: The Professionals. Ah yes, I think I know it. The food there is excellent. Indeed, chilli jam and shellfish bisque, roast quail, pine nut puree, foie gras and leg bonbon, celeriac puree, parmesan-crusted stone bass ... All right, I get the picture. The menu must have changed a bit since I was last there. I think I had the chicken nuggets. Ah, you may be making a common error, confusing the Michelin-starred Royal Oak near Maidenhead with the somewhat less celebrated Royal Oak in Yateley, Hampshire, 20 miles away. No Michelin stars? The cheesy-topped nachos sharer and chick’n’dip crispy Louisiana chicken strips have yet to win over the notoriously fussy Michelin judges. So surely it would be hard to confuse the two. French president Emmanuel Macron managed it on his visit to the UK. After meeting a member of staff at the Maidenhead Royal Oak who hailed from the southern French town of Rodez, he tweeted: “From Rodez to Yateley, these young French people are living the partnership between our two countries.” How did the confusion arise? Yateley is very close to Sandhurst, where the Anglo-French summit was taking place, but Mrs May had chosen her Maidenhead constituency as the venue for lunch. Some mis-Googling and the language barrier may have caused the slip. Doesn’t bode well for Le Brexit. Indeed. We are slowly realising that we can’t have our roast chestnut bavarois/traditional apple crumble (delete according to which pub you go to) and eat it. Is it embarrassing? Only in the sense that Mrs May chose a pub where the tasting menu is £65, steak and chips £36, and a selection of cheeses £13.50. Hardly Austerity Britain. Yateley might have been a tad cheaper. Too right. Beef burned ends in BBQ sauce with Jack Daniel’s for just £3! They also have a “senior deal” where you can get three courses for £5.99. Perfect for Madame Macron. I’m not sure we can make that joke. Not to be confused with: Each other. Do say: “Something amusing in French.” Don’t say: “I bet Nigel Farage would have taken Macron to Yateley, and had the all-day breakfast and 15 pints.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/20/swansea-city-liverpool-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T09:00:48Z","webTitle":"Swansea City v Liverpool: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/20/swansea-city-liverpool-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/20/swansea-city-liverpool-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Swansea City v Liverpool: match preview","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Carlos Carvalhal strayed into “David and Goliath” territory when he was talking about this fixture, which provides a measure of what he feels Swansea are up against.

The Board of Deputies of British Jews met Mary Hassell, the senior coroner for inner north London, after she said she would not prioritise any death for religious reasons. Under Jewish and Islamic law, bodies must be buried on the day of death or as soon as possible afterwards. Both faiths also view invasive postmortems as desecration, preferring CT body scans and autopsies only as a last resort. Hassell’s jurisdiction covers Hackney, which has the biggest concentration of ultra-Orthodox Jews in Europe, and Tower Hamlets, the UK’s biggest Muslim community. The Board of Deputies and the Adath Yisrael Burial Society (ABYS) sought a meeting with Hassell in an attempt to resolve the dispute and persuade the coroner to withdraw the protocol, issued this month. “The early release of bodies for those families who want it – including Jewish families – is a fulfilment of the basic human rights of family life and religious practice,” said Marie Van Der Zyl, the board’s vice-president. “Not only is Ms Hassell failing to respect those rights, but she shows no inclination to do so. She has lost the confidence of the Jewish community, and appears to have no interest in winning it back.” The board plans to write to David Gauke, the lord chancellor and justice secretary, and Lord Burnett, the lord chief justice, to request Hassell’s removal from post. The relationship between Hassell and the orthodox Jewish community has been tense since the coroner took up her post in 2013, but it has come to a head in a dispute over the death of a Jewish man, Aharon Barzevski, 43, on 21 October 2017. The ABYS and Barzevski’s family accused the coroner of unnecessary foot-dragging in authorising a CT scan instead of an invasive autopsy, and therefore delaying the burial until four days after his death. Hassell said the delay was due to no out-of-hours service being available and staff shortages. She also accused Jewish community representatives of bullying her staff. She issued a protocol, under which “no death will be prioritised in any way over any other because of the religion of the deceased or family”. In a letter to lawyers for the ABYS and Barzevski’s relatives, Hassell said: “I believe the cab rank rule is the fairest way.” Hassell’s office has declined to comment on the dispute. The Judicial Conduct Investigations Office has confirmed it has received a formal complaint against the coroner."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/20/davos-2018-wef-hottest-topics-climate-change-harassment-donald-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T15:59:02Z","webTitle":"Climate change, AI and harassment – the hottest topics at this year’s Davos","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/20/davos-2018-wef-hottest-topics-climate-change-harassment-donald-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/20/davos-2018-wef-hottest-topics-climate-change-harassment-donald-trump","fields":{"headline":"Climate change, AI and harassment – the hottest topics at this year’s Davos","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Donald Trump will loom large at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos this week, as the self-styled anti-globalist joins the annual gathering of billionaires, business executives and politicians. The meeting at the luxury ski resort in the Swiss Alps at the start of each year is set to be dominated by the US president, who is due to give a special address to the conference on Friday. The official theme of this year’s forum is “creating a shared future in a fractured world”, which could have taken its cue from Trump alone. However, it does leave enough wiggle room to take in Brexit and the growing risks from technological advances, climate change and rising inequality. Political upheaval and rising populism will also be hot topics for the more than 2,500 delegates from the realms of business, politics, academia, the charity sector and the arts, plus the usual smattering of celebrities. These will be the themes to watch out for. Trump brings ‘America first’ to a global gathering The US president might enjoy the trappings of power and a billionaire’s lifestyle, like the most ardent of globalists at Davos, yet politically he has set himself up as the very opposite of the WEF and all that it stands for. The organisers set great store in “multi-stakeholder” solutions and the idea that global problems are best solved by countries working together – which makes the event an unlikely stomping ground for a president bent on isolationism and putting “America first”. Protectionism and the potential for the disruption of world trade and cooperation will be a hot topic all week. Klaus Schwab, the founder and executive chairman of the WEF, gave a thinly veiled warning to Trump at his pre-meeting press conference, arguing “no individual alone can solve the issues on the global agenda”. He said the world was at an inflection point where there was a “real danger of a collapse of our global systems”. That may be no bad thing for Trump, who has shown little love for global institutions. His keynote address just before the close of the meeting on Friday will be unmissable. The booming world economy Almost 10 years on from the financial crisis, and the global economy has got its mojo back. The International Monetary Fund will deliver its latest world economic outlook update on Monday from Davos, where there are sure to be questions about the sustainability of the current upswing. The IMF’s managing director, Christine Lagarde, will deliver the update and speak on several other panels throughout the week. The prospect of rising inflation and the removal of economic stimulus by central banks will be sure to feature prominently, while the theme of the conference – creating a shared future – will raise the issues of wealth and growing income inequality. The rise of the robots The increasing use of artificial intelligence, robotics and the automation of jobs has been a repeating theme at Davos, and this year is no different. The impact of AI will be one of the forum’s major events, with a one-to-one interview to be held between Schwab and the chief executive of Google, Sundar Pichai. The “fourth industrial revolution” will be a key theme once more, with a focus on how the loss of millions of jobs could undermine social cohesion. The way states respond to governing and taxing technologies and borderless business will be high on the agenda. Brexit sideshow Although unlikely to be a major theme at Davos this year, the annual summit will present UK ministers with an opportunity to rub shoulders with European leaders just before they pile into more substantive talks on trade later this year. Theresa May and Philip Hammond will be in attendance, while representatives from all 28 EU member states will also be heading to Davos, including the head of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the French president Emmanuel Macron. Labour’s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, will be making his first visit to Davos, planning to use the event as an opportunity to explain why the rules of the global economy need rewriting. May, on the other hand, will be expected to explain how Britain still matters on the global stage as it quits the EU. Climate-change risks to the fore Trump moved quickly to pull the US out of the Paris climate accords in one of his first acts as president last year. At Davos, where the environment is always among the most important issues up for debate, this won’t have gone down well. The former US vice-president Al Gore is attending and will speak on several panels, including one about how extreme weather events are proving more devastating and expensive. The WEF’s global risks perception survey, released last week, cited climate change-related issues as the top problems facing the world, while it also issued a thinly veiled warning to the US president that “nation-state unilateralism” will make it harder to combat change and ecological damage. Harvey Weinstein fallout comes into focus In the wake of the Harvey Weinstein sex abuse scandal, gender equality and issues such as bullying and harassment in the workplace will be in sharp focus at Davos this year. Business leaders have often talked about encouraging diversity in the past, although are also accused of having made very little headway. Women will only account for 21% of all of the participants this year. At least three sessions will directly tackle the problems facing women at work, including one with the Microsoft executive Peggy Johnson and Canadian minister for the status of women, Maryam Monsef, titled “Gender, power and stemming sexual harassment”. Helping the developing world More than a third of participants come from developing or emerging economies, while the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, will address the opening plenary. Humanitarian crises are on the agenda, with the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees out of Myanmar likely to feature prominently, as the forum considers the outlook for 2018. The actor Cate Blanchett, who alongside Elton John has won a prize designated for artists who best represent the “spirit of Davos”, will speak to raise awareness about the refugee crisis. Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani student who fights for education and women’s rights, will also speak about the importance of education and equal opportunities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jan/19/banksy-painting-saved-from-derelict-container-on-dungeness-beach","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T15:53:59Z","webTitle":"Banksy painting saved from derelict container on Dungeness beach","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/19/banksy-painting-saved-from-derelict-container-on-dungeness-beach","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/19/banksy-painting-saved-from-derelict-container-on-dungeness-beach","fields":{"headline":"Banksy painting saved from derelict container on Dungeness beach","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"An authentic Banksy image has been recovered from a derelict container on Dungeness beach in Kent after fears it could be destroyed by the landowners. The elusive graffiti artist created the image, which depicts a bird with a head made of a petrol-pump nozzle, as an indictment of world pollution by oil companies. The site’s owners, EDF Energy, had reportedly warned locals of their intention to clean up the beach, which would have involved destroying the container – and therefore the Banksy. Fearing that time was of the essence, a local fisherman who owned the container sold it to John Brandler, a Banksy specialist and dealer, who has ensured its survival. The picture, which measures about 8ft by 4ft (2.5 x 1.25 metres), was created in 2004. It was a sequel to a previous 2001 work – a bird perched on a branch – on the same derelict container, which had been stolen – cut from the side of the container – 12 days after its completion. The second version had been preserved from the harsh sea air because a local fisherman had painted over it. Brandler told the Guardian: “It was getting a lot of attention and bringing people on to the beach where the fishermen wanted to sell fish. Just after it was painted, someone threw a can of white household paint over it. The owner, because he was using the container as an office, just left it. Then EDF Energy wanted to tidy up the beach … He knew that if [they] sent a team of men … they would crush and destroy everything.” He added: “EDF told the fishermen that they were going to tidy up the beach because it’s a nature reserve – which is rather ironic bearing in mind that this picture is all about the petro-chemical industry causing disasters … and birds being killed by petrol.” Brandler removed the picture from the container with the help of independent construction recyclists Land Logical. The Dartford-based company used specialist equipment to salvage the container, recycling its metal and wood. The restoration has cost him a “shedload of money”, he said, but the work is likely to be worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. He hopes that it will remain in the UK and is exhibiting it at the Brandler Galleries in Brentwood, Essex. Last summer, Brandler helped save another Banksy painting that had appeared on a public toilet block in east London, only for it to disappear after it was vandalised, spray-jetted by the local council and then painted over. Banksy, known for his stencil-based images, describes himself as a “quality vandal”, poking fun at authority figures through artworks in public places. Such is his popularity with the public that his Girl with Balloon – in which a child watches her heart-shaped balloon float away – was last year voted Britain’s best-loved work of art, ahead of masterpieces such as Constable’s painting The Hay Wain. An EDF spokesman declined to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/19/leicester-city-watford-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T15:05:44Z","webTitle":"Leicester City v Watford: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/19/leicester-city-watford-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/19/leicester-city-watford-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Leicester City v Watford: match preview","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Claude Puel says it will be “the beginning of the end” if Leicester start thinking of trying to qualify for the Europa League, although their supporters could be forgiven for wondering if that is a possibility, especially if the team can maintain the sort of form they showed against Chelsea last Saturday.

Stephens has a dig from just inside the Chelsea box, but Azpilicueta and Caballero combine to deny him. And that’s that. On another day, Brighton could have had a penalty, maybe a goal or two. They played well in patches. But they didn’t have the luck, and no decisions went their way. And they started cold, Chelsea punishing them severely. Then the class of the English champions told during the latter stages. Antonio Conte’s men have ended a barren run with a stylish goalfest, and they join Manchester United on 50 points, for a couple of hours at least. The man of the match, the ever-sensational Eden Hazard, gifts his top to a young lad in the crowd, a lovely end to a fine afternoon for Chelsea. Not such a happy ending for Brighton, who are slipping towards relegation bother. 90 min: Kayal crosses from the right. Murray flashes a header over the crossbar. A consolation goal wouldn’t flatter Brighton, who have played well. They’ve just been undone by the class of Chelsea. Musonda, quarterbacking from deep, loops a stunning pass down the centre to pick out Moses, cutting in from the right. He’s clear on goal. He takes a touch and guides the ball into the bottom right. A lovely goal! 88 min: Musonda elects to pull the ball back for Moses, instead of launching it into the mixer. It eventually ends up at Cabellero’s feet. A waste of an opportunity, not that it matters one jot. 87 min: Musonda drives elegantly down the right and is upended by Propper. A free kick, and a chance to pile into the Brighton box. 86 min: The travelling Chelsea support are running through their songbook. Carefree, wherever they may be. The Brighton fans entertain themselves by trilling abusive observations about Crystal Palace. Everyone’s happy right now, in their own way. 84 min: Izquierdo races down the left with a view to outstripping Azpilicueta, but a heavy touch runs the ball out of play. 83 min: Marsh is replaced by Izquierdo. 81 min: The wonderful Willian is replaced by the 21-year-old Belgian Charly Musonda. 80 min: Yes, this match was never going to finish 0-2. Though it took a while. 79 min: Goldson completes a miserable couple of minutes by picking up a booking for obstructing Hazard. Luiz tries to send the free kick into the top left from 35 yards. Ambitious, even for him. A lovely solo dribble by Hazard, who is sent scampering down the left by Willian. He drifts inside. Goldson runs away from him, as opposed to putting in a challenge, and suddenly the Brighton defence opens up in the generous fashion. Hazard has acres to run into down the middle. He enters the box, and calmly rolls the ball into the bottom left. Chelsea will be joining Manchester United in second spot on 50 points, for a couple of hours at least. 76 min: Chelsea made their second change. Zappacosta comes on for Alonso. 74 min: Batshuayi gets involved in a garden-variety tangle with Dunk, and briefly considers pushing his head into his opponent’s mush, then thinks better of it. The ref tells him to stop playing silly buggers and calm down. A little flashpoint out of nothing. It hasn’t been that sort of game. 72 min: March tries to bustle his way through the middle, and very nearly works space to shoot on the edge of the Chelsea D. But he loses balance - with a little bit of encouragement from Kante - and Chelsea mop up. March wants a free kick, but he’s not getting it. 70 min: The ever-busy Propper robs Willian in the middle of the park and starts a move that sends Brighton into the Chelsea box. Murray can’t quite control to shoot; Schelotto has a whack that’s blocked the second it leaves his boot. Batshuayi threatens to tear clear on the break, but Duffy puts a stop to his gallop. This is a very open, entertaining match! 68 min: Brighton make a double change: Gross and Hemed off, Kayal and Murray on. 66 min: And then suddenly Brighton spring into life! Gross makes a nuisance of himself under a high ball. Rudiger only half clears with his header. Schelotto bursts in from the right, chests the ball down, and suddenly he’s one on one in the area with Caballero! But the keeper spreads himself brilliantly and saves Chelsea’s bacon. I repeat: how has this game stayed 0-2? 65 min: Moses probes down the Chelsea right but can’t make room to deliver a cross. The game’s slipped into a lull. 63 min: Chelsea break upfield straight from Brighton’s corner, Willian feeding Hazard down the left. Hazard enters the box and looks briefly threatening, but then runs the ball out of play. End-to-end fun. 62 min: Space for March down the inside-right, Brighton having put a few nice passes together to advance upfield. He looks for the top right, but the ball deflects off Luiz and out for a corner. 60 min: How on earth has this game stayed at 0-2? The woodwork has been bothered at both ends, and there have been three penalty shouts that on another day could have been given. The punters have had their money’s worth today. 58 min: But before the free kick can be taken, referee Jon Moss ushers a confused looking Christensen to the sidelines. The defender can’t continue. Luiz comes on in his stead. Willian then takes the free kick, sending the ball towards the top right. Ryan, at full stretch, pushes it onto the post, and the danger is cleared. 56 min: Hazard goes on a brisk meander down the middle of the park. He’s stopped by a crunching Stephens tackle. But he springs up and goes again. This time he’s scythed down by Duffy, who is booked. A free kick in a dangerous, central position, 25 yards out. 54 min: Brighton are first to everything right now, though most of the game is being played out in the middle of the park. They’ve been impressive today, those costly (and admittedly rather important) first six minutes aside. 52 min: Christensen is back on. Brighton are on the front foot. Chelsea have not looked comfortable when dealing with crosses. 50 min: Brighton hit the post! Schelotto jinks down the right and whips a deliciously inviting cross into the Chelsea box. Propper throws himself at it, and guides a header towards the top right. Caballero is beaten all ends up, but the ball crashes off the upright and away from danger! So unlucky! 49 min: And there’s a stoppage as Duffy and Christensen require some treatment after clashing heads. The Chelsea man has come off worse; he looks pained and a little dazed. He ambles off the pitch though all signs suggest he’ll be waved back on soon. 47 min: A free kick for Brighton down the left and a chance to load the Chelsea box. Suttner curls it into the six-yard box. Duffy flings himself at the ball but only succeeds in clattering into Christensen. Free kick, he’s offside. 46 min: A loose pass from Duffy sets Chelsea on the attack again almost immediately. Hazard threatens to break down the middle. Then Moses has a look down the right. Nothing doing. But Brighton can’t afford to start the second half as slowly as they did the first. And we’re off again! Brighton get the game restarted. No changes. The rain is still coming down. Half-time listening: Lee Calvert, Gary Naylor and Rob Smyth reminiscing about Italia 90? What could you possibly be waiting for?! Hazard dribbles into the area from the right, and jinks past Suttner. There’s the slightest contact, and Hazard goes down. It would have been a harsh decision, but then you’ve seen them given. The third penalty claim of the half! And all ignored. So a slightly strange half of football comes to an end. Chelsea flew out of the blocks, and could have added more goals to their total. Brighton will argue that they should have had at least one spot kick, while Cabellero made a stunning stop on the line from Hemed. Pretty fine entertainment, all in all. You’ll not want to miss the second half, in which anything could happen. 44 min: Then they suddenly break upfield through Willian, who shuttles the ball down the right for Batshuayi. The striker spins on the edge of the box and slashes a first-time effort towards the top left. It’s high and wide, but not so far off target. 43 min: Chelsea take the sting out of the game by stroking the ball around in the centre circle awhile. 41 min: Chelsea go very close to a third. Batshuayi has a dig from the edge of the D. It’s blocked, but the ball finds its way to Hazard on the left. Hazard enters the area and hits a cross-cum-shot that Moses can’t quite turn in at the far post. 40 min: Christensen plays a poor one out of defence and Brighton are once more on the attack. Propper tries to open Chelsea up with a backheel down the left, a clever idea that doesn’t quite come off. Nearly. 38 min: Chelsea suddenly look slightly less effective going forward. Batshuayi latches onto a loose ball in the middle of the park and drives upfield, but then sprays what should be a simple pass to Hazard on his left out of play for a throw. 37 min: Brighton are flinging crosses into the Chelsea box from left and right, and the visitors aren’t looking totally solid right now. Caballero has been a bit flappy. 35 min: Another penalty shout for Brighton! And again it’s Schelotto breaking into the box from the right. He goes over in a tangle with Bakayoko. Referee Jon Moss decides it was a 50-50 coming together, and isn’t giving that one either. Then he books Schelotto for arguing the toss. The home crowd are livid, and the Brighton players aren’t too happy either. 33 min: Another corner for Brighton on the right. Duffy meets this one, six yards out, but doesn’t connect properly and the ball flashes wide left. A chance spurned, though in fairness Alonso was seriously hassling him. 30 min: And yet Brighton, on another day, could be level. Add to the earlier penalty controversy this amazing save by Caballero, Hamed meeting a right-wing Gross cross with a header down towards the bottom left. Caballero somehow stops the brilliant effort on the line. It’s not quite Pele v Gordon Banks, but it’s in the very rough ballpark, and it’s some pretty great football all round. Nothing comes of the resulting corner. 28 min: Hazard embarks on a Maradonaesque dribble down the middle of the park. He thinks about shaping one into the top right from the edge of the area. Shame he didn’t, it would have been a classic goal. Instead he feeds Batshuayi on his right. The striker shoots; Ryan saves; the resulting corner is wasted. But Chelsea are back to their scintillating best. 26 min: Hazard slips a pass down the right to release Willian, Brighton’s offside trap all over the shop. Willian has a batter at goal, and very nearly finds the top right. Ryan parries. Corner. Hazard dances around in the area for a while, then tries to bust Moses into space on the right. He overcooks the pass, and that’s a goal kick. Chelsea look incredibly potent today. 25 min: A free kick for Brighton out on the right, and a chance for the home side to load the Chelsea box. Gross curls it into the mixer, but Hemed can’t get his head on it. Chelsea clear. 23 min: Hazard and Willian nearly open Brighton up again down the inside-right channel. One loose pass at the crucial moment nixes the move. Brighton are living on their nerves at the back. “Allow me to be the 567th pedant to say it should be 1.4 billion pennies for his thoughts (11 min).” Be my guest, Mike McCarthy. I’m not good at the number counting. 20 min: Brighton win their first corner of the game down the right. That one leads to a corner on the left. From that one, Caballero comes off his line and makes a complete balls of a punch. Duffy wins the header on the six-yard line and the ball’s bouncing around the area with the keeper stranded. The referee saves the day for Chelsea, by blowing up for a foul on the keeper that didn’t really happen. A shaky start for Caballero on his Premier League debut for Chelsea. And this is much better from Brighton, who have finally turned up to play. 18 min: Having been very fortunate with the penalty non-decision, Chelsea go up the other end and nearly make it three. Bakayoko bashes towards the bottom right from the edge of the box, and Ryan does very well to push the ball away from danger. 16 min: Brighton claim for a penalty as Caballero races off his line and fails to gather Suttner’s cross from the left. Schelotto romps into the box down the inside-right channel, knocking the ball past the keeper. There’s contact, and the Brighton man goes down. But the referee isn’t having any of it. 14 min: This is nice, though, as March executes a brisk Cruyff Turn to spin his way past Bakayoko and make good down the inside-right channel. He looks to thread a shot into the bottom left, but Caballero gets down and gathers well on a greasy pitch. 13 min: Chelsea stroke the ball around the middle of the park. Hazard and Willian take turns to perform elaborate backflicks as the English champions put on a stylish show. Brighton are chasing shadows. 11 min: They hold firm. In the stand, Jürgen Locadia is chewing gum hard and frowning quite a lot. Fourteen million pennies for his thoughts right now. 10 min: Willian is in a no-nonsense mood today. He drives at purpose down the inside left and feeds Alonso, who earns a corner off Goldson. Brighton have already conceded 12 goals from corners this season, the worst record in the Premier League. They really need to hold firm here. 8 min: The home fans are stunned. The only noise is coming from the Chelsea corner, much as you’d imagine. Brighton try to steady the ship with some crisp passing of their own in the opposition half, but Chelsea hold their shape and neither March nor Hemed can fashion space for a shot from the edge of the box. This is a gorgeous goal! Willian drives down the middle and offloads to Hazard, who instigates some pretty triangles with Batshuayi. Willian then gets involved in the ping-fest. More triangles. Then Willian finds a bit of space and slams a rising shot into the top right! What a start this is by Chelsea! Goals have been hard to come by ... but no longer! 5 min: Chelsea always win when they take the lead. They’re 13 wins out of 13 this season. Brighton meanwhile have lost nine of 11 when conceding first. The form book suggests this game is already over, then. But Brighton won’t be going down without a fight, and Gross has a belt from distance. Over the bar. Chelsea have been struggling for goals recently, so this will do them very nicely. Willian and Moses take turns to dribble down the right. Moses reaches the byline and pulls one back for Hazard on the penalty spot. Stephens and Dunk try to intercept the pass, but no luck. Hazard takes a touch, shifts the ball to the right, and lashes into the top left! 2 min: The rain is coming down hard on the south coast. Chelsea ping the ball about awhile. Stephens tries to stop a Hazard dribble and upends his man. An early free kick for the visitors deep in Brighton territory, in a fairly central position. Chelsea load the box, but Willian goes for goal from the best part of 30 yards. He looks for the top right but wafts his effort straight down Ryan’s throat. And we’re off! Chelsea get the 150th league game at this lovely new stadium underway. But only after a bittersweet minute of the warmest applause in memory of the late, great Cyrille Regis. The teams are out! Brighton &amp; Hove Albion are in their blue-and-white-striped tops, which forces Chelsea into third-choice black. A rare old atmosphere at the Falmer Stadium, as ever, despite the hazy rain; Locadia taking to the pitch in his civvies for an introductory clap to all corners is met with a particularly huge roar. We’ll be off in a minute! Antonio Conte speaks! “Every game is different. We will try to be focused offensively, and focused defensively. We will try to get three points, it’s the most important thing today.” One day I’ll stop transcribing these pre-match interviews, and you’ll probably thank me for it. Chris Hughton speaks! “We have had a decent level of performance against the top teams, but we haven’t scored any goals against them, and so we haven’t won any of the games. So sometimes as a manager you try to do something a little bit different. We are at home, we have a chance in every game. We will certainly have a go.” We won’t be seeing him on the pitch today - in fact he’s injured and won’t be available for a couple of weeks - but Brighton’s new £14m record signing Jürgen Locadia is in the house, and he’s been talking to Sky Sports: “This move is crazy, it was all a dream, I’m glad I’m in the Premier League now. I’m obsessed with football and watch every Premier League game at home, so it’s crazy to be here. I bring power, precision, goals, assists and a lot of energy. I can shoot with my right and left foot, and have lot of ability to score a goal. I don’t think about the price.” He looks and sounds like he means business. Brighton fans will be extremely excited. Brighton weren’t able to register their new signing Jürgen Locadia in time for this match. Nevertheless, they still make five changes to the team that went down 2-0 at West Bromwich Albion last week. Connor Goldson, Ezequiel Schelotto, Markus Suttner, Solly March and Tomer Hemed replace Gaetan Bong, Jose Izquierdo, Bruno, Anthony Knockaert and Glenn FFS Murray. Chelsea have all manner of concerns. Pedro and Alvaro Morata are suspended after their red cards against Norwich City in the cup; Thibaut Courtois, Cesc Fabregas and Gary Cahill are all injured. Willy Caballero makes his Premier League debut for the club, while Ross Barkley is seen in a Chelsea shirt for the first time, albeit on the bench. There are six changes to the team sent out against Norwich midweek: Eden Hazard, Marcos Alonso, Antonio Rudiger, Andreas Christensen, Victor Moses and N’Golo Kane take the places of Davide Zappacosta, David Luiz, Danny Drinkwater, Kenedy, Ethan Ampadu and naughty Pedro. Brighton &amp; Hove Albion: Ryan, Goldson, Duffy, Dunk, Suttner, Schelotto, Stephens, Propper, March, Gross, Hemed. Subs: Hunemeier, Kayal, Baldock, Murray, Izquierdo, Rosenior, Krul. Chelsea: Caballero, Azpilicueta, Christensen, Rudiger, Moses, Kante, Bakayoko, Alonso, Willian, Batshuayi, Hazard. Subs: Barkley, Musonda, Zappacosta, Luiz, Eduardo, Ampadu, Sterling. Referee: Jonathan Moss (County Durham). Neither of these teams are in the goals. Brighton have scored just three in their last eight Premier League matches, while Chelsea have only managed one in their previous four league and cup fixtures. And form comes at a premium too. Brighton have only won three games since the start of November; Chelsea haven’t tasted victory in a match in 2018 yet, one FA Cup penalty shootout aside. But there’s always hope. Brighton will take succour from the fact they’ve only lost two of their 11 Premier League matches at the Amex all season; Chelsea will be buoyed by the way they saw off the Seagulls easily enough on Boxing Day. Chelsea will be hot favourites this lunchtime: despite that recent indifferent form, they’re the English champions, after all. And they haven’t been beaten by Brighton since January 1933, when they were knocked out of the FA Cup on the same day Herbert Chapman’s Arsenal were famously felled by Walsall. But long unbeaten runs are there to be broken, aren’t they, and Brighton will fancy their chances of a long-overdue win against out-of-sorts opponents. It promises to be a fascinating duel. It’s on! Kick off: 12.30pm GMT."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/19/jacinda-ardern-new-zealand-will-help-us-raise-our-child","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T17:00:23Z","webTitle":"Jacinda Ardern: 'New Zealand will help us raise our child'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/19/jacinda-ardern-new-zealand-will-help-us-raise-our-child","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/19/jacinda-ardern-new-zealand-will-help-us-raise-our-child","fields":{"headline":"Jacinda Ardern: 'New Zealand will help us raise our child'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Having found herself in the midst of tough coalition negotiations after a closely fought election, Jacinda Ardern was facing far more than her political colleagues could have guessed. Six days before becoming New Zealand’s prime minister-elect, the Labour leader discovered she was pregnant, but was desperate to keep it, and the accompanying morning sickness, a secret during the post-election maelstrom. Asked how she managed, Ardern replied: “It’s just what ladies do”, evoking the sympathy of women the world over who just get on with it while struggling with first-trimester nausea. The 37-year-old worried her staff might notice she was eating constantly, and only the same foods. “But no,” she revealed, “apparently people thought I was just a woman of odd habits,” she told stuff.co.nz. No one, it seems, rumbled her. “None of them noticed I had pretty bad morning sickness while negotiating our government,” she told Sky News. News that Ardern will give birth in June – shortly after which her television producer partner, Clarke Gayford, will become the primary caregiver – has been hailed as a thrilling landmark. “Exciting news!” tweeted Labour’s Harriet Harman, the UK’s longest-serving female MP and the first pregnant candidate to win an election in 1982. “Pregnant prime minister &amp; stay at home dad! New Zealand leads the way! Congrats all round.” Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the announcement, though foremost a personal moment for Ardern, “also helps demonstrate to young women that holding leadership positions needn’t be a barrier to having children (if you want to)”. And the former UK Green party leader Natalie Bennett saw it as “another landmark passed for women in politics”. Ardern said she did not think her position was that different to others’. “I’m not a trailblazer,” she said. “I am not the first woman to multitask. I am not the first woman to work and have a baby. I know these are special circumstances but there will be many women who will have done this well before I have. “And, New Zealand is going to help us raise our first child … I think it’s fair to say that this will be a wee one that a village will raise, but we couldn’t be more excited.” Ardern, once a policy adviser to the former British prime minister Tony Blair, broke the news on Instagram and Facebook, posting a photograph of three fish hooks, two large and one small, in reference to Gayford’s passion for fishing. He is host of the popular TV show Fish of the Day. In the post she said: “I’ll be prime minister and a mum, and Clarke will be ‘first man of fishing’ and stay at home dad. I think it’s fair to say that this will be a wee one that a village will raise, but we couldn’t be more excited.” She will take six weeks’ maternity leave – rather that the 22 weeks of paid paternal leave to which New Zealanders are entitled – during which the deputy prime minister, Winston Peters, will take over. She will, however, remain “fully contactable” throughout, and intends to resume full prime ministerial duties on her return. Ardern is one of only a handful of world leaders to give birth in office. Pakistan’s Benazir Bhutto delivered her second child while in office in 1990. Ardern and Gayford had been told they needed help conceiving, and put plans on hold when she was promoted to Labour leader in August. They discovered she was pregnant on 13 October and she was sworn in as prime minister two weeks later. Asked if the news had weighed on her during coalition negotiations with the New Zealand First party, she replied: “I am human. Whose mind wouldn’t it play on?” The couple, however, were delighted with the news. “We wanted a family, but weren’t sure it would happen for us, which has made this news unexpected but exciting,” she said. Within days of becoming Labour leader, Ardern was twice asked by television hosts about her plans for children. One questioned whether it was acceptable for the country’s leader to take maternity leave while in office, claiming most employers would want to know about their workers’ maternity plans. Ardern, who had previously talked about the difficulties of juggling political life with wanting to start a family, made clear such questions were “unacceptable” in the workplace in 2017. Before becoming New Zealand’s youngest prime minister since 1856, and its third female leader, she acknowledged it would be “difficult” to be a parent as well, but said: “I don’t think they are mutually exclusive” and “if we want parliament to reflect New Zealand as a society, then we should be able to accommodate both”. The former prime minister Helen Clark, tweeted her congratulations, adding: “Every woman should have the choice of combining family and career.” In New Zealand, which in 1893 became the first country in the world to give women the right to vote, the people seem proud of once more putting equality on the world map. Ardern, meanwhile, is insistent her maternal responsibilities will not conflict with those to her country, and she will deliver on both. “I know, because of who I am, that I will do the job that I’ve been asked to do, that I have a mandate to do. Nothing’s going to change that.” • This article was amended on 29 January 2018 to correct a misspelling of Helen Clark’s surname from Clarke."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jan/21/land-we-live-in-land-left-behind-review-hauser-wirth-somerset","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T12:25:02Z","webTitle":"The Land We Live In – The Land We Left Behind review: Bilbo Baggins with mulch and menace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/21/land-we-live-in-land-left-behind-review-hauser-wirth-somerset","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/21/land-we-live-in-land-left-behind-review-hauser-wirth-somerset","fields":{"headline":"The Land We Live In – The Land We Left Behind review: Bilbo Baggins with mulch and menace","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It is all going down at Durslade Farm, Hauser &amp; Wirth’s Somerset art venture. There will be cheese-making. There will be baking and wood-fired oven demonstrations. Goats shall be milked. Fernando García-Dory’s Goat Pavilion project, devised with Hayatsu Architects, opens The Land We Live In – The Land We Left Behind. Curated by Adam Sutherland, director of Grizedale Arts in the Lake District, the show, with its theme of society’s contradictory relationship with the rural, is full of promise. The title itself is a migrant’s drinking toast, and encapsulates feelings of hope and longing. The goat man arrived with his goats, ready to install them on a specially designed climbing frame on a lawn between the buildings. The goats are meant to clamber about and socialise. But the pitch of the steps and ramps are too steep for the larger animals, and the goat farmer thinks they would churn up the lawn to a muddy morass in no time at all if given the chance. It was raining. Goats don’t like the wet and wouldn’t leave their trailer. Someone should have asked the farmer, a local top man in his field, or possibly the goats themselves, but they didn’t. Back indoors, the tilapia look happy enough in their tanks, swimming about, excavating nests in the gravel, crapping. Their droppings are providing nourishment for the lettuces and other green stuff growing in trays above the tanks, in a project by the Sweet Water Foundation. Eric Sjödin is growing more green stuff, azolla weed, on the surface of water-filled trays nearby. Tilapia and azolla weed. Yum. But the most disturbing thing by far in the first gallery are the rows of jars of pickled eggs and gherkins. I have always had my doubts about the pickled egg, which reminds me of things people have had surgically removed and kept in jars of formaldehyde as souvenirs of operations. Next to them, Carsten Höller’s giant models of fly agaric fungi (the red and white toadstools beloved of myth, shamanism and fairy tales) look positively benign. Sutherland believes that art, and galleries, should be socially useful. In its way, so is H&amp;W’s Somerset operation. The Land We Live In is full artworks and agricultural knickknacks, abandoned dinners, straw and soil, back-to-the-land proto-fascists, wonderful things and terrible things. Here come William Blake and Samuel Palmer, William Morris and Diderot. Even Bilbo bloody Baggins is here, in a rather well done illustration by a teenage Jimmy Cauty, who went on to distinguish himself in the KLF and the Orb. Boot-scrapers and pitchforks, mulch and menace, and a huge pair of evil looking pincers are on display. The wooden pincers are designed for pulling ragwort, should you have need. I imagine them in the hands of the bad guys, in movie stills of violent country-folk in Sam Peckinpah’s Straw Dogs, and the mean mountain men from John Boorman’s Deliverance. Delights like this, lining the walls and in vitrines, stop the exhibition from getting too worthy. Here are Marcus Coates’s bronze casts of British mammal scat. The rabbits have done it all over a book in one vitrine. This is one of the curator’s little jokes, as, I suppose, is the great mound of compost in the largest gallery. During the show, Coates will perform in a suit made of apples, while Bedwyr Williams is on his rock, in a photo titled Bard Attitude, from 2005, wildly hirsute and plucking manfully at a harp. One of the problems of this exhibition is that so much of the context is provided not by wall labels or a proper catalogue, but by supporting anecdotes, which the gallery staff are currently being trained to recount. Looking alone can leave one mystified. The whole thing is best regarded as freewheeling illustrated lecture. Without the talk, it is often difficult to know what one is looking at. Hung high above a door, a Grayson Perry map cannot be read. Nor can Thomas Rowlandson’s hand-coloured etchings. Knowing they are here is not enough. I gawp over the vitrines, with their farmers’ smocks and photos of games where people dress up as picturesque labourers, engravings of Druids at Stonehenge, a Bernard Leach tankard and John Ruskin’s enlarged models of bird feathers (used by the critic as lecture aids). We go from Ruskin to the wicker man, from a Paul Nash painting of the Malvern Hills to Beatrix Potter’s delicate drawing of absidia fungal spores, then to a horrible Thomas Kinkade sylvan landscape painting, with Disney cartoon animals doing their thing in the great outdoors. My eye snags on the red admiral butterfly at rest on a dish of pig’s trotters, in a 1615 still life by Jacob van Hulsdonck, and the model of a death’s head hawk moth sits on the lid of a fanciful tureen on a dining table where a reconstruction of a gothic meal has been laid out. Black pasta slithers from bowls. A lone figure clambers through a nightmarish hellscape by English visionary painter John Martin and, if this were not enough to put you off your dinner, a wall-sized projection of Nikolaus Geyrhalter’s 2005 film Our Daily Bread, which shows us the reality of industrialised farming and intensive animal husbandry. The worst excesses of animal slaughter and food production are all here. This, in its awful way, is the rotten heart of the exhibition. On a wall nearby, Arcimboldo’s 1572 personifications of the Four Seasons look on, their painted physiognomies entirely constructed of fruit and vegetables. We are what we eat. The entire room is indigestible. Around the corner is an Honest Shop, where you can buy locally produced, handmade objects and clothing. No packaging, no long-distance transport, and no hard sell. See a jumper or a woolly hat, a doll or a bangle you like, and put the money in the honesty box. Is this the future of local production and retailing? Well meant, none of it seems all that useful. Huge straw presences loom in the last room, along with posters for cult movies The Wicker Man and Zardoz, and a great many books, pamphlets, posters and ephemera, bulwarks against the loss of the natural world, a depleted rural. Somewhere I hear a goat, bleating.

The fly-half, who was injured four minutes into Bath’s 35–17 defeat by Scarlets in the Champions Cup, will remain at his club rather than joining up with the Wales squad next week. Warren Gatland has not called up a replacement having also named Dan Biggar, Owen Williams, Rhys Patchell and Gareth Anscombe, who can all play fly-half, in his 39-man squad for the Six Nations. Wales will play Scotland in a friendly in Cardiff in November to kick off their autumn series. They usually face Australia or South Africa in a fourth international played outside the Test window but the former have arranged an extra match at Twickenham, while the Welsh Rugby Union is negotiating a June fixture with the Springboks in the United States. The WRU needs an extra Test every autumn to help fund its deal with the country’s four regions, not least the national dual contract system which this year is bringing back the wing George North from England. Scotland will receive a share of the gate receipts and the teams will play for the Doddie Weir Cup in honour of the former Scotland and Lions lock who has motor neurone disease. The foundation he has set up to fund research into the condition will benefit financially. Scotland’s captain is John Barclay, who is in the final year of his contract with the Scarlets having opted to return home next season and join Edinburgh. The region won what was the Pro 12 last season and has recovered from a poor start in Europe to be in a position where victory over Toulon in Llanelli on Saturday will earn a first knock-out berth since 2007. Barclay is relishing the clash of styles with the prize of the group title at stake and a likely home quarter-final draw. If the Scarlets win, and they start one point behind the leaders Toulon, they would become the only team to top their group after losing the first two games - and they were trailing Treviso by seven points with four minutes to go in the third. “The pressure was on against Treviso,” said Barclay. “Everyone knew what was on the line and you could feel the desperation on the pitch and in the stand. People were thinking ‘that’s it’, but we pulled through. “Last week at Bath was probably the first time this season that we have played as we know we can, with a high tempo and off-loading. It is a style similar to Scotland’s: neither side is blessed with an abundance of monsters and it is about keeping the ball alive and moving big men around so they will start to struggle at the set-pieces. “The French league is full of enormous men and Toulon have some big units. We were disappointed to lose there in October having given them two soft, early tries but we recovered to take the lead by looking after the ball. Their power game can be effective, but let’s see how good they are when they have to work hard for long phases of play.” The Scarlets have 13 players in the Wales squad for the Six Nations, which starts with a meeting with Barclay’s Scotland in Cardiff. “It shows we are doing well,” said the flanker. “I am delighted for James Davies [the uncapped wing forward who was called up by Wales this week]. I hope he gets the chance to show everyone what he can do at that level.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/19/olympic-champions-jordyn-wieber-aly-raisman-larry-nassar-court","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T19:03:02Z","webTitle":"'How do you sleep at night?'

Olympic duo Wieber and Raisman confront Larry Nassar in court","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Olympic gold medalists Jordyn Wieber and Aly Raisman said in court on Friday they were among the 140 girls and women who were sexually abused by longtime USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar. Wieber, who helped the USA team known as the Fierce Five to a gold medal at the London Olympics, addressed the abuse for the first time publicly in a victim impact statement on the fourth day of the disgraced former physician’s sentencing hearing in Michigan. “Even though I’m a victim, I do not and will not live my life as one,” said Wieber, a Michigan native who began seeing Nassar from the age of eight until she was 18. “I’m an Olympian despite being abused. I worked hard and managed to achieve my goal. But I want everyone especially the media to know that despite my athletic achievements I am one of over 140 women and survivors whose story is important.” She added: “Larry Nassar is accountable. USA Gymnastics is accountable. The US Olympic Committee is accountable. My teammates and friends have been through enough, and now it’s time for change. The current gymnasts should not have to live in anxiety and fear as I did.” Raisman, a six-time Olympic medalist who went public with her story in November after speaking to FBI investigators after last year’s Rio Games, spoke directly to Nassar. “Adult after adult protected you,” Raisman said. “How do you sleep at night? You are the person they had ‘take the lead on athlete care.’ I cringe to think your influence remains in the policies they [USA Gymnastics] claim will make athletes safe. “I will not rest until every last trace of the influence you had on this sport has been destroyed like the cancer it is.” Nassar, an osteopath who spent nearly 30 years as trainer and national medical coordinator with the USA Gymnastics program, faces a minimum sentence of 25 to 40 years in federal prison after admitting to molesting girls at Michigan State University and his home under the guise of medical treatment. The 54-year-old has already been given an additional 60 years in a separate case regarding child abuse images. The statements by Wieber and Raisman came as Michigan State’s board of trustees called on the state’s attorney general to review the university’s handling of the Nassar complaints amid mounting calls for the resignation of school president Lou Anna Simon – including a scathing front-page editorial by the independent student newspaper that cast “Simon, her appointees and cheerleaders” as “enablers”. The eight-member board, who will hold a unscheduled, closed-door meeting on Friday, wrote in a letter to Bill Schuette that “questions grew louder this week with the victim impact statements. After watching many of these heartbreaking statements and reading accounts about them, we have concluded that only a review by your office can resolve the questions in a way that the victims, their families, and the public will deem satisfactory and that will help all those affected by Nassar’s horrible crimes to heal.” Many statements from victims and their attorneys have centered on the institutions that allegedly enabled or were negligent in preventing Nassar’s abuse for as long as two decades: Michigan State, USA Gymnastics and the United States Olympic Committee, all of which have been named as co-defendants in civil suits that appear headed to trial. But the board’s letter reopens the possibility of criminal action that so far has not extended beyond Nassar himself. The statements continued into the afternoon when Nassar broke down in tears during the testimony of Trenea Gonzcar, who said she’d known him for more than 30 years. “I hope you cry like we cry,” Gonzcar said, shaking as he took off his glasses and wiped his eyes. “I hope you feel bad for what you’ve done. I hope...everyday these girls can feel less pain. But this is goodbye to you, Larry,” Gonzcar told him. While Nassar’s sentencing hearing was initially scheduled to conclude on Friday, judge Rosemarie Aquilina said it would be extended to Monday or Tuesday in order to hear all the statements of about 40 more survivors, many of whom, including Gonzcar, signed up with the district attorney’s office over the course of the week. In all, 89 victims have given statements so far."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/19/roy-hodgson-interview-crystal-palace-manager","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T22:30:35Z","webTitle":"Roy Hodgson: ‘Coaching is a sadistic pleasure – the suffering never stops’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/19/roy-hodgson-interview-crystal-palace-manager","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/19/roy-hodgson-interview-crystal-palace-manager","fields":{"headline":"Roy Hodgson: ‘Coaching is a sadistic pleasure – the suffering never stops’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Roy Hodgson is not one for sentimental reflection. Looking back has never really been his thing. If it were, as he admits, he might linger on his life going full circle in restoring him to the club he supported as a boy, “walking with my dad to watch the reserves one week, the first team the next” from their regular vantage point on the bleak concrete of the Holmesdale Road terrace. Or hoarding programmes, a youngster craving an audience with Johnny Byrne or Terry Long “and waiting to collect autographs by the changing rooms”. It had been a sense of Crystal Palace’s underlying ambition, and a desire to fling himself back into work 14 months after leaving his role with England, that convinced him to return to the club where a career spanning more than half a century had begun with evening sessions in the youth team. Yet, when Hodgson allows himself a second to contemplate, he can acknowledge some would spy romance in last autumn’s return. His father, Bill, was a geordie who had moved to the capital before the second world war, then returned from the fighting to marry and settle as a bus driver in the suburbs south of the river. “He regarded himself as a Londoner but he had two teams: Newcastle from his youth and then, when he came down to Croydon, he was Crystal Palace all the way,” Hodgson says. “He watched the game. Just before he died, we knocked Internazionale out of the European Cup with Malmö [in 1989] and I was really happy he lived at least to see that moment. But to see me at Palace? I’m sure he’d have been very proud. He’d have loved it.” A little over four months into an appointment that had underwhelmed many outside this corner of south London, the doubters blinded by memories of England’s failures at recent tournaments and assuming this was a broken man, it is hard not to admire the rejuvenation instigated by the country’s most worldly wise manager. At 70, Hodgson is on his 20th coaching assignment, yet his appetite for hands-on coaching is as fierce as ever, his enthusiasm and energy infectious. It has rubbed off on his players, from Wilfried Zaha to James Tomkins, Bakary Sako to Martin Kelly. They are revived. The job he has overseen is far from complete but feels remarkable. Palace had endured the worst start to a top-flight campaign, losing seven games without scoring, a sequence that included Frank de Boer’s four-match tenure. Hodgson had arrived as a firefighter to stumble almost from the off into brutal batterings at the two Manchester clubs. The situation was grim. But, in 16 games since and despite a lengthening injury list, Palace have earned 25 points. Their opponents on Saturday, Arsenal, are the only side to have beaten them in the last 12 league matches. There must have been times – as the wheels came off at the Etihad Stadium or when stoppage-time penalties were saved against Bournemouth and at home to Manchester City – when he contemplated the logic in resuming his career. “I’d have laughed if someone had told me, in 1976, I’d still be doing this at 70. I assisted Bobby Houghton at Halmstads and we were both just under 30. We’d say: ‘Wouldn’t it be great to do this for maybe 10 years, save a little money, then perhaps start a little business together.’ Some sort of travel agency. We had no football thoughts beyond that, other than maybe combining it with a bit of sport, getting a few tours going. It was a very loose plan and the wheels fell off it many years ago. “It is a sadistic pleasure. The suffering never stops – that’s the problem. A lot of young coaches who respect the fact I have been doing it a long time … that is often their question. Does it get any easier? Can you relax more during the games? Can you take it all a little bit more philosophically and put it in perspective? The tragedy is I have to tell them: ‘No. If anything it gets worse.’ Getting that first foot on the rung of the ladder, that’s where you find it easier to shrug off those times when your foot slips off and you have to get yourself going again. When you have been lucky enough to move up, all you see is the slide back down. You don’t see the further steps upwards. “You learn to harden yourself towards it but, the longer you are in, it isn’t something you can give up lightly. It’s not something you can walk away from and, even if you’re not winning, it’s possible to derive some satisfaction from the fact you are working properly. But I suffer during games. We follow the action, kicking every ball, wondering if our centre-backs can stop the cross … In some ways you enjoy it but your heart is always thumping.” The sight of Pep Guardiola joining him in the dugout in stoppage time in the goalless draw with City on New Year’s Eve summed up the respect in which Hodgson is held by his peers. The pair spoke about the seasons their sides are enjoying. “A nice conversation,” says the Englishman. Hodgson will have admired City’s style and panache, as well as their feverish work rate. “I like the artistry of the game. I still get a lot of pleasure watching the good quality teams play, where the movements of the players are coordinated. It’s almost balletic. There is so much interaction in a football match: between you and your team-mates and how you support each other, work for each other, make runs. But I also enjoy the other aspect: the pressing and how people work so hard to recover the ball.” He inherited a squad whose confidence was fragile but who were eager to follow his lead. The structured nature of training has been embraced, sessions replicating game-play to encourage familiarity, clarity and a recognition of each player’s role. It worked at Fulham and West Bromwich Albion, Malmö and Copenhagen. “We didn’t hear anyone saying: ‘What the hell are we doing this for?’ In fact, quite the reverse. Quite a few came up to us and said: ‘We like this. We need more of this. Please keep it going.’ They take their lead from you: your energy, your enthusiasm. It does transmit. I’m anxious as I get older to make sure that doesn’t drop.” In a congested bottom half, he has hoisted Palace to 12th and should be rewarded with forays into the transfer market. Everything about his appointment seems to fit. “I’m working at a club which has really good potential, with owners with the right ideas,” he says. “The only thing we are lacking is making certain we have the 11 players who can deliver total stability in the Premier League, where you are not looking over your shoulder every year wondering: ‘Are we in or are we out?’” There lies his target. Over at Malmö’s stadium the fans refer to the upper corner of the eastern stand as “Roys Hörna” (Roy’s Corner). Maintain Palace’s progress and Hodgson, back where it all began, will find adulation far closer to home."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/19/fox-news-tucker-carlson-is-the-new-premiere-voice-of-bannonism","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T15:37:47Z","webTitle":"Fox News' Tucker Carlson is the new premier voice of Bannonism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/19/fox-news-tucker-carlson-is-the-new-premiere-voice-of-bannonism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/19/fox-news-tucker-carlson-is-the-new-premiere-voice-of-bannonism","fields":{"headline":"Fox News' Tucker Carlson is the new premier voice of Bannonism","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Last night from 8pm ET on Fox News, Bannonite-in-chief Tucker Carlson executed his formula and landed a rip-roaring show. His opening monologue alleged that “illegal aliens” commit more crimes, and that illegal immigration “costs Americans their lives”. He then interviewed rightwing pundit Mark Steyn, who asserted, on the basis of Hispanic birthrates in Arizona, that “the border has moved north”, and insisted that the views of white supremacists should be prioritized over “illegals” because “they are citizens”. Later on, he badgered a Latina mayoral candidate from Phoenix, asking repeatedly how many “illegals” had started tech companies. Finally, he let Congressman Scott Perry speculate as to whether Isis agents might have been responsible for the Las Vegas massacre. Steve Bannon may have lost control of Breitbart, but as long as Tucker Carlson is around, Bannon-style rightwing populism will have a powerful voice in the media. Since around the time of Trump’s election, Carlson has consistently articulated the nationalist, anti-immigran and anti-establishment program that Bannon took to the White House. He’s also shown he’s prepared to maintain a hard line on these issues at Trump’s expense. Last week, he blasted the president for meeting with “the very swamp creatures he once denounced” to try to reach a deal on Daca. “Congress,” he said, running a familiar populist line, “is full of people from both parties who believe that the point of our immigration policy is to provide cheap labor to their donors and to atone for America’s imaginary sins against the world.” Outside the far right proper, perhaps only Ann Coulter was harder on Trump over negotiating with the Democrats. While rightwing Republicans are generally anti-immigration, Carlson has found ways to go further on issues of race than shock jocks like Sean Hannity or Mark Levin. Last July, he devoted a long segment to drumming up fear and loathing for Roma in Pennsylvania, a fairly exotic prejudice to promote in the context of the American right. Certainly, it’s unrelated to any US policy debates. Some observers have suggested that in such moments, Carlson is actually pitching to a broader sense of “European” (ie white) cultural and ethnic identity. In other words, Carlson is promoting values associated with the alt-right. At the same time, he may be mainstreaming their message. He stood up not only for Confederate statues, but for flyers put up at a high school reading “it’s okay to be white”, a phrase which was propagated as an alt-right slogan. He has also taken time to defend the alt-right social network, Gab. And he reserves his most scathing attacks for the far right’s sworn enemies – not only leftist academics, but hate-monitoring groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center. Prominent alt-right figures have returned the favor. In a celebratory tweet last year, Richard Spencer affirmed that one “can’t cuck the Tuck”. On the Daily Stormer, neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin approvingly called the combative Carlson “a machine of ultimate destruction”. How much of this does Carlson, formerly a more conventional conservative, really mean? Dan Cassino, a professor of political science at Fairleigh Dickinson University who studies conservative media, thinks that a lot of what Carlson does is driven by sheer contrarianism, and a desire to produce lively television. He points to his journeyman history on a series of cable networks – including MSNBC and CNN, where he was infamously lectured by Jon Stewart – and the evolution of the Daily Caller, which Carlson co-founded, suggesting that he has learned that viewers love fireworks. “His show is less about what he thinks, and more about ‘owning the liberals’,” he says, though he adds that Carlson seems to have few limits on what he is willing to say in coming up with his particular brand of political bloodsport. Carlson’s contrarianism is most visible in his signature technique: confrontational interviews in his “Tucker Takes On” segment. His tone is important in making them shareable – his lighthearted sneering sets him apart from the hectoring anger that so many other conservative media figures rely on. What’s notable about Carlson’s viral interviews are his targets. Some of them would be irresistible to any rightwing pundit, like the Chicago Democratic alderman whom Carlson called a “loathsome little demagogue” on Wednesday night. (One wonders why so many local politicians and campus advocates agree to enter into in a no-win situation). But Carlson also had a notorious on-air brawl with Max Boot, a neoconservative who advocated for and later defended the Bush administration’s invasion of Iraq. He has repeatedly excoriated “Russia hawks” in the foreign policy establishment, and those who argued for Middle Eastern adventurism in the previous decade. This lines up perfectly with the isolationism of many in the alt right. On the other hand, Carlson has even given a warm reception to a select group on the left. Intercept founder Glenn Greenwald and Alternet’s Max Blumenthal have each been given a respectful hearing by Carlson, who has chosen to emphasize their common ground – skepticism about US overseas adventurism, the “Russiagate” narrative and Clintonian liberalism. Whether he is cynical or sincere, Carlson continues to blur the lines between the far right and the mainstream, and is prepared to employ any weapon that comes to hand in taking on establishment conservatives and liberals alike. There’s no sign that he is looking to change what has been a successful formula."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/jan/19/galliano-completes-rehabilitation-maison-margiela-paris-menswear","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T15:58:20Z","webTitle":"'Dressing in haste': Galliano delivers his first menswear collection for Margiela","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jan/19/galliano-completes-rehabilitation-maison-margiela-paris-menswear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/jan/19/galliano-completes-rehabilitation-maison-margiela-paris-menswear","fields":{"headline":"'Dressing in haste': Galliano delivers his first menswear collection for Margiela","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"John Galliano’s first menswear collection for Maison Margiela opened with a red and black double-breasted overcoat worn with black, spongy slippers. It closed with a white shredded mackintosh over beige muslin underpants. In between, there were plastic sandals which clonked along the catwalk like ski boots, and several of Margiela’s famous split-toed high-heeled tabi boots and a bright yellow padded jacket, blown up like a pufferfish, paired with a sober midi-length skirt. According to notes distributed at the show, the theme was “dressing in haste”. The idea was to merge “past and present house ideas into one forward proposal for a new kind of glamour”. Clearly, the aim was optimism. Models walked along a zingy yellow and white set. There were pops of colour, often worn top to toe, in yellow, red, orange and blue. A new house symbol of a triangle containing a circle – or “synergistic glyph imbued with a positive message” as the notes had it – was introduced. The show, which took place in an intimate salon of the Musée de l’Armée in Paris on Friday, was a significant step in Galliano’s rehabilitation. The designer was hired, controversially, as creative director of Margiela in 2014, three years after he was sacked from Dior after an antisemitic rant in a Paris bar. In a talk at the Central Synagogue in London, after his fall from grace, he spoke about his addictions and said if he hadn’t left Dior in 2011, “I think I would be dead”. Though there are many who will never forgive him, the fashion industry has mostly welcomed him back into the fold, thanks in no small part to the support of powerful friends such as Kate Moss and Anna Wintour. His recent work for Margiela has been well received. Historically, Margiela has been known for rigorous, cool deconstruction; Galliano’s most famous creations were completely over the top, often inspired by historical periods, complete with powdered wigs, of which he has said “didn’t exactly help portray a sane image of myself”. Now those two points of view are gelling. As with his womenswear, the styling was sometimes wacky (one model wore a leather corset belt over a military jacket, paired with a feathered shower cap), but the individual pieces were wearable – even commercial – twists on everyday items, such as a raw-seamed herringbone overcoat inlaid with a panel of cobalt silk. Margiela’s refusal to shy away from its association with Galliano – rather, its insistence that his vision is stamped across every element of the brand – is a sign that within the fashion industry, at least, his rehabilitation appears to be complete."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/19/five-classic-songs-that-got-sex-right","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T15:27:04Z","webTitle":"Five classic songs that got sex right","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/19/five-classic-songs-that-got-sex-right","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/19/five-classic-songs-that-got-sex-right","fields":{"headline":"Five classic songs that got sex right","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"1960s The Shirelles: Will You Love Me Tomorrow When Carole King and Gerry Goffin were asked to follow up the Shirelles’ Tonight’s the Night – about a girl contemplating the loss of her virginity – they simply decided to continue the narrative. Here, the girl’s anxieties that her beau might break her heart harden into a stark demand for assurance that he won’t discard her the next day. It’s a brazen show of confidence and remains as appropriate to modern fears of ghosting as it was to the early 60s’ insistence on female chastity. 1970s Marvin Gaye: Let’s Get It On A year after the publication of The Joy of Sex, Marvin Gaye released the perfect audio accompaniment to the illustrated manual that turned on a generation. In doing so he defined the template for sensual music. But for Gaye, Let’s Get It On wasn’t simply about pleasure, but liberation from his fundamentalist upbringing and abuse at the hands of his preacher father. For him, sexuality became spirituality. “I hope the music that I present here makes you lucky,” he wrote in the album’s liner notes. 1980s Frankie Goes to Hollywood: Relax Taking its own advice, Relax took its sweet time creeping up the UK charts to climax at No 1 in January 1984, by which point the BBC had already banned it for being too sexually explicit. Naturally, this did nothing to hurt its commercial prospects and the band delighted in putting the Beeb in an awkward position when they repeatedly denied that it had anything to do with sex, gay or otherwise. The whole episode looks even more radical in retrospect, as a last hedonistic high before the Aids epidemic went mainstream. 1990s Divinyls: I Touch Myself There had been songs about female masturbation before – notably Cyndi Lauper’s 1984 single, She Bop – but none as explicit or successful as this Top 10 hit from the Australian rock band. It’s not quite as progressive as it may seem, portraying self-love as a way of flattering a man’s ego; Tweet’s Oops (Oh My) would later better it as the singer gets turned on by the thought of a man, and then the sight of herself. 2000s Peaches: Fuck the Pain Away “What else is in the teaches of Peaches?” Education, contraception, but above all, satisfaction. The Canadian electroclash artist’s breakout song fit perfectly into the easy sleaze of the new millennium, when strip-club culture penetrated pop and sex tapes started careers rather than wrecking them. Here, she added an essential seam of agency and sex-positivity. Amusingly, its sordid Roland TR-909 production would go on to influence those notorious horndogs, Radiohead, on In Rainbows’ 15 Step."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/20/southampton-tottenham-hotspur-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T09:00:48Z","webTitle":"Southampton v Tottenham Hotspur: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/20/southampton-tottenham-hotspur-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/20/southampton-tottenham-hotspur-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Southampton v Tottenham Hotspur: match preview","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There is little reason for optimism among Southampton fans before this fixture.

St James Parish, of which Montego Bay is the capital, has been hit by a surge in gang-related killing and violence, according to authorities, and a state of emergency was declared on Thursday. The UK Foreign Office (FCO) has warned holidaymakers that “intensive law enforcement activities” were expected in the area and holidaymakers should limit their movements outside their resorts, especially at night. Other countries have issued similar advice, including Canada. Around 200,000 Britons visit Jamaica each year, with many drawn to Montego Bay by its luxury resorts and white sandy beaches. The FCO said: “A state of emergency has been declared in St James Parish, which includes Montego Bay. This will lead to more intensive law enforcement activities in response to recent violence including shooting incidents. “You should follow local advice, including restrictions in selected areas. You should limit your movements outside of resorts in the area at this time, and exercise particular care if travelling at night. “Travel to and from the airport or for excursions should be undertaken with organised tour operators, and transport should be arranged or provided by the resort hotels. “Local media have reported that a major military operation is under way in parts of St James. This may result in road closures and travel delays. You should exercise caution if you’re in the area.” Jamaica Constabulary’s force police commissioner, George Quallo, told the Jamaica Information Service 335 murders were recorded in St James Parish in 2017, almost twice as many as the other parishes. Maj Gen Rocky Meade, chief of defence staff of the Jamaican Defence Force, told the JIS: “All citizens of Jamaica, including the violence producers, can feel safe in the hands of the military, as long as you are not threatening the troops. “We are ensuring that we enforce the rule of law, that we disrupt gang activities, and the particular focus is on those that are responsible for murders, lotto scamming, trafficking of arms and guns, and extortion.” The Jamaican prime minister, Andrew Holness, said the crackdown was being undertaken with the support of the tourism industry. “Several stakeholders, including those in the tourism industry, have written to me to say that they would support the necessary actions to bring the parish of St James under control and restore public safety,” he said. Holness said the government had been planning the operation “for some time”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/20/west-ham-bournemouth-premier-league-reporet","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T17:08:04Z","webTitle":"Javier Hernández rescues point for West Ham against Bournemouth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/20/west-ham-bournemouth-premier-league-reporet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/20/west-ham-bournemouth-premier-league-reporet","fields":{"headline":"Javier Hernández rescues point for West Ham against Bournemouth","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"This game came and went in almost 60 seconds. Ryan Fraser’s sweet strike gave the visitors an unlikely lead only for it to be cancelled out in little over a minute by a typical finish from Javier Hernández. That aside, it was a match of missed opportunities. For David Moyes there was not only two home points dropped against a bottom-half rival but two more injuries to a threadbare West Ham squad. Aaron Cresswell limped off with cramp in the final knockings and Manuel Lanzini will have to undergo a scan after apparently damaging a hamstring. Eddie Howe, meanwhile, said he was frustrated not to have left with three points but Bournemouth were there for the taking for much of the match. “We’re disappointed because the team that took the lead should be able to hold on in that situation,” he said. “We were pretty slow out of the traps and did well not to concede under early pressure. It was a similar start to the second half but then we scored the goal. I thought that might be good enough but it wasn’t to be.” Howe was full of praise for Fraser who ran on to a through-ball from the substitute Junior Stanislas before smashing it home with his left foot for his fifth goal of the season. “When players from the wings start scoring regularly, it’s fantastic,” Howe said. Crafted from fast incisive play, it was the type of goal West Ham had been threatening to score themselves. But the home side’s equaliser, straight from the restart, was the result of a long ball and a flick on, before Hernández pounced on Marko Arnautovic’s blocked shot with trademark alacrity. “We played well but missed a cutting edge,” Moyes said of his second game of the week, Tuesday’s FA Cup replay with Shrewsbury running to extra time before West Ham won 1-0. “For me it’s progress. The players who’ve been a handful all year didn’t quite have the magic we needed but with 15 to go, we were on our knees. I’d have taken a point then.” It is seven matches unbeaten for West Ham, a statistic Moyes was not unaware of. But in that opening spell, during which Arnautovic and Lanzini ran riot, his team played some of their best football under their new manager and it was notable the crowd showed their appreciation. Moyes said: “I’ve been looking for more and there were bits of that more today.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/25/country-diary-poplar-laid-low-by-age-and-wind-sandy-bedfordshire","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T05:30:07Z","webTitle":"Country diary: a mighty poplar brought down by old age and the revenge of the wind","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/25/country-diary-poplar-laid-low-by-age-and-wind-sandy-bedfordshire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/25/country-diary-poplar-laid-low-by-age-and-wind-sandy-bedfordshire","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: a mighty poplar laid low by age and the wind's revenge","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When the last storm whipped through our valley it brought down the tallest tree on the river. An old Lombardy poplar, a spire without a church, it belonged to an age when planting poplars was popular. They were the leylandii of their day, for they shot up as fast as rockets and looked like them too. They were often grown in rows as windbreaks, though nobody much thought about old age and the wind’s revenge. For a day or so after, my eyes clawed at the air, looking for the absent shape of a tower that had been a crow’s nest for a magpie, a labyrinth for tits, a cricked neck. I saw only a wooded ridge, some houses, and sky – so much sky that it snuffed out the memory. For a day or so only, passersby stopped to inspect the toppled giant, as they might view the corpse of a beached whale. I paced its prostrate length – at 30 metres it was bigger than a blue whale. The impact of its fall had snapped off branches all the way along – arms, fingers and knuckles. I touched the tip of a topmost twig, probably the first human to do so in 75 years or more, and it came away. It had put on a spurt of 30cm growth in its final summer, its tight grey buds poised to open into another year. A moment later, it protruded from my coat pocket, destined to bud or not in a mantelpiece vase. At the tree’s base, an autopsy of its last seconds was written in splits, snaps, rips and a broken heart. Close to, the anchors of its roots had severed with yellowing tears that wept still, or lifted to leave a half-ring crater. Peeled back like the lid of a tin, its trunk revealed itself as hollow, the heartwood eaten out. An ivy-coated stem of trunk-like proportions had sheared off to the river, the overhang already amputated by a chainsaw. A blackbird played on the parallel bars, hopping from horizontal branch to horizontal branch, a surfeit of perches.

Tara Hudson, a trans woman, was sent to a male prison in 2015, prompting a national outcry with more than 150,000 people signing a petition calling for her to be moved to a women’s jail. Hudson is suing the MoJ for damages, alleging that her status as a woman was ignored when she was imprisoned, that she suffered sexual assault during her incarceration and that she was placed in an atmosphere that was “intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating and offensive”. Her lawyers are also seeking a declaration from the court that Hudson was discriminated against, potentially the first time the MoJ has been found guilty of mistreating a prisoner on the basis of gender reassignment. The case will be heard at the Mayor’s and City of London court in April, but Hudson’s lawyers have expressed outrage at the “transphobic and insulting” language used by the government in its response to the allegations. In court papers seen by the Observer, the MoJ and government lawyers argue that they do not consider Hudson to be a woman despite the make-up artist reassigning her gender and living as a woman for her adult life. They state Hudson “is as a matter of biological fact a man” and add that the term “transwoman” has no legal significance. They say they have adopted female pronouns when referring to Hudson only “out of respect for her wishes”. In response, Hudson’s legal team accuse government lawyers of adopting “transphobic, unnecessarily abrasive, aggressive and insulting” language towards Hudson, who has breasts and has used hormones for years but does not have a gender recognition certificate. Hudson spent six weeks in jail in 2015, after she admitted head-butting a barman. She spent seven days in HMP Bristol before being moved to a women’s facility, Eastwood Park, after a storm of national protest. Speaking from Belgium, where she lives with her boyfriend, Hudson said: “I was horrified when I read the defence from the MoJ. It states that I’m a male, which is a complete insult, humiliating and wrong because I’ve been living as a female all my adult life. I’m not a drag act. When I was put in jail I’d been the subject of transphobia and it feels like I’m the subject of transphobia again from the MoJ, which is horrible because it’s my government.” Her lawyer, Jane Ryan of Bhatt Murphy, says the government is denying her gender identity and that its argument runs counter to the ministry’s published policies on trans prisoners and the 2016 women and equalities committee transgender inquiry, the first ever parliamentary report on such issues. Her case was also instrumental in prompting a national review to examine the treatment of trans prisoners. It concluded it may be appropriate for some trans prisoners to be placed in a prison of their acquired gender, even if they do not have a gender recognition certificate. “According to the review, the MoJ is committed to promoting transgender equality. Yet its decision to defend these proceedings, and the manner in which it is conducting its defence, directly undermines that commitment, compounding the discrimination suffered by my client,” said Ryan. Last year Theresa May announced she would reform the gender recognition act, allowing people to self-identify and removing the need for medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria before someone can officially change gender. Government lawyers insist that Hudson is legally a man and that placing her in a male prison did not signify “scant regard for her wellbeing”, deny breaching her human rights and state that all efforts were made to prevent her suffering any abuse or assault from other inmates. Hudson’s allegations include a description of her arrival at HMP Bristol in October 2015, where she says she was met “by a cacophony of noise and verbal abuse” with prisoners shouting: “What is it? Kill it.” During a body search, it is alleged that a male officer “gasped and mumbled ‘fucking hell’”. Hudson also alleges that an inmate groped her breasts and genitals, leaving her “threatened, distressed and humiliated”. Other claims involve Hudson being held in a segregation unit and not initially being offered a transfer to a woman’s prison, again contradicted by the government who claim “she preferred not to be transferred to a female prison”. Hudson is calling for an apology. “They should accept they mistreated me and move forward rather than aggressively fight me. It’s shameful when really they should be trying to make sure a trans person is not mistreated.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/19/theresa-may-accused-of-timidity-in-tory-mps-outburst","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T23:28:25Z","webTitle":"Theresa May told to 'raise her game' in Tory MP's outburst","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/19/theresa-may-accused-of-timidity-in-tory-mps-outburst","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/19/theresa-may-accused-of-timidity-in-tory-mps-outburst","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May told to 'raise her game' in Tory MP's outburst","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Theresa May has been ordered to raise her game by a Conservative MP and former minister who says her government is guilty of “timidity and lack of ambition”. Nick Boles launched an extraordinary attack on his party leader on Twitter, listing the controversy over the release of John Worboys, the housing crisis and NHS funding as key areas of concern. The politician has been delivering a critique of government policy in recent months through the publication of a series of chapters from his new book, Square Deal, about how to revitalise modern Conservatism. But he appeared to snap over the decision of the justice secretary, David Gauke, not to seek a judicial review into the Parole Board’s decision to free Worboys after less than 10 years in prison. The 60-year-old taxi driver was jailed in 2009 for assaults on 12 women in London. The government had looked into the possibility of a legal challenge but decided against it after consulting lawyers. Boles told the Guardian: “We need ministers to have the courage of their convictions and not be bamboozled by the advice of officials trying to justify the system.” It came after he tweeted: The MP, who returned to constituency work in September after battling cancer, argued that the Worboys decision was the final straw because a judicial review would have been an opportunity for ministers to express their anger. He said they should have pushed ahead even if there was only a 10% chance of victory. His book has called for a bolder approach to economic, housing and health policy, demanding the Tories bring an end to the “age of austerity” and focus on investment and driving up productivity. The former skills minister said that would help tackle the lack of growth in wages. He has also suggested re-branding national insurance to fund the NHS and social care. Boles, who was a key figure in Michael Gove’s unsuccessful leadership bid, told the Sun that he wanted Downing Street to “pull their finger out” and for May to lead, be bold and definite. “When I came back, I said we needed a new story, a new set of ambitions. I put it in friendly terms and I just feel we’re moving backwards,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/commentisfree/2018/jan/21/jack-in-your-job-and-go-and-live-the-dream---if-you-can-afford-it-peter-mayle","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T00:04:06Z","webTitle":"Jack in your job and go and live the dream – if you can afford it | Barbara Ellen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2018/jan/21/jack-in-your-job-and-go-and-live-the-dream---if-you-can-afford-it-peter-mayle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/commentisfree/2018/jan/21/jack-in-your-job-and-go-and-live-the-dream---if-you-can-afford-it-peter-mayle","fields":{"headline":"Jack in your job and go and live the dream – if you can afford it","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Peter Mayle, the writer of 1989’s multimillion-selling A Year in Provence, has died aged 78.

It’s not just about relocating to Provence, Tuscany or wherever.

St Stephen’s primary school in Newham, east London, hit the headlines at the weekend after the Sunday Times reported it had banned Muslim girls under the age of eight from wearing headscarves, to the delight of campaigners who argued it enforces religious conformity on children. That decision, along with curbs on children fasting on school days during Ramadan, upset many parents, who said they had not been consulted. On Friday, the school’s chair of governors, Arif Qawi, said he was stepping down, telling colleagues in an email: “I wish the school continued success and am truly sorry that my actions have caused any harm to the reputation of the fantastic school.” Qawi’s comments regarding “Islamisation” posted on social media attracted sustained criticism, while parents complained that they first heard about the ban through the media rather than the school. The website for St Stephen’s posted a note on Friday, headlined as a uniform policy update, that read: “Having spoken to our school community we now have a deeper understanding of the matter and have decided to reverse our position with immediate effect.” The note was later amended to read: “The school has taken the decision to make the changes to this policy with immediate effect and this follows on from conversations with our school community. We will work with out school community to continue to review this policy going forward in the best interests of our children.” Miqdaad Versi, the assistant secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said his organisation welcomed Qawi’s resignation because of his “appalling” statements in support of the ban. “This decision on religious symbols did not appear to target adherents of other faiths and appears to have been made without consulting the parents or community,” Versi said. “Yet serious questions remain unanswered as to the school leadership’s attitude towards Muslims, which are potentially discriminatory. “It is deeply disappointing that a primary school with such a reputation has acted in this way. We hope that future decisions are made carefully and with full consultation with local communities.” Amina Lone, an activist who has lobbied the government to bar hijabs in schools for young girls, was disappointed by the school’s U-turn: “A result of clicktivism in all its polarised glory. So much for choice and individual liberty. Terribly sad day for a secular democracy,” Lone wrote on Twitter. Earlier this week, a group of Newham councillors criticised the school’s decision for creating a “toxic atmosphere” and called for the hijab ban to be reversed. “It is troubling that the school has decided on a course of action that has clearly divided them from the very community they look to serve,” the councillors said in a statement. The Department for Education’s policy is for individual schools to set their own uniform policies. The Sunday Times had previously claimed that St Stephen’s was the best primary school in England last year, based on its outstanding key stage two test results. But the DfE’s performance tables show that a small number of other primaries achieved better results. The school did not respond to attempts to contact it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/20/wales-front-five-passing-game-scotland-six-nations-robert-howley","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T22:00:03Z","webTitle":"Wales prepare front-five passing game for opening match against Scotland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/20/wales-front-five-passing-game-scotland-six-nations-robert-howley","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/20/wales-front-five-passing-game-scotland-six-nations-robert-howley","fields":{"headline":"Wales prepare front-five passing game for opening match against Scotland","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Robert Howley will put a close friendship on hold in the first week of the Six Nations as Wales, who finished fifth last season after losing three matches for only the second time in 10 years, prepare for Scotland in Cardiff. Howley got to know the Scotland head coach, Gregor Townsend, who will be taking charge of his first match in the championship after succeeding Vern Cotter last summer, during the 1997 Lions tour to South Africa. They should have been half-back partners in the Test series but Howley was injured in Durban a week before the opener and was ruled out of the tour. “Gregor is a good friend who came to my wedding,” says the Wales attack coach who was part of the Lions management team in New Zealand last summer, his third successive tour as a coach after 2009 and 2013. “He has done a great job since taking charge of Scotland and they enjoyed some outstanding victories in the autumn. They will come to Cardiff in buoyant mood, even though they have a few injuries in the front row. “I think it will be a cracking game, as they always tend to be when Wales and Scotland meet. The rugby is usually fast and furious: we came up short against them in the contact area last year at Murrayfield and the key is to be controlled in your own structure.” For once, Wales are going into the championship without having to apologise for the performances of their sides in the European Champions Cup. The Scarlets and Ospreys went into the final round of group matches knowing victory would guarantee them a place in the quarter-finals, with the former playing the free-flowing, offloading game Wales aspire to. “We have encouraged that approach since coming back from New Zealand in 2016,” says Howley. “That was a watershed tour for us, and when we got back we got all the regional coaches together and asked them to work on their front five players passing the ball. You can now see the ambition and intent and it is a long time since we had two Welsh regions in the mix in the final weekend of the European Cup. “The Scarlets are fantastic to watch. Players like Aaron Shingler and James Davies [flankers who are in the Wales squad] have been outstanding. We have real strength in depth in the back row but what the Scarlets have also shown in Europe is an ability to play the game in several ways. They have been solid in defence and strong in the set pieces. That is what we will be looking for in the Six Nations.” A conundrum for Wales is the full-back Leigh Halfpenny, one of the best goal-kickers and defenders in the world who, after joining Toulon, lost the attacking spark he had shown in the final Lions Test in Australia in 2013. As an attacking force he is behind rivals Liam Williams, Hallam Amos and Rhys Patchell, but the decision to leave him out will not be taken easily with the centre Jonathan Davies missing and the wing George North feeling his way back after injury. “Without being disrespectful to where he came from [last summer], it is a different game here,” says Howley. “Leigh is being encouraged to play from the back and I am not sure that was the message in France. As we saw with Jonathan [when he was at Clermont Auvergne] as well as Leigh, they were burying themselves in rucks rather than being on their feet and playing. They are now with a side that plays rugby and they are not automated.” Wales picked the Worcester wing Josh Adams in the squad after Howley watched him twice this month. “He beats defenders and he can tackle,” says the coach. “We want to see how he reacts in our environment but having looked at him, I have no doubt he has the ability to play international rugby. “The Six Nations is all about winning and our squad reflects that. We have not won it for a long time and that is very much at the forefront of our minds.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/21/ernst-young-whistleblower-suing-gold-audit-dubai","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T00:04:05Z","webTitle":"Whistleblower suing Ernst & Young over gold dealings with Dubai firm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/21/ernst-young-whistleblower-suing-gold-audit-dubai","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/21/ernst-young-whistleblower-suing-gold-audit-dubai","fields":{"headline":"Whistleblower suing Ernst & Young over gold dealings with Dubai firm","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"UK consultancy giant Ernst &amp; Young has been accused of “unlawful, unprofessional and unethical” conduct over its relationship with a Dubai firm that was allegedly involved in money laundering and buying gold from conflict zones. The claims are made in documents filed in the high court by lawyers acting for Amjad Rihan, a former partner at E&amp;Y who exposed the alleged scandal three years ago. Rihan led a team given the job of auditing the Kaloti group, which at the time commanded half of Dubai’s gold refining market. His lawyers say that after blowing the whistle, Rihan was ordered by his employer to return to Dubai. He was dismissed when he refused. Kaloti required the E&amp;Y audit to prove it was responsibly sourcing its gold. An independent assurance was needed to meet the requirements of the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC), a Dubai government entity, and the London Bullion Market Association, two bodies that were essential to the firm’s operation. It is claimed in the court papers that Rihan’s team found Kaloti had imported 5 tons of gold bars from Morocco painted silver to avoid Moroccan restrictions on gold exports, while more than $5bn worth of cash transactions processed by the firm were not reported to the Dubai authorities. About 57 tons of Sudanese gold are said to have been received without conducting proper due diligence as to whether it had come from a conflict zone. Kaloti is also alleged to have dealt with several organisations listed by the US authorities as fronts for terrorism and organised crime – including one linked to armed rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo and another in Iran that at the time was subject to US and EU trade sanctions. When Rihan’s claims first surfaced, they provoked a storm in Dubai, where gold is one of the country’s most important industries, worth more than $70bn a year. His decision to now sue his former employer has raised troubling questions about the role of E&amp;Y and its treatment of whistleblowers. The court documents claim that when Rihan alerted his bosses to the fact Kaloti had failed the audit, they “positively undermined his authority (including by removing him from the audit) and ostracised him within EY, treating him as a troublemaker”. It is claimed E&amp;Y placed “unreasonable pressure” on him to return to Dubai, despite there being “credible evidence the Dubai authorities and/or other authorities in the region took serious retaliatory action against individuals who criticised them or otherwise damaged their interests”. Several E&amp;Y senior staff were then drafted in to help Kaloti rewrite its compliance report for the DMCC “in such a way as to suppress, conceal or distort the audit findings”. References to gold bars coated with silver were removed and no mention was made of Sudan, the DRC or Iran; values put on cash transactions were removed. Rihan’s lawyers say E&amp;Y “failed to make a required disclosure based on their knowledge or suspicion that Kaloti and/or some of its suppliers were engaged in money laundering”, contravening the Proceeds of Crime Act. They claim E&amp;Y is guilty under the Bribery Act because it sought to gain advantages, including retaining Kaloti as a client and maintaining good relations with the Dubai authorities, by “improperly performing its functions”. An E&amp;Y spokeswoman said: “We are aware of the lawsuit and deny any liability on this matter. We plan to vigorously defend any allegations made against EY.” Kaloti has always denied any impropriety."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/20/arsenal-crystal-palace-premier-league-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T17:03:11Z","webTitle":"Nacho Monreal ignites quickfire Arsenal to blow away Crystal Palace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/20/arsenal-crystal-palace-premier-league-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/20/arsenal-crystal-palace-premier-league-report","fields":{"headline":"Nacho Monreal ignites quickfire Arsenal to blow away Crystal Palace","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Arsène Wenger spoke about clarity and – perhaps inevitably – his subject was Alexis Sánchez. The Arsenal forward was not at the Emirates Stadium because, according to Wenger, he had driven north to put himself in position to complete his January transfer to Manchester United. Yet Sánchez still managed to colour the narrative. Wenger talked about how the saga involving his club’s best player had affected everybody. “For us, it’s not only to lose a world-class player – it’s a period of uncertainty that creates a strange feeling in the dressing room,” the manager said. “What is very difficult is that, for the first time, we are losing one of our big players in January. It’s a bit more destabilising than usual.” Wenger put forward the silver lining. “Once things are clear, the team responds and focuses on the job,” he said. Sánchez had left the team hotel on Friday night and it now looks pretty certain that the next time he appears in these parts, he will be wearing a United shirt. Henrikh Mkhitaryan is primed to move in the opposite direction and Wenger said that part of the deal was affecting the timing of it all. Against a Crystal Palace team that simply did not turn up at the outset, Arsenal stepped boldly into the post-Sánchez era. Wenger will always say that the pitch is the only place where anything matters and this was a reminder of what his team can do when it all clicks. When Arsenal play like this – they were 4-0 up after 22 minutes – it begs the question as to why they can be so weak on other occasions. Nacho Monreal was the unlikely star on his comeback from an ankle problem. He scored the opening goal and laid on the second and third before departing, as a precaution, on 33 minutes after a kick to his hamstring. Monreal was not the only Arsenal player who retuned from injury to good effect. Laurent Koscielny scored the third goal while Mesut Özil decorated the afternoon with some lovely touches, not least his flick for Alexandre Lacazette’s first goal in 10 games. Roy Hodgson could not believe what he was watching. It was a day when virtually nothing went right for him and his Palace team, down to Yohan Cabaye being taken off on a stretcher with ankle ligament damage in the closing moments. It looked like yet another serious injury problem for the club. Arsenal laid waste to Palace in an early bombardment and it was shocking to see how loose the visitors were at the back. Wenger’s team twisted the knife with relish. The game was over after only 13 minutes, when Monreal eluded James McArthur and ran around the back to meet Granit Xhaka’s corner. Monreal hooked into the danger area and Koscielny rolled home. Monreal’s goal set the tone for both teams. McArthur let him go on a Xhaka corner and the defender advanced into yards of space to thump home his header. The goalkeeper, Wayne Hennessey, was caught in no man’s land. McArthur put his head in his hands. Palace were on their heels all too regularly and it was particularly pronounced on Arsenal’s second. Timothy Fosu-Mensah stretched to cut out Alex Iwobi’s ball for Lacazette but when it broke Monreal was allowed to power into the left side of the area. He cut the ball back and Alex Iwobi, in so much space, swept past Hennessey from close range. Arsenal enjoyed themselves, pulling out the party tricks; Palace gasped for breath. The fourth was all about the interchange between Özil and Jack Wilshere. The final pass came from Özil – a sumptuous backheel – and Lacazette beat Hennessey for power. It was a humiliation for Palace. Özil and Wilshere drew aahs with first-half flicks and the damage at the interval might have been heavier. Iwobi twice worked Hennessey while James Tomkins leapt into a saving block on 15 minutes to deny Xhaka. Palace, who the have completed the signings of the defender Jaroslaw Jach from Zaglebie Lubin and the midfielder Erdal Rakip on loan from Benfica, were better after the interval, although they could hardly have been any worse. Wilfried Zaha wanted a penalty following a challenge from Mohamed Elneny while Bakary Sako found Christian Benteke with a glorious ball on the break. Benteke could not beat Cech when one-on-one. Iwobi was again denied by Hennessey while Lacazette had a stoppage-time penalty appeal turned down after Tomkins jumped in on him. Palace’s consolation came when Luka Milivojevic took a touch on his chest, spun and found the far corner following Cabaye’s corner. It rang hollow. Before kick-off, it emerged Arsenal had failed with a €50m (£44m) bid for the Borussia Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Olivier Giroud has been mentioned as a possible makeweight in the deal. Wenger made no comment, possibly fearing another ”tactical reaction” from the Dortmund sporting director, Michael Zorc. Arsenal did their talking on the pitch."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/20/stoke-huddersfield-premier-league-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T17:27:31Z","webTitle":"Joe Allen strike sees off Huddersfield and gives Stoke renewed hope","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/20/stoke-huddersfield-premier-league-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/20/stoke-huddersfield-premier-league-report","fields":{"headline":"Joe Allen strike sees off Huddersfield and gives Stoke renewed hope","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"A brave new era at Stoke City got off to the best possible start as Paul Lambert’s first game in charge delivered the precious victory that breathes fresh life into their troubled season. Joe Allen and Mame Diouf scored the goals that lifted Stoke out of the relegation zone and had Lambert manically running on to the pitch to celebrate. The 48-year-old was way down Stoke’s original list of candidates to replace Mark Hughes and news of his appointment was not exactly welcomed by the supporters, yet few will be complaining if this result proves to be a sign of things to come. This was Stoke’s first win in five league matches and their first clean sheet since October. Lambert, whose last game as a Premier League manager was almost three years ago, looked like he was determined to make up for lost time. The Scot paced up and down his technical area throughout, heading and kicking every ball and working himself up into such a sweat that he pointed to the bench and asked for a second bottle of water after only 15 minutes. Stoke took rather longer to get going but they never looked back from the moment that Allen, the best player on the pitch, converted Eric Choupo-Moting’s cross eight minutes into the second half. Choupo-Moting was also involved in the second goal, which was clinically dispatched by Diouf with a little over 20 minutes remaining, and in effect killed the game on an afternoon when the Stoke fans rediscovered their voice. “I’m delighted for the players and the supporters,” said Lambert. “I thought they bounced off each other.” Huddersfield, it has to be said, were obliging opponents. David Wagner’s side rarely troubled Jack Butland, the Stoke goalkeeper, during a listless performance and the large number of away supporters here could be forgiven for fearing that their season is starting to unravel a little. Huddersfield are 14th but only three points clear of the relegation zone and have now failed to win in six league matches. “It was a deserved defeat,” Wagner said. “We tried our best but Stoke limited our offensive game and were too aggressive for us today.” Although both teams were poor in the opening 45 minutes, when Xherdan Shaqiri squandered an excellent chance to score on the stroke of half-time, Stoke improved significantly in the second half. The opening goal arrived after Charlie Adam’s lovely pass set Choupo-Moting free down the left and, although the forward’s cut-back eluded Diouf, the ball ran into the path of Allen, who steered a crisp first-time shot inside Jonas Lössl’s near post. Stoke did not have to wait long for a second goal. Choupo-Moting fed the ball into the feet of Shaqiri, whose clever backheel released Diouf. One-on-one with Lössl, Diouf squeezed his low shot in off the upright and Lambert was running around with his arms aloft. “We won’t win every game but if we can keep that level of intensity, we’ll be fine,” the Stoke manager said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/20/vancouver-aquarium-wont-keep-whales-or-dolphins-captive-after-public-outcry","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T09:00:48Z","webTitle":"Vancouver aquarium won't keep whales or dolphins captive after public outcry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/20/vancouver-aquarium-wont-keep-whales-or-dolphins-captive-after-public-outcry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/20/vancouver-aquarium-wont-keep-whales-or-dolphins-captive-after-public-outcry","fields":{"headline":"Vancouver aquarium won't keep whales or dolphins captive after public outcry","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"For years the Vancouver aquarium fended off pressure from animal right activists, local government and residents, arguing instead that whales and dolphins were central to its mission. But this week the tourist attraction gave in to public pressure, and announced that it would end the practice of keeping cetaceans in captivity. “It had become a local hot topic, to the point where it was just hijacking everything else,” said John Nightingale, the aquarium’s president. “As much as we understand the tremendous value that an animal like a beluga whale brought to our mission … public controversy had gotten to the point where it was just preventing us from moving forward on so many other parts of our mission.” The decision follows years of campaigning in the western Canadian city. In May – after two beluga whales died just weeks apart – municipal authorities voted to ban the aquarium from bringing in new cetaceans. The aquarium vowed to fight back, citing plans for a C$20m Arctic exhibit featuring belugas and the educational and awareness opportunities offered by the captive cetaceans. But public opinion continued to shift – partly galvanised by the deaths of five cetaceans within a 15-month span. Along with the two beluga whales who were found to have died due to an unknown toxin, the facility lost a false killer whale to a bacterial infection and two harbour porpoises, one to pulmonary disease and the other of an unknown cause. Currently the facility is home to just one cetacean: Helen, a Pacific white-sided dolphin with partial flippers. Believed to be in her 30s, Helen has spent more than decade at the aquarium after she was found entangled in a fishing net in Japan. The aquarium said it would weigh its options for the lone dolphin in the coming months although, neither of the solutions being considered are perfect, said Nightingale. The facility could bring in a companion animal to stay with her as long as she lives – which would violate this week’s announcement – or potentially risk her health by sending her to another facility. Another exemption being sought is for the aquarium’s longstanding cetacean rescue program. While more than 99% of rescues are returned to the wild, some cannot be, Nightingale said. The aquarium wants to be allowed to house these animals in its display pools as they wait for them to be moved to their new homes. The announcement was welcomed across the country by animal rights campaigners, who described it as the culmination of a decades-long battle. Marineland in Niagara Falls, Ontario is now believed to be the only other facility in the country that houses cetaceans, boasting on its website of the “largest collection of beluga whales in the world”. “The Vancouver Aquarium appears to have finally accepted that whale and dolphin captivity is no longer socially acceptable in Canada,” said Camille Labchuk of Animal Justice. “The writing is on the wall for the whale and dolphin captivity industry.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/22/brazil-lgbt-violence-deaths-all-time-high-new-research","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T07:15:43Z","webTitle":"Violent deaths of LGBT people in Brazil hit all-time high","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/22/brazil-lgbt-violence-deaths-all-time-high-new-research","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/22/brazil-lgbt-violence-deaths-all-time-high-new-research","fields":{"headline":"Violent deaths of LGBT people in Brazil hit all-time high","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Violent deaths of LGBT people in Brazil have hit an all-time high following a sudden spike last year, new research reveals. At least 445 LGBT Brazilians died as victims of homophobia in 2017 – a 30% increase from 2016, according to LGBT watchdog group Grupo Gay de Bahia. The victims – 387 murders and 58 suicides – include Dandara dos Santos, a transexual woman who was beaten to death in the north-eastern Brazil city Fortaleza in March. A video of her being beaten and kicked circulated on social media with her torturers calling her homophobic slurs. Brazil is one of the world’s most violent countries, with a record 62,000 homicides in 2016, but authors of the research say that the deaths were directly related to homophobia. Luiz Mott, an anthropologist and president of Grupo Gay de Bahia, said the rising violence owed much to the prominence of ultraconservative politicians, many of whom are linked to the country’s powerful evangelical caucus in congress. “It’s a discourse that destroys solidarity and equates LGBT people to animals,” he said. TV programs linked to evangelical churches often compare homosexuality to the devil, she said Homophobic speech is not a federal crime in Brazil, while similar state and municipal laws are rarely effective or enforced. “In the last decade Brazil looked to produce policies that could protect vulnerable groups like gay and trans people but they mostly failed, due to lack of investment or change in vision of policy,” said Jurema Werneck, executive director at Amnesty International Brazil. The violence might seem at odds with Brazil’s image as an inclusive nation that is home to the world’s largest gay parade and where gay marriage is legal. But the country has a strong conservative streak too: one of the leading candidates in this year’s presidential election is former army captain Jair Bolsonaro who has said that gay children can be “beaten straight”. In March last year, federal congressman Victório Galli said on radio that Mickey Mouse was a homosexual infiltrator and Disney was an apologist for “gayness” sending subliminal messages to children. In September, a Brazilian judge approved gay “conversion therapy”, a week after an exhibition of gay art was cancelled."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jan/21/afc-championship-game-patriots-jaguars-latest-score","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T23:24:45Z","webTitle":"Jacksonville Jaguars 20-24 New England Patriots: AFC championship game – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jan/21/afc-championship-game-patriots-jaguars-latest-score","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jan/21/afc-championship-game-patriots-jaguars-latest-score","fields":{"headline":"Jacksonville Jaguars 20-24 New England Patriots: AFC championship game – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"So, the Patriots will be returning to the Super Bowl.

My work here is done, however. Thanks for reading, especially everyone who contributed to this liveblog. Sorry I couldn’t quite fit in everybody. Ciao! You can read the full report from the game here: Give the Jacksonville Jaguars the credit: They played well enough to win tonight. The Patriots were able to make just one or two more plays at the end. Jaguars 20-24 Patriots, FINAL And the Patriots get a first down on the Jacksonville 38 and that seals the deal. The Patriots will be returning to the Super Bowl! Jaguars 20-24 Patriots, 4th quarter, 1:38 Bortles’s throw at 4th &amp; 15 is swatted away by Stephon Gilmore. The Patriots get it back on downs. Jaguars 20-24 Patriots, 4th quarter, 2:00 Gostkowski’s kick goes into the end zone for a touchback. Bortles makes two great throws to get his team to the New England 38 but James Harrison makes that one postseason play that he was brought to make: he forces a fumble at the New England 47. The Jaguars recover but it’s a 3rd and 19 situation now. That takes us to the 2 minute warning. Jaguars 20-24 Patriots, 4th quarter, 2:48 1st an goal time, White picks up a yard. On 2nd &amp; 4, Brady finds, who else, Damon Amendola who stretches out to make a touchdown catch that gives the Patriots the lead. The extra point is good. Jaguars 20-17 Patriots, 4th quarter, 3:57 On 2nd and 2, Brady picks up 2 yards himself. it’s a new set of downs for the Patriots,, who are now at the Jacksonville 5. Jaguars 20-17 Patriots, 4th quarter, 4:19 Brady throws to White who picks up 15 yards to get the Patriots to the Jacksonville 15. Brady finds Amendola for a spectacular catch to bring the Patriots to the Jaguars’ 7. This could be the game. Jaguars 20-17 Patriots, 4th quarter, 4:58 Jaguars start at their own. On 1st down, Fournette gets stuffed for a one yard loss. On 2nd and 11, Bortles nearly throws an interception On 3rd and 11, Bortles throws another incompletion. They have to punt. And Amendola has a great return on the punt, bringing it 20 yards to the Jacksonville 30. Jaguars 20-17 Patriots, 4th quarter, 5:53 Patriots start at their own 19 after Amendola makes a fair catch. On 1st &amp; 10, Brady throws to Cooks, it’s incomplete but there’s a defensive pass interference call that puts them a the Jacksonville 45. On 1st &amp; 10, Brady throws incomplete to White. On 2nd &amp; 10, Brady throws incomplete again, this time to Amendola. On 3rd and 10… yet another incomplete pass. So much for momentum. Here comes Ryan Allen to punt. Jaguars 20-17 Patriots, 4th quarter, 6:34 Gillette is as loud as its been all night. The Jaguars are starting at their own 16 after a kickoff return. Fournette gets a single measly yard on first down but on 2nd &amp; 9, Bortles hits Allen Hurns with a fantastic pass that brings the Jaguars to their own 37. Fournette picks up an extra yard. On 2nd &amp; 9, Bortles almost throws an interception but it will just be an incompletion. 3rd &amp; 9. Bortles throw is… incomplete. The Jaguars have to punt. Solid job the Pats defense there. Jaguars 20-17 Patriots, 4th quarter, 8:44 Brady finds Amendola for 14 yards. it’s 1st an goal at the Jacksonville 9 and Brady finds Amendola yet again. That’s a touchdown, Gostkowski’s kick is good and just like that it’s a three point game. Jaguars 20-10 Patriots, 4th quarter, 9:30 The Jaguars get a huge 1st down sack on Brady to set up a 3rd and 18, but Brady manages to throw to Amndola for 21 yards. Whoa. On the next pass, he throws to Dorsett for a gain of 31 yards, and that puts them at the Jacksonville 23. That, as the kids say, escalated quickly. Jaguars 20-10 Patriots, 4th quarter, 12:03 Patriots start at their own 25. Brady throws to Cooks for an 18 yards gain . It’s 1st and 10 on the New England 45. On the next play however, a gadget play breaks down and Lewis fumbles the ball after an Amendola throw Jacksonville recovers the ball, but they can’t do anything with it, so the Patriots get a break here. They end up punting on their own 42. Jaguars 20-10 Patriots, 4th quarter, 14:52 The Patriots force the Jaguars to kick a field goal. Lambo’s 43 yard attempt is good, and that’s a two score lead for Jacksonville. If the Patriots lose, it’s clearly going to be on the Illuminati. That’s my take. Jaguars 17-10 Patriots, end of the 3rd quarter Bortles finds Hurns for a 15 yards gain to the Jacksonville 49. Fournette gets them a few extra yards. Lee picks up a first down. The Jaguars are at the New England 41 and it’s 1st &amp; 10. Bortles throws incomplete. Grant picks up 2 yards to put the Jaguars at New England’s 25 when play resumes in the 4th quarter. Jaguars 17-10 Patriots, 3:21, 3rd quarter The Jaguars start at their own 9. The Patriots defense stuff LaFournette for no gain. On 2nd and 10, Fournette picks up 7 yards. It’s 3rd and 3, maybe a key moment for the New England defense… Instead, Bortles finds Lee for a 18 yard gain. They’re at their own 34 and have a new set of downs. Jaguars 17-10 Patriots, 4:41, 3rd quarter Amendola returns the Jaguars punt to the New England 46. Not bad field position. It doesn’t matter. The Jaguars defense forces another 3-and-out.. Could… Could the Jaguars actually pull this off? Jaguars 17-10 Patriots, 6:47, 3rd quarter Jaguars start on their own 10. His first throw is incomplete. On 2nd down, he gets sacked for a 5 yard loss. It’s 1st and 15 and Yeldon can only get his team 3. The Jaguars punt. “Up by a touchdown, assuming that the kicker didn’t totally screw up the extra point attempt” doesn’t quite have the same ring to it. Jaguars 17-10 Patriots, 8:20, 3rd quarter Patriots will start at their own 25 after a touchback. Lewis picks up a 5 yard gain. On 2nd &amp; 5, Brady’s throw to Cooks is incomplete. No bother, Brady targets Horgan who gets the Patriots 17 yards. Brady makes a beautiful throw on 1st &amp; 10 but Cooks just finagle the catch. On 2nd &amp; 10, Lewis picks up 4 yards. It’s 3rd and &amp; 6 and they’re at the Jguars 49. White can only pick up two and that’s not enough. So it’s punting time again. Jaguars 17-10 Patriots, 10:23, 3rd quarter The Patriots stop the Jaguars on the New England 36, so on 4th &amp; 4 at the New England 36 and they try for a field goal. Josh Lambo makes the 54 yarder that puts Jacksonville up by a touchdown. Jaguars 14-10 Patriots, 12:18, 3rd quarter On 3rd &amp; 8, Bortles finds Yeldon for 9 yards, getting them to the New England 42. That’s a first down for Jacksonville but tackle Cam Robinson was hurt during the play. Jaguars 14-10 Patriots, 13:41, 3rd quarter The Jaguars will start on their own 25 to start the second half after a touchback. Fournette picks up 2 yards on 1st down and Bortles throws a nice short pass to Tommy Bohanon who picks up 20 yards. to get them to their own 47. Oh and Gronk is officially “questionable” to return. Email from Benjamin Yoo: Hey Hunter, watching along while in NZ. with all the concussion issues in the game surely a red card equivalent could help. Gronk looks done. Shouldn’t the offender in helmet contact cases should be kicked from the game and have a 2 or 3 game ban. It took the two footed tackle out of soccer, why not be more aggressive about this sort of tackle in American football. Cheers, Ben I seriously doubt that anything approximating the card system will ever work in the NFL, regardless of whether or not it actually would help. What will the NFL end up doing? Man, I don’t know. If they knew they could get away with it, the answer would probably be “absolutely nothing.” Well this got depressing really quick. Email from Simon McMahon: Evening Hunter. I know nothing about American football, except that I want the Jaguars to win tonight. I do know it’s overtime, not extra time, though. You want a prediction? Ok, let’s say, eh, 34-28. GO JAGUARS!!! It’s hard not to root for the Jaguars in this matchup for a wide variety of reasons. I would call this something close to the best case scenario for the Jaguars, especially if Gronkowski can’t return. The Patriots, of course, can’t be too upset, that could have gone much worse and they’re great at making second half adjustments. What really matters now is how these two teams start the second half. Jaguars 14-10 Patriots, end of the first half Gronk is in the concussion protocol, which is never good to hear. Gostkowski’s kick goes into the end zone.for a touchback. And the Jaguars decide to play it conservatively and will just take a knee and let the clock run out. Given that Bortles’s ball security issues, that’s probably the right call here. They will get the ball to start to second half, however. Jaguars 14-10 Patriots, :55, 2nd quarter Brady throws to Cooks who takes it all the way to Jacksonville 1 and James White picks up that last yard on the next play as he runs in for the Patriots’ first touchdown of the game. The extra point is good. Jaguars 14-3 Patriots, 1:28, 2nd quarter The Patriots, of course, are as dangerous as any team with only two minutes to play. Brady throws to Cooks for a ten yard gain. He throws to Amendola who gets the ball to the 35. Brady connects with White who pick up 5 yards and a first down. He throws to Gronkowski, who get hit by Barry Church. That’s unnecessary roughness and a first down. The Patriots are at their own 40 but Gronk is injured and out. Jaguars 14-3 Patriots, 2:02, 2nd quarter It’s 3rd &amp; 7 now for the Jaguars at the New England 44, they get a first down BUT there’s a delay of game penalty that negates it AND it pushes them back to 5 yards. On 3rd &amp; 12, Bortles is sacked and the Patriots decline a holding penalty. The Jaguars punt, the Patriots escape the jam. Jaguars 14-3 Patriots, 3:28, 2nd quarter Blake Bortles is 12-f0r-14 so far, by the way. The Jaguars are on their own 25. The Patriots have a chance to force a three and out on 3rd &amp; 8 after a 26 yard throw from Bortles to Keelan Cole. Jaguars 14-3 Patriots, 5:26, 2nd quarter Dante Fowler sacks Brady for a 3 yard loss and the Patriots have to punt. This game is going exactly how Jacksonville wants it to so far. Jaguars 14-3 Patriots, 6:17, 2nd quarter So how will the Patriots respond here? They will start at their own 11 after a holding penalty on Marquis Flowers. Te next play Brady finds Gronkoski with a throw, that’s usually a good thing, as it is here. He gets them to the New England 32. This is actually the answer to quite a lot of questions you might have about America. Jaguars 14-3 Patriots, 7:06, 2nd quarter On 1s and 10, T.J. Yeldon is hit for a loss. On 2nd and 13, he’s able to pick up 12 yards and get to the New England 6. On 3rd &amp; 1, Fournette picks up 2 yards, they’re at the New England 4 with a fresh set of downs. They don’t need all of them though, as Fournette immediately runs into the end zone for the Jaguars’ second touchdown of he game. Jaguars 7-3 Patriots, 9:55, 2nd quarter On 2nd &amp; 2, the Patriots defense stops them, but not so much on 3rd and 2, as Fournette runs for 4 yards. That’s a first down and the Jags are on the New England 15. Jaguars 7-3 Patriots,, 11:08, 2nd quarter The Jaguars get to 33.. Out of the shotgun, Bortles throws for 27 yards to Allen Hurns who gets it to the New England 40. Hurns picks up 8 yards the next time out, putting the Jaguars at the 32. There they decide it’s prudent to take out a timeout. One of the peculiar quirks of the NFL is that there is actually very little football in them. It’s sort of like how boxes of cereal are like 40% air. Jaguars 7-3 Patriots,, 13:13, 2nd quarter And the Jaguars force a three-and-out right after scoring a touchdown. This is exactly how the Jaguars had to start if they were going to have any hope of pulling off a win here at Gillette. The Patriots seem somewhat frustrated early and it’s hard to blame them. Jaguars 7-3 Patriots,, 14:15, 2nd quarter Jaguars start the quarter at the Patriots 28. They don’t stay there long. Bortles throws to Grant who goes for 24 yards before being stopped by Devin McCourty at the 4 yard mark.. The next play, Bortles throws a touchdown pass to Marcedes Lewis! The extra point attempt is good and, look at that, the Jaguars have a lead. Jaguars 0-3 Patriots, end of the 1st quarter Bortles throws to Cole who picks up 11 yards and a first down. That’s the end of the first quarter, these teams are definitely still feeling each other our right now it seems. Jaguars 0-3 Patriots, 1:01, 1st quarter Ryan Alllen’s punt buts the Jaguars on their own 34. Bortles throws a short pass to Corey Grant who picks up 20 yards. Bortles connects with Lee to get insider the New England 49. Fournette picks up 6 yards and that’s good for a first down. The Jaguars dare at the New England 43. Jaguars 0-3 Patriots, 3:37, 1st quarter Amendola makes a fair catch at the New England 14, where the Patriots will start their drive. The Jaguars gets them into a 3rd &amp; 3 situation, stopping James White, who only is a yard short. A 3 and out for the Patriots. Jaguars 0-3 Patriots, 5:01, 1st quarter They get to their own 49 and that’s as far as they will get as Malcolm Butler takes down lee. Jaguars end their first possession on a punt. Jaguars 0-3 Patriots, 6:01, 1st quarter The Jaguars keep handing going to Leonard Fournette, putting together drives. On 3rd an 2 he passes to Allen Hurns for 3 yards and a first down. I think the majority of America agrees with you on this one. Also, unrelated, but “Desire” is absolutely brilliant. Jaguars 0-3 Patriots, 9:21, 1st quarter The Jaguars defense steps up and forces the Patriots to settle for a field goal. Stephen Gostkowski’s kick is good but that has to feel like a win for Jacksonville. Jaguars 0-0 Patriots, 11:21, 1st quarter They don’t quite get a first down in a 3rd &amp; 4 situation They take a timeout to figure out what they’re doing here. It looks like they’re going for it here. It’s 4th and a yard and he hits Damon Amendola, who gets it to the Jacksonville 10. Not very conservative there. Jaguars 0-0 Patriots, 13:47, 1st quarter Dion Lewis gets 5 yards on 1st &amp; 10. The next time Brady throws to Brandon Cook for a 31 yard gain. Looks like the hand is fine. They’re at the Jacksonville 39. Jaguars 0-0 Patriots, 15:00, 1st quarter It goes into the end zone for a touchback. Jacksonville wins the coin toss and they will defer, the Patriots will start with possession. We’re almost off. Meanwhile.... So, is anyone willing to take the Jaguars for this game? I think the only chance they have a chance is if Brady has a terrible game, which (of course) entirely possible if his hand injury is more significant than it seems. In fact, there’s already chatter that this whole thing is being set up as an excuse if Brady looks terrible today, a line of thinking that would probably sound incredibly paranoid if it weren’t for the fact that this is the Patriots organization we’re talking about. I say that even if the hand is a factor, the Patriots will be able to figure out a way to end Jacksonville’s run. Jaguars 10-20 Patriots. How they got here In order to make it to this AFC Championship game, the Jaguars had to first beat the Buffalo Bills, which they did in relatively unexciting fashion: they won by the final score of 10-3 victory. Their wild win over the Pittsburgh Steelers was a lot more exciting. they held on to a 45-42 win after a last second Pittsburgh touchdown made it look like a tighter game than it actually was. The Patriots, on the other hand, had a bye week and then easily defeated the Tennessee Titans 35-14. One of these teams is a tad more rested than the other, one would think. BRADY HAND UPDATE. It is now covered in black wrapping of some sort. There’s only one real story line for today’s AFC Championship Game: Can the Jacksonville Jaguars continue their unexpected playoff run by beating the New England Patriots? If they could pull it off, and it honestly feels like anything is possible at this particular point in history, it would amount to one of the biggest upsets in NFL history. To make their first Super Bowl, all the Jaguars have to do is defeat the defending champions in the New England Patriots, who are seeking their 7th Super Bowl win/. The Patriots are led by Tom Brady, who is making a strong case for being the greatest quarterback of all time. The Jaguars have Blake Bortles, who is literally a sitcom punchline.. What’s a potential wild card? Well that would be this game’s biggest sublet: How injured is Tom Brady? Earlier this week he suffered some sort of hand injury that prevented him from practicing this week, giving al of New England a good scare. He will definitely be starting, the question is how close he is to 100% and how close to 100% does he need to be for his team to beat the Jaguars? Don’t expect to hear anything from Brady, he actually showed up at Gillette Stadium with his hands in his pockets. As always we welcome your commentary throughout today’s NFL action.

Ben de Pear, the editor of Channel 4 News, said Newman had been subjected to “vicious misogynistic abuse”. Having to call in security specialists was a “terrible indictment of the times we live in”, he said. Newman interviewed the psychologist, Jordan Peterson, about gender on Tuesday. A video of the full 30-minute interview has been watched more than 1.6m times on the Channel 4 News YouTube page and has attracted more than 36,000 comments. Peterson rose to prominence in 2016 when he released a video lecture series in which he said that his right to free speech meant he would not use gender-neutral pronouns for transgender students at the University of Toronto. He was in the UK promoting a new book called 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos. The combative Channel 4 interview led to praise for Peterson and criticism for Newman on some right-leaning sites. James Delingpole, a Breitbart columnist, said the interview marked a “pivotal victory in the culture wars” and that the “weaknesses of the regressive left have never been more cruelly or damningly expose”. Douglas Murray in the Spectator said: “I don’t think I have ever witnessed an interview that is more catastrophic for the interviewer.” Newman has faced a wave of abuse and threats online, including on Twitter. There is no suggestion that Peterson, Delingpole or Murray are behind the threats or instigated them. De Pear said on Twitter on Friday: “Our Channel 4 News on-screen journalists expect to be held to account for their journalism but the level of vicious misogynistic abuse, nastiness, and threat to Cathy Newman is an unacceptable response to a robust and engaging debate with Jordan Peterson. “Such is the scale of threat, we are having to get security specialists in to carry out an analysis. I will not hesitate to get the police involved if necessary. What a terrible indictment of the times we live in.” Newman retweeted De Pear’s posts. In response to Murray’s column – in which he said Newman should get Channel 4 to remove the video from the internet because of how “catastrophic” it was – she said earlier in the week: “Always grateful for advice from Douglas Murray but I won’t be suing or taking out a super-injunction. I thoroughly enjoyed my bout with Jordan Peterson as did hundreds of thousands of our viewers. Viva feminism, viva free speech. Stay tuned Douglas.” Channel 4 News said: “Following her interview with psychology professor Jordan Peterson broadcast earlier this week, our presenter Cathy Newman has been the target of unwarranted and unacceptable misogynistic abuse and threats. “As journalists in the public eye, our presenters expect criticism, but we will not tolerate this level of abuse towards our staff. We have taken immediate steps to ensure Cathy’s safety and security and continue to offer her our full support on this matter.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jan/22/lgbt-muslims-san-francisco-art","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T11:30:48Z","webTitle":"'We're stepping out of a binary' – celebrating the art of marginalized LGBT Muslims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/22/lgbt-muslims-san-francisco-art","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/22/lgbt-muslims-san-francisco-art","fields":{"headline":"'We're stepping out of a binary' – celebrating the art of marginalized LGBT Muslims","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In the aftermath of the Orlando terror attack – the deadliest incident of violence against LGBT people in American history – queer Muslims felt the chill when it was announced the killer was Omar Mateen, a homophobic Muslim man who was reported to be gay. “It was a particularly fraught moment for queer and transgender Muslims because the attacker was unfortunately a Muslim,” said San Francisco artist, writer and curator Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. “It caused a lot of us to feel isolated by our own queer community and there was a lot of Islamophobia in the queer community,” he said. “You were either queer or Muslim, but there is the resistance to say no – we are both. We inhabit both identities.” While queer and transgender Muslim artists have been marginalized in the past, they have a new platform to share their experiences and their voice in a new art exhibition opening at SOMArts Cultural Center in San Francisco on 25 January titled The Third Muslim: Queer and Trans Muslim Narratives of Resistance and Resilience. The show features artwork by 14 queer, transgender and gender non-binary Muslim artists from Syria, Pakistan, Somalia, and beyond, including painters, performance artists and fashion designers. “We can find ways to reconcile the identities of being queer and Muslim and in this case, people are reconciling them creatively,” said Bhutto, the co-curator of the exhibition who is the grandson of the namesake Pakistani president. “It unfortunately took Trump to wake people up again,” he said. “We need to constantly be attuned to these forms of bigotry and prejudice that affect our own communities. To be publicly a Muslim in America is an act of resistance.” The show features artwork themed around issues of Islamophobia, racism and homophobia to “highlight the struggles common among contemporary Muslim queer, trans and gender non-conforming communities,” said co-curator and activist Yas Ahmed. The title for the show, The Third Muslim, comes from breaking the two-tier stereotype around Islam in today’s world, especially in light of the recent “Muslim Ban”. “When we think of Muslim stereotypes, we think of a moderate Muslim and an extremist Muslim,” said Bhutto. “With The Third Muslim, we’re bringing in another perspective of Islam and queer identities – we’re not saying there are only three types of Muslims, but we’re stepping out of a binary.” The show might be timely considering the political climate, but the curators believe this inclusive exhibition is also long overdue. “We wanted to include voices of people who have queer and Muslim experiences in a way that invites conversation with the public,” said Ahmed. “There are certain attachments people have when they think of Islam but we’re using the show to reflect on the breadth and depth of being queer and Muslim.” Among the works in the show, San Francisco-based Syrian artist Jamil Hellu shows a piece called Cloak, which depicts an image of a man wearing a headscarf, which is screen-printed on lambskin leather. “This work refers to the conflicts related to covering up queer identity for fear of homophobia and physical violence,” said Hellu. “The work considers the duality of being Arab and queer, it brings the friction between my Syrian lineage and gay identity into focus as I look for ways to voice my despair over homophobia and violence against LGBTQ people in the Middle East.” North Carolina artist Saba Taj shows a piece entitled Fuck Veil Art, which is a collection of colourful, veiled mannequins she made in collaboration with her mother. “Before 9/11, I just knew a burqa as something that some Muslims wore in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and after, it became this incredibly pervasive image that underscored Islamophobic messaging – the burqa has become synonymous with ‘Muslim’ and ‘terrorist’,” said Taj. “There is something tiring about the use of hijabs and burqas in both Islamophobia and its countering narratives, but still, I think there is so much there to talk about.” The exhibition also features photos by Iranian artist Kiyaan Abadani, who brings a modern twist to traditional Iranian portraiture, paintings by Pakistani artist Numair Abbasi and photographs by Chicago-based Bengali artist Nabeela Vega, who captures a gold veiled person in displacing scenarios and landscapes. Despite the ongoing struggles of isolation, Islamophobia and racism the queer Muslim community face, this exhibition is a space for not only dialogue, but for healing. “We are finding ways where we can heal ourselves, each other and find each other, and this is a way to make that happen,” said Bhutto. “The world is in need of healing, the problems have not been resolved and justice has not been served to many of us, the community we come from. We are trying to find a way to shed light on issues that are important to us, in order to see is a necessary change in the world– as queer, Muslim and trans artists representing ourselves.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/22/bandgladesh-textile-factory-safety-unions-settlement","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T07:00:43Z","webTitle":"Unions reach $2.3m settlement on Bangladesh textile factory safety","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/22/bandgladesh-textile-factory-safety-unions-settlement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/22/bandgladesh-textile-factory-safety-unions-settlement","fields":{"headline":"Unions reach $2.3m settlement on Bangladesh textile factory safety","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Unions representing Bangladeshi textile workers have reached a landmark $2.3m settlement with a multinational apparel brand after it was accused of delays in remedying life-threatening hazards at its factories. The settlement was agreed after a two-year arbitration process under the legally binding Bangladesh Accord for Fire and Building Safety. The accord was set up in the wake of the fatal collapse of the Rana Plaza textile factory complex in 2013, which killed 1,135 people in what is considered the world’s worst textile industrial disaster. Many of the world’s largest brands, including Adidas, H&amp;M, Marks &amp; Spencer, Tesco, Top Shop and Uniqlo are signatories to the accord. There is no evidence that any of these brands is the company involved in the settlement. The brand, which cannot be named under the terms of the settlement, has agreed to pay $2m to fix issues at more than 150 garment factories in Bangladesh. A further $300,000 will be paid to the two unions that brought the case, IndustriALL Global Union and UNI Global Union, to fund their joint “supply chain worker support fund”, an initiative that supports union-backed efforts to improve pay and conditions for workers in global supply chains. Christy Hoffman, UNI Global Union’s deputy general secretary called the settlement “ground breaking”. “This proves the validity of the arbitration process. It’s a turning point for business and human rights,” she said. The case, heard at the permanent court of arbitration in The Hague, was brought after the unions complained that basic safety features at the factories, such as the presence of locked gates, structural faults and a lack of fire doors and sprinkler systems, had not been addressed despite pledges to the contrary. The case’s filing in October 2016 did, however, spur action. One factory went from a remediation rate of 56% in October 2016 to more than 90% in October 2017. But other factories supplying the brand continued to lag far behind and serious structural and fire safety issues were left unresolved. IndustriALL’s general secretary, Valter Sanches, said: “This settlement shows that the Bangladesh Accord works. It is proof that legally binding mechanisms can hold multinational companies to account. We are glad that the brand in question is now taking seriously its responsibility for the safety of its supplier factories in Bangladesh. Their financial commitment serves as an example for other brands to follow.” This is the second arbitration case to be settled under the accord. In December 2017, IndustriALL and UNI reached another agreement with a brand using more than 200 factories in Bangladesh. However, that settlement was reached under an even tighter confidentiality agreement and even the amount of the settlement was kept under wraps. Accord inspectors have so far carried out inspections on more than 1,800 factories supplying more than 200 brands and identified over 118,500 fire, electrical and structural hazards. A 2016 report by the Asia Floor Wage Alliance found little progress had been made to improve labour conditions for garment workers since the Rana Plaza disaster. Child labour remains rampant and protests over pay and conditions have led to strikes in Bangladesh, which ranks behind only China as a supplier of clothes to western countries. But Hoffman said that despite remaining issues the accord agreement has had a significant impact. Some 83% of workplace dangers identified in the accord’s original round of inspections have now been addressed. “There has been a significant level of change,” said Hoffman. “However, we are pushing for 100% and we want to make sure that the funds are there for us to get over the finishing line.” The collapse of the Rana Plaza complex, which supplied clothes to retailers including Benetton, Primark and Walmart, triggered a global outcry over the treatment of workers in Bangladesh. A second accord agreement was signed in June of this year. It goes into effect when the original agreement expires in May 2018 and extends the accord’s protections until 31 May 2021."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/20/anthony-joshua-joseph-parker-steroids-jibe","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T21:59:03Z","webTitle":"Anthony Joshua desperate to make Joseph Parker pay for ‘king of steroids’ jibe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/20/anthony-joshua-joseph-parker-steroids-jibe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/20/anthony-joshua-joseph-parker-steroids-jibe","fields":{"headline":"Anthony Joshua desperate to make Joseph Parker pay for ‘king of steroids’ jibe","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Anthony Joshua has admitted Joseph Parker got under his skin with jibes about his supposed glass jaw and being “the king of steroids” – but said he will come in faster and lighter and make the New Zealander pay when they fight in March. Joshua, who puts his WBA, IBF and IBO belts on the line against Parker, wants to end the year as undisputed heavyweight champion – first by taking the New Zealander’s WBO belt and then by defeating the WBC champion, Deontay Wilder, in what he hopes will be a compelling summer unification fight at Wembley Stadium. He warned his rivals he has improved significantly after revamping his training following his below-par showing against Carlos Takam in October. “I am leaps and bounds ahead compared to the Klitschko and Takam fights,” said Joshua, who pointed out his weight was already down to 17st 8lb, eight pounds lighter than against Takam. “I’m watching what I eat, running further and doing more than I did last year. Last week I did 20 rounds in the gym which I wasn’t even doing for Klitschko, and we’re still 11 weeks to the Parker fight. “I think speed is in power,” he added. “When you’re heavy and you try to club these durable fighters, it’s not that simple just to go ‘boom’. Just because I’m the most muscly man, it doesn’t mean I can just hit someone and knock them out. It’s the shot that you don’t see coming that knocks you out. When I’m quicker – bang, bang, bang – that’s when I can knock my opponents down a lot easier.” The 28-year-old had sharp words for Parker and his entourage, who he said had lied about him being put down in the gym and using performance-enhancing drugs to hype the fight and annoy him. “Three times it’s happened,” he said. “If you want to use it as a PR stunt carry on using it as a PR stunt, but let’s just talk about facts if you want to talk real. It gets under my skin. If he’s better than me, quicker than me, tougher than me, it will take a lot to put me away because I won’t stop coming.” Joshua pointed out he was not only tested regularly by UK Anti-Doping but also paid extra to be on the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association testing programme before fights. “I give them a slot and they can turn up anywhere, if I’m on holiday, at a hotel, at a club,” he said. “I just text them and say I’m going to be here. You have to let them know. I normally give them the time when I’m going to be in the gym training for the opportunity.” On one occasion the drug testers even accompanied him to Nando’s in Sheffield. “You have to go through the piss test before they take your blood,” Joshua explained. “So I said: ‘Look, I haven’t eaten, I’m not going to sit here for an hour.’ So they have to follow me, I got in my car. We went to eat at Nando's. They were patient. Then they followed me home.” Meanwhile Joshua’s promoter, Eddie Hearn, has told Wilder he must be realistic if he wants a unification fight against Joshua. “We were up for fighting Wilder now,” he said. “But it’s very easy to kill a fight. And you kill a fight by coming out with an unrealistic remark like: ‘I won’t take one per cent less than 50-50 or there’s no fight.’ We look at that and say: ‘Mate go away, don’t waste our time.’ We would love Wilder to be next but he’s got delusions of grandeur.” Before that Joshua knows he will have to get past Parker – who clearly believes he can spring a huge upset. “I played rugby union when I was at school for three years as a lock, as you can probably tell by my cauliflower ear,” Parker said. “I had thoughts of turning professional at rugby but my dad always told me to focus on one sport so I chose boxing. And it was the best decision ever.” However, Joshua intends to make him eat those words – and plenty of others – on 31 March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/20/why-has-britain-given-such-a-warm-welcome-to-this-shadowy-professor","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T18:05:05Z","webTitle":"Why has Britain given such a warm welcome to this shadowy professor? | Nick Cohen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/20/why-has-britain-given-such-a-warm-welcome-to-this-shadowy-professor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/20/why-has-britain-given-such-a-warm-welcome-to-this-shadowy-professor","fields":{"headline":"Why has Britain given such a warm welcome to this shadowy professor?","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"‘Professor” Joseph Mifsud once said he was not a Russian spy. Then he vanished and stayed vanished despite multiple attempts by journalists to put pertinent questions to him. Though he is not named in the indictment, prosecutors working for the Mueller inquiry into Russian involvement in Donald Trump’s election allege this ghostly presence, this incredible vanishing man, was the conduit between the Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos and a Kremlin with “dirt” to share on Hillary Clinton. The rest of us are in the dark. But perhaps not wholly so. Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, and joined the list of officials who would rather send their former friends on the alt right to jail than go to jail themselves. For his part, the “professor” has at least raised questions about how respectable academic institutions and the highest levels of British politics are open to penetration by kleptomaniac regimes. Anyone who examines Mifsud’s career should be wary of believing a word he says. But on one point he is right. He’s not a traditional spy, if your image of the spy is a brutal cold war colonel from the KGB. He appears to be something altogether more modern. Mifsud is from Malta. He received a Phd from Queen’s University, Belfast in 1995, on how to reform primary school education, and then served as an assistant to a Maltese foreign minister, which I suppose gave him a little experience of diplomacy. In 2008, he popped up at the EMUNI University in Slovenia. It may not be Europe’s most distinguished academic institution, but it was too distinguished for Mifsud. The Times of Malta reported he left in haste after pocketing €39,000 in expenses, including an impressive €13,767 for mobile calls. Where would a man like this head to? Why, dear old London town, of course, where half the oligarchs, thieves, spies, spivs and shits on the planet are welcomed. Mifsud set up the “London Academy of Diplomacy” and boasted to the Washington Diplomat that it was “one of the best diplomatic academies in the world”. Mifsud denies any wrongdoing and is, of course, innocent until proved guilty. Still, when the necessary caveats have been made, I have to say the London Academy of Diplomacy does not look like an elite diplomatic finishing school. It’s my fault, for having a suspicious mind but at first glance it appears to resemble just the type of front organisation an espionage agency would establish. “It felt like something was weird,” Simona Mangiante told the Guardian last week. “I never met any Russians there… But the centre certainly wasn’t what it pretended to be.” Mifsud recruited Mangiante from the European parliament because of her excellent contacts book. Through the academy, she met and fell in love with Papadopoulos. She’s now moved in with him in Chicago, but remembered that, while the academy had an impressive London address in a townhouse overlooking Lincoln’s Inn Fields, behind its doors there was just one table for the staff to work from. They had to supply their own laptops and were wary of the “sneaky” Mifsud. Undeterred by the rickety surroundings, Mifsud quickly found institutions ready to boost his credentials. The University of East Anglia took him on in 2011 and claimed he was a professor, although no one can see how he earned the title. In 2016, he moved to Stirling University, which was delighted that he flew “the University of Stirling flag” at “high-profile” meetings with Putin. You have to have encountered the fierce jealousy with which academics guard their specialisms to realise how unusual it is for two universities to treat Mifsud as an authority on international diplomacy when what expertise he possessed was on early years education. I asked Stirling and East Anglia what academic qualifications Mifsud had for the posts they granted him, what checks they had run on his academy and what financial arrangements they had made with him. Britain’s universities are as bad at replying to questions in the public interest as they are at defending freedom of speech. Stirling refused to answer. East Anglia said it might get back to me this week. Tellingly, as soon as the scandal broke, the London Academy of Diplomacy closed its doors. It’s almost as if it were an intelligence asset whose cover had been blown, rather than an academic institution dedicated to an impartial understanding of international affairs. But for a few years, East Anglia and Stirling helped Mifsud appear to be an expert on diplomacy. He put his unearned reputation to work. At one point, Mifsud said he was close to the Clinton Foundation. At another, he befriended and hired Gianni Pittella, the Italian leader of the Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European parliament. Naturally, Mifsud moved in on Boris Johnson and the Tory right, which is delighting Russia by weakening the European Union. Alok Sharma, a Foreign Office minister until June this year, confirmed Mifsud had attended a fundraising dinner in his constituency. Mifsud boasted he would be “meeting Boris Johnson for dinner re Brexit”. And indeed he did meet our immeasurably incompetent foreign secretary. I don’t know how the Mifsud affair will end. But I do know this. When we talk of tax havens laundering dirty money, we should think of London and New York as well as the Virgin Islands and Bermuda. When we talk of politicians who doff the cap to Putin, we should think of the Brexit right and Labour left as well as the dictators running central Asian republics. And perhaps, when we talk of spies, we will soon need to think less of cruel men extracting secrets from terrified victims and more of podgy “professors” pushing at open doors."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/28/nils-frahm-all-melody-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T08:00:13Z","webTitle":"Nils Frahm: All Melody review – the magnificent and the misjudged","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/28/nils-frahm-all-melody-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/28/nils-frahm-all-melody-review","fields":{"headline":"Nils Frahm: All Melody review – the magnificent and the misjudged","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It all begins unexpectedly – with a wordless chorale “ooh”-ing prettily. For his seventh studio album, German post-classical composer Nils Frahm has expanded his previous core solo piano brief – a brief that was, admittedly, always highly individual. Here are novelties: trumpets and modular synths, birdsong and beatboxes, all recorded in his new base, a refurbished east German palace of mid-20th century tech, the Funkhaus Berlin. As ever, Frahm draws on his classical chops, accentuating the physicality of interacting with members of the piano family. The lush thwop of fingers on keys on hammers on strings on the nebulously jazzy My Friend the Forest or Forever Changeless is enough to give anyone an ASMR thrill. By contrast, Sunson emphasises Frahm’s porous borders, fading organ music into minimal dub techno percussion. Frahm’s judgment slips though. While All Melody’s textures are magnificent, plick-plocking susurrations, his treatment of the human voice is like a gash in an otherwise beauteous canvas.

She spent most of her working life as a physiotherapist and much of her personal time looking after family members and friends. Cynthia was born in Fallowfield, Manchester, to Annie (nee Stapleton) and James Wade. James ran the Vegetarian Society’s first shop, in Rusholme, Manchester. Aged seven, Cynthia was evacuated with her brother, Peter, during the second world war before eventually returning to Manchester, where she and her family sought refuge in the pantry during air raids. After Withington school and the end of the war, she trained in physiotherapy and, despite contracting tuberculosis, which put her in hospital for many months, became a physiotherapist at Wythenshawe hospital. Only six weeks after she met Allan Cownie, a University of Salford academic, they were engaged, and in 1961 they married. Cynthia left her job to raise their young family, who by the end of the 70s – inspired by Peter Singer’s book Animal Liberation and by Cynthia’s upbringing – had collectively turned vegetarian. Later Cynthia became a vegan. In the 1970s she became a physiotherapist at Parkfield school for disabled children in Swinton, Manchester. At home she cared for neighbours on a long-term basis, as well as for her father and then her mother, who had Alzheimer’s and whom she looked after for 20 years. In 1989 Cynthia and Allan retired to Pwllheli in north-west Wales, where she learned Welsh. After 20 years there, Allan’s health deteriorated and Cynthia cared for him. They moved to their final home in Sheffield before Allan died in 2015. Cynthia was a woman who thought deeply about the choices she made and made the world a better place for us all. Her resilience, compassion, selflessness and lack of interest in materialism were evident throughout her life. She is survived by her children, Philippa, David and me, and by seven grandchildren, James, Edward, Lily, Tom, Ella, Max and Joe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/jan/20/harry-kane-world-messi-ronaldo-tottenham","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T19:01:00Z","webTitle":"Harry’s game: Kane making a striking case to succeed Messi and Ronaldo | Nick Ames","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/jan/20/harry-kane-world-messi-ronaldo-tottenham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/jan/20/harry-kane-world-messi-ronaldo-tottenham","fields":{"headline":"Harry’s game: Kane making a striking case to succeed Messi and Ronaldo","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"There was nothing too restrained about the celebrations when, seven years ago on Monday, a young loanee scored his first professional goal. Harry Kane’s close-range finish for Leyton Orient against Sheffield Wednesday was sufficiently gift-wrapped that he glanced over his shoulder towards the linesman as he wheeled away; that element of doubt having been dispelled, the joy was unconfined. At 17 you never know quite how often moments like that will come. The Kane of January 2018 has a somewhat clearer idea. If he scores twice against Southampton on Sunday, he will hit the 100-goal mark in the Premier League; it would be the latest milestone to fall at his feet and evidence, yet again, that targets have become virtually redundant. “I said to someone the other day that it would be great to get to that 100 club before the end of next season,” Kane said in May after scoring four times at Leicester. That now seems modest to a fault. The only real question is where his acceleration can possibly end; any serious debate about his place in Europe’s top bracket has long since been settled and it is more pertinent to wonder whether his ferocious drive for self-improvement can make him the best player of his generation. “Today, one striker in the world, a specific position, who is better than him?” Mauricio Pochettino asked after Kane had put a hat-trick past the Saints on Boxing Day, breaking Alan Shearer’s 22-year record for Premier League goals in a calendar year. Empirically there is no simple answer: Robert Lewandowski would have his proponents, as would Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Sergio Agüero, Luis Suárez and the present-day, centre-forward incarnation of Cristiano Ronaldo. Both Edinson Cavani and Neymar have comparable records this season in an inferior league, the latter starting from wide and providing assists as regularly as goals. Lionel Messi remains, to most sets of eyes, unsurpassable no matter where across a front line he is fielded. Yet Kane, who does not turn 25 until July, is younger than them all – younger too than Ciro Immobile and Mauro Icardi, two strikers who have made significant strides in Italy. Lewandowski, the best player of the last five years to fit the traditional No 9 bracket, was already 27 when, in 2015-16, he first reached the 25-goal mark in a league campaign. Kane will, barring serious injury, achieve that for the third time this season and has never had the benefit of playing for a club that dominate their league. In those early months when Kane, whose progress had been encouraging but not overly persuasive across four loan spells, first began scoring prolifically for Tottenham, it was natural to have doubts. He was making the most of his service but not everybody saw a standout facet, a particular burst of pace or bull-like strength, a gossamer touch or a glint of balletic grace. Perceptions began to swing decisively on New Year’s Day 2015; that afternoon Kane ran Chelsea into the ground during a riotous 5-3 win at White Hart Lane, scoring two brilliant goals and doing so much more, rendering Gary Cahill a disoriented heap by the end of the match. Kane had done it in a big game; he has done it in so many since and it is to Tottenham’s benefit that others took so long to catch on. Zinedine Zidane put it best when, before Spurs visited the Bernabéu in October, he said of Kane: “He is a complete player. He did not seem to be one but in the end he is.” It was the highest possible vote of confidence and also an admission that, among the elite, it took a couple of years to be certain. These days Zidane can be excused a vested interest. If it says everything about Kane’s status that Real Madrid now seems one of very few logical career advancements, the fact Real will soon enough have a vacancy up front adds urgency to any pursuit. Should Real wish to replace Ronaldo, who is 33 next month and stuttering in an underperforming team, with a replica of his former self then Mohamed Salah’s explosive threat from wide seems the nearest modern-day analogue; if a totemic centre-forward fits the plan more neatly, then the answer could hardly be more obvious. It was no accident when Pochettino bracketed them together last month. “You cannot say no for one day,” he said. “That is the secret of the big players like Harry, Cristiano and Messi. You cannot afford not to work every day.” Like Ronaldo, Kane’s strength lies in an inability to tolerate his own weaknesses. The work devoted to improving his pace and power is well documented, as is his appetite for extra shooting practice sessions. Although Roy Hodgson was derided for letting Kane take corners for England at Euro 2016, it at least spoke of the fact that his dead‑ball delivery can be exceptional; he can also pick a pass and, while Pochettino’s reference to a “specific position” makes sense, the overriding impression now is that he would be comfortable anywhere on a football pitch. It is on Tottenham’s pitches that he has touched greatness; it is under Pochettino’s fastidious guidance that he has become the centre‑forward their rivals covet. Breaking that bond would hold no guarantees but at some point a decision may be required. Ronaldo, Aubameyang and Suárez were all 24 when they made the moves that defined their peak years; for Kane it will be a question of how to maximise a clear opportunity to become the best striker of his time. For the moment, though, these questions can wait and it would be a loss not to savour the present. A history-making contribution at St Mary’s would be another reminder that, ever since that quick check for the flag at Brisbane Road, Kane has never once looked back."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"fashion/shortcuts/2018/jan/19/buzz-cut-prince-william-duke-of-cambridge-some-advice-fellow-baldy","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T10:48:05Z","webTitle":"Well done on the buzz cut, William.

And, like me, he has admitted defeat, yesterday becoming the first in the family to baldly go where no man has gone before; he has, at the age of 35, buzzed off his surviving hair. Duke, what took you so long? I was born two months before Wills and have suffered a similar rate of loss. But I took the grade-zero leap about three years ago. It takes guts, but I have not looked back and can now offer the hairless heir my guide to being bald. Properly bald. • It can be hard to give up your barber (I had gone to mine since I was about six), but now that you are bald-bald you can DIY your bonce with clippers and save all us taxpayers some cash. I recommend the rechargeable Wahl haircut and beard trimmer, still only £29.99 at Argos. Once a fortnight will do. Get the duchess to check your crown for missed bits. • People will react; in your case, in every newspaper in the world. But they will react positively and you will wish you had done it sooner. The mickey-taking will cease, so enjoy that. A French former housemate helped tip me over the edge when he described the sorry tuft clinging to my forehead as my “petit chapeau”. • Beware the weather during walkabouts and polo tournaments. I am afraid you have entered the age in a man’s life where hats become a thing, in winter and summer, when you will also need to slap on the factor 30 every day. • From one tall baldy to another: beware low doorways. Bumps that would be forgotten under a mop of hair now become lumps or worse. The payoff for this, along with the convenience, is that your grey hairs won’t show – and your children now have nothing to pull. • But remember this: you are still bald. At best, you are more Grant Mitchell than David Beckham circa 2000, so use your height to avoid photos from above and choose your profile pics wisely. My last piece of advice: stop shaving your face and trim everything at once (in my house we call this the “full Statham”, perhaps optimistically)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/19/boris-johnson-channel-bridge-france-emmanuel-macron","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T16:27:07Z","webTitle":"Experts, industry and PM pour cold water on Boris Johnson's bridge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/19/boris-johnson-channel-bridge-france-emmanuel-macron","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/19/boris-johnson-channel-bridge-france-emmanuel-macron","fields":{"headline":"Experts, industry and PM pour cold water on Boris Johnson's bridge","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"As ideas go, it has not been a resounding success. Architects, hauliers, the maritime industry, and an MP have so far expressed their scepticism about Boris Johnson’s ambition to build a 22-mile (35km) bridge across the Channel - and even the prime minister has signalled it won’t happen. The foreign secretary proposed the idea on Thursday, telling the French president that it was “ridiculous” that two of the world’s biggest economies were joined only by a single railway line and later tweeting a picture of the two giving a thumbs-up. But on Friday, Downing Street swiftly poured cold water on the idea. Pressed several times on whether the prime minister was open to a cross-Channel bridge, Theresa May’s spokesman said there were “no specific plans”. “What was agreed yesterday, and I think that’s what the foreign secretary tweeted about as well, is a panel of experts who will look at major projects together including infrastructure,” he said. That dismissal of the prospect will be seen as a snub for Johnson, who has championed a number of ambitious infrastructure projects that have failed to see the light of day. No 10’s apparent bemusement at his latest suggestion was matched with reservations elsewhere, including from the UK Chamber of Shipping, which represents more than 180 maritime industry bodies. “Building a huge concrete structure in the middle of the world’s busiest shipping lane might come with some challenges,” it tweeted, though the body might be expected to take a dim view of any potential maritime obstruction in the Channel. The chamber’s chief executive, Guy Platten, said: “It’s good to have vision, particularly with respect to transport infrastructure projects, but the Dover Strait is the world’s busiest shipping lane. Many, many hundreds of vessel transits are made each day by commercial shipping, fishing and pleasure craft. “Building a 22-mile-long bridge across the Channel would be a huge construction project, especially as the largest ships currently transiting the strait have a height above the water line in excess of 70 metres. “Shipping moves 95% of the UK’s trade – it is vital that its movement remains as frictionless as possible, without disruption of any kind. The government and the EU should concentrate on keeping trade moving freely through our ports, which is in the economic interest of both sides of the Channel.” The Road Haulage Association said the costs and practical implications of a bridge across the Channel would be “enormous”. Its chief executive, Richard Burnett, said: “We’re better off spending smaller amounts of money on improving our crumbling roads and opening more lorry parks. “The Strait of Dover … carries more than 500 ships daily, so construction would cause huge disruption to sea traffic. And what of the impact on the road network and people of Kent? “The Channel tunnel and the ferry routes are working well within capacity, so it makes no sense to commit huge amounts of taxpayer’s money in an uncertain economic climate to a costly bridge project that we don’t need.” Johnson’s Conservative colleague Charlie Elphicke, the MP for Dover, said cash should be invested in Kent instead. “Boris is right. We absolutely must invest in infrastructure to keep trade flowing between Britain and France,” he said. “Let’s start by dualling the A2 to Dover, and building the Lower Thames Crossing and lorry parks on the M20. Surely it’s not a bridge too far for the government to invest in Kent.” Engineers, however, have said the idea of a Channel bridge is not as far-fetched as it may seem. Alan Dunlop, who teaches architecture at the University of Liverpool, referred to the new 34-mile sea bridge linking Hong Kong and Macau, which cost £12bn. It is yet to open to traffic. “That’s without any regulation, processes, health and safety and using Chinese workers,” he told the Times. “I’d say at least £120bn for a Channel bridge and that’s a conservative estimate. It would really be cheaper to mover France closer.” Even the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage thought Johnson’s idea wide of the mark. He tweeted: Bridge designer Ian Firth, a former president of the Institution of Structural Engineers, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It is entirely feasible. Before the tunnel was built there were bridge options being looked at. “There are bridges of a similar, if not quite the same, scale elsewhere. Of course this would not be one big span; the economics may lean towards something like 800m to 1km spans. It would be a huge undertaking, but it would be absolutely possible, and shipping impact issues could be dealt with.” The Strait of Dover is 20.7 miles (33.3km) and has an average depth of 45m (147ft). Johnson has championed an array of ambitious infrastructure projects that have not come to fruition. As mayor of London, he opened the £60m Emirates Air Line cable car that has failed to attract hoped-for commuter traffic. He wanted an airport built in the Thames estuary, dubbed Boris Island, but the idea was dismissed as impractical and costly in comparison to expanding Heathrow. He also backed the construction of a garden bridge across the Thames in west London, which was ditched by his successor as mayor, Sadiq Khan, for not offering value for money."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/20/great-barrier-reef-coral-bleaching-has-started-early-biologist-says","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T21:00:33Z","webTitle":"Great Barrier Reef coral bleaching has started early, biologist says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/20/great-barrier-reef-coral-bleaching-has-started-early-biologist-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/20/great-barrier-reef-coral-bleaching-has-started-early-biologist-says","fields":{"headline":"Great Barrier Reef coral bleaching has started early, biologist says","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Warm water has already begun bleaching coral on the Great Barrier Reef, weeks ahead of the period with highest forecast risk. Satellite data suggest widespread bleaching is possible by March. Selina Ward, a coral reef biologist from the University of Queensland, has photographed the bleaching, which she said appeared to be very localised so far, but was concerning because of how early in the season it was. “It was quite a large stretch and there were some very recently dead corals,” Ward said. “Hopefully it isn’t a sign of more to come.” “It is the earliness and the early death that worries me,” Ward said, noting that it wasn’t yet an indication that there would be severe or widespread bleaching. The US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) recently updated its bleaching outlook, finding that the entire Great Barrier Reef would face a status of “possible” or “bleaching likely” by February. The world’s coral reefs are reeling from the worst recorded global coral bleaching event, in which the Great Barrier Reef was hit in both 2016 and 2017. Between the two events, half the reef’s coral is thought to have been killed. Heron Island escaped significant bleaching throughout the two bleaching events. In a Facebook post, Noaa’s Coral Reef Watch program posted: “Currently not expecting anything as bad as the last two years but these corals don’t need repeated heat stress.” The latest results firm up uncertain forecasts from November that suggested the same thing. Photos taken by Ward around Heron Island show a large stretch of bleached coral, with some already dead and covered in algae. Coral bleaches when the water around it is too hot for too long. When that happens, it expels the colorful symbiotic algae that lives inside it, leaving transparent flesh exposing the white skeleton. Since the algae provides most of the energy the coral needs to survive, unless water temperatures quickly return to normal, the coral dies. According to a 2013 paper published in Nature, a 2C rise in global surface air temperatures will result in the loss of more than 95% of coral around the world. If the world limits warming to 1.5C, it might save 10%, the paper finds. To save 50% of coral reefs, global warming needs to be halted at 1.2C. The world may already have warmed by about 1C."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/19/frosty-reception-for-south-koreas-winter-olympics-detente-with-north","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T05:59:32Z","webTitle":"Frosty reception for South Korea's Winter Olympics detente with North","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/19/frosty-reception-for-south-koreas-winter-olympics-detente-with-north","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/19/frosty-reception-for-south-koreas-winter-olympics-detente-with-north","fields":{"headline":"Frosty reception for South Korea's Winter Olympics detente with North","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"South Korea is facing a public backlash over its sports rapprochement with North Korea, with critics accusing the government of turning next month’s Pyeongchang Winter Olympics into the “Pyongyang Olympics”. After three high-level meetings along their border in little over a week, North and South Korea have proposed forming a joint women’s ice hockey team and allowing their athletes to march together under one flag at next month’s games in South Korea. Despite the logistical challenges posed by North Korea’s eleventh-hour agreement to compete in Pyeongchang, the International Olympic Committee is expected to give the proposal a sympathetic hearing when it meets officials from both countries in Lausanne on Saturday. But young people and conservatives in South Korea have accused the country’s president, Moon Jae-in, of sacrificing Olympic ideals for diplomatic expediency. Moon’s approval rating fell to a four-month low of 67% on Friday, in a reflection of the public’s lukewarm response to his attempts to promote an Olympic détente he hopes will lead to a diplomatic breakthrough over Pyongyang’s ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes. Moon’s approval rating among people in their 20s and 30s – his core support – fell to 75% and 82% respectively, down six percentage points and seven percentage points from last week. “North Korea was all about firing missiles last year, but suddenly they want to come to the South for the Olympics? Who gets to decide that?,” said Kim Joo-hee, a 24-year-old Seoul resident. “Does North Korea have so much privilege to do whatever they want?” Conservative politicians voiced anger over a proposal to have the country’s athletes march with their North Korean counterparts under a unification flag rather than the South Korean flag. “We are turning the Pyeongchang Olympics that we’ve got into the Pyongyang Olympics,” said Hong Joon-pyo, leader of South Korea’s main conservative opposition party, adding that Seoul was now “dancing to the tune” of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. Moon countered that North Korea’s participation at Pyeongchang “will serve as a chance to warm solidly frozen South-North ties.” He added: “If we march together or field a single team, I think that can be a further step in developing South-North relations.” While the overall number of North Korean athletes has yet to be decided, the existing South Korean ice hockey squad of 22 players will have to be expanded, possibly to 35, to accommodate them – an arrangement criticised by their Canadian coach, Sarah Murray. “Adding somebody so close to the Olympics is a little bit dangerous just for team chemistry because the girls have been together for so long,” Murray said. Ice hockey officials in Switzerland, who face South Korea in their opening match, said the expected late addition of North Korean players was “not fair and distorts competition”. South Korean government officials have also been forced to defend the planned use of North Korea’s Masikryong ski resort as a training base, after critics said it would generate publicity for one of Kim Jong-un’s pet projects.

It was 2014, and celebrities brushed aside the child molestation allegations as unproven or a private family matter, often deeming it too risky to comment further. In 2018, it appears the biggest risk is staying silent. Allen’s legacy is for the first time facing an existential threat in the wake of an unprecedented outpouring of praise and empathy for Farrow, whose account of sexual assault could very well end her father’s career – and soon. Farrow, who alleges that Allen assaulted her in an attic when she was seven years old, has been telling the same story for years, prompting the same vehement denials from the director. But a vast cultural reckoning surrounding sexual abuse in the entertainment industry has shifted the world around them, and observers say the prolific film-maker, who once seemed untouchable, is on track to become too toxic for Hollywood. “This moment is just extraordinary,” said Melissa Silverstein, founder and publisher of Women in Hollywood, a gender equality initiative and film news site. “There’s nothing prestigious now about working with Woody Allen … I think time is up for him. It should’ve been up a long time ago.” Farrow, 32, gave her first television interview this week, recounting the specific details of the alleged assault on 4 August 1992. “I was taken to a small attic crawl space in my mother’s country house in Connecticut by my father. He instructed me to lay down on my stomach and play with my brother’s toy train that was set up,” Farrow told Gayle King of CBS This Morning. “As I played with the toy train, I was sexually assaulted … As a seven-year-old, I would say, I would have said he touched my private parts.” The emotional interview – which included Farrow breaking down after watching a 1992 clip of Allen forcefully denying the allegations – came after a wave of denunciations in recent weeks from high-profile actors who have worked with Allen over the years. In a particularly remarkable move, Rebecca Hall and Timothée Chalamet, who star in his new film A Rainy Day in New York, now in post-production, both publicly stated that they regretted their decisions to do the film and would donate their salaries to charity. Greta Gerwig, Mira Sorvino, Ellen Page, Rachel Brosnahan, Natalie Portman, Reese Witherspoon, Shonda Rhimes, Colin Firth and many others have also said they believed Farrow or would not work with Allen in the future, making it increasingly difficult for other celebrities to stand by the director. Keeping quiet isn’t much of an option, either. Silence is interpreted as complicity, and celebrities like Selena Gomez, who also stars in his new film, have faced intense social media pressure to speak up. Danny Deraney, a Los Angeles PR executive who does crisis communications for celebrities, said he would not advise clients to work with Allen at this time: “It’s extremely toxic, and why would you want to surround yourself and your career with potential damaging consequences?” Fans who support the #MeToo movement and the Time’s Up campaign – which grew out of the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse scandal – will reject actors who choose to be in Allen films, said Deraney, adding: “I don’t think your performance will be taken seriously. Everyone will be looking at: why did you do it?” Farrow increased pressure on Allen and the industry in December when she wrote a scathing op-ed discussing the pain of hearing women in Hollywood dismiss her. In this week’s interview, she denied the claims that her mother Mia Farrow had coached and brainwashed her to say she was molested. Allen’s statement on Thursday said: “I never molested my daughter – as all investigations concluded a quarter of a century ago.” Some have speculated that A Rainy Day in New York could be Allen’s last film, and it it remains uncertain whether the film will be released at all. Silverstein predicted it could be increasingly difficult for Allen to secure funding and talent at every step of the process: “As this movement continues to grow, because it’s not going away, it becomes more and more problematic to be in business with him.” The film-maker Jen McGowan said she hoped that as more men are held accountable for misconduct, the shift will help lead to greater gender parity and opportunities for women in the film industry. “We have a culture of exclusivity, which creates a culture of abuse. Then we elevate people who are abusive,” she said. “It doesn’t help anyone in the world when we are only telling stories from one perspective.” Diehard fans, however, said they would not stop supporting Allen. Cody Stanford, a 54-year-old Kansas man, said he had made friends with other fans through Facebook pages dedicated to Allen, and noted that many are upset about the recent criticisms from former stars. “There’s a lot of irritation, a lot of people saying: ‘Why are you doing this now?’ People are simply jumping on the bandwagon.” Micheline Bahini, an aspiring film-maker, said she was considering boycotting actors who have condemned Allen and that she would never stop embracing his work: “My reason is fully selfish … I want to see the next Woody Allen movie.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/bike-blog/2018/jan/19/regents-park-cycle-route-plans-at-risk-of-being-cut-back","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T11:38:08Z","webTitle":"Regent's Park cycle route plans at risk of being cut back","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2018/jan/19/regents-park-cycle-route-plans-at-risk-of-being-cut-back","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/bike-blog/2018/jan/19/regents-park-cycle-route-plans-at-risk-of-being-cut-back","fields":{"headline":"Regent's Park cycle route plans at risk of being cut back","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Plans to close the outer circle of Regent’s Park to rat-running motor traffic are being “significantly watered down” to shutting just two gates – down from four – and to shorter periods, in only the morning and evening peak, it has been revealed. Although still in discussion, plans for the road, which will form part of cycle superhighway 11 (CS11), have reportedly been under pressure from Westminster city council since they gained 60% approval in a public consultation in August 2016. Those close to discussions say weakened changes are now being blocked by the body that runs the park’s roads on the grounds they could be more dangerous than the status quo. London’s former cycling commissioner, Andrew Gilligan, has declared CS11 dead under the two gate scenario, saying “The closure of the gates, and the removal of rat-running in the park, is the only thing which makes CS11 a meaningful route. But a nimby minority is vocally opposed to losing their rat-run.” Westminster city council has been accused by the Crown Estates Paving commission (CEPC), which manages the park’s roads, of voicing opposition to the gate closures “at the last minute”, after years of talks with more than a dozen stakeholders. Gilligan says what is now on the table is closure of the North Gate and Park Square West, in the north-west and south-west of the park, respectively. The east side of the outer circle would still be open to rat-running motor traffic. Gilligan says: “The hours of closure would be 7am to 9.30am and 4pm to 7pm, on Mondays to Fridays only; there would no longer be any closures of any gate at the weekends.” He adds there is also a new proposal to make Hanover Gate in the north-west corner entry-only during the rush hours. A senior City Hall official told the Guardian the outer circle has almost three times as many collision injuries per kilometre than the central London average, with drivers recorded doing in excess of 80mph in its 30mph zone. Proposals to close four gates to the outer circle except between 11am and 3pm were intended to cut rat-running traffic. The two-gate proposal is reportedly designed to appease Westminster, but the CEPC says it will not support amended plans, which it says could be “more risky” for cyclists – a position Gilligan echoes. At present, the gates are open from 7am to midnight. Max Jack, director of CEPC, which is also responsible for opening and closing park gates every day says Westminster city council “don’t want cycle proposals, they are not keen on cycle routes, and they aren’t very keen on gate closures”. He said: “Westminster have a way of never being quite clear, you don’t know what they are supporting until the last minute. It was only when the consultation results came back that it became clear there was opposition about traffic displacement [on to Westminster’s roads] and that’s really what’s created the issue.” CS11, due to run from Swiss Cottage to the West End, was proposed and consulted on under the former mayor, Boris Johnson, and Gilligan, his cycling commissioner, in 2016, but work on the route has not started. The London Cycling Campaign’s Simon Munk says the reduced gate closure times will not tackle the problem of the afternoon school run, one of the major contributors to park traffic. “Long term, through motor traffic has no business in any park, particularly this one,” says Munk. “It shouldn’t be acceptable that massive volumes of motor traffic, saving a minute or two on people’s journeys, are cutting through the park.” “Every day, let alone every week and month that goes by, we risk further collisions.” The two-gate closure plan has not been made public, and will reportedly not be consulted on again. CEPC, which is unrelated to the Crown Estate, says they “certainly won’t reduce the through traffic in the park very significantly”. A senior City Hall source told the Guardian the discussions have delayed work on the CS11 route north of the park, as funnelling large numbers of cyclists on to the outer circle in its current state is considered a safety risk. Jack says the CEPC does not want the scheme to fail, after “hundreds of hours” negotiating plans with stakeholders. “We were happy to support those [previously consulted] ideas because they had a strong chance of improving the park,” he said. “It’s a recreational space, you want to be safe cycling in a park. Whatever proposals happen, we take a park view: are they going to work for the park, are they going to improve the environment for all park users? That’s our frame of reference.” Gilligan lays the blame at London mayor Sadiq Khan’s feet, saying Westminster was the “most lukewarm” main stakeholder during his discussions on CS11, but “if the mayor does really want something, and is prepared to press for it, you can overcome stakeholder opposition”. The Royal Parks and Camden city council both say they support current proposals. A spokesperson for Khan said: “Despite the positive consultation results there has to be agreement from all responsible authorities for the plans to be progressed, and we continue to work with all stakeholders to take these plans forward.” A Westminster spokesperson said: “Westminster city council is one of a number of organisations consulted on this scheme and is not the decision making authority. The council was not supportive of the original proposal for the Regent’s Park gate closure.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/21/search-area-willing-host-highly-radioactive-waste-uk-geology","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T15:52:15Z","webTitle":"Search restarts for area willing to host highly radioactive UK waste","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/21/search-area-willing-host-highly-radioactive-waste-uk-geology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/21/search-area-willing-host-highly-radioactive-waste-uk-geology","fields":{"headline":"Search restarts for area willing to host highly radioactive UK waste","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The government is expected this week to begin a nationwide search for a community willing to host an underground nuclear waste dump to store highly radioactive material for thousands of years. Britain has been trying for years to secure a site with the right geology and local communities which would volunteer to host a £12bn geological disposal facility (GDF), as a long-term solution for the most dangerous waste from nuclear power stations. The last effort hit a brick wall in 2013 when Cumbria county council, the only local authority still in the running as a host for the dump, rejected it. Now, ministers are to relaunch their mission to win over a community to host the GDF. The task has taken on heightened importance now that a nuclear power plant is under construction in Somerset, with plans to build four others. Radioactive Waste Management, the government body tasked with building the facility hundreds of metres underground, said it had made significant progress since 2014 in “developing the offer” to interested communities. The energy minister Richard Harrington has said construction of the GDF would create 1,000 jobs and running it would create 600 more. Consultations on the planning process and how the government will work with communities will be launched this week, said two sources close to the process. “I hope to God they get it right this time,” said one. “The mess they made in the past can’t be repeated. It’s outrageous it became a victim of local politics last time.” In January 2013, Cumbria council’s cabinet voted against preliminary work starting on the facility, with the Conservative council leader citing concerns about the local geology. The decision came five months before local elections. After the failures of 2013, a 2014 white paper set out the government’s new plans, which are still based on gaining the consent of a community. Experts said success in finding a site would hinge on suitable geology and acceptance by the public. Prof Neil Hyatt, who heads the department of materials science and engineering at the University of Sheffield, said: “It’s having the right geology coupled with community acceptance. The geological setting needs to be able to isolate the radioactive waste from the surface for the required timescale, which is hundreds of thousands of years.” A national geological screening report has been undertaken to identify the most favourable parts of the country, but Hyatt said further information was needed. Ann McCall, the geological disposal facility siting and engagement director of Radioactive Waste Management, told a conference in December that building the GDF was “mission critical” to store the UK’s radioactive waste, which the country has “an awful lot of”. She said the agency would soon launch a campaign website to increase awareness and engagement with the public, adding: “It’s not possible to foist a solution on a community.” The facility would be sited in England or Wales, as Scotland prefers a ground-level store. High-level waste, the most radioactive material, would not be moved there for many decades. Nuclear waste is currently stored at about 30 sites, but predominantly at ground level at Sellafield in Cumbria. The project is expected to cost £12bn, spread over a century. The government will bear 55% of the cost, owners of new-build plants such as EDF another 35%, and the final 10% will be covered by a liability fund set aside by previous nuclear operators. The price tag could go up or down depending on how much waste the facility needs to store, said Hyatt. “There is a lot of uncertainty around costs.” Other nuclear countries, such as Finland, have already started building underground stores. One senior industry figure said: “Lots of other countries would just get on and do this. They’ve got to do something. They can’t keep ducking this.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/feb/01/lies-we-tell-how-a-bradford-double-glazing-salesman-got-harvey-keitel-to-star-in-his-debut-film","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-01T16:00:04Z","webTitle":"Lies We Tell: how a Bradford double-glazing salesman got Harvey Keitel and Gabriel Byrne to star in his debut film","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/01/lies-we-tell-how-a-bradford-double-glazing-salesman-got-harvey-keitel-to-star-in-his-debut-film","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/feb/01/lies-we-tell-how-a-bradford-double-glazing-salesman-got-harvey-keitel-to-star-in-his-debut-film","fields":{"headline":"Lies We Tell: how a Bradford double-glazing salesman got Harvey Keitel and Gabriel Byrne to star in his debut film","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"‘You see that dormer window up there?” says Mitu Misra as we stand in an alley behind some shops in Bradford. “When I was a lad I used to climb out of that window late at night.” After he had climbed out of the second-floor window, little Mitu would shin down a drainpipe, jump on to a toilet roof and then hit the ground running to the nearby cinema. “At school, I was beaten up regularly and called ‘Paki’. Growing up, most of my friends were Pakistani immigrants. We were all quite poor. Cinema, be it Bollywood or Hollywood, was my way out.” Half a century on from those night-time flits out of his bedroom window, the 58-year-old millionaire businessman has used the money he made from his double-glazing empire to bankroll his movie-making debut. In 2013, Misra floated Safestyle UK, the company he had built up from nothing into a business with an annual turnover of £100m. That money helped to fund Lies We Tell, a film written and directed by Misra and starring an impressive cast of actors, including Gabriel Byrne, Harvey Keitel, Gina McKee and Mark Addy. Misra’s PR people are billing it as a “northern noir” in the vein of Mike Hodges’ Get Carter and Mike Figgis’s Stormy Monday. It is also a British-Asian culture-clash drama in the tradition of Ken Loach’s Ae Fond Kiss ..., Hanif Kureishi’s My Son the Fanatic or Ayub Khan-Din’s East is East, but with the twist that, for once, it is a Muslim woman’s story that is front and centre. How on earth did, with all due respect, a pair of cinematic nobodies manage to get such talent on board? Misra and the film’s producer, Andy McDermott, laugh at the question. “We come from a business mindset where if you don’t ask, you don’t get,” says McDermott. “We asked and, being Yorkshiremen, weren’t put off when people said no. We just kept asking. And then people started saying yes.” Their biggest coup was securing Byrne, star of The Usual Suspects and Miller’s Crossing, to play a leading role. But why would a Golden Globe-winning actor agree to appear in a film made by a double-glazing tycoon with no film-making experience? “We contacted his agent and sent the script, and we got a meeting,” says Misra. Byrne invited Misra and McDermott to meet him at a pub in Howth, near Dublin. “That was a tough meeting,” laughs Misra. “He went through the script with a fine-tooth comb, getting me to explain each character’s motivation until he was satisfied the story held up and we knew what we were doing. And then he agreed to be in the film.” But Misra didn’t know what he was doing. Not really. “That became clear on the the first day of the shoot,” he says, laughing. “You see, I’d done screenwriting courses in London when I was 45, but nothing about how to actually make a film. “So, on that first day, somebody was waving something in front of me. I said: ‘What’s that?’ It turned out it was a boom. You know, the big mic? Gabriel heard and I got summoned to his trailer. When I got there, he had his shirt off and was marching up and down. He said: ‘Have you never been on a set before?’ I said no. He said: ‘Why the fuck didn’t you do a course?’ ‘Arrogance,’ I said. That made him laugh. I think that’s why he didn’t quit.” Another reason Byrne stayed, presumably, is that by the time shooting began on Lies We Tell two years ago, Misra had surrounded himself with accomplished movie professionals, not least his director of photography, Santosh Sivan. The Indian cinematographer makes Bradford look unprecedentedly glamorous in Misra’s film. For those who know the city from dowdy-looking British films such as Billy Liar or Rita, Sue and Bob Too, Sivan’s Bradford will be a sumptuous revelation. Once Byrne agreed to be in the film, Misra and McDermott used his name as leverage to get other stars. McDermott says: “We would go to casting agents’ offices in Hollywood and they would say: ‘For your film, you can have actors off this shelf, but not the top shelf.’ And I’d ask why, and they’d say: ‘Because you haven’t made a film before.” McDermott started his career writing radio scripts and later worked as copywriter for Misra’s company. “But through sheer persistence we got actors from that top shelf.” One of them was Keitel. The actor, who has worked with Scorsese, Tarantino and Ridley Scott and now appears in an insurance ad on TV, met his match in Misra. “Harvey’s a passionate guy, I get that,” says Misra, over tea in the movie room of his sprawling home on Bradford’s outskirts. “But when we met Harvey to talk through the part we wanted him to play, Demi [a billionaire boss who dies, leaving a compromising video of him cavorting with his mistress], he wanted to change it. So I lost my temper.” What happened? “I said to him: ‘I know you’re from Brooklyn or the Bronx or wherever, but I’m from Bradford, understand?’ What he wanted was unacceptable.” In the script, Keitel’s character was supposed to be disporting himself half-naked on a sofa while his mistress, Amber, performed a sexy dance. The 78-year-old had other ideas. “At the meeting Harvey started doing this dance, shaking his chest saying: ‘You want some of this right?’ But I didn’t. So we had a huge argument. At one point I said to him: ‘I’m not going to let you fuck up my film!’ I thought he was going to walk. But he didn’t. After we sorted out our differences, he came right up to me and said: ‘Me and you are friends. We’ve earned it.’” After Misra tells me this story, his daughter Aarti shows me photos on her phone of Keitel chilling in Bradford. In one, he is helping the Misra family prepare dinner in the kitchen. In another, he is on his hands and knees in the hall romping with their family dog, Meg. “He’s the sweetest man you can imagine,” Aarti says. For all the famous names Misra wooed for his project, though, it is a relative unknown who steals the film. Sibylla Deen, an Australian actor who appeared in the soap Home and Away, plays the film’s heroine, Amber. “Amber’s typical of a lot of young Muslim women in that she has to have about seven identities to survive,” Misra tells me. “One for the home, one for work, one for her lovers, and so on.” When we first meet Amber, her billionaire lover Demi (Keitel) has died and his driver Donald (Byrne) has one last task – to destroy any evidence of Demi’s relationship with his mistress, notably that compromising video of her with her non-Muslim lover. But in trying to do so, Donald gets dragged into her world. Amber’s backstory, as imagined by Misra, is that she was sent to Pakistan at 16 to marry her cousin, KD (an oleaginous villain superbly realised by British actor Jan Uddin), before returning to Bradford where she realised her new husband was a local gangster. He raped Amber, prompting her to get a divorce. To play Amber convincingly, Deen learned a Yorkshire accent with a voice coach, spent a day with Bradford West MP Naz Shah, and hung out with local families. “She found that very upsetting, meeting girls who were happy to imagine themselves having arranged marriages yet having no career,” recalls McDermott. “The narrowness of their lives shocked her – and it would, given she divides her time between Los Angeles and Sydney.” McDermott and Misra now want to make more films. Misra has written three more scripts. One, Mona Lisa, is about a road trip across India, another is a Coen-Brothers-esque caper called Johnny Fuckall and another is intriguingly entitled Why Hasn’t Gandhi Died Yet?. “That’s a remark made by Winston Churchill when Gandhi was on hunger strike against British rule. “I’d love to make that,” says Misra. “Everyone thinks Churchill was a hero. He was a racist and that needs to be shown.” How do Misra and McDermott think Lies We Tell will be received? “I don’t expect it to be taken seriously because I’m a first-timer,” says Misra. He is pleased, though, that the film has survived its first ordeal – its Bradford premiere. “I thought I’d get lambasted because I’m a Hindu.” But he didn’t. “Actually, I’d say 99% of the Muslim women at the screening were supportive. The men, not as much. We even had people coming up to us after the Q&amp;A to say thank you for showing what our lives are like.” • Lies We Tell is released on 2 February"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/19/bayeux-tapestry-a-brag-a-lament-an-embodiment-of-historys-complexity","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T12:01:04Z","webTitle":"Bayeux tapestry: a brag, a lament, an embodiment of history's complexity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/19/bayeux-tapestry-a-brag-a-lament-an-embodiment-of-historys-complexity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/19/bayeux-tapestry-a-brag-a-lament-an-embodiment-of-historys-complexity","fields":{"headline":"Bayeux tapestry: a brag, a lament, an embodiment of history's complexity","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It is a miracle of cooperation across borders that brings two peoples, two cultures together and reveals they are the same, after all. I’m not talking about the news this week that France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has given the go-ahead for the Bayeux tapestry to visit Britain. I am describing the tapestry itself. Perhaps it is coming to something when we have to turn to the early middle ages for lessons in humanity, compassion and how to be Europeans. The Bayeux tapestry was created in a world of bullying knights, near-universal illiteracy and tiny life expectancies, a remote time when a comet passing in the sky was a sign from God. In 1066 – as every British child is taught – the Normans, a hardy people who had been Vikings before they settled in northern France, invaded England. Their leader, Duke William, seized the crown after killing his Anglo-Saxon rival, Harold Godwinson, at the Battle of Hastings. Very soon after that fatal battle, a more than 70 metre-long comic strip was created that told the story of the Norman invasion in bold, bright, embroidered woollen images revealing one unexpectedly subtle detail after another to create a moving picture (in every sense) of what war is really like. All great historical events are complex. Modern historians can tell you that and historical novels like War and Peace or Wolf Hall set out to capture it. The Bayeux tapestry shows it. The incredible, mysterious thing about this apparently primitive work made by anonymous craftspeople so long ago is that it shows the truth from multiple points of view, with respect for the losers as well as winners of the most decisive battle in British history. “It’s a fantastic example of the making of history,” says Simon Schama. The writer, broadcaster and Columbia professor who has done so much to put narrative at the heart of today’s historical thinking and teaching is awed by the storytelling skills of the anonymous embroiderers who filled this panorama with lovely living detail. “My favourite bit is where the embroiderers abolish the borders at the point where the armada sails so you have this extension in space, creating the sense of an infinite flotilla. There’s also a couple having it off. And there are these peasants in the border pulling the hauberks [chain-mail armour] off the dead.” It all starts with a holiday gone wrong. Perhaps the trip the Anglo-Saxon noble Harold takes to Normandy in the early scenes of the tapestry is more business than pleasure, but whatever his plans, they are wrecked. He ends up a “guest” of Duke William, who gets him to swear an oath of loyalty. Harold has to stand placing his hands on two ornate reliquary caskets. William sits on his throne, already the image of a king. He points to the relics in an acutely cinematic, psychologically truthful image of smouldering power. Already the question hits you – whose side are the artists on? For this is no simple propaganda image. Harold is portrayed just as sensitively as William. This is a moment of strange intimacy. If anything, we’re on Harold’s side. Schama, like most historians, believes the tapestry was commissioned by Odo, bishop of Bayeux and half-brother to William. After the Norman victory at Hastings, Odo was made Earl of Kent, giving him access to “Europe’s greatest embroiderers – men and women”. The style of Kent’s craftspeople has been detected in the bright wool of the frieze. Chances are it is their work and, in its most subversive moments, their vision. For ambivalence runs like a subtle thread right through this richly told story. If it only showed the Normans building castles when they landed in England, that would be impressive propaganda. Yet it also shows them burning a house – not such a good look. The Anglo-Saxons meanwhile are portrayed fighting bravely and well. Harold’s death in battle is given tragic pathos. “Really the two armies are indistinguishable,” says Schama. He thinks this even-handed quality underlines “the sense the embroiderers are bound to be English”. This is where the tapestry becomes not just an image of history but an embodiment of its living complexity. It is both a Norman brag and a Saxon lament. Perhaps we are looking at it with the wrong eyes if we ascribe a fixed point of view – for or against the conquest – to anyone involved in its creation. This is a wise, broadminded, tolerant work of art that sees no need to insult the weak or make gods of the strong. “It’s so much about Englishness or Britishness and at the same time how that is rooted in Norman-ness,” marvels Schama. At a time when our relationship with Europe is being remade – or just plain broken – here is a document of how interwoven that relationship really is. The story behind what happened this week and how Macron came to make such a daring cultural gesture also has an intricate weave. It is not purely a French initiative but started in the British Museum, which is probably where the tapestry will be shown in 2022 so long as scientific tests confirm it can travel. Under its current director, Hartwig Fischer, as well as his predecessor, Neil MacGregor, this museum has developed an ideal of “cultural diplomacy”, the use of museums and their treasures to open doors between nations and cultures, that has seen it send works to China and loan the Cyrus Cylinder, an ancient Persian treasure, to Iran. Now it is doing cultural diplomacy on Brexit Britain itself by bringing our European story home to us. In 2013 Michael Lewis, the British museum’s deputy head of Britain, Europe and pre-history, who also happens to be an authority on the Bayeux tapestry, joined a committee to help plan a new gallery in Bayeux for the town’s most precious treasure. As he sat on this committee he got an idea. What would happen to the tapestry while its space was being rebuilt? “It occurred to me that they will need to take it off display,” Lewis says. He began talking to his colleagues in Bayeux about the possibility of lending it to Britain. These talks developed until they were taken to civil service levels. Then suddenly the French president stepped in. So it’s all his idea, not Macron’s? “I suppose it is really,” he says. But of course Macron deserves the credit, he insists. The president saw its potential, cut through red tape (of which France has plenty) and has used his authority to make a medieval dream come true. Fischer agrees. For the British museum’s director, Macron is a visionary. “He’s extemely aware of what constitutes Europe through history. What are the ideas that have shaped Europe? What is the shared heritage? If you read his speech in Athens last year, he seems to be aware of the role culture plays”. Macron gave that speech on the ancient Pnyx hill and delivered part of it in Greek. Fischer does not, however, see any analogy between the tapestry and the Parthenon marbles, the treasure of the British Museum whose return Greece has so long demanded. Britain does not claim to own the Bayeux tapestry, after all – he points out. Is he sure? After speaking to him I see this headline: “The Bayeux tapestry’s English. If the French want it back they’ll have to invade!” It seems a bit premature, before we’ve even got our hands it. Yet any attempt to twist the tapestry into petty patriotism looks desperate and doomed. This medieval masterpiece is, says Fischer, “about conquest, it’s about exchange. It makes you aware of how national borders come out of a long, long process. If you asked people in the 11th century what their country was, the answer would be very different.” So there you have it – the Bayeux tapestry is coming to Britain in a remainer plot hatched at the ultra-liberal British Museum. The year 1066 is where British history starts in a lot of our minds. It’s where the line of monarchs down to today begins. It’s a date we can all latch on to. Thinking about it means thinking about who the British are. If you look at the tapestry with both eyes open the answers to that can easily be seen. It’s true we are an island. The Normans come across in a great fleet of Viking ships. Yet to look at those embroidered ships with their multicoloured sails is to see the richness of the new, the foreign, the different. The Bayeux tapestry is a mix of threads, a carnival of colours. The true flag of Europe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/little-library-cafe/2018/jan/19/novel-recipes-italian-chocolate-cake-from-call-me-by-your-name","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T08:27:37Z","webTitle":"Novel recipes: Italian chocolate cake from Call Me By Your Name","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/little-library-cafe/2018/jan/19/novel-recipes-italian-chocolate-cake-from-call-me-by-your-name","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/little-library-cafe/2018/jan/19/novel-recipes-italian-chocolate-cake-from-call-me-by-your-name","fields":{"headline":"Novel recipes: Italian chocolate cake from Call Me By Your Name","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When I looked at my dessert plate and saw the chocolate cake speckled with raspberry juice, it seemed to me that someone was pouring more and more red sauce than usual... Call Me By Your Name, André Aciman --- If we’ve had a conversation in the past couple of months, there’s a good chance I’ve told you to read Call Me By Your Name. I read it in November in a single sitting, jumping up every now and then to attend to a conveyer belt of cakes going into and out of the oven. I emerged from the book somewhere near 4am, as I placed the final cake onto a cooling rack. A love story set on the Italian Riviera in the 1980s, it is so evocative, of Italy and summertime. Reading it made me want to be a better, bolder, and braver person. It’s rare to walk away from a book feeling genuinely changed, but I was by this one. The book captures, so beautifully, the stultifying, soporific nature of summer; the listlessness; the days spent lying languid by a pool with books, with the bursts of energy in the late afternoon, suddenly desperate for something to do. I have recently returned to summer - my first Australian one in nearly 10 years. The heat has been sitting heavily on us this week, easing only once the sun starts to sink from the sky. And I’ve spent it struck by the similarities between my mum’s garden and Elio’s: I loved the afternoons best: the scent of rosemary, the heat, the birds, the cicadas, the sway of palm fronds, the silence that fell like a light linen shawl on an appalling sunny day... My mum’s house has a rosemary tree in the front garden, which has had nearly two decades to send its roots deep. She gives great handfuls of it to people who drop by to visit, but can never get rid of it fast enough. We use it in as many dishes as possible, and it it is a welcome presence in the cake I make most often: the Winnie-the-Pooh inspired cakes that are in my book. In summer, I generally have to be persuaded to eat dessert - rejecting anything heavier than a scoop of gelato (or a single, ripe peach). But this cake is special: while it is undeniably rich, it is also not cloying or heavy. With a sharp fruit – the raspberries suggested in the book are perfect – it is more than appropriate for a balmy afternoon. And if it is currently winter where you are, it would also be lovely with some poached rhubarb or roasted pears. Chocolate, rosemary, and hazelnut cake Serves 10 Ingredients 200g butter 250g dark chocolate (70% is good here) 50ml extra virgin olive oil 250g caster sugar 4 eggs 250g hazelnuts (whole, if you have a spice grinder, or ground) Pinch salt Two 20cm stalks of rosemary Equipment Saucepan and heatproof bowl Mixing bowl Spice grinder (optional) Whisk 23cm springform cake tin Spatula 1. Preheat the oven to 180C (160 fan). Grease and line the tin – thoroughly, as the cake is delicate and will be tricky to get out of the tin if it sticks. Melt the butter in the heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water. Chop the chocolate into small chunks and add to the bowl, stirring until the chocolate has melted. Add the olive oil, stir and set aside. 2. Separate the eggs. Whisk the yolks and sugar together in the mixing bowl until pale. Whisk in the butter, chocolate and oil. 3. Blitz the hazelnuts finely, in batches, adding the leaves from the rosemary to the final batch. If you are using ground hazelnuts, chop the rosemary as finely as you can. Fold the ground hazelnuts and the rosemary into the cake batter. 4. Beat the egg whites to stiff peaks. Fold a third into the cake batter to loosen it, then fold the rest in very gently. Tip into the lined cake tin. 5. Bake for 45 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the cake comes out clean. Leave to cool and settle in the tin for at least 20 minutes. Dust with cocoa and serve warm or at room temperature."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"science/2018/jan/19/georgetown-in-northern-queensland-once-part-of-north-america-geologists","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T07:54:56Z","webTitle":"Georgetown in northern Queensland once part of North America – geologists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jan/19/georgetown-in-northern-queensland-once-part-of-north-america-geologists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/jan/19/georgetown-in-northern-queensland-once-part-of-north-america-geologists","fields":{"headline":"Georgetown in northern Queensland once part of North America – geologists","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Geologists in northern Australia have made a discovery that suggests the area around Georgetown in northern Queensland was once part of North America, more than a billion years ago. Researchers from Curtin University discovered that rocks in the area, 412km west of Cairns, were unlike any other rock deposits in Australia, but similar to those found in Canada. This means that the Georgetown area – with a current population of roughly 250 – was originally a part of North America, and only collided with the rest of the Australian land mass during the formation of the ancient supercontinent Nuna (also known as Columbia) 1.7bn years ago. Nuna predates the supercontinent Pangea by 1.3bn years, and was formed as part of what geologists describe as the supercontinent cycle – where tectonic movements over Earth’s history have repeatedly created and destroyed supercontinents. Pangea, a relatively recent supercontinent, is believed to have formed 335m years ago and began breaking apart 175m years ago. Nuna is believed to have formed 1.7bn years ago, and to have broken apart after 100m years. Based on the Georgetown discovery, researchers now believe that the whole of northern Queensland was a part of North America that collided with Australia when Nuna formed. When the supercontinent drifted apart, it broke off and stuck to Australia. The lead researcher, Adam Nordsvan, said the Georgetown area likely collided with the Mount Isa region of Queensland. “We found that in Mount Isa the rocks were very typically Australian,” he told Guardian Australia. “We can tie them to other parts of Australia. Surprisingly, in Georgetown – about 500km away – we found signatures that were completely unknown to the Australian continent, and are remarkably similar to North America.” He said preliminary data suggested the whole of northern Queensland above Georgetown could have been part of North America at the time. “We are expecting more data this year that will definitely show whether or not they are the same, but it is likely that the whole northern tip of Queensland is North American. That’s one of the implications of the paper.” He said that links between Australia and North America had first been proposed in the late 1970s, and further researched in the early 1990s. In models of other supercontinents, such as Rodinia (formed after the breakup of Nuna), eastern Australia has been connected by geologists to the west of North America. “On the North American side, some great research has come out showing the connection was likely at that time [of Nuna],” Nordsvan said. “In Australia there has been a little bit of research that shows the connection was likely there. This is probably the first piece of really good evidence that at 1.7bn or 1.6bn years ago, there was definitely a connection between the two continents.” The paper was co-authored by researchers from Monash University and the Geological Survey of Queensland, and was published in the journal Geology."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/19/womens-march-washington-whats-next-2018-first-anniversary","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T11:00:21Z","webTitle":"Thousands to return to the streets for anniversary of Women's March","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/19/womens-march-washington-whats-next-2018-first-anniversary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/19/womens-march-washington-whats-next-2018-first-anniversary","fields":{"headline":"Thousands to return to the streets for anniversary of Women's March","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A year ago, more than 1 million people took to the streets in cities around the US wearing pink knit “pussy hats” and waving wry placards, in an extraordinary display of dissent against a newly vested president. Then, after the rousing success of the march, organizers were left with the inevitable question: what next? On Sunday, the first anniversary of the march, the organizers will head to Las Vegas to launch “Power to the Polls”, a national voter registration and mobilization tour that will target swing states ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. “We started 2017 with perpetual outrage and now we are at the moment when we have perpetual outrage, plus a plan in place for 2018,” Linda Sarsour, a co-chair of the Women’s March, told the Guardian. Meanwhile, women and supporters of the liberal movement around the world will return to the streets this weekend in opposition to Donald Trump. The largest protests are expected in Washington, New York and Los Angeles. Sarsour said reclaiming liberal majorities in the House and Senate is the best – and only – way to stop Trump’s agenda. The Women’s March intends to endorse female and progressive candidates in 2018, and to partner with local organizations to register new voters and increase engagement. “One year ago, we had millions of people marching in the streets of the streets,” she said. “The idea is that we march the same people and their families and their friends to the polls in 2018.” The Las Vegas venue was a deliberate choice. On 8 November 2016, Nevada, a swing state with an increasingly diverse electorate, voted for Hillary Clinton and elected Democrats up and down the ballot, a bright spot during an otherwise devastating night for liberals. It’s poised again to be a battleground state in 2018. This year, Democrats hope to pick up a Senate seat and reclaim the governor’s mansion, energized in part by the state’s substantial Latino population, many of whom have a stake in the changes to the US immigration system. Sustaining the movement Last year, the decentralized movement touched off a flurry of activism. Liberals mobilized against the administration’s travel ban and an attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and ushered in a wave of progressive victories, including electing a Democrat to the Senate in Alabama. Liberal organizations have reported record-breaking outreach from women interested in running for office – or from people eager to help women win office. In October, thousands of women attended a convention in Detroit, attending trainings sessions for candidates and others on coalition building and countering white supremacy. It also paved the way, organizers believe, for the #MeToo moment, a social upswell in which women have come forward to share experiences of sexual assault and harassment. In mobilizing the so-called “resistance”, this sprawling movement has also given rise to new groups, such as March On, which is concentrated on winning back Democratic majorities in Congress this year. “How do we take the spirit of the Women’s March – in its positivity, in its exuberance, its intergenerational nature, in its women-led nature – and how do you aim it at elections in a way that will move the needle politically?” asked Vanessa Wruble, the executive director of March On and an organizer of the 2017 Women’s March on Washington. On Saturday, the group will launch a national poll in an attempt to crowdsource a political platform, and to shape their political strategy in 2018. March On expects to endorse candidates. “Anything we want to achieve within this movement is not going to happen until we have the right people in government,” Wruble said, “so let’s first focus on getting the right people into office.” Gwen Combs, an elementary school teacher in Little Rock, Arkansas, is one of the women hoping to bring a Democratic wave that topples Republicans from their majority in Congress. Combs spent much of the presidential election biting her tongue. Barred from discussing politics in the classroom, the teacher couldn’t answer her students’ questions about what a Trump presidency might mean for an immigrant parent or a minority classmate. After the election, she was demoralized and couldn’t stop thinking about her students. “It moved me. It moved me to want to make a safer world for these kids,” she said. Like hundreds of thousands of other women, Combs stumbled on a Facebook group for a massive march on Washington. She couldn’t afford a flight on short notice, so decided to organize one in Little Rock. After its success, she heard from the parent of a former student. “Marches are great,” the woman told her, “but they’re just one-time events. What we really need is a movement not just a moment.” Combs agreed. She is now running for Arkansas’s second congressional district."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/19/nigel-scullion-no-indigenous-person-tells-me-they-want-australia-day-changed","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T23:13:20Z","webTitle":"Nigel Scullion: No Indigenous person tells me they want Australia Day changed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/19/nigel-scullion-no-indigenous-person-tells-me-they-want-australia-day-changed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/19/nigel-scullion-no-indigenous-person-tells-me-they-want-australia-day-changed","fields":{"headline":"Nigel Scullion: No Indigenous person tells me they want Australia Day changed","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Indigenous Affairs minister, Nigel Scullion, says no Indigenous Australian has told him the date of Australia Day should be changed other than a single government adviser. Speaking on the ABC’s AM program on Friday, Scullion was asked about comments this week from the government adviser Chris Sarra that the date was dividing the nation and ought to be changed. Scullion said Sarra was a good friend but he was the only Indigenous Australian who had said that to him. “I’ve just spent the last week in different communities around Australia, and it never comes up as an issue,” the minister said. “This is one of those things that comes up from time to time [in Australia, but] what people are telling me is that they want their kids to get a good education, what about more opportunities for access to the health system?” The ABC AM radio host Kim Landers sought clarification, asking: “So not a single Indigenous person has ever expressed to you as the Indigenous affairs minister that they want the date changed?” Scullion: “That’s correct, absolutely correct. This is not something that comes up at all. And outside of Chris, I can tell you, there would be no one, as a fact. “So you know, in the bubble around our tea trolleys we might sort of say, ‘Well, I’ve heard,’ and therefore we have a discussion, but no one’s brought that to me. “We have Naidoc Week, we have Sorry Day, we have Reconciliation Week, we have Mabo Day, and if you want to divide the nation this is how we go down that line. “This is a very low priority, certainly on my agenda.” The debate about changing the date of Australia Day has flared up in recent months. In August Yarra city council in Melbourne was stripped of the power to hold citizenship ceremonies by the federal government because councillors voted unanimously to stop referring to 26 January as Australia Day and to stop holding a citizenship ceremony on that day. In September a Guardian Essential poll found 26% of Australians supported changing the date, while 54% opposed changing it. But a few months later, after continued public debate, a poll of 1,417 voters conducted by the Australia Institute found 56% of Australians did not mind when Australia Day was celebrated. Sarra – who was last year appointed co-chairman of the prime minister’s Indigenous Advisory Council – intervened in the debate this week, saying most Indigenous Australians wanted the date changed. “Regrettably I don’t think Australia Day, and what it represents, is a day that most people in the Aboriginal community want to celebrate,” he said. “I say that mindful that you get one or two Aborigines who say what people want to hear, but that’s not a true and accurate reflection of what most of the Aboriginal community thinks.” An Alice Springs town councillor, Jacinta Price, told ABC radio on Friday that she did not think Australia Day needed to be changed because it was a day for all Australians to come together. She said she believed she was speaking on behalf of Indigenous Australians who did not have a voice. “The most marginalised people of this country, you know, a lot of my family are the most marginalised, whose first language is not English, who live in remote communities and town camps around the Northern Territory, and I speak for many of my constituents who voted me in in the last council election on a landslide number of votes,” she said. “Up in the Northern Territory, we want to get on with one another, blackfellas and whitefellas.” Another Indigenous Australian, Carla McGrath, a director of GetUp, said no one thought Australians should not celebrate a national day but there ought to be a date that was more inclusive than 26 January. “The one we have unfortunately holds a really traumatic place for many people as a day of mourning,” she said. “It doesn’t represent a day of unity.” Rod Little, the co-chair of the National Congress of Australia’s First Peoples, said it was possible no one had raised the issue of changing the date with Scullion, because time with the minister was limited and focused on specific issues. But he said that did not mean it wasn’t an issue, and Scullion should have made it his business to find out what Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people thought. “We know that January 26, Australia Day, conversations come up every year and have since 1938,” Little told Guardian Australia. “It’s not new, so you would know that this conversation would come each year, so inform yourself … Go and ask people.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/19/points-based-immigration-racism","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T14:55:53Z","webTitle":"Points-based immigration was meant to reduce racial bias.

It doesn't","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump caused an uproar last week when he labeled Haiti and African countries “shitholes”. This overt racism appalled people across the globe. But without using profanities, some of the world’s most well-regarded admission systems – which have informed Republican proposals here – quietly ensure few people from Haiti, Africa and countries subject to the “Muslim ban” ever immigrate. Following the abolition of admission policies that evaluated applicants on the basis of their race and origin until the 1960s and 1970s, Australia, Canada and some countries in western Europe shifted to points-based systems that prioritized immigrants with desirable skills and regional free movement agreements with their neighbors. Points-based systems – which select immigrants based on their language proficiency, educational credentials, age, work experience and skills, among other criteria – have previously been supported by many Democrats and Republicans, including more recently President Trump. However, while these innovations were designed to reduce racial bias in the ways governments select newcomers, they reproduce this bias in more subtle ways. In 2011, Laura Hill and Joseph Hayes simulated the effect on immigrants’ origins were the United States to adopt the points-based tests considered by Congress as part of proposed comprehensive immigration reforms in 2007. Only 1% of Latin Americans would pass. Meanwhile, the pass rate would be 6% for Europeans and central Asians, 12% for people from east Asia, south Asia, and 14% of Canadians. Without using any simulations, a 2012 study led by economist Tito Boeri found that the population of immigrants admitted on visas for “highly skilled” workers across highly developed countries is heavily skewed toward migrants from other highly developed countries – nearly all of which are predominantly European or Anglo-origin. There is also evidence that points-based systems disadvantage women too. Governments tend to devalue skills typically associated with women such as caregiving, hospitality and those relevant to the service sector. And because of social norms and family dynamics, men are more likely to have longer periods of uninterrupted work experience, higher education credentials, and networking opportunities. This is bias. With regional free movement agreements like those under the European Union and the trans-Tasman agreement between Australia and New Zealand, the mobility given to member state citizens reduces demand for low- and high-skilled labor that might otherwise come from non-white majority countries. Entry data show that many of these countries have relied more and more on free movement migrants to fill labor gaps, rather than recruit immigrants from outside the region. To be clear, these policies do not deny Haitians or Africans entry because they are Haitian or African; indeed, Canada admits a significant number of Caribbeans and Africans. Rather, they set standards that very few Haitians or Africans are likely to meet due to the less developed state of their economies and education systems. They may also reinforce racialized inequalities in the countries of origin, impede the reunification of families, and hurt the development potential of migration. These so-called “merit-based” systems can also assign points for bona fide family relationships and humanitarian need. President Trump and his Republican colleagues simply do not believe that family bonds and human vulnerability have any “merit”. Further questions arise because it is not clear that points-based systems are any better at promoting immigrants’ economic integration than other types of visas. Some observers argue that migrants who enter via points-based systems are more likely to have difficulty finding jobs and building social networks than migrants who enter on family visas or perhaps even humanitarian visas. Family migrants benefit from the immediate embrace offered by spouses, parents, and other relatives, who help them adapt and succeed in their new environment. The arrival of humanitarian migrants is facilitated by refugee resettlement agencies, which provide language classes, job training and cultural orientation. These admissions programs – particularly family reunification, humanitarian migration, and the diversity lottery, which have collectively made up the vast majority of America’s permanent visas recently – are precisely those that have driven the United States’ ethnic diversification since 1965. And they are precisely those which would be cut by the immigration admissions programs that the president and his Republican colleagues are currently proposing. In this light, President Trump’s comments are less significant for the severe prejudice they reveal in his personal worldview. This much we knew. Rather, they are significant in that they help us connect this worldview to the subtleties of immigration policymaking. In the revolutionary changes he and Republicans are proposing to immigrant admissions, they will effectively create a government that favors people from Norway over Haiti under the guise of promoting immigrants’ economic integration. Unlike the president’s Muslim ban, his cuts in refugee admissions, and his assaults on undocumented people and their families – all of which a future White House can swiftly reverse – admissions criteria can last generations. Such policy proposals represent the first shots in a battle to remake the ethnic composition of American society and should be scrutinized very carefully for the promises they make and the motivations they veil.

Now his accuser has shared her story that the actor allegedly masturbated in front of her in 1989. Speaking to the Hollywood Reporter, journalist and author Susan Braudy claims that during her time working for Douglas, when she ran the New York office of his production company, his behavior started with inappropriate sexual conversation. She claims he openly discussed an affair with co-star Kathleen Turner, made lewd remarks about Braudy’s sex life and made so many comments about her body that she started to wear “long, loose layers of black”. But one day in his office, the situation worsened. “I peered at him and saw he’d inserted both hands into his unzipped pants,” Braudy said. “I realized to my horror that he was rubbing his private parts. Within seconds his voice cracked and it appeared to me he’d had an orgasm.” Shocked, she rushed to the door. “I said nothing,” she said. “I was surprised I wasn’t falling to pieces even though I was humiliated. I realized he thought he could do anything he wanted because he was so much more powerful than I was. Michael ran barefoot after me to the elevator, zipping his fly and buckling his belt. ‘Hey, thank you, you’re good. You helped me, thank you, thank you.’” She claims that she told people after the incident, including Fire and Fury author Michael Wolff, who confirmed this via email to the Hollywood Reporter. “We have discussed the incident many, many times since, as well as Douglas’ relentless, goading, mocking and belittling sexual behavior,” he wrote. Soon after Douglas allegedly asked Braudy to sign a confidentiality agreement and was let go later that year. When his lawyer was approached about the story, Douglas made the decision to come forward with a denial before the story was printed. He originally referred to it as “a complete lie”. “Coarse language or overheard private conversations with my friends that may have troubled her are a far cry from harassment,” he said. “Suggesting so does a true disservice to those who have actually endured sexual harassment and intimidation.” Last week he added: “Maybe she is disgruntled her career didn’t go the way she hoped and she is holding this grudge.” In response to his denial, Braudy said: “I believe this is part of the problem, as is his pretext of victimization. These are some reasons why so many women don’t come forward with their stories – Lord knows it’s taken 30 years and a movement for me to gather my courage.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/24/tennis-quiz-players-australian-open-identify","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T10:24:19Z","webTitle":"Tennis quiz: Can you identify the players at the Australian Open?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/24/tennis-quiz-players-australian-open-identify","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/24/tennis-quiz-players-australian-open-identify","fields":{"headline":"Tennis quiz: Can you identify the players at the Australian Open?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/19/stoke-city-huddersfield-town-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T17:16:20Z","webTitle":"Stoke City v Huddersfield Town: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/19/stoke-city-huddersfield-town-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/19/stoke-city-huddersfield-town-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Stoke City v Huddersfield Town: match preview","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Stoke City need the fabled new manager bounce as they fight to remain in the top flight for a 10th successive season.

The live sport doesn’t end there, inevitably – there’s football to follow right now, right here. Bye! Radwanska has advantage but then double faults to surrender it, and Hiseh takes the next two points to win it 6-2, 7-5! She’ll play Angelique Kerber in round four. At 30-30, the keyest of key points, both players try to play hard but safe. A long rally ends with Radwanska hitting into the net to set up match point, but then a strong first serve saves it. From 30-0 it’s now 30-0, Hsieh hitting two clean winners, the latest a lob that left Radwanska stranded at the net. The live blog is winding down, but I’ll hang on until the end of the second set on the Margaret Court Arena. Hsieh won the first set 6-2, and leads 6-5 in the second, with Radwanska serving to stay in the match but with the wind behind her. Over on the Margaret Court Arena, Radwanska has fought her way back into the second set, and she’s currently serving to make it 4-4. Federer plays Marton Fucsovics in the fourth round. The 25-year-old’s Hungarian’s current ranking of 80 is the best of his career. He and Federer have never played. Roger Federer speaks! What was the difference between us? My head’s still spinning from the match point when I got so lucky. I was able to stay a bit more on the offensive than maybe he was, and maybe protecting my own serve a little bit better than him. The match was close. You focus to the very end. It’s a terrible answer. Expectations are different this year. I’m coming in this year very fit, very well equipped, knowing that five sets are not an issue. The Berdych match [in the third round last year] was really key to showing myself that I can play a great match and maybe I can do it again and again. I don’t know if that’s how it’s going to happen this year, but so far so good. Third set: Federer 6-2, 7-5, 6-4 Gasquet* (*denotes server) With successive shots Federer gradually pushes his opponent wider and wider, eventually forcing an error. 0-15. Then they trade backhands for a while before Federer eventually runs round one, goes down the line and comes to the net for an easy winning volley. 0-30. But an unforced error lets Gasquet into the game, and an excellent forehand winner brings him level. When he wins the next point as well Gasquet recycles the ball, and inevitably loses the next one. A brilliant backhand and a smashed winner gives Federer break and match point; again they trade backhands, again Federer eventually runs round one, but in so doing he opens up the whole court and by failing to hit a winner presents Gasquet with an easy chance to win it himself. It is a temporary reprieve: a backhand down the line brings up a second match point, and Federer takes that one! Third set: Federer* 6-2, 7-5, 5-4 Gasquet (*denotes server) Federer holds to love in the blink of an eye (the game took almost exactly one minute). Gasquet will serve to stay in the match. Third set: Federer 6-2, 7-5, 4-4 Gasquet* (*denotes server) Gasquet has got into the habit of reusing balls that he’s just hit winners with. It doesn’t seem to work very well – he goes 15-0 up, and then back to 15-15; 30-15 up, and back to 30-30. Then Federer hits another unforced forehand error, and Gasquet wins the game with an unreturnable first serve. Back to level pegging in this set, to Gasquet’s great credit. Third set: Federer* 6-2, 7-5, 4-3 Gasquet (*denotes server) The game starts with a ludicrously wide first serve; the ball disappears off screen where something happens to make the crowd “ooh” and “aaah” for a while. I can only guess what happened out there, and I’m going with a juggling possum. Gasquet focuses here on Federer’s forehand, with varying results: three winners, a couple unforced errors. He scraps his way to deuce, and to advantage – his first break point of the day. He can’t convert, but a wildly mishit Federer backhand later he has another – and this he wins! Meanwhile, drama on Margaret Court, where the umpire overruled and Radwanska got quite upset about it. As they talked the umpire revealed he didn’t remember what had actually happened, and somehow it seems his overrule was undone, and they ended up replaying the point. Radwanska still lost the game though, and is 0-2 down in the second set, having also had a medical time out. Third set: Federer 6-2, 7-5, 4-2 Gasquet* (*denotes server) Gasquet hits a fine crosscourt passing shot but still somehow loses the point, Federer lunging to get the ball over the net, and Gasquet racing forward to reach it but hitting wide. But from 0-15 he holds to 15, thanks mainly to some excellent serving. Third set: Federer* 6-2, 7-5, 4-1 Gasquet (*denotes server) At 30-30 Gasquet is sniffing break point – he hasn’t had one of those yet – but then Federer, who has tended to serve wide on that wing, goes down the line and the return is begging to be put away, and is. A fine forehand return drags the game to deuce, but a phenomenally controlled stretching backhand volley and a forehand winner end the game. Third set: Federer 6-2, 7-5, 3-1 Gasquet* (*denotes server) Federer pounces upon Gasquet’s first serve, immediately taking control of the point and never relaxing his grip. But it goes downhill for him from there, the game featuring as it does a forehand mishit into the crowd, a backhand mishit into the net and a Gasquet ace to conclude. Third set: Federer* 6-2, 7-5, 3-0 Gasquet (*denotes server) A couple of unforced errors from Federer turn 30-0 into 30-30 but a strong service sets up game point, and he then forces Gasquet into a desperate, stretching forehand that loops up, bounces just over the net, and is then slammed into space. Third set: Federer 6-2, 7-5, 2-0 Gasquet* (*denotes server) Oh dear. At 15-30 Gasquet hits his first serve slightly long, challenges the call, fails and promptly double faults. Federer’s drop forehand wins him the first break point. Meanwhile on Margaret Court, Radwanska has been broken for a second time and, in so doing, lost the first set 6-2 to Hsieh. Third set: Federer* 6-2, 7-5, 1-0 Gasquet (*denotes server) Gasquet hits a gorgeous backhand passing shot at 30-0, but that’s as good as it gets for him, the one hiccup in Federer’s hold. Federer hit 57% first serves in that set to Gasquet’s 73%, 10 unforced errors to Gasquet’s 7, and 13 winners to Gasquet’s 14, and won the set. Second set: Federer 6-2, 7-5* Gasquet (*denotes server) Hawk-Eye is back, and Gasquet celebrates with a couple of challenges, which don’t really work out for him. He’s always on the back foot in this game; it’s 0-15, then 15-30, then 30-40 – an excellent backhand passing shot down the line to set up break point – at which point he hits a forehand just long. He challenges that one as well, in desperation rather than genuine belief, and it’s in vain. Second set: Federer* 6-2, 6-5 Gasquet (*denotes server) Federer also takes a 40-0 before losing a point, and then another, at which point Gasquet wildly mishits a forehand return to end the game. Second set: Federer 6-2, 5-5* Gasquet (*denotes server) Gasquet has only lost seven points on his serve in this set. One of them was in this game, a backhand slapped into the net, but he was 40-0 up by then. Second set: Federer* 6-2, 5-4 Gasquet (*denotes server) Federer wins the game to 15, the four points he won requiring four serves (two of them aces), one forehand winner and a volley. Second set: Federer 6-2, 4-4 Gasquet* (*denotes server) If Gasquet’s focus wavered at the end of the previous game there’s no sign of it here, as he motors into a 40-0 lead. A fine Federer forehand and a double fault constitutes a mid-game wobble, but an excellent first serve leads to an easy put-away and it’s 4-4. Second set: Federer* 6-2, 4-3 Gasquet (*denotes server) Federer starts with an ace out wide; Gasquet wants to challenge but is unable to. And at 15-15 another serve out wide, which Gasquet returns but in so doing leaves himself hopelessly out of position. The Frenchman hits a lovely backhand winner from midcourt, but then Federer serves out wide again; it’s called out but the umpire overrules, and again Gasquet wants to challenge but can’t. He’s clearly upset about this, and it’s no surprise when an unforced error then surrenders the game. Second set: Federer 6-2, 3-3 Gasquet* (*denotes server) Before the game begins the umpire explains that Hawk-Eye is down, so there will be no challenges. Federer wins the opening point, almost toying with his opponent as he forces him around the court, left and then right, deep and then forward. From 15-30 though the Frenchman hits an ace and then two fine forehand winners. Second set: Federer* 6-2, 3-2 Gasquet (*denotes server) Federer serves wide to Gasquet’s backhand, then advances to put away a forehand volley into an empty court. Classic serve-and-volley tennis, of the highest standard. He wins the game 40-30, with an excellently-controlled drop-volley from knee height, Gasquet’s perfectly decent attempt at a pass bringing no success whatsoever. Second set: Federer 6-2, 2-2 Gasquet* (*denotes server) Gasquet’s playing pretty well here, really. He’s seizing upon any mistakes and making the most of his opportunities. There just haven’t been many of them. So this article about facial recognition software in tennis was interesting. The scientists “organised the images into seven categories – focused, fired up, elation, dejection, anxious, annoyance, anger – after examining facial movements such as jaw drops, blinking, brow raising or lowering, lip tightening and nose wrinkling. From there they established emotional profiles of the ‘big four’ men’s players, Federer, Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray, at last year’s Australian Open and compared them to the results of each point. For Nadal, big displays of negative emotion after one point was likely to reduce his chances of hitting back and winning the next, while the outwardly cool Federer was 17 per cent more likely to win the following point after showing elation at hitting a winner.” So Federer, to summarise, plays better when he’s playing well. Second set: Federer* 6-2, 2-1 Gasquet (*denotes server) Federer cruelly forces Gasquet deep behind the baseline on his forehand wing and then hits a drop shot to the other side, and the Frenchman’s long-distance (comparatively) sprint ends with an uncontrolled forehand. From 30-0 Gasquet draws level, thanks in part to a double fault, but a timid blocked return allows Federer to set up game point, which he takes in short order. Second set: Federer 6-2, 1-1 Gasquet* (*denotes server) Federer hits a forehand approach that is nowhere near deep enough, and Gasquet slaps a winner down the line, and ends up holding to 15. Next up on the Margaret Court Arena, meanwhile, is Agnieszka Radwanska against Su-Wei Hsieh. Second set: Federer* 6-2, 1-0 Gasquet (*denotes server) The game starts with a long rally, which ends when Gasquet tosses up a weak defensive lob and Federer advances and lashes a power valley into the net from no distance at all. Federer then wins the next three points before serving into Gasquet’s forehand hitting zone; the ball whistles back past his ankles before he’s finished his follow-through. He can’t, however, hold back the tide. Meanwhile Novak Djokovic is in round four, having seen off Albert Ramos-Vinolas in style and comfort, 6-2, 6-3, 6-3. First set: Federer 6-2 Gasquet* (*denotes server) Phwoar! Yum! Federer hits a down-the-line backhand of impeccable grace and beauty, on his way to a 0-40 lead and three set points. Gasquet hits a powder-puff second serve; Federer runs round it and hits a forehand down the same line but just wide. That’s one break point saved, but Gasquet’s serving doesn’t improve from there, and a double fault surrenders the set. First set: Federer* 5-2 Gasquet (*denotes server) At 40-15 Federer comes forward and hits a drop volley; Gasquet runs up, feints to hit it down the line and then clips crosscourt for a stylish winner. No matter, Federer aces to win the game. You’re right, of course, but he’d need a couple of four-legged sidekicks before he’s as exciting as Paw Patrol. First set: Federer 4-2 Gasquet* (*denotes server) Gasquet serves wide; it’s called out, so it doesn’t matter that Federer’s return lands long. But Gasquet challenges, and the ball is shown to have clipped the very edge of the line. 15-0, and Gasquet accelerates from there. First set: Federer* 4-1 Gasquet (*denotes server) Federer runs around his backhand twice to send inside-out forehands crosscourt, and then comes across to hit a deep approach shot to Gasquet’s backhand, only for the Frenchman to whip a perfect crosscourt passing shot to win the point. It’s a spectacular point, but it’s Federer who has the consistency. First set: Federer 3-1 Gasquet* (*denotes server) A lovely rally sets up break point for Federer, the players trading powerful backhands before the Swiss forces his rival to stretch a little too far, but Federer then hits the net a couple of times to give Gasquet a game point. He then significantly overhits a forehand to bring us back to deuce. But an unforced error gives Federer another break point, and a poor second serve allows him to win it with a powerful forehand. First set: Federer* 2-1 Gasquet (*denotes server) The pace of this is pretty wild, compared with the Kerber v Sharapova match. Neither player has lengthy pre-serve preparatory routines, and there haven’t been many rallies of note either. Meanwhile, Djokovic has just broken, and is 2-1 up in the third. First set: Federer 1-1 Gasquet* (*denotes server) And Gasquet does likewise, in double-quick time, rushing from one point to the next and winning all of them. First set: Federer* 1-0 Gasquet (*denotes server) Federer holds to love. Elsewhere, Berdych has completed a 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 win over Del Potro, and Djokovic has taken the second set against Ramos Vinolas; it’s currently 1-1 in the third. Federer and Gasquet, meanwhile, are ready to go. Federer will serve. While we wait for Gasquet v Federer to start, here’s a first-take report on Kerber’s thrashing of Sharapova. Kerber speaks: This court is so special for me, so I came out here and I was trying to enjoy every point and with you guys it’s even more special. I knew before the match it would be a tough one. I was really trying to play my game. I am so happy it is 2018 and not 2017 any more. I’m just trying to enjoy every moment right now. I learned a lot from the last 24 months. I had a great 2016 and last year was a little bit tougher, but everybody who knows me knows I never give up. Second set: Sharapova 1-6, 3-6 Kerber* (*denotes server) Kerber starts with an ace. Sharapova hits wide, and then doesn’t even run after her return lands midcourt, allowing Kerbert to set up three match points. Sharapova sends a down-the-line forehand onto the line to force an error and save one, but then blazes a backhand wildly wide to end it! Second set: Sharapova* 1-6, 3-5 Kerber (*denotes server) Sharapova lands her first serve precisely and perfectly on the line, down the middle. She couldn’t have placed it better had she walked over there and put it where she wanted it to go. Kerber challenges, but to no avail. But Sharapova’s confidence seems so brittle: she immediately double faults, overhits a forehand and then underhits a drop shot. That makes it 15-40, and she then nets an easy shot from mid-court to give up the game and give Kerber a chance to serve for the match. Second set: Sharapova 1-6, 3-4 Kerber* (*denotes server) “Come on!” shouts Sharapova, as her forehand wins the point to make it 30-30. “Come on!” she shouts again, as her backhand return makes it 30-40. The crowd is getting noisier too, buzzing with excitement at the prospect that this might not be the one-sided encounter the first set had suggested. But Kerber doesn’t actually have to win any of the three points she needs to take the game; she just pressures Sharapova, who makes minor misjudgements. Still, this set is in the balance. Second set: Sharapova* 1-6, 3-3 Kerber (*denotes server) Sharapova holds to love! She wins the game with a thunder serve down the middle, and though Kerber just about gets it back she can barely control it, and Sharapova runs forward and slaps the ball across court at an acute angle. Second set: Sharapova 1-6, 2-3 Kerber* (*denotes server) The first challenge of the match comes when Kerber’s forehand is called in, to Sharapova’s surprise – and the player turns out to be right. That’s the only point she gets, though, and Kerber wins the game with an excellent crosscourt backhand, which again is very close to the line but is too good to argue with this time. Second set: Sharapova* 1-6, 2-2 Kerber (*denotes server) This is so frustrating from, and surely for, Sharapova, as she continues to alternate between great and grotty. There were a couple of great winners here, particularly a forehand from wide and sprinting wider, but also a couple of unforced errors. She should have breezed through the game, but still she holds to 30. Meanwhile, Djokovic has come back from the medical timeout apparently unaffected, and has broken to go 3-1 up in the second set. And Berdych has won the second set against Del Potro, also by six games to three. Second set: Sharapova 1-6, 1-2 Kerber* (*denotes server) Hello! Kerber hits long and then, forced way wide by her opponent, does it again to go 0-30 down. Then Sharapova hits a good crosscourt backhand but Kerber could have struck a winner down the line, but hit the net. 0-40. Sharapova then basically wins the next point, forcing Kerber so far back and so far wide there seems no way back. There is, though: the German battles back and forces an error, and wins the next point as well, but then overhits a backhand and Sharapova squeals with relief, still in the match. Second set: Sharapova* 1-6, 0-2 Kerber (*denotes server) Sharapova hits the ball into the top of the net to go 15-30 down – and 14-2 up on unforced errors – and pauses for a moment, struggling with how little reward she’s getting for all the effort, the grit and the power she’s currently showing. Then she double faults, misses her first serve and then hits a 15th unforced error to surrender the game. Second set: Sharapova 1-6, 0-1 Kerber* (*denotes server) Kerber keeps the pedal to the metal, winning the first game of the second set in short order. Meanwhile on Margeret Court Arena Novak Djokovic, 6-2, 2-1 up, has called a medical time out and a physio is attacking his left leg, focusing it seems on the hip. First set: Sharapova* 1-6 Kerber (*denotes server) All of which appears to take something out of Sharapova, who surrenders the first couple of points too easily and is then brutally and brilliantly passed by Kerber, four yards behind the baseline but just too precise and powerful. A netted forehand later, the set is over. First set: Sharapova 1-5 Kerber* (*denotes server) Sharapova comes out all guns blazing, bludgeoning shots at her opponent until she finally forces an error, but then she blazes a return into the net. Two excellent crosscourt forehands win Sharapova another point, and then she blazes a return wide. It’s a tale of hard-fought gains and easily-surrendered losses, and it’s not quite good enough. Eventually Kerber thunders a forehand into an open court to win the game. Here’s some more reading for you. First set: Sharapova* 1-4 Kerber (*denotes server) Phwoar! Kerber goes 30-0 up at the end of a brutal exchange of cross-court power-hitting from both players, which ends when Sharapova moves across to cover a shot down the line, and is wrong-footed when it goes the other way, and she doesn’t release he grip on the game from there. Sharapova eventually surrenders it with an overhit backhand. First set: Sharapova 1-3 Kerber* (*denotes server) Kerber wins the first three points in double-quick time but then has to fight for a fourth, ending the longest point of the match so far by reaching an imperfect drop shot and touching the ball down the line. Meanwhile on the Margaret Court Arena, Djokovic started slowly but improved, and how: from 2-2 and struggling to hold serve, he won the first set 6-2. First set: Sharapova* 1-2 Kerber (*denotes server) This is better. At 15-15 Sharapova plays by some distance her finest point of the match so far, shifting Kerber around the court before finally putting the ball out of reach. Then, an unforced error later, there’s a fine forehand down the line that bounces out of Kerber’s reach to take her to game point. She doesn’t win it, but then Kerber, in a point-winning position, hits a power volley long and she’s got another. She then develops a deep affinity for the net, hitting the ball into it twice, serving into it, and saving the break point by clipping the top of it and getting a lucky bounce. Finally, two excellent serves and a forehand of magnificent length later, she’s on the board. Here’s Kevin Mitchell’s report on Ashleigh Barty’s defeat to Naomi Osaka: First set: Sharapova 0-2 Kerber* (*denotes server) Kerber is playing a different sport here: harder, faster, more aggressive, better. She streaks to a 40-0 lead but then misses a first serve and Sharapova reminds her that she’s there by, given a weak second serve to hit, pounding a forehand return down the line for a winner. It doesn’t help her much. First set: Sharapova* 0-1 Kerber (*denotes server) In the blink of an eye Sharapova is 0-30 down, and though she hangs in the next point a little longer she loses it to, hitting up a desperate, lunging defensive shot from the back of the court that Kerber smashes; it goes too close to her opponent but Sharapova can’t get the ball in play. Then at 0-40 Kerber’s return is perfect, landing practically on Sharapova’s toes and she can’t control her reply. Del Potro saves a couple of break points and is on the board, 1-2 in the second set. Djokovic saves a couple of break points and is still fighting, 2-2 in the first set. And Sharapova is about to serve on the Rod Laver Arena. Kerber and Sharapova are on court and warming up! Ramos-Vinolas makes it 2-2, holding to love with the help of two gorgeous drop shots. Berdych has broken Del Potro in the first game of the second set. Djokovic ended up saving a break point on his own serve, and he would have lost it had Ramos-Vinolas hit a passing shot down the line rather than going crosscourt, with his opponent poorly position at the net. Instead he won that point, won the next with an excellent crosscourt backhand that landed on the back edge of two lines, and then hit an ace down the middle to finish the game. Berdych has wrapped up the first set against Del Potro, six games to three. Not so fast, Novak: Ramos-Vinolas won the next four points, and eventually held. There’s been a short delay because of the earlier session over-running. Shouldn’t be long now. The Djokovic match is under way, and having held in the opening game he is now 0-40 up in the second. On the Hisense Arena, Berdych has taken a 5-2 first-set lead over Del Potro. The players are out on the Margaret Court Arena, where Djokovic v Ramos-Vinolas should be under way imminently. Sharapova has reached four singles finals here and won one, precisely a decade ago. Angelique Kerber has played one final, and won it. They have played seven times, Kerber winning the last two but behind 4-3 overall. Though I do like the idea of a banana replacing the calorie as the main measure of energy. It would be a lot easier for people to relate to. Here’s my stat of the day. Halep and Davis spent three hours and 44 minutes thrashing the ball around the RLA for the honour of a place in the fourth round. Apparently Halep expended 18 bananas of energy in winning the match. I’d have thought that four hours of top-class tennis would be more than 18 bananas’ worth. Though I guess that’s 0.375 bananas, or a little over a third of a banana, per game. Still, I’d have guessed at about 30 bananas. And probably a few grapes as well. Morning/evening/whenever-it-is-where-you-are world! Everything is a little out of kilter in Melbourne because of the Halep-Davis epic a little earlier, which will slightly delay the night session on the Rod Laver Arena. First up, though, we’ll have Angelique Kerber against Maria Sharapova on the RLA, while Novak Djokovic v Albert Ramos-Vinolas on the Margaret Court Arena. Meanwhile, Tomas Berdych and Juan Martin del Potro are three games in on the Hisense Arena, and going with serve. Simon will be here shortly. Until then, re-live all of Friday’s action:"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/19/jenny-joseph-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T17:50:35Z","webTitle":"Jenny Joseph obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/19/jenny-joseph-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/19/jenny-joseph-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Jenny Joseph obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The poet Jenny Joseph, who has died aged 85, might well have wondered a little ruefully whether WH Auden was altogether correct in maintaining that “poetry makes nothing happen”. Her famous Warning (“When I am an old woman I shall wear purple/ With a red hat which doesn’t go, and doesn’t suit me ... ”) was written when she was 28, and after its appearance in an early book went almost unnoticed for 25 years. Then, because of its contention that growing old should be a defiant process, it gradually began to be slotted into serious selections of writing about old age, and for its merit ended up in one or two grander places, such as Philip Larkin’s Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse in 1973. With unforeseen consequences. It was eventually spotted by a retired public relations aide to Lady Bird Johnson, widow of the US president Lyndon Johnson, who enthused about it in an article in Reader’s Digest as an encouragement to older women looking to feel defiant and active again after recovering from illness. After that it went through numerous reprintings, spread to greeting cards and tea towels, and became an unorthodox addition to the stock of “message” poems brought into service for weddings, funerals and other solemn events. In a BBC poll in 1996 it was voted the most popular postwar poem. The red hat, unsuitably worn with purple clothes, finally supplied the name and symbol for the Red Hat Society, a worldwide league of clubs for women who identify themselves by wearing one for their meetings. The poet, who in fact thoroughly disliked the colour purple, greeted this success with a mixture of astonishment, pleasure and weary frustration. Warning was, after all, just one poem in a considerable and wide-ranging body of work of which most of its readers remained unaware. Joseph issued denials: the piece was not autobiographical and she did not plan to fulfil its outrageous promises (“I shall ... pick the flowers in other people’s gardens/ And learn to spit”). But they went unheeded. People expected her to come and read to audiences as the self portrayed in the poem. Meanwhile, critical regard steadily increased for a succession of books which established her as a serious and talented poet with an acute, disarmingly explicit sense of the oddity and pathos of the human condition. Daughter of Florence (nee Cotton) and Louis Joseph, she was born in Birmingham, where her father was an antiques dealer. Louis’s knowledge and enterprise quickly brought a family move to a new home in Buckinghamshire, from where he ran a successful shop in Knightsbridge, London. Jenny attended Badminton school and won a scholarship to study English at St Hilda’s College, Oxford, in 1950. She and her student contemporaries, a sizable group of poets that included Geoffrey Hill, Anthony Thwaite and Alistair Elliot, were of a generation that just missed the influence of the postwar no-nonsense mood in poetry that went into the making of the later 50s Movement associated with Larkin, Kingsley Amis, John Wain and others – though one Movement poet, the slightly older Elizabeth Jennings, was an important friend. The two were both nearer than the Movement to an English Romantic tradition. From the beginning, Joseph’s poems, slowly composed and carefully crafted though almost entirely free in form, showed an appealing ability to catch the detail of everyday living. The Unlooked-for Season (1960), published by John Rolph’s small Scorpion Press, set the tone and the themes for almost all her subsequent writing: sensitive and yet never routine treatment of home and domestic life, childhood, love and loss, nature and natural disasters (River Rising in India, February Floods, 1953). They also frequently featured people, such as beggars and outcasts, who obstinately refuse to meet the requirements of “normal” society. Perhaps there was something of herself in that preoccupation. After graduating, she had worked variously as a teacher of English as a foreign language, a cleaner (in hard times) and a reporter for local newspapers such as the Oxford Mail; she also worked in South Africa for a radical publishing enterprise, Drum, just as apartheid was coming into full force with the election of the early Nationalist governments. She was in effect expelled from the country for her views, though she was reticent about her life and work during that period. Returning to Britain, in 1961 she married Charles Coles and raised three children while working with her husband as proprietors of the Greyhound, a west London pub. Despite all the effort that required, she went on to produce Persephone (1985), a modern retelling of the myth of rape mingling poetry and prose, Led By the Nose (2002), a calendar of a year in her Cotswold garden with its distinctive scents, and volumes of poetry at regular, if long, intervals. Among those was Rose in the Afternoon (1974), in which Warning first appeared, inconspicuously, as one of a batch of poems about “some people”, almost as if she was detaching herself from the speaker. It shows an unfashionable forthrightness and an open pity which is never mawkish, in poems about ordinary, deprived people; as in Thoughts on Oxford Street from Provence and Elsewhere, in which a beggar challenges her sympathy with “I’m a dirty old man ... The rain cements my shoes to me./ The dustbin furnishes meals to me./ Why wasn’t anyone interested seven years ago/ Before I became a character and stank?” Ghosts and Other Company (1996) renewed and enriched her earlier reflections on memory and mortality, characteristically celebrating “the graceful ne’er-do-wells who cavort and slap/ Their boards about on the concrete under the walkways”. She was never too much satisfied with her own good fortune, though disappointed about what she considered her failures: not producing an academic study of Shakespeare, never making films, and not finding the time to put the entire Warning story into a book, so as to “take my revenge on people”. But the dedication to what is probably her best volume, The Thinking Heart (1978), quietly and philosophically sums up her view of the conflict between her two kinds of creative activity. It says simply: “To my children, preventers of literature, life-savers.” That is like her, as a poet whose mood is predominantly poignant sadness and regret; but she is being much too modest about her achievement. Her marriage ended in divorce. She is survived by her children, Martin, Nell and Bec. • Jennifer Ruth Joseph, poet, born 7 May 1932; died 8 January 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/19/antonio-conte-pedro-dived-learn-mistake","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T22:30:35Z","webTitle":"Antonio Conte agrees Pedro dived and tells forward to learn from ‘mistake’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/19/antonio-conte-pedro-dived-learn-mistake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/19/antonio-conte-pedro-dived-learn-mistake","fields":{"headline":"Antonio Conte agrees Pedro dived and tells forward to learn from ‘mistake’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Antonio Conte has admitted Pedro Rodríguez was guilty of diving in the chaotic FA Cup replay against Norwich City and has urged the Spain forward to learn from the mistake and avoid a repeat. Pedro was shown a yellow card for simulation, his second such offence this season. The tumble, just after the hour in Wednesday’s third-round replay at Stamford Bridge, set the tone for everything that followed, with Willian booked for a dive early in extra time, despite the Norwich defender Timm Klose admitting he had clipped the Brazilian, and Álvaro Morata cautioned in the final minute after going to ground under Christoph Zimmermann’s challenge. Chelsea have four bookings for diving this season, after two in each of the last two campaigns. Pedro and Morata, the former Real Madrid striker, were shown second yellow cards against Norwich, ruling them out of Saturday’s trip to Brighton. “I must be honest, I watched the three situations against Norwich and Willian’s situation was very clear – it was a big mistake,” Conte said. “Then Morata, there is a foul. You can decide whether [it was enough] to concede a penalty or not, but there is contact, so not a dive. We must be honest and accept Pedro dived. I think the player … in this situation, the player is clever and intelligent enough to understand when you make a mistake. In this case, Pedro understood this mistake. He didn’t ask for a penalty. “The player understood the mistake and wanted to stand up quickly and admit it was a mistake. But, sometimes we can make mistakes. The most important thing is to try to recognise the mistake and try to avoid repeating them next time.” Michy Batshuayi, who will be permitted to leave Chelsea on loan this month if a replacement is recruited, will lead the line at the Amex Stadium in Morata’s absence. Morata was shown a second yellow card for dissent as he protested against Scott’s decision to penalise him for simulation as the game neared the end of extra time. “He has to overcome this because this is a stupid problem,” Conte said. “He knows very well his mistake. You must learn to control yourself; he has to check himself in future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/21/lloyds-of-london-to-divest-from-coal-over-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T15:35:01Z","webTitle":"Lloyd's of London to divest from coal over climate change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/21/lloyds-of-london-to-divest-from-coal-over-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/21/lloyds-of-london-to-divest-from-coal-over-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Lloyd's of London to divest from coal over climate change","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Lloyd’s of London, the world’s oldest insurance market, has become the latest financial firm to announce that it plans to stop investing in coal companies. Lloyd’s will start to exclude coal from its investment strategy from 1 April. The definition of what is a coal company and the criteria for divestment will be set over the coming months. The firm has long been vocal about the need to battle climate change, with insurance one of the worst affected industries by hurricanes, wildfires and flooding in recent years. The insurance market decided last month to implement a coal exclusion policy as part of a responsible investment strategy for the central mutual fund that sits behind every insurance policy written by the Lloyd’s market. Inga Beale, Lloyd’s of London chief executive, said: “That means that in the areas of our portfolio where we can directly influence investment decisions we will avoid investing in companies that are involved mainly in coal. “Is there more the insurance sector could be doing to help the world transition to a low-carbon economy by choosing sustainable or low-carbon stocks?” Lloyd’s does not underwrite operations directly, but offers a marketplace to almost 90 syndicates of other insurers. Lloyd’s has been slower to take action than others. Other big UK and European insurance companies, including Aviva, Allianz, Axa, Legal &amp; General, SCOR, Swiss Re and Zurich, have been shifting away from coal and other fossil fuels due to concerns about climate risks. About £15bn has been divested by insurers in the past two years, according to a recent report from Unfriend Coal Network, a global coalition of NGOs and campaigners including 350.org and Greenpeace. It said 15 companies – almost all in Europe – have fully or partially cut financial ties by selling holdings in coal companies and refusing to insure their operations. France’s Axa was one of the first financial firms to reduce investments in coal in May 2015 and is still leading the way. It said last month it was ditching investments and ending insurance for controversial US oil pipelines. After being criticised by campaigners for applying a threshold of 50% of revenues to define coal companies, it lowered the threshold to 30%. The Church of England has gone further, pulling out of investing in companies that make more than 10% of their revenues from thermal coal or oil from tar sands. Analysis by the ClimateWise coalition of the world’s biggest insurers published in December 2016 found that more frequent extreme weather events were driving up uninsured losses and making some assets uninsurable. The report concluded that the “protection gap” – the difference between the costs of natural disasters and the amount insured – had quadrupled to $100bn (£79bn) a year since the 1980s. Insurance companies are perhaps also mindful of the danger that they could suffer a huge loss if their investments in fossil fuel companies were rendered worthless by action on climate change, as the Bank of England warned in 2015. However, some banks are still investing in coal plants, according to research from campaign groups. Beale told the Guardian that she would be discussing the group’s new investment strategy at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos this week. Climate change and what investors can do will feature prominently at the meeting of political and business leaders. Beale said: “It goes beyond climate change. The broader issue is how we clean up the planet.” Investment companies and organisations divesting from coal Allianz Axa Aviva BMO Global Asset Management Church of England Generali Legal &amp; General Munich Re Natixis SCOR Storebrand Swiss Re Zurich Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/21/minimum-bet-rule-could-be-winner-for-punters-horse-racing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T14:00:22Z","webTitle":"‘Minimum bet’ rule could prove a winner for punters and horse racing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/21/minimum-bet-rule-could-be-winner-for-punters-horse-racing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/21/minimum-bet-rule-could-be-winner-for-punters-horse-racing","fields":{"headline":"‘Minimum bet’ rule could prove a winner for punters and horse racing","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"About 150 of horse racing’s great and good will converge on Claridge’s in Mayfair on Tuesday afternoon for a ceremony to reveal the ‘world’s best racehorse’ in 2017. Meanwhile, at 3pm, a much smaller audience will gather in committee room four of the House of Lords to consider another subject of considerable interest to racing fans and, for that matter, anyone who likes a bet. There will be no food or fine wine but it is the latter event that could, in the long run, prove the more significant. The subject for discussion, in front of an audience including MPs with an interest in betting matters as well as officials from the Gambling Commission, will be the widespread use of account closures and bet restrictions by online bookmakers, to avoid taking money from successful punters (or, for that matter, from any punter who appears to put some thought and effort into his or her betting, for instance by generally betting at the best price on offer). Closures, and restrictions on individual accounts that amount to the same thing – for instance, a bookie offering to lay 10p at 5-1 when a customer has asked for £20 – are standard practice for the majority of online firms. They do not release figures – perhaps to avoid embarrassment as much as anything else – but 878 respondents to a survey conducted by the Horserace Bettors Forum in 2016 reported a total of 4,576 restricted accounts – about five each, on average – in the previous six months. This is, without doubt, a frustration that afflicts thousands of ordinary punters from week to week. In the long run it will drive people away from betting, which is racing’s most important revenue stream, if they cannot get even a trivial bet laid at an advertised price. Now, thanks to a punter whose infuriation prompted him to raise the problem with his local MP, the issue of restrictions will be considered by an audience that might actually be able to begin the process of doing something about it. The MP in question was Philip Davies, better known perhaps as a voice for the bookies in parliament and a staunch defender of betting-shop fixed odds betting terminals but also co-chair of the all-party gaming and betting group. Davies has convened Tuesday’s seminar, at which three leading figures in racing and betting will give 10-minute speeches before taking questions from the audience. The three speakers are expected to be Richard Flint, the chief executive of Sky Bet; Bruce Millington, the editor of the Racing Post; and Simon Rowlands, chair of the HBF. While the invited audience will hear tales of laughable cowardice on the part of the bookmakers, Rowlands will have a proposal that could begin to address the problem. The idea of a “minimum bet rule”, which would require a bookmaker to lay an advertised price to lose a specified sum, is not new. New South Wales, one of Australia’s main racing jurisdictions, introduced a minimum bet policy in 2014 and other Australian states, including Victoria, the home of the Melbourne Cup, have followed suit. It has proved to be straightforward, effective and, most interesting of all, popular not only with punters but also some of the layers, who have found it easier to trade in a marketplace where turnover is strong and a price must be honoured and available to all. Flint can be expected to argue that bookmakers have a right to refuse any customer a bet, in the same way that a publican can refuse to serve someone beer. A landlord, though, cannot offer a thimbleful of lager instead of a pint, any more than Tesco is allowed to refuse you a box of cornflakes for £2 but offer a single cornflake for a penny as an alternative. The bookies can also insist that restrictions affect only a small percentage of their customers – “no more than 5%” was one recent claim – but even 5% of a big online bookies’ customer base is tens of thousands of punters. Their standard practice now is to attract new accounts by offering vastly inflated odds about near certainties and then weed out anyone who threatens to be uneconomic, a description that covers not only winners but also those who do not lose enough to be worth the effort. One of the Gambling Commission’s duties is to ensure that gambling is “conducted in an open and fair way”. Bookies are not open about the widespread practice of laying a price to one punter while restricting another to pennies and it is most certainly not fair. But the regulator could, if it wished, introduce a minimum bet rule as a condition of a bookie’s licence. Tuesday’s seminar could be an important step along that road."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/19/mauricio-pochettino-spurs-young-players-loans","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T22:30:35Z","webTitle":"Mauricio Pochettino admits Spurs youngsters now have to be extra special","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/19/mauricio-pochettino-spurs-young-players-loans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/19/mauricio-pochettino-spurs-young-players-loans","fields":{"headline":"Mauricio Pochettino admits Spurs youngsters now have to be extra special","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Mauricio Pochettino has said it is harder for Tottenham’s academy players to break into the first team than when he arrived at the club, as he reflected on his decision to loan out Cameron Carter-Vickers and Marcus Edwards.

Congratulations, Katharine Viner and all at the Guardian, for being brave. My 52 years of reading and enjoying the Guardian will continue unabated. Gill Empson Edwinstowe, Nottinghamshire • Your double-page advert in Wednesday’s Guardian (17 January) claims “more understanding for less”. And we get incisive full-page pieces on a whistleblowers’ summit in G2, the scandal of child refugees still in Calais, the predicament of mothers and babies in B&amp;Bs, plus contemporary art at the National Gallery, and a Journal debate on fostering creativity in schools – all on one day. I wasn’t convinced at first, but thank you and the best of luck. Ya’ir Klein London • All is well with the world. The paper looks delightful; the editor-in-chief has written to me; Polly Toynbee is still here, and so is the Codeword and the concise crossword. I am purring. Isobel Waddington York • Not one word of adverse criticism has been printed about what is solely – and let’s cut the bullshit – a cost-cutting exercise. Go on, show me I am misguided and publish this letter. Steve Mason Hornchurch, Essex • I have been a reader for over four decades, buying it lately to help safeguard the financial position of the only liberally minded newspaper left. I regret to say I shall no longer be purchasing the revolting little tabloid that has replaced the stylish Berliner, which defined the Guardian’s brand as a quality newspaper for readers of taste and discernment. With its multiple pages, integral sports section, weather forecast buried away and a generally tacky look, it feels debased (and at almost £2, expensive for a tabloid). What a catastrophe. Peter Bell York • Congratulations on a fantastic job. The news section looks great and I love the way sport has been integrated into the main paper. G2 is really well structured and Journal feels particularly substantial – and nice tint. Small size, big success. Ria Hopkinson London • No divorce is required (letters this week). I am delighted to find the pale pink section in the middle can be separated out before my husband (also of 50 years) picks up the paper. It is a delight – and moreover has the letters spread within. Sylvia Henry Bridport, Dorset • What a delight to have the letters pages in the centrefold and the opinion and comment pieces elegantly brought together in your new Journal section without the intrusion of a single advertisement. Peter Sparks Cambridge • I love the new format but miss the distinctive blue in the masthead – could always pick out the Guardian from 50 paces. Neil Kimberley Windsor • I didn’t bat an eyelid when you changed from broadsheet to Berliner to tabloid format, or even when you changed the font. But I think that changing “the guardian” to “The Guardian” is a step too far. Chris Jackson Southall, Middlesex • I used to wear my Berliner with pride. Now I fear my fellow commuters think I subscribe to the Times. Is there nothing that can be done to the rather pedestrian design of the main section to convince those around me on the tube I’m not reading a Murdoch? Andrew Webb London • Problem is you now look like all the rest. On Tuesday our newsagent delivered the Daily Mail – the first time in eight years that we have had the wrong newspaper – while our neighbour got the Guardian. We were both in a hurry to swap. Marion Jones Weymouth, Dorset • The new tabloid seems a little ageist. Much of the type is fainter and more difficult to read. And many more pages. As a tennis player of McEnroe vintage, my elbow, forearm, wrist and fingers all suffer with the extra turning. John Barrett Edinburgh • Thank you for changing to a tabloid format. The reduction in size coincides with the birth of my first grandchild and will allow me to hold the baby and read the Guardian at the same time. Chris Jones Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan • I use to only read G2 in the bath. Now I can manage the whole paper. Congratulations. Gill Day Shoreham by Sea, West Sussex • I’m sorry that while the Quick crossword has grown to a rather bloated 10cm x 10cm in the new and larger G2 format, the radio guide has lost Radios 1, 2, 4 Extra, 5 Live and 6 Music. Does that reflect your assumptions about your readership’s listening tastes or your somewhat narrow view of radio? John Bailey St Albans, Herfordshire • I like the new format ( I wish sport was separate) but have a gripe with the weather page. No lighting-up times, or sunrise-sunset or moonrise-moonset; I miss the tide times and what the weather was in Crawley or Margate. Jenny Cross Herne Bay, Kent • Letter writers should stop pussy-footing around. The new tabloid Guardian is brilliant. Congratulations to Katherine Viner and her team on such an outstanding technical and editorial achievement. David Seymour Ponteland, Northumberland • Like many, I am impressed by the new format. However, including listings for Radio 3 and Radio 4 only, smacks of snobbish elitism. Annoyed listener of more than two radio stations, Janis Craig Edinburgh • Just a minor quibble. Every morning when I’ve received my Guardian, my ritual has been to open the TV listings, reach for the yellow marker pen and highlight any programme that takes my eye for later watching or recording. A shock then to open the new Guardian to find a third of the programmes decked in the exact day-glow yellow of my marker pen. Life can be full of small tribulations. Howard Richards Hitchin, Herfordshire • Wednesday’s newspaper arrived in two distinct sections, with a large sports headline on the back of the second one. I was impressed that the Guardian had taken such prompt action to avoid a rise in the divorce rate amongst its readers (Letter from Mavis Maclean, 16 January). Unfortunately the second section turned out to be the Daily Express, which I then delivered to the correct address a few doors down. Hilary Ward Ormskirk, Lancashire • I like the new Guardian format generally. But, in the weather section, could you reinstate daily sunshine records? I note the Times and i newspapers do. Tom Rees Thames Ditton, Surrey • To my amazement, I really like the tabloid version and am particularly impressed with the weather maps. If you could just get Nottingham into the “Around the UK” list that page would be perfect. Pam Edwards Sleaford, Lincolnshire • A colourful, full page for the weather, though perhaps not for the 2.5 million people in the UK who are red-green colour blind? Jan Rigby Department of Geography, Maynooth University, Ireland • Please quell my rising sense of panic. Where is Kakuro? I look forward to Fridays for the mathematical workout over breakfast. Please bring it back. It will make the new format perfect. Natasha Howes Manchester • Nope. Looked everywhere, still can’t find it. Where have you put Doonesbury? John Murphy Carshalton, Surrey • Why no pieceword? I was just getting the hang of it. There seems to be space for it on the puzzle page of G2. Barbara Laird Wath-upon-Dearne, West Yorkshire • The only complaint I have about the new Guardian is that, having struggled all week, I find the codeword too small, despite there being plenty of empty space on its page. This from an elderly reader who is a little short of lamp-oil. Alan Spoors Pidley, Cambrideshire • Concerning your new format, I have not seen any approbation in these columns from the Flongs of Sans Serriffe – surely you kept them “on board” as your plans progressed? Dr David Griffiths Claygate, Surrey • As a reader for over 40 years, I was apprehensive about the switch to tabloid size. But why not call it “compact” rather than tabloid? Robert Grover Eastbourne, East Sussex • The trouble is, I can’t moan about the tabloid press any more.

In a major U-turn, the new work and pensions secretary, Esther McVey, said she would not challenge the December ruling that found changes to personal independence payments (PIPs) could not be justified. Campaigners called the announcement a major victory for thousands of disabled people who had faced “crude and unfair distinctions” between those with physical impairments and mental health conditions. McVey’s decision overturns moves by ministers last spring to stop people qualifying for enhanced payments within the mobility component of PIP for reasons of “psychological distress”. The decision led to an outcry from campaigners and many disabled people who lost money. Individuals with conditions such as severe anxiety and bipolar disorder warned that they were scared to leave the house and needed support to walk 200 metres, but were stripped of payments because they did not need a stick or a physical aid. A challenge to the high court resulted in a judgment before Christmas last year, in which Mr Justice Mostyn said: “In my judgment, the 2017 regulations introduced criteria ... which were blatantly discriminatory against those with mental health impairments and which cannot be objectively justified.” Charities widely expected McVey to challenge the decision but she said the government had decided not to do that, although she said ministers did not agree with some of the detail of the ruling. “Our intention has always been to deliver the policy intent of the original regulations, as approved by parliament, and to provide the best support to claimants with mental health conditions,” she said. However, she has now asked the Department for Work and Pensions to begin an exercise going through all affected cases in receipt of PIP. “We will then write to those individuals affected, and all payments will be backdated to the effective date in each individual claim. I hope that by making this statement it is clear that the government is committed to improving the lives of people with mental health conditions,” she said in a written ministerial statement. Officials would not put a number on how many people might be affected but a government impact assessment did suggest 164,000 claimants could be affected by the change to the mobility component of PIP. However, not all will have gone for a reassessment during the period since the changes, so will not all receive backdated payments. Mark Atkinson, chief executive of disability charity Scope, said: “It’s absolutely right that the government has accepted the high court’s ruling over the ‘discriminatory’ changes made to PIP last year. This announcement is a victory for the many disabled people who have been unable to access support they are entitled to. “The regulations introduced last March made crude and unfair distinctions between those with physical impairments and mental health conditions.” He argued that thousands relied on PIP to live independently and meet “often substantial extra costs” as a result of their condition or impairment. “While those affected by these misguided changes will now receive the payments they are entitled to, the fundamentally flawed PIP assessment process still needs radically overhauling so it accurately identifies the extra costs disabled people face,” he added. Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary, Debbie Abrahams, said the government was wrong to bring in the new regulations and ignore the view of the courts “time and time again”. But she added: “Serious questions remain including: how many people have been adversely affected by the government’s reckless decision to oppose the tribunal’s original judgment? How much public money has been spent on lawyers, trying to defend the indefensible? And how quickly will people with severe mental health conditions receive the support to which they are rightly entitled? “This is yet more evidence of the duplicity and disarray of the Tories’ social security policies.” Frank Field, the Labour MP who chairs parliament’s work and pensions select committee, called it a very welcome first move for McVey, adding “hopefully the new broom sweeps clean”. “I hope she will now put into place the high court’s ruling for past claimants who may have lost out, or are waiting for their appeals,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/20/mexico-leftwing-andres-manuel-lopez-obrador","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T08:00:46Z","webTitle":"Mexico's leftwing frontrunner laughs off Russia jibes and says: I'm no Moscow stooge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/20/mexico-leftwing-andres-manuel-lopez-obrador","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/20/mexico-leftwing-andres-manuel-lopez-obrador","fields":{"headline":"Mexico's leftwing frontrunner laughs off Russia jibes and says: I'm no Moscow stooge","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It could be a scene from a John Le Carré novel: under a leaden sky, a grey-haired man in an overcoat looks out to sea and chuckles quietly at the prospect of a Russian submarine bearing a shipment of gold. But the image came in a video this week by the leftwing frontrunner in Mexico’s presidential election, as he laughed off claims that he is receiving covert support from Moscow. Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a populist former mayor of Mexico City, has become the focus of escalating – if unsubstantiated – allegations of Russian interference in the 1 July election. In December, the US national security adviser HR McMaster said there had been “initial signs” of Russian meddling in Mexico. He offered no details, but the ruling PRI has made such claims a central plank of its campaign against López Obrador, popularly known as Amlo. In response, Amlo this week posted the video in which he joked that he was waiting for a submarine to bring “gold from Moscow” and said he was now known as “Andrés Manuelovich”. According to western officials, Russia has used hackers, bots and fake news to influence campaigns from the US presidential election to the Brexit referendum and Catalonia’s independence vote. And as the presidential election draws closer, similar suspicions have been voiced in Mexico – though evidence remains elusive. The Washington Post and Bloomberg have both run recent opinion columns arguing that a victory for Amlo would benefit Moscow. Such comments have been seized upon by the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). “International media are documenting Russian and Venezuelan interests supporting López,” the party said in a statement. But the suggestion that López Obrador is a Trojan horse for a foreign power has also brought back memories of the country’s contentious 2006 election, in which Amlo was ahead in the polls until attack ads compared him with the late Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chávez; Amlo’s support cratered and he lost by less than a percentage point. Many Mexicans poured scorn on the idea that Russia could further destabilizing Mexico – which in 2017 had its most violent year in recent history – or undermine its democracy, which has long been plagued by vote-buying and excessive campaign spending. “If the point of Russian intervention in the electoral process is to undermine confidence in democratic institutions, the truth is there isn’t much left to do in Mexico. The Mexican political class has already done this work, without their help,” tweeted Carlos Bravo Regidor, professor at the Centre for Research and Teaching in Economics. The PRI has itself been accused of using armies of bots to spread fake narratives, hacking the communications of government critics and paying the press to boost its candidates. The party denies such wrongdoing. But Amlo, a close friend of the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, has drawn fire over his some of his close associates, including John Ackerman, an academic who often appears on the Spanish-language service of the Russian news channel RT. Ackerman’s wife, Irma Sandoval has been tapped as a potential member of Amlo’s cabinet, and critics assert that his work with RT – often seen as a Kremlin propaganda channel – constitutes a conflict of interest. “Ackerman’s work on Russia Today dangerously reduced the degrees of separation between Putin and López Obrador,” wrote the commentator León Krauze in El Universal. Ackerman, a professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, told the Guardian that his work on RT is limited to a weekly commentary on social media and he has received no instructions from anyone. Online, many Mexicans made fun of the allegations against Amlo, changing Twitter handles to cyrillic script and sharing gifs from Rocky IV. But in a second column for the Washington Post, Krauze repeated his warnings: “The world knows very well what happened last time a country laughed off the possibility of Russian interference in a democratic process.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/21/no-reds-under-beds-young-awake-to-flaws-in-capitalism","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T00:03:05Z","webTitle":"No reds under beds, but the young are awake to the flaws in capitalism | Kenan Malik","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/21/no-reds-under-beds-young-awake-to-flaws-in-capitalism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/21/no-reds-under-beds-young-awake-to-flaws-in-capitalism","fields":{"headline":"No reds under beds, but the young are awake to the flaws in capitalism","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Are student Red Guards about to storm the quads of Oxbridge colleges? Do young people think that famines and purges and mass executions are good? Apparently so. A ComRes poll last week showed that young people worry more about capitalism than communism: 9% of 18- to 24-year-olds thought communists were “the most dangerous in the world today” while 24% thought it was “big business”. It was, in all honesty, a daft poll. It’s a bit like asking: “Who do you fear most – Jack the Ripper or the murderer now living in your road?” Nevertheless, it created ripples. On BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, John Humphrys interviewed Fiona Lali, president of the Marxist Society at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. She put up a defence of the Soviet Union. “It was [not] allowed to develop or flourish in the way that it could have done because the US, the British, were all involved in attacking it,” she suggested. “Universities luring millennials to communism, leading don warns” ran the faux-shock headlines in both the Times and the Daily Mail. The don in question was Orlando Figes, professor of history at London University’s Birkbeck College and a Russia expert, who, according to the Times “warned that the drive for balance and moral relativism in universities risked minimising Stalin’s crimes”. No, we shouldn’t minimise Stalin’s crimes. And, yes, some do, though those who wish to airbrush Uncle Joe are hardly either the loudest voices or the brightest sparks, even among millennials. Relativism among the young today expresses itself not through regurgitated Stalinism but in the embrace of identity politics. Worrying more about capitalism than communism is no more to minimise Stalin’s crimes than worrying more about the murderer down the road is to minimise the horrors inflicted by Jack the Ripper. What else should we expect young people to say? Communism is barely alive, while capitalism ravages their lives. The west, some seem to have forgotten, won the cold war. The Soviet Union is no more. The Chinese Communist party has long ago embraced the market, albeit in a particularly statist and authoritarian form. In Europe, only rumps of the old communist parties remain. But having won the cold war, capitalism is losing the peace. There is a growing backlash against the consequences of free market policies and a sense of alienation from mainstream institutions. The lives of most young people have been shaped not by Stalin’s purges or Mao’s cultural revolution, but by the financial crash of 2008, by the austerity policies that have followed and by the gross inequalities that disfigure the world. It is not Lenin who has ensured that real wages in Britain today are lower than they were in 2007. Nor is it Castro’s policies that have led to the housing crisis. Nor yet is Pol Pot responsible for the collapse of Carillion. Anyone who imagines that young people (and not just young people) would not feel rage about what the free market has wrought are as much living in the past as those who are nostalgic for Stalinism. It is a measure of how little faith the right has in its own market-led policies that it is forced so often to wheel out the red scare, a scare that gets more pathetic with every outing. What is striking about the ComRes poll is not that so many should despise capitalism, but that so few do: 24% of 18- to 24-year-olds may have been most worried about big business, but only 12% thought that capitalism was the biggest threat – not that different from the 9% that most feared communism. The fact that less than a quarter of young people worry too deeply about big business seems to suggest a strain of conservatism rather than of communism. The problem we face is not that young people are being drawn once again towards Soviet-style communism but that most forms of progressive collective action have faded. With the fall of the Berlin Wall, not just the Soviet Union but much of the non-Stalinist left began crumbling, too. The labour movement has withered. Trade unions have lost influence.

All except the best and strongest of them feel vulnerable. They suspect that politicians see them as the soft underbelly of the private system. As fees edge up, impecunious parents go over to the State. Small classes are still a strong attraction, but State primary schools don’t carry quite the old stigma in the suburbs. Cruellest of all, the prep schools fear that the public schools – the only reason for their existence – would, if pressed politically, abandon them, and settle for State-educated children. There are probably fewer than 100,000 boys at prep schools, more than half of them under the umbrella of the Incorporated Association of Preparatory Schools. This is a well-connected body, with 500 headmaster-members, who run schools for 55,000 boys aged from 7 to 13. All their schools are recognised by the State as “efficient”, which means as efficient as a comparable State school (inspectors take a lenient view). About 70 of the 500 are associated with public schools. A third of them are run by charitable trusts, the rest by owner-headmasters and private companies. The association says “prep school” ought to be synonymous with “I.A.P.S. school”, but has to admit it isn’t: there are several hundred outside the association, most of them headmaster-owned and some officially non-efficient. Many of these are in and around London and other cities: day-schools, occupying converted Victorian houses in suburban avenues, some of them moderately good, others well below State-school standard in everything but snob-appeal. But even the smarter schools are on edge. “We have been warned by our masters at I.A.P.S. not to give interviews to the Press,” the headmaster of a Seaford school said. “If you’ve got an axe to grind,” said a Birmingham headmaster, “I’ll grind it afterwards by correspondence, and I guarantee I’ll grind you up.” The Guardian and Observer archive has more than 200 years of articles and images available to view.

Womack, a retired army major who grew up in the area and is now the leader of a local environmental justice group, has parked on a patch of dirt under a stories-high interstate bridge, wedged between a paper mill, oil storage tanks and an industrial railroad. Between the tangle of heavy industry, it’s about as close as you can still get to the area where the Clotilda and the 110 kidnapped west Africans aboard are said to have first touched ground – and where the remains of what might in fact be the ship were recently discovered, thanks to unusual weather conditions. Several years after emancipation many of the Clotilda survivors would return here to start an independent settlement governed by native traditions. The Clotilda was sponsored by Timothy Meaher, a wealthy Alabama businessman, on a bet that he could evade authorities and successfully land an illegal slave ship (he was caught but never convicted). The landing site, now covered by oil storage tanks, is on land still owned by the Meaher family, along with several other lucrative industrial plots in the area. Today, this mostly black, low-income community has more than just a unique history as an against-the-odds bolthole of black independence in the Reconstruction south. Residents say they also have a serious industrial pollution and public health problem, and a group of about 1,200 have launched a lawsuit against the owners of a now-shuttered paper plant that was built in 1928 on land that was then owned by A Meaher Jr. “People born after 1945 seem to be dying before the age of 65,” said Womack, who grew up during the mid-century heydey of the International Paper plant that drew thousands of workers here but also, according to residents, spewed ash across the town. The lawsuit claims International Paper was responsible for the release of hazardous chemicals into the air and local environment, and notes that these have been linked to bad health outcomes including cancer. It further claims International Paper failed to properly clean up the site when it closed 20 years ago. The firm denies all the allegations. After being smuggled into Mobile, survivors of the Clotilda were sold into slavery or kept on Meaher’s properties until the civil war ended five years later. After emancipation, many returned to this bank of the Mobile river and, unable to return to Africa, founded their own town in 1866 as Sylviane Anna Diouf documents in her book, Dreams of Africa in Alabama. Africatown residents were able to remain independent, self-governed under African traditions and languages, and eventually saved enough money to buy land from their former owners. It is one of the first towns founded and controlled by African Americans in the United States. Many of Africatown’s descendants still live here today. And residents fear their unique past is in danger of being erased by industrialization, environmental pollution and, they say, high cancer rates. It is one of many poor communities of color around the country disproportionately affected by industrial pollution. “We’re still fighting” says Womack when asked about Africatown’s past and the current legal fight. “This whole thing is called planned obsolescence and that is what we are fighting,” said Womack, who is the executive director of a local environmental justice organization known by its acronym, Chess. Once home to around 10,000, Africatown’s population has dipped to about 3,000. Abandoned houses line the town’s quiet and compact residential heart. Paper, asphalt and petrochemical plants, pipelines and coal terminals surround the town, which is just a few miles upriver from downtown Mobile. Residents say the surrounding industry presents serious health and safety issues, as does the continued threat of further industrialization (activists successfully beat back an oil storage tank farm proposal in 2015). Cancer Pastor Christopher L Williams Sr says he noticed a high cancer rate almost immediately after moving to Africatown’s Yorktown Missionary Baptist church in 2006. “We must have done 20 funerals that year,” the vast majority due to cancer, he said. Alarmed by the death rate, he sent out a questionnaire on cancer to the 150 or so active church members. About 100 people replied indicating they or a family member had cancer. Since then, Williams says he has gone through a handful of lawyers trying to get legal help. No localized cancer data on Africatown exists – the Alabama department of health averages data across the county – but Williams and others here all describe a similar trend: many longtime residents dying before the age of 65, very often from cancer. Patricia J Dock, a lifelong resident and Yorktown church member, rattles off her list – a husband who died of spine cancer, a younger brother who died of brain and lung cancer, and another brother who is now fighting leukemia. Her father died years ago from what doctors said was tuberculosis, but she believes was cancer. Many here the Guardian speaks to are convinced a trail of cancer leads back to International Paper, which has denied any wrongdoing. Today, all that is left of the plant are a few concrete stumps in an abandoned field. But Patricia Dock and other residents recalled what they say was ubiquitous ash emitted from the plant up until the 1980s and 90s, when pollution control measures used today started to kick in. “The debris that would fall from the air would be so thick you couldn’t see three feet in front of you,” she said. New cars would rust out within a few years. Airborne pollution would cover the small vegetable gardens many families kept. “You’d wash it off and eat it. You didn’t have anything else,” she said. Tightening EPA regulations helped to reduce pollutive practices of paper mills around the country years ago. Although residents complain about the current industrialization they say it is not as bad. Past pollution has continued to haunt the town, says a lawsuit filed in Mobile County court last spring. The suit alleges that International Paper released dioxins and furans – highly toxic compounds shown to be directly linked to cancer – into the air, ground and water in amounts that exceeded EPA limits. It also, it is claimed, failed to follow federal clean-up regulations before shuttering the mill and bulldozing the site in 2000, so that chemicals left behind have continued to spread into the surrounding area, affecting the health and property of residents. Moreover, the suit charges, International Paper and other defendants sought to hide these violations from the public and government officials. “They were supposed to retrofit the plant so that it didn’t release harmful substances into the community and they chose not to do that,” said Donald W Stewart, one of the lead prosecuting attorneys on the case. “They just shut it down and bulldozed the plant to the ground.” He expects the case to go to trial sometime this year. International Paper, which is based in Memphis and reported sales of $21bn in 2016, has denied all allegations in the suit. A spokesman for the company said he could not comment on ongoing litigation. In response to a question on the health and safety practices of its production operations more generally, he said: “As with all our operations, we adhere to all federal, state and local regulations and often go well beyond the standards set.” Africatown’s plight has attracted the attention of Senator Cory Booker and former EPA environmental justice lead Mustafa Santiago Ali, who now works for a civil and human rights non-profit called the Hip Hop Caucus. Womack and others are eyeing tourism as a potential salve to local economic problems, though they say this has not had enough support from local officials. Under the future land use plan for Mobile, adopted last year, Africatown’s small residential area remains surrounded by land zoned as heavy industry, leaving a path open for new development. Lorna Gail Woods, 69, a fifth-generation Africatown resident and descendant of a Clotilda survivor, has seen the town’s fortunes rise and fall. “It was people living here that thought they were living a good life and doing pretty good, and all of a sudden you come home and you get sick and in a few weeks or a month you’re dead,” she said. Her grandfather worked at the International Paper plant and died in the 1950s. Residents say the town has lost its long tradition of self-sufficiency, as creeping industrialization has contributed to a decline in population and a loss of the local businesses. “We don’t have a store that we can stop in and get a bottle of water,” says Woods. Like others here, Woods is also concerned about Africatown’s history being lost. She has kept a fastidious collection of historical artifacts and records on Africatown in the hopes of one day creating a museum to honor her ancestors and past residents. “I’m here as living hope for those that have gone on, that their life was not in vain,” she said. W Mae Jones, 79, who moved to Africatown in the 1970s, and whose husband died of cancer a few months ago, said her main concern is raising awareness of what the town has been through. “Before we can get it cleaned up, this community needs to be recognized for what it is and what it has been and what it was.” This article was amended on 27 January 2018. It originally implied that the American civil war ended in 1862. It ended in 1865."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/20/cyrille-regis-pioneer-footballer-west-brom-hawthorns-fans-gather","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T11:49:47Z","webTitle":"A pioneer, but first a footballer: how West Brom celebrates Cyrille the King","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/20/cyrille-regis-pioneer-footballer-west-brom-hawthorns-fans-gather","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/20/cyrille-regis-pioneer-footballer-west-brom-hawthorns-fans-gather","fields":{"headline":"A pioneer, but first a footballer: how West Brom celebrates Cyrille the King","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"As any pub quiz regular will tell you, the Hawthorns, home of West Bromwich Albion since 1900, is the highest league football stadium above sea level in the UK. It stands 551ft up on a ridge west of Birmingham and all last week it was a place of pilgrimage, a city on a hill. From the moment fans heard of the death of Cyrille Regis, at 59, last Sunday, they trooped up here in ones and twos, in sleet and rain, to tie scarves and shirts to the ground’s blue-painted iron gates. Empty football stadiums always carry the ghost of Saturdays past; you half hear the roar they are built to contain. That roar was never louder here than 40 years ago when Regis led the forward line alongside his best mate Laurie Cunningham. The eyes of those who have come to pay their respects shine with the memory of it when I ask. First they talk of Regis’s power: “He was so strong, and so quick”; “There was no stopping him, once he got into his stride.” And then they talk of his grace: “He was just such a lovely bloke, a proper gentleman.” On Thursday lunchtime Graham Chambers was sticking a handwritten note to the gates. The note recalled a full-throated hymn of 1978: Hark now hear the West Brom sing! A new king born today! His name is Cyrille Regis And he’s better than Andy Gray! I tell him I last heard that song as a 12-year-old Aston Villa fan, from the rival end of the ground; Andy Gray was our player. He smiles. “Cyrille was born exactly the same day as me,” he says. “I told him that a couple of times but we never worked out who was older.” Much of the talk last week was of Regis’s impact as the first black hero of the English game, slowly changing attitudes; but up here they just loved him from day one. “The first game he played, he scored two goals, the second just bang in the top corner,” Chambers says. “We all just looked at each other: ‘Where’s he come from?’” The answer to that is another reason why Regis’s death was so poignant. His story, like that of all genuine heroes, was one of struggle. His first five years were spent in a rainforest village without a school, a boat ride upriver from the capital of French Guiana, Cayenne. His dad dug desperately for gold, and when he found none, aged 46, he headed for England. Regis followed in the hard London winter of 1963 with his mother and sister, not knowing what cold was. The four of them lived in a single room at 383 Portobello Road, Rachman territory. Then, when things got worse, Regis and a younger brother were taken in by a convent while their mother lived in a Salvation Army hostel. Eventually they were reunited in a high rise adjacent to Wembley stadium. Though Regis, a trained electrician, was a standout non-league footballer, he was rejected by the big London clubs. The Albion scout Ronnie Allen was so sure of his ability he offered to pay the 19-year-old’s wages – £60 a week – himself. A quarter of that went on the digs that a part-time coach arranged after asking at the factory in Dudley where he worked if anyone knew a black landlady to take the player in. Murtella Groce, who became a lifelong friend to Regis – he visited her often after she developed Alzheimer’s in her 90s – gave him a room in her terraced house in Smethwick. Her home was in the constituency where a decade earlier the Conservative candidate, Peter Griffiths, had won an election with posters stating, “If you want a nigger for a neighbour – vote Labour”. For that first Albion match in 1977, Regis walked the half an hour from Groce’s, across the canal, past Handsworth cemetery to the Hawthorns with his boots in a bag on his shoulder. It was probably the last time in West Bromwich he went about unrecognised. The racism from opposition fans never stopped shocking him, but he had a ready answer. The first time the monkey noises rolled down from the terraces was in a game at Newcastle. He and Cunningham both scored. When Regis was in the England dressing room before his international debut he opened a letter which read: “If you put your foot on our Wembley turf you’ll get one of these through your knees.” Also in the envelope was a bullet. He kept the bullet, and went on to play five times for England. He knew it should have been more. And there were other might-have-beens after those first three explosive seasons. St Etienne wanted to take Regis to France for £750,000. Johan Cruyff wanted him at Ajax, to replace the world’s best centre forward, Marco van Basten. At the time of the first offer he was persuaded to stay at West Brom for £200 a week and a one-off £11,000 loyalty bonus. As a couple of the West Brom fans at the gates tell me, ruefully: “We now have defensive midfield players who can’t get a game on 70 grand a week.” That’s the other reason that Regis’s death has resonated; he was of the last generation of football heroes who was, in other respects, also one of us. On the way home from the Hawthorns on Thursday, I heard a radio report that suggested this weekend’s fixtures would mark how Regis “had led the fight against racism”. This sounded slightly wrong-headed. Regis never stooped to engage directly with the bigots. He just showed Saturday after Saturday, year after year, in the way he played his football and carried himself as a man, the emptiness and absurdity of those who abused him. As he said in his autobiography: “Through this reply of consistent perseverance and performance, people’s minds were changed.” Football came first – thrilling, unforgettable for those who watched him: all the rest followed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/feb/05/quiz-iceland-native-land-mammal-seto-inland-sea-beach-boys","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-05T09:38:34Z","webTitle":"What is Iceland’s only native land mammal?

It has led to an embarrassing wealth of consumer goods. But it is also increasingly clear that the me-first model of modern economies is a big source of unhappiness. When life feels like a cut-throat contest each one of us is encouraged to chase income and rank. In a rat race improving one’s income causes others to feel dissatisfied with theirs. One person’s pay rise is another’s psychic loss. Envy spreads despair, encouraging workers to devote more time to making money than to family or community. Such competition weighs heavily on national wellbeing. A slice of Britain seem to be losing hope; the lives of poorer citizens are unhappier than their richer peers in ways that simply having less money cannot explain. Our story revealing that private insurers refuse policies to people suffering even mild mental health conditions shows how those who suffer could be shut out of society. Medical research shows that happier people heal quicker, worrying given measures of wellbeing show the proportions of people satisfied with their health, home and income to have fallen over the past three years. This week the government appointed its first minister for loneliness, and it should be applauded for recognising a growing problem. Loneliness is the feeling of having inadequate social connections. It can be deadly; one study found it did more damage to health than smoking. The risk factors are growing: record numbers of middle-aged people now live alone. Local spaces that get people together have disappeared in the austerity years. Participation in sport, a marker of social bonding, has dropped. However, loneliness is a symptom; it is not the disease. That is the problem with having a minister whose remit is so circumscribed. The new minister, Tracey Crouch, will rightly look at ways of reducing emotional suffering. But she will say little about how to tackle what causes it. Britain requires a politician with clout at cabinet level to act more widely and restore community wealth and civic responsibility. There is an acute need to redefine notions of gainful work so that no longer is it just about private profit for firms. Since the financial crash of 2008, the UK labour market has undergone a quiet transformation as companies have forgone full-time employees and filled positions with precarious posts. In the last decade 40% of jobs growth has been via self-employment. Agency work has grown by a half. There are now about 1 million workers on zero-hours contracts. Britain has record employment but at what cost to society, when employment is no longer able to support a stable life? Jobs where hours and income fluctuate can wreak havoc with benefits and childcare. They wear workers out mentally. Research last year found astoundingly that some jobs might be even worse than unemployment for one’s health: people moving into poor-quality work were found to have the highest levels of chronic stress, higher than that recorded by jobless workers. Not only has the fissuring of the workplace been bad for the health of workers, it has contributed to the weakest pay growth since the Napoleonic wars. We are boosting corporate profits and lowering consumer prices while increasing the chances of poorer workers experiencing heart disease. This economic model needs to be recast. The neoclassical economic theory of “homo economicus” – that we are essentially selfish, that we only know our own wishes and act rationally to maximise our own utility – describes only one part of our nature. From a biological perspective, we evolved to be social creatures with relationships built on trust and cooperation. It is this side of humanity, built on empathy and compassion, that we need to encourage. Business can make money while supporting social goals, but to do so such enterprises must adhere to a set of ethical and democratic principles. To revitalise an economy without putting profits above people, Britain needs to jettison its infatuation with firms which end up a repository for risk that others must bear."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/21/love-i-felt-for-cyrille-regis-as-bigots-stood-beside-me","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T00:05:06Z","webTitle":"The love I felt for Cyrille Regis as the bigots stood beside me | Kenan Malik","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/21/love-i-felt-for-cyrille-regis-as-bigots-stood-beside-me","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/21/love-i-felt-for-cyrille-regis-as-bigots-stood-beside-me","fields":{"headline":"The love I felt for Cyrille Regis as the bigots stood beside me","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"‘There ain’t no black in the Union Jack, all the Pakis can fuck off back.” In the 1970s, when I started watching football, that’s what often greeted me at Old Trafford and Elland Road. And Anfield. I am a Liverpool fan. In my teenage years, visiting Anfield, I was often spat on, kicked, called a “fucking Paki cunt”. Not just from visiting fans, but also from the Kop faithful. Not by everyone on the Kop, but by a significant number, which was largely tolerated. In the 1970s and 1980s, racism was endemic, in football and in society. That’s why for me, the death last week of Cyrille Regis is more than the passing of a fine footballer. I never supported West Brom, Coventry or any of the other teams for which Regis played. But Regis was a hero to me as much as Liverpool legends such as John Barnes and Kenny Dalglish. He was a wonderful centre-forward, who never seemed to score forgettable goals. But he was also, as so many black footballers have made clear, an inspiration and a trailblazer, whose strength and dignity in facing down the racists helped pave the way for a new generation. To confront the racism on the terraces was one thing, to confront it on the pitch, to pass and to score in the face of the vicious abuse quite another. That took real courage. Why did I carry on supporting Liverpool despite the abuse? Partly because sporting obsessions are rarely driven by rational considerations. Partly because standing on the Kop was little different then to standing on any street corner. Partly because to have stopped would have been to give in to the bigots But it was also because of players such as Cyrille Regis. Next weekend, when Liverpool play West Brom in the FA Cup, I’ll have a drink in his memory.

Firing triggers for Polaris nuclear missiles, warhead nose cones as well as Cold War cultural items such as posters of the 1990 Sean Connery film The Hunt for Red October will form part of the event, which will open on 15 June at the navy’s submarine museum in Gosport, Hampshire. “The exhibition will highlight the need for a continuous at-sea deterrent but will not shy away from debate,” according to documents describing the show, which comes at a time when there are divisions in society over Britain’s continued possession of nuclear weapons and plans to replace the current Trident missile system. Kate Hudson, general secretary of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), has taken issue with the project. “At a time when the defence budget is severely stretched and key equipment is unfunded, it is shocking to read that the Ministry of Defence-sponsored navy museum is undertaking a propaganda offensive at taxpayers’ expense,” she said. “It will ‘highlight the need for a continuous at-sea deterrent’. This is a highly contested political view and certainly does not fit within the published charitable objectives of the NMRN. We urge the museum to think again about how it marks this significant anniversary.” The £60,000 cost of the exhibition has been raised privately, according to the museum, which is a public body sponsored by the MoD and in receipt of lottery funding. Existing items from the museum’s collection will be used, including a radar mast from a Resolution class submarine, while the exhibition will also give an insight into life on board a nuclear submarine through items such as the books taken on Polaris patrols. But voices of opposition will also feature, including subversive works from the artist and political cartoonist Darren Cullen, who last year placed spoof posters, mocked up to look like Royal Navy recruitment advertisements, in bus shelters around London. They bore the slogan: “Become a suicide bomber”. Cullen told the Observer that the museum had acquired two posters from him – the suicide bomber one and one with the slogan “Trident: the final solution to all problems”, which were posted in bus stops in 2015 as part of protests against a defence and security equipment arms fair. He was not aware that the works would be used in a new permanent exhibition. “Museums are an important record of the peaks and troughs of human civilisation,” he said. “I hope this exhibition is housed deep enough to survive the Royal Navy’s plan to destroy civilisation entirely if Britain loses a war. “Nuclear bombs are suicide bombs – it is impossible to use these weapons without also killing ourselves. They are an expression of a genocidal and suicidal, not to mention very expensive, form of national insanity.” Professor Dominic Tweddle, director general of the NMRN, said: “The new exhibition marks the 50th anniversary of the first Polaris patrol with HMS Resolution. It will be an objective assessment of the deterrent patrols, with the story of the Royal Navy’s submarines and submariners at its heart. We are also planning to hold a conference on the same subject. “We cannot ignore protest nor pretend that it does not exist. It has been government policy – whatever party has been in power – to have an independent nuclear deterrent. The exhibition and conference will be balanced and reflect the views of both sides of the argument.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/21/peter-mayle-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T15:18:01Z","webTitle":"Peter Mayle obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/21/peter-mayle-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/21/peter-mayle-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Peter Mayle obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In 1987, Peter Mayle and his third wife, Jennie, moved from Devon to a farmhouse in Ménerbes, in the Luberon region of Provence, which they intended to refurbish while he worked on a novel. Months later, he wrote his agent a long letter explaining his lack of progress on his fiction by detailing the tribulations of dealing with the French. “Do another 250 pages of that,” his agent replied, “and I’ll find a publisher.” The book that resulted, A Year in Provence (1989), became a bestseller, was adapted for television, and spawned a series of sequels as well as a flood of imitators. A Year in Provence tapped in to the rising affluence of the British middle class, and its growing appetite for a lifestyle beyond Elizabeth David and a week’s holiday on the Côte d’Azur. It might be seen as the starting point for the tidal wave of books and reality programmes about cooking, travel and property speculation. Mayle’s relaxed amusement with the French villagers appealed to traditional British frustrations at dealing with their neighbours, and more important, it linked into what the writer George Mikes once described as the English love of enduring hardship: the lavender-scented pleasures of Provence came only at the cost of adapting to life among the locals. Mayle, who has died aged 78, conveyed his enjoyment with an exuberance that reflected his training as an advertising copywriter; in effect, he sold Provence first to Britain and then to the world. Mayle was born in Brighton, East Sussex. His father worked for the foreign office and his mother part-time as a beautician. He was educated at Brighton college, where he boarded unhappily, and left at 15 to join his parents in Barbados, where his father had been posted, and where Peter took his O-levels. On his return to the UK, he took a trainee job with Shell, in their public relations department in London. He recalled accompanying his boss to Paris, and receiving instructions on how to behave. “Don’t try their lingo,” he was warned. “Speak English forcefully enough and they will understand you.” Shell’s advertising was handled by Ogilvy &amp; Mather; Mayle recalled his “one skill was writing good letters” and he sent one to David Ogilvy in New York. He was offered a post as a junior account executive, but sat their copywriting test and in 1961 became one of what we now think of as Mad Men. He returned to London after an offer to become head of creative from the Papert Koenig Lois agency which doubled his salary; his colleagues there included the future film director Alan Parker. In the mid-1960s he and a partner bought out the company, and four years later they sold it to the US group BBDO, where Mayle became creative director. In 1974, “fed up with the rat race”, he moved to Devon and began writing. His first book, Where Did I Come From? (1973), was a young person’s guide to the facts of life; he turned out many such guides, ranging from Divorce Can Happen to the Nicest People (1979) to Anything But Rover: The Art and Science of Naming Your Dog (1985), as well as more traditional children’s books. But his biggest hit was the Wicked Willie series, illustrated by Gray Jolliffe, about a cartoon penis dubbed “Man’s Best Friend”. The move to France came with his again wanting to break from the grind of his book production. Even when A Year In Provence found a publisher, expectations were not high. But Christopher Sinclair-Stevenson at Hamish Hamilton recognised what would sell the books; he arranged a dinner with eight key booksellers, and Mayle so charmed them that they gave it priority. He also benefited from an unusual serialisation in the Sunday Times: one excerpt per month, following the flow of the book’s year. A Year in Provence eventually sold millions and in 1993 was made into a TV series starring John Thaw and Lindsay Duncan. Mayle returned to his theme with Toujours Provence (1991) and Encore Provence (1999), and moved to fiction with light-hearted books set in France, beginning with Hotel Pastis (1993). But by now tourists were beating a path to his door in Ménerbes, and the last straw came when he found a photographer from the Sun hiding in his bushes hoping for a shot of someone sunbathing naked – in February. Mayle sold the house and moved to the village of Amagansett on Long Island, a summer playground for New York’s rich. It was a good place to work; Mayle wrote the novels Anything Considered (1996) and Chasing Cezanne (1997) as well as a children’s book, A Dog’s Life (1995). But he could not resist the lure of France and in 1999 returned to Provence – to a secluded mansion between the picture book village of Lourmarin and the even-tinier Vaugines – and to books about Provence. A Good Year (2004) was adapted into a film starring Russell Crowe and directed by Ridley Scott, a friend from his advertising days and a neighbour in Provence. With The Vintage Caper (2009), Mayle began a series of light-hearted crime novels set in the south of France; the fourth, The Diamond Caper was published in 2015. Mayle’s books were criticised on both sides of the Channel for a portrayal of the French that conformed to English stereotypes. There were complaints that he encouraged tourists, who failed to adapt as easily as he had, and he was often blamed for the rise in house prices caused by buyers of second homes. He was also accused of incessantly mining the same vein, to which he replied in a 2006 interview with the Telegraph: “It is a very rich vein and I haven’t even started to scrape the bottom of the barrel yet.” Yet Mayle was made a chevalier of the Légion d’honneur in 2002, and his love of his subject matter always shone through. He told another interviewer: “I’m very lucky. I really couldn’t be happier with my life ... oops, I’m getting smug again, forgive me.” Mayle’s first two marriages ended in divorce. He is survived by Jennie, and by three sons, Simon, Nicholas and Christopher, from his first marriage, to Pamela, and two daughters, Jane and Joanna, from his second marriage, to Nicola. • Peter Mayle, writer, born 14 June 1939; died 18 January 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/21/the-tale-review-stunning-sexual-abuse-drama-laura-dern","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T13:00:21Z","webTitle":"The Tale review – stunning sexual abuse drama is the mother of all #MeToo movies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/21/the-tale-review-stunning-sexual-abuse-drama-laura-dern","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/21/the-tale-review-stunning-sexual-abuse-drama-laura-dern","fields":{"headline":"The Tale review – stunning sexual abuse drama is the mother of all #MeToo movies","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I’ve attended the Sundance Film Festival for about a decade and, until now, there’s always been a constant. After a big premiere, the men’s room adjacent to the enormous Eccles Theater is brimming with chatter. As the credits rolled on Jennifer Fox’s The Tale there was stony silence. I’ve never seen anything like it - the hushed lavatory or, quite frankly, this film. The Tale rattled me in ways I didn’t know I still could be rattled. This deliberately paced, remarkable exploration about sexual abuse, consent and way we second-guess ourselves is the mother of all #MeToo movies. Perhaps if I knew going in that I would see (simulated) child molestation and hear the phrases predators use to lure children into thinking that their bond is “too pure for regular society to understand”, I would not have had such a visceral reaction. Would Jennifer Fox and company take it as a compliment if I told them that their movie almost made me throw up? Because it did, but only because this remarkable achievement is so damn effective. Fox has been making documentaries for 30 years, but this is her first scripted film. It is, however, an autobiography, or at least based on a kind of dialogue between the adult Fox (as played by Laura Dern) and the 13 year-old version of herself. As a child she wrote a short story (upon which this film is technically “based”), and at the time she claimed it was fiction. Encountering that story again “now” begins a long, serpentine road to a shocking realization: Fox was sexually molested as a pre-pubescent, even though she’s held those memories as part of her self-described bloom into a maturity. In the 35 intervening years Fox (and at this point it is hard to know if we’re talking about the actual Jennifer Fox or the version Dern plays) buried herself in her work, often on the subject of sexual abuse and female empowerment. She’s first nudged to reflection when Fox’s mother (Ellen Burstyn) finds the old story from her eighth grade creative writing class. In it, she describes her two mentors: “Mrs. G” (Elizabeth Debicki), a strict, married trainer from a horse camp, and her lover Bill (Jason Ritter), a running coach. Fox was an introspective child in a busy home with numerous siblings, so began spending weekends on the ranch. “Mrs. G.” and Bill bond with the younger version of Jennifer (Isabelle Nélisse), but soon red flags appear. There are many overlapping threads and timelines. Common has a small but essential role as Jennifer’s current and very supportive boyfriend, to whom Jennifer argues that she is not now nor has she ever been a victim. This is where The Tale treads into some daring and unusual waters. It’s not as if the movie states that a 13 year-old girl has the capacity to engage in a mature, intimate relationship with a nearly 40 year-old man. But it does offer the basis for that argument to be made – even if it is something of a head-fake. One of of Fox’s many skilled stylistic moves is when we first “see” the 13 year-old Jennifer. Jennifer “remembers” her as much more physically developed (and played by a more mature actress). Only when she’s shown an actual photograph does the film shift gears and introduce Jennifer as the kid she truly was. The Tale is a difficult film. I’ll confess I wasn’t all that with it during much of the first half. I thought it meandered, over-explained things and I found the relationship between Dern and Burstyn a bit phony. This was, I now realize, setting the stage for the fireworks of the second half. Then there’s also the scenes of what young Jennifer called lovemaking, but everyone else in the world will call rape. A closing title card assures that stunt doubles were used, and while there is no nudity, these scenes are extremely uncomfortable. Fox shoots Nélisse’s face in close-up during the act, and though I do believe in the power of art and storytelling if the artist has the goods, for some this will be a bridge too far. Jason Ritter’s Bill is never crass. His character’s make-believe openness (or who knows, maybe it was real openness) is part of what makes him appealing at first to young Jennifer. Yet, I must warn that some of the dialogue he has during these sure-to-be-controversial scenes turned me ice cold. I can’t repeat the lines in this review, not because they are vulgar, but more because I can’t handle them coming out of my fingertips. Not when I associate them with the close-up reaction shots Fox uses. I want more people to see The Tale because it’s such an innovative, honest and important film. It is a landmark, and Laura Dern is absolutely extraordinary. But I know for certain I’ll never watch it again. The Tale premieres on HBO in the US on 26 May with a UK date yet to be announced"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/21/julie-fowlisceltic-connections-festival-review-glasgow","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T11:55:13Z","webTitle":"Julie Fowlis/Celtic Connections gala review – Gaelic song in full force","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/21/julie-fowlisceltic-connections-festival-review-glasgow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/21/julie-fowlisceltic-connections-festival-review-glasgow","fields":{"headline":"Julie Fowlis/Celtic Connections gala review – Gaelic song in full force","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"‘Because this is happening in a Gaelic song,” jokes Julie Fowlis, “we know it won’t end well.” Fowlis wears her tradition lightly and deeply. It’s a pivot that comes with assurance; the Gaelic singer/multi-instrumentalist is a seasoned TV presenter, a poster girl for Gaelic culture, a bonafide trad music star whose slick fifth studio album, Alterum, has just been released. Nothing to prove here. On Alterum, Fowlis explores supernatural places and spaces – an orphic world of selkies, kelpies and whispering birds. And, like everything at her Celtic Connections show, she treats the theme with a gentle touch. Her voice is flawless, glossy and just a bit breathy. A Gaelic version of Paul McCartney’s Blackbird comes across as inescapably fey, but elsewhere the sound is edgier. “I’ll do something radical now,” she says. “I’ll sing in the other language.” A stripped-back Americana version of Anne Briggs’s Go Your Way gives her warble a touch of Emmylou Harris. Fowlis can sing like a diva, but she keeps it sweet. For the opening number – a beautiful seal song from North Uist – her voice sits softly against harmonium drones and spare fiddles. Her band features two guitars, two fiddles (the excellent Patsy Reid and Duncan Chisholm), bass, reedy keys and, wisely, no drums. It sounds classy, spacious, understated and warm. Nothing breaks the mould: the harmonies are safe and the arrangements don’t do anything dangerous. Fowlis is a thoughtful, supremely capable frontwoman who stays in her comfort zone, and listening to her perform is a congenial way to spend an evening. Celtic Connections turns 25 this year. The folk festival that began as a big-hearted gathering during the dreichest month in the UK’s dreichest city is now a sprawling international jamboree, full of TV cameras and industry showcase events. The initial emphasis on the Celtic has arguably shifted to the connections, with a rostrum of commercial acts whose pure folk credentials are tangential. It’s a sign of a genre that is robust enough to test the form and flex with the times. The soul of the thing is still there, amply, if you know where to look, but to judge by the opening concert alone you’d think folk music had lost its voice. The anniversary gala two days earlier was like an outsized schools concert, three-and-a-half interminable hours of innocuous, self-congratulatory navel gazing that seemed rudderless and largely disengaged with sociopolitical matters. On trooped pipe band Tryst to play something rousing and unmemorable; on traipsed Glasgow indie star Louis Abbott to sing of breakups and bleeding radiators. Given the state of the world, and the historic force of folk music to articulate the lives of the underprivileged and the disenfranchised, this gala seemed an epic missed opportunity to renew a mission statement for the genre. Folk has a relevance beyond couthy shoutouts to your gran and hackneyed quotes from Loch Lomond. Highlights included a gracious account of The Unquiet Grave from Siobhan Miller and Kris Drever and a slow, simple waulking song delivered with unfussy grace by a young group called Sian. But a gender problem prevails. Yes, the evening opened with a female piper (Robyn McKay) and featured a couple of terrific female supergroups (the fierce-spirited Cherish the Ladies and the infectiously convivial fiddlers String Sisters), but women enjoyed an average stage ratio of around 1:13. Here’s hoping integration doesn’t take another 25 years. • Celtic Connections festival is at various venues in Glasgow until 4 February. Box office: 0141-353 8000.

So to catch you up to speed in case you never heard it, here goes: Lizzie Borden took an axe, gave her mother forty whacks. When she saw what she had done, she gave her father forty-one. The resultant mess from this bit of New England gothic folklore are some of the first images in this gripping, well-acted and sharply-written low-budget drama. We then flash back six months, just enough time for Macneill to get audiences … well, I won’t exactly say cheering for the eventual act of violence, but at least understanding. The Borden House is one of the wealthiest in their small Massachusetts town. Though it’s 1892, Andrew (Jamey Sheridan) has yet to have set up electric lights. “Father prefers it in the dark,” Lizzie says to a gossipy women when she goes out – unescorted! – to the theater one night. Lizzie, a marvelous role for the abundantly talented Chloe Sevigny, is gasping for breath in that house, but her father is strict and her stepmother (Fiona Shaw) and older sister Emma (Kim Dickens) do little for her desire to be independent. Lizzie suffers from occasional fainting spells, and that’s all the excuse one needs for a woman to be considered unfit to make any of her own decisions. Quite frankly, the women with no illnesses don’t seem to fare much better. “We live in this world and not another,” a character later says about the preposterous idea that two women in love could ever live together on their own. That woman is the new maid, Bridget (Kristen Stewart). Fresh from Ireland, she’s immediately dubbed “Maggie”, just to keep things simple. Lizzie, however, calls her by her real name, then starts teaching her to read. Just as Bridget gets into the rhythm of her work, Andrew suggests she keep her door open at night to let the air circulate. He proceeds to climb the stairs and, grotesquely, encourages her to “be a sweet girl”. There is no way for Bridget to refuse his advances. The main stretch of Lizzie is a slow burn, showcasing the many insidious ways the cruel abuses of power (patriarchal power, specifically) can break the human spirit. When Lizzie and Bridget finally share an intimate moment it is one of the few glimpses of tenderness in an otherwise brutal film. But it just spells further doom for these two characters. If the Borden murders went the way portrayed here, well, you’ve got to hand it to Lizzie for thinking it through. I’m not saying it’s right to hack your father’s face past all recognisability, but if you were going to do it, and in an era before you could watch CSI, her scheme was certainly the way to go. Whether you want to applaud when the deed is finally done is entirely up to you. One thing’s for certain: Sevigny has been ripe for a juicy role like this for some time. It’s a shame she doesn’t get more opportunities. I noticed that Sevigny herself was the first listed producer for the film. Lizzie Borden, if she were to somehow come back as a Hollywood producer, would probably get a kick out of that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/21/man-arrested-after-eight-year-old-stabbed-to-death-near-walsall","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T16:49:55Z","webTitle":"Girl stabbed to death near Walsall named as Mylee Billingham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/21/man-arrested-after-eight-year-old-stabbed-to-death-near-walsall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/21/man-arrested-after-eight-year-old-stabbed-to-death-near-walsall","fields":{"headline":"Girl stabbed to death near Walsall named as Mylee Billingham","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A man has been arrested after an eight-year-old girl was stabbed to death near Walsall, West Midlands police said. Officers were called to an address in Brownhills at about 9.15pm on Saturday and found the girl, named by police as Mylee Billingham, with serious injuries. She was taken to hospital and died a short time later. A 54-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder. He was treated in hospital for a stab wound to his stomach. Police said on Sunday morning that he was in a stable condition and would be questioned in due course. A neighbour, Graham Greatrex, 74, told how he helped comfort Mylee’s mother after the schoolgirl was discovered badly wounded. He said: “I just offered her a warm drink because it was a bitterly cold night. “She was in shock.” On Sunday the home was being searched by forensics experts. The house is believed to belong to the local authority and is one of a row of terraced bungalows in the street. Greatrex said that a man had lived there for the past six months after the previous occupier, a woman, had died. But he said he did not know the current occupant. He added: “It was a bit of a shock. You can’t imagine it happening on our doorstep, especially when it’s a little girl.” DI Jim Colclough, from the homicide unit, said: “We are treating this as a domestic incident and are not looking for anyone else in connection with the child’s death. Our family liaison team are supporting the family of the little girl, who are naturally devastated by her death. Our thoughts remain with them.” Bob Weir, 72, lives two doors away from the bungalow where the stabbing happened. He said a middle-aged man had lived at the now sealed-off property, apparently on his own. The pensioner told reporters: “I didn’t hear until this morning what it was and I was absolutely shocked – I didn’t know the bloke who lived there and he hadn’t lived there long, maybe six months, if that. “There were police cars both sides of the road, ambulances ... all sorts. I thought it was something to do with drugs. I didn’t know there were any kids in there. I thought he just lived on his own. I never saw a girl or a woman there.” Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: “I only knew the guy to say hello to and I think he was married and was living there on his own. I didn’t hear anything before the police got here. “It’s really sad. This is not the sort of area where you hear of anybody being stabbed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/22/labor-warns-of-sydney-road-toll-hikes-as-transurban-circles-westconnex","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T17:00:26Z","webTitle":"Labor warns of Sydney road toll hikes as Transurban circles WestConnex","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/22/labor-warns-of-sydney-road-toll-hikes-as-transurban-circles-westconnex","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/22/labor-warns-of-sydney-road-toll-hikes-as-transurban-circles-westconnex","fields":{"headline":"Labor warns of Sydney road toll hikes as Transurban circles WestConnex","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The New South Wales opposition has asked the competition regulator to intervene in the forthcoming privatisation of WestConnex, warning a successful bid by toll road giant Transurban risks creating a near-monopoly on Sydney’s motorways and higher tolls for consumers. Transurban already owns the majority of tollways in Sydney, including NorthConnex, the M5 South-West, the M2, the Lane Cove tunnel, the Eastern Distributor and the Cross City tunnel. It is the biggest toll road company in Australia, commanding a 73% share of tolls across the country and is widely regarded as the frontrunner to win WestConnex, the nation’s largest road infrastructure project. Last August the NSW government announced the sale of 51% of the Sydney Motorway Corporation (which is in charge of financing WestConnex) and hoped to raise $5bn from the sale of the majority share. The sale was scheduled to be completed mid year. The NSW’s shadow minister for transport, Jodi McKay, wrote to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission last week asking it to take “a close interest” in the forthcoming sale and also in the fate of the government owned E-toll company, which she believes is also on the sale block. While McKay acknowledged toll roads don’t necessarily compete for traffic, she said the creation of a near monopoly in operating toll roads would reduce the incentives to lower tolls and keep them in place for as short a time as possible. “The damage to consumers could be substantial as toll roads developers should be faced with strong competition to ensure that tolls are as low as they possibly can be and that the length of a tolling concession is as short as it can possibly be,” she said. McKay also argued in her letter that having a monopoly in place would put Transurban in the box seat for future toll roads. She said the NSW government had awarded Transurban the $3bn NorthConnex project without tender as an unsolicited bid because it accepted Transurban’s argument the project was unique. This was because Transurban already owned nearby toll roads which could be used to finance the project. “With the NorthConnex precedent in mind, I am concerned that should Transurban acquire control of the SMC then its position in the market to secure, without competition, future toll roads that may be developed in Sydney in the decades to 2060 may be so strong as to be anti-competitive.” McKay said a monopoly or near monopoly over toll roads, which would last for 40 to 50 years, was not healthy by anyone’s standards. McKay raised concerns about the future of the government-owned E-toll company, which she believed could become part of the sale process. The other three brands of electronic tags – Linkt, Roam and E-way – are either owned by Transurban or by companies in which Transurban has a stake. “Should E-toll be sold to Transurban, then consumers would be faced with a market defined by the absence of meaningful competition,” she said. The Australian Financial Review reported that Transurban was part of consortium that also includes AustralianSuper and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. It said Transurban was the frontrunner to win WestConnex. Other confirmed bidders are Netflow, which brings together the Cintra/Plenary Group and has backing from Canadian institutional investors. IFM Investors, a company which invests on behalf of several major international pension funds and 27 Australian superannuation funds, was also said to be interested. But other companies with interests in infrastructure investment are said to be circling. The $16.8bn WestConnex project comprises 33km of new and upgraded roadway and tunnel, and is designed to improve connections between the city’s east and west. A 2016 paper by the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics warned of the dangers of concentration in the tollway market. “In recent years, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission approved a series of acquisitions by Transurban on the grounds that there is adequate competition from non-toll roads and public transport, and that state governments have powers to regulate the industry,” they noted. “There are signs that concentration in the Australian toll road operators industry will remain high for the foreseeable future. Lack of competition among toll road operators may not be desirable from the viewpoint of the efficiency of the industry over the long run,” they said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/11/readers-recommend-playlist-your-songs-about-dares","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T12:00:20Z","webTitle":"Readers recommend playlist: your songs about dares","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/11/readers-recommend-playlist-your-songs-about-dares","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/11/readers-recommend-playlist-your-songs-about-dares","fields":{"headline":"Readers recommend playlist: your songs about dares","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Here is this week’s playlist – songs picked by a reader from your suggestions on last week’s callout. Thanks for taking part. Read more about how our weekly series works at the end of the piece. What is the impulse that drives people to take up a dare – or issue one, for that matter? To begin our playlist, we wonder whether it starts early, as a way to discover and test our parents’ boundaries. As the aptly named Mischief Brew point out, in Children Play With Matches, that can soon escalate into a parent’s nightmare. Taking up a dare can become addictive, they say. Paul Westerberg seems to have reached that point in the Replacements’ I Will Dare: “Now, I don’t care, meet me tonight / If you will dare, I will dare”. Bold, that. Speaking of being bold, Max Koffler sings on the Boldest Cats that: “Elephants are afraid of mice / Is that proof greatness does not depend on size? / The boldest is who tries / And dares to fail.” As proof of that axiom I give you two tiny women with a huge presence. First, watch Esperanza Spalding effortlessly wield a bass about twice her size on Funk the Fear: “Why don’t we seize the day / And frost it in our own way?” Hmm, sound advice. And possibly even tinier, Pat Benatar has put her player boyfriend on notice. You think you’ve got what it takes to break my heart? C’mon, “Hit Me With Your Best Shot”. Yeah, I’m putting my money on Pat. Around the turn of the century, Ursula Rucker took a look around the hip-hop scene and also had the urge to put the players on notice. If bling is all ya got, get out of the way. It’s time to bring more to the table. Ursula lays down the dare and points the way in What??? “Across The Lines / Who would dare to go,” is perhaps still the challenge least answered in the US, my home country. Tracy Chapman’s sadly perfect lament is tearfully prescient. It seems we haven’t moved that far down a saner path in the 30 years since this was released. You can’t say Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash didn’t warn us. “Speak out against the madness / You got to speak your mind if you dare,” because it’s gonna be a Long Time Gone. Maybe we should just live our lives as one big dare. It worked for Bo Diddley: everything is a dare in Who Do You Love? – even that question to Arlene. Perhaps a dare is a way to discover yourself. Following your own path, and being true to it, can lead to great things – as the Robert Glasper Experiment extol in I Stand Alone. Finding out you can stand by yourself is very liberating, and indeed a path worth pursuing. “Do something even if it’s wrong!” My uncle would shout those words whenever he caught you wallowing or stuck in your life. I understand now he meant that much good can happen with action and very little with inaction. “Get up off the floor” as Switchfoot sing in Dare You to Move. Finally, when “you’ve pushed the other guys too far” it’s good to know you have someone to watch your back. Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys wrote Don’t Worry Baby after pretty much daring himself he could make it the follow-up hit for the Ronettes’ Be My Baby.

Police and army forces were deployed in several cities, including Tebourba, 20 miles (30km) west of the capital, Tunis, where hundreds of young people took to the streets after the funeral of a 45-year-old man who died in the unrest on Monday night. Police have insisted they did not kill the man, who they say had a chronic respiratory condition. The results of an autopsy have not been made public. Clashes erupted in more than 20 towns and cities late on Tuesday, including the southern city of Gafsa and in Sidi Bouzid, the cradle of the protests that led to the ousting of Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011 and sparked the regional Arab spring uprisings. Young people blocked roads and hurled stones, causing the police to retaliate with teargas, according to an AFP reporter on the ground in Sidi Bouzid. In Tunis, a crowd stormed a Carrefour market. The protests broke out after activists and politicians denounced increases in VAT and the introduction of social contributions at the start of the year as a tough new budget was implemented. A year ago, the government agreed to a four-year loan programme with the International Monetary Fund worth about $2.8bn in return for economic reforms. Protests have become common in Tunisia in January, the anniversary of the 2011 revolt, which was sparked by the death of Mohamed Bouazizi, a street seller who set himself on fire in a protest over unemployment and police harassment. While Tunisia is widely seen as the only democratic success story among the nations where Arab spring uprisings took place, it has since had nine governments, none of which has been able to tackle growing economic problems. About 50 police were wounded in clashes and 237 people were arrested on Tuesday, said an interior ministry spokesman, Khelifa Chibani. Among the arrested were two radical Islamists who had helped storm a police station in Nefza town, he said. Heythem Guesmi, of Manich Msamahm (I Will Not Forgive), said the activist group was calling for justice over the death in Tebourba and a return to the aims of the 2011 revolution. He said the new budget “has made the rich richer and the poor poorer. By increasing taxes and the cost of such basic items as flour, telephone bills and internet access, they’ve risked families’ food security. Prices have increased, but incomes have remained at the very lowest level.” Another activist, Wael Naouar, from the What Are We Waiting For? movement, called for the 2018 budget to be withdrawn. Callum Redfern, a Tunis-based British multimedia journalist who travelled to Tebourba on hearing about the person who died there, said: “My impression is that this [anger] has been building up for years. In Tunis, it’s all pretty well controlled … The further you get from Tunis the wilder it gets.” Chibani said “criminals” had looted and burned security centres, torched police cars and attacked government offices. “They blocked roads and carried out robberies in many cities, he said. “Obviously these are not protests but theft and damage to public and private property.” The prime minister, Youssef Chahed, said on Tuesday that his government respected the right to protest but recent demonstrations had descended into “acts of vandalism, looting and violence against citizens”. “We are in a democracy, and those who want to protest can do it during the day, not at night,” said Chahed, who heads a coalition of Islamist and secular parties. The demonstrations have so far been smaller than others in recent years, but the confrontations between the government, labour unions, Islamists and secular forces that led to the 2011 revolt also started on a small scale. Analysts say Chahed could amend some of his reforms. Pressure from unions has already led to an agreement to increase public sector salaries and avoid layoffs. The government plans to offer voluntary redundancies to cut the bloated civil service, but a rise in petrol prices and social security contributions are hard for people to swallow after years of hardship. “At the time of Ben Ali, which we did not like, I filled my stand with vegetables, fruits and other items with 10 dinars, and now 50 dinars do not fill this gap. The situation has worsened dramatically,” said Fatma, a market trader in Tunis. “The government is sacrificing the poor and the middle class by raising prices and ignoring tax evaders and businessmen,” she said. Olfa Lamloum, from the peacebuilding charity International Alert, said that with municipal elections due later this year, authorities faced a difficult choice. “The economic factor is central: unemployment, the cost of living and inflation, poverty, precariousness of labour – and loss of hope. The governing majority have two options: either intensify the repression ... which has a high electoral cost for them, or make concessions, which would be [unpopular] with the international donors,” Lamloum said. Europe is concerned about stability in Tunisia partly because unemployment there has forced many young Tunisians to go abroad. The number of boats smuggling migrants to Italy has been rising and Tunisia has also produced significant numbers of recruits for Islamic State. Two Molotov cocktails were thrown at the entrance of a Jewish school on the tourist resort island of Djerba, in an attack blamed on assailants exploiting a reduced security presence because police were busy elsewhere. Tunisia, which is predominantly Muslim, has a Jewish minority of fewer than 1,800 people.

Helena Maleno and her Walking Borders NGO have, over the past few years, fielded distress calls from people crossing from north Africa, passing on their details and locations to the Spanish coastguard so they can be rescued. On Wednesday, after an adjournment last month, Maleno, who has been based in Morocco for 15 years, appeared in a court in Tangier to give evidence. After testifying for almost two hours, she was told to return on 31 January when the judge would question her over the material submitted by her lawyers. She has repeatedly said that trying to save the lives of people crossing the Mediterranean is not a crime. Spanish police began an investigation into Maleno’s activities in 2012 but the case against her was shelved by the country’s high court last April on the grounds that her actions did not constitute a criminal offence. Maleno says Spanish police have passed their investigation on to the Moroccan authorities who, she claims, have tapped her phones. “I’m out of court,” she tweeted on Wednesday afternoon. “I’ve testified and the judge has recognised my work as ‘humanitarian labour’ and noted that the accusation is blatantly from the [Central Unit of the Network for Illegal Immigration and False Documents] of the Spanish national police.” Maleno said in December that there was no logic to the proceedings as both the Spanish and Moroccan police had acknowledged that she had never profited at any time despite being accused of being a people trafficker. Maleno is being supported by NGOs and politicians. The Spanish branch of Doctors of the World tweeted: “People like Helena Maleno dignify this world by saving lives. Her commitment to defending human rights helps us keep our faith in humanity.” Maribel Mora, a Podemos senator, tweeted: “All those of us who want a more just society, where the respect for human rights is guaranteed, must today defend [Helena Maleno]. No person is illegal and defending human dignity can never be a crime.” The anti-austerity party plans to petition King Felipe of Spain to intervene in the case. “We want to ask the king of Spain – who, as we know, gets on well with the Moroccan authorities – to step in or show some concerns so that Helena can get back to her daily work as an activist,” a Podemos MP told the online newspaper eldiario.es. More than 200 prominent Spanish figures – including the actors Javier Bardem and Eduardo Noriega – have also signed a petition in support of Maleno. Speaking in December, Maleno said: “I am calm and I am strong because I know that all I have done is defend the right to life of people who cross borders … I want to thank all those people in Spain and around the world who have supported me in these complicated and difficult days.” The case had drawn parallels with the measures faced by human rights activists working to help migrants and refugees elsewhere in Europe. Last February, a French farmer who helped African migrants cross the border from Italy and provided them with shelter, was given a suspended €3,000 (£2,660) fine for aiding illegal arrivals. In August last year, Italian police seized a rescue ship operated by German NGO Jugend Rettet as part of an Italian attempt to end the Mediterranean migrant and refugee crisis. According to the International Organisation for Migration, 21,468 migrants and refugees arrived in Spain by sea in 2017, with 223 people dying as they made the crossing. The number of arrivals had more than tripled on the previous year, when 6,046 people reached Spain and 128 people died en route."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/10/mexican-scrambled-egg-overload-and-other-reasons-why-i-hate-celebrity-diet-books","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T16:49:45Z","webTitle":"Mexican scrambled egg overload – and other reasons why I hate celebrity diet books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/10/mexican-scrambled-egg-overload-and-other-reasons-why-i-hate-celebrity-diet-books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/10/mexican-scrambled-egg-overload-and-other-reasons-why-i-hate-celebrity-diet-books","fields":{"headline":"Mexican scrambled egg overload – and other reasons why I hate celebrity diet books","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The annual glut of diet books are pretty formulaic. Take an established star, preferably one who has recently lost weight, and get them to create a diet plan based on their “journey”. Dishes are cut from a standard list of “stuff considered healthy these days”, so be prepared for endless incarnations of avocado, a recipe for Mexican scrambled eggs, and a dizzying array of spiralised vegetables. Most present a complex set of rules and restrictions, with recipes so aspirational and unrealistic for everyday living that most people will fail. It moves from something that happens to you, to something you can buy with enough effort. Modern diet books are the wet dream of neoliberalism, with a side serving of courgetti. Many people struggle with their weight, so perhaps I should not knock these books. For some they may provide a lifeline. But consider this: although many dieters will manage to lose weight in the short term, for the vast majority it will end in failure. Studies have shown that most people will regain any weight they have lost within four years. To make matters worse, in long-term behaviour and attitude studies, dieting, food avoidance and restricted eating in normal weight children are some of the strongest predictors of weight gain in adulthood. A large twin study in Finland found that normal-weight individuals who engage in restrictive dieting behaviours are more likely to gain weight than those who don’t. And just think about the US, a country with one of the highest rates of obesity in the world, yet one where 80% of 10-year-old girls have been on a diet. Restrictive dieting is often seen as a solution to the problem of obesity, but it is tempting to surmise it may actually be one of the causes. Still, it does shift a few books every January. Here’s a few of this year’s ... Lisa Riley’s Honesty Diet: Change Your Life in Eight Days I never thought there would be much common ground between Lisa Riley and Kate Moss, but during the long-winded cod-psychology introduction to Lisa’s “honesty diet”, she actually says “feeling this good every day makes me a million times happier than any cake ever could”. This seems frighteningly close to Kate Moss’s “nothing tastes as good as skinny feels”. Of course, when a supermodel says it, it is the subject of much derision. But apparently, because Riley has been overweight in the past, things are different. Riley seems to think that all you need is self-belief, determination and a recipe for Mexican scrambled eggs. She is also at pains to point out that you need to be honest with yourself. You must realise that being fat is your fault, and start feeling guilty. Feel guilty about sharing food with friends, eating at a party, eating after 6.30pm or eating on holiday. What you really need to make your life better is a complex set of eating rules. Why not start with eight days of brutal calorie restriction, followed by a lifetime of denial and control. The food is predictable. I can only assume there is a factory somewhere, churning out recipes for smashed avocado, quinoa salads and vegetable frittatas. All are seemingly dumped into this book, with no clue as to their inspiration. Riley believes that she is now “the best version of herself” and happy that she no longer “takes up excess space”. It saddens me that a much-loved actor and presenter only feels validated now she has reached an aesthetically driven weight-loss goal. The newspapers who spent years bullying her about her weight should really hang their heads in shame. It is also troubling that Riley cannot imagine that weight might be a different battle for others than it was for her. What she sells as “tough love” comes across as compassionless bullying, all from someone who should know better. She does little more than tell fat people to eat less and move more, which is akin to telling someone falling from a building to move slower and try to bounce. Charlotte Crosby’s 30-Day Blitz Charlotte Crosby really wants you to blitz things. With this in mind, the former reality TV star has created a 30-day blitz, although the desired outcome of this is not made clear. Given that it involves eating only 1,500 calories a day, I assume she wants you to lose weight. Thirty days at 1,500 calories will cause significant weight loss, and if Crosby has fans that don’t have weight to lose, it might be wise to explain how dangerous this could be. Another clue about the nature of the plan comes from a clever hashtag Crosby created when she detailed parts of her “blitz” on social media. #FOF stands for Fuck Off Fat. If there is anyone left on Instagram who doesn’t hate their body enough, now there is actually a hashtag to help you swear at it. The 30-day aspect of the Blitz is not just an arbitrary figure to help sell books. Crosby explains: “I read on the internet that breaking a habit takes 21 days, so that’s why I made this book 30 days.” No cheating or drinking is allowed when you are blitzing, which is a shame, because I think I might need a large scotch if I had to spend 30 days with Crosby. I would also have to pluck and dye my eyebrows on day five as part of a “face blitz”, which I might need to be drunk to contemplate. When it comes to the recipes, they are standard fare, regurgitated almost verbatim from last year’s clean-eating craze. Mexican scrambled eggs are there, of course. Coconut oil, gluten-free flour, green smoothies and spiralised vegetables abound, with no explanation as to why. When talking about her ambitions for the future, Crosby gives the game away some more, perhaps revealing something of her true self. “I’d quite like to learn Chinese,” she comments “because it’s my favourite takeaway.” That Crosby seems a lot more fun to be around. Joe Wicks The Fat-Loss Plan Joe Wicks’s puppy-like enthusiasm makes me nauseous. For those not aware of his work, he is the ripped love child of Jamie Oliver and Russell Brand, famous for short, web-based videos where he bounds, spaniel-like, up to the camera and yells the name of various ingredients. Apparently he has sold 2m books, yet I cannot imagine a single human person to which he would have any appeal. Still, at least in book form I can contemplate his message minus the nightmarish videos and constant repetition of words like “bosh”. There are actually parts of his content to be admired. He is against weighing scales and calorie counting. He doesn’t encourage sudden weight loss. He allows people to consume carbohydrates occasionally. He lists a hundred different recipes, some of which are creative and genuinely interesting. That said, “new healthy” standards abound. Avocados with everything. Daily smoothies. Spiralised veg, just in case you might accidentally enjoy some pasta. And his version of Mexican scrambled eggs. Coconut oil is ubiquitous, yet with no explanation as to why you should use something overpriced, full of saturated fat and with a tendency to make everything taste of suncream. Even in book form, Wicks is uniquely irritating. Insisting broccoli is called “midget trees” in every recipe, is not the behaviour of a grown man. And although weighing yourself is seen as old fashioned, dietary success is assessed by how good people look in underwear selfies, which hardly seems like progress. Despite claims that he rejects the one-size-fits-all diet approach, this book offers just that. There are rules, restrictions and forbidden items. It prescribes when and how you should eat. It sells itself as something new, yet it is a diet plan as old as the hills. Just packaged up with abs and a winning smile. Wicks is now very much a culinary superstar. The exercise plans on which his initial fame was founded are now a footnote at the end of the book. Without the energy and animation of his videos, they provide some brief amusement. In many, he has the look of a man doing a particularly ostentatious poo, quite appropriate in a book with so many recipes for cauliflower rice. Bosh. Tom Kerridge Lose Weight for Good – Full-Flavour Cooking for a Low-Calorie Diet I write about diets, and regularly attack diet culture, but have had a level of cognitive dissonance when it comes to Tom Kerridge. Kerridge is a full on chef-crush of mine, and the Hand and Flowers in Marlow serves food of rare beauty and honesty. So in the past, I have cheerfully attempted to ignore his forays into weight-loss literature, which were inspired by his own considerable reduction in girth. It is quite clear that Kerridge’s weight loss was due to a number of lifestyle changes (his drinking was legendary within the industry, and is one of the things he gave up). It is also clear that diet played a part. But when anyone writes about diet from the perspective of their own weight-loss journey, I get nervous. We are all different, in lifestyle, genetics and psychology. What is effective, healthy and realistic for one, might be the opposite for someone else. Often this is hard for people writing diet books to grasp. That said, there is much to admire in this book. Kerridge is a chef of rare talent, and it is clear that he has approached cooking low-calorie food with everything in his culinary arsenal. He aims for maximum flavour, and attempts to make portions as large as possible. I admire the approach, which even embraces low-calorie sweeteners, and the recipes are genuinely inspiring in places. Dishes such as his pot roast topside or rainbow trout with braised fennel would grace any cookbook, healthy or otherwise. But I am more troubled by what the book does not say than what it does. Kerridge cut carbs from his diet to lose weight, an approach that clearly worked for him, but will be unlikely to suit everyone. Throughout the book, pasta and rice are replaced with cauliflower and random spiralisations, producing poor facsimiles of the dishes they should be. Potatoes, an ingredient that the Hand and Flowers is famous for doing sublime things to, are conspicuous by their absence. Carbohydrates are being silently demonised, even though for many people they can form part of a healthy diet. This is a great shame, in an otherwise thoughtful set of recipes. I even forgive him for including a spiced scrambled eggs recipe (Cajun this time). Gordon Ramsay’s Ultimate Fit Food Whatever you might think of his public persona, for anyone who has ever worn a set of whites, Ramsay’s reputation as a chef is beyond reproach. No one has done more to put the UK on the culinary map, both in the creation of many wonderful eating places, and the mentoring of our finest culinary talents. That said, he somehow managed to miss the memo on Mexican scrambled eggs, and instead includes something called a Mexican fruit salad, which seems remarkably like a regular fruit salad with a bit of chilli powder. The refreshing thing about this book is that there is at least some acceptance that not everyone who wants to eat healthily does so because they need to lose weight. There are three categories of recipe: healthy, lean and fit. All have different nutritional breakdowns, and frustratingly for me, it is hard to argue with. Ramsay has a money machine driving his every move, and clearly they have worked hard to produce a book that it is hard to pick nutritional holes in. It is very much Ramsay’s take on standard healthy eating messages, with very little nutritional nonsense. It even avoids excessive demonisation of carbohydrates. That said, the inclusion of chia seed pudding and quinoa porridge is baffling. If he finds these so delicious, I would challenge him to include them on one of his restaurant menus. Or publically eat some without gagging. I have tried a number of chia seed puddings, and they do not deserve to be described as food. It is hard to find much in this book that feels personal to Ramsay himself. The food is vibrant, bright and heavily influenced by California, yet the text is bland and formulaic. For a chef with such personality, it is remarkable how this can occur. It feels as if it has been written by committee, rather than being a work of a passionate individual. And underlying it all is the idea that if we eat like millionaires living in LA, we shall become them. Our lives will be carefree, thin and bursting with activity, if only we have a crispy tofu wrap for lunch. This is the great myth of all branded diet books. They confuse the food with the lifestyle itself, and so ultimately disappoint. There is more separating you from Gordon Ramsay than a brown rice and sushi roll. Just Stop with the Diets It might be because I am genetically lean and have never had to worry about my weight, but I really hate diets. The true joy of food is in the way it helps us form social bonds, yet dieting seems to individualise what we eat and draw us into ourselves. This cuts us off from food’s great power, which seems to me the opposite of healthy. All I want to see is a book about eating well, getting some variety, and making food that warms the soul. Where nothing is demonised, there are no strict rules, and there is no need for guilt and shame. I would love to see simple accessible recipes that appreciate how not everyone can afford three avocados a day, or grass-fed organic beef each evening. Something that considers how damaging the demonisation of foods can be for people’s mental health, and understands that telling people they can lose weight if they just try harder, actually does more harm than good. Most of all, next January, I would like to see a book on the shelves that cares only about how healthy we are, instead of how much we weigh.

Scales from the wings of at least seven species were found in a sample of just 10g of sediment – the weight of a UK pound coin – and researchers believe there are “many, many more” to be identified. But as well as dating the flying insects to about 200m years ago, when they would have shared food with the early dinosaurs, the diaphanous, ridged golden-brown wing scales throw up another mystery. Some of the moths show signs of a proboscis, the protrusion scientists have long believed evolved alongside flowering plants to allow them the reach the nectar. The researchers now hypothesise that the proboscis was originally used to suck up tiny amounts of sticky sap which the plants produced to trap pollen, until flowering plants evolved tens of millions of years later. “[This] was most likely an evolutionary response to widespread heat and aridity during the Late Triassic period [before 200m years ago],” they said. The team excavated cores from beneath what was once a lagoon in Schandelah, northern Germany with the intention of examining the likely impacts of changes in oceans as rising carbon dioxide emissions are being absorbed, lowering oxygen. Because water in the lagoon would have allowed species much lower levels of oxygen than above, remains of algae, spores, pollen, fungi and plants have been well preserved. It was among these species that the wing-scales of tiny butterflies and moths were found. Since the find, other cores have been re-examined and at least one – from Luxembourg – revealed similar remains. Previously only one lepidoptera find of a similar age, dated to 190m years ago, had been found on the Dorset coast in England. “That confirms to us that we’re dealing with something real,” said Bas van de Schootbrugge at Utrecht University, one of the lead authors of the paper, published in Science Advances. “That suggests they were reasonably widespread.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/11/mackenzie-crook-druids-britannia-jez-butterworths-mad-masterpiece-tv-series","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T06:00:13Z","webTitle":"Giant squid and sexed-up druids: is Britannia Jez Butterworth's mad masterpiece?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/11/mackenzie-crook-druids-britannia-jez-butterworths-mad-masterpiece-tv-series","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/11/mackenzie-crook-druids-britannia-jez-butterworths-mad-masterpiece-tv-series","fields":{"headline":"Giant squid and sexed-up druids: is Britannia Jez Butterworth's mad masterpiece?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It is 43 AD. Britain. A young girl is on the verge of an initiation ceremony that will nudge her into adulthood via chanting, dancing and something nasty with a knife. Zoë Wanamaker as Antedia, warrior queen of a British clan, is magnificent in electric-blue eyeshadow and bird’s nest hair. A mysterious outcast from the druids is receiving signs – from the badgers and the frogs, among other authorities – that something in Albion is badly amiss. Mackenzie Crook, who has clearly spent hours in makeup, is listing and swaying menacingly, face caked with clay-coloured grime, high as a kite on some nameless drug. Crook, a cadaverous vision, is the druidic leader, Veran. Meantime, just over the Channel on the northern shore of Gaul, a Roman general is on the brink of invading Britain, surveying a bunch of foot soldiers who have expressed, let us say, reservations about crossing a (reputedly) giant-squid-filled ocean to take arms against a barbarous, terrifying land full of magic and human sacrifice. “What’s the punishment for mutiny, Lucius?” roars David Morrissey’s Aulus Plautius, as he pours himself a glass of finest Falernian (an action he repeats, with cloak-swirling dash, on multiple occasions). This is Britannia, a hugely fun, extremely violent, new series for Sky Atlantic about the Roman invasion of Britain – the second, successful one, by the emperor Claudius, rather than the unsuccessful, probably rather shambolic attempts made by Julius Caesar. Jez Butterworth, author of the hit plays Jerusalem and The Ferryman, co-writer of the James Bond movie Spectre, is behind the series, with fellow writers Tom Butterworth (his brother) and James Richardson. It is not the first time he has visited Roman Britain: there was, in 2007, a film called The Last Legion, described by Guardian film critic Peter Bradshaw as riper than “a hunk of old Brie, left all day in a glove compartment in a car” – proof that even a great writer is not immune to the occasional flop. Butterworth has made it clear in interviews that he is not too worried about historical accuracy: and why should he be? He is a storyteller, not a professor of classics. And he has long been enchanted by the myths of Britain, by its old gods and spirits – a preoccupation of Jerusalem, with its intimations of the uncanny and the numinous, the hint that the mythical British giants Gog and Magog might one day, quite soon, wake. And yet in one way, Britannia – marvellously preposterous as it frequently seems, with its lurid scenes of drugged up, orgiastic druidic rites – is firmly within a tradition of writing, thinking and fantasising about Roman Britain. This tradition was begun by the Romans themselves – the first people to conjure the idea of “Britain” into life through writing. The most compelling picture we have of the Celtic, iron age tribes of Britain, for example, comes from the way the Romans wrote about them. One such author, Julius Caesar, was writing from first-hand experience, though doubtless not without spin and certainly with prejudice. Another, Tacitus, perhaps the greatest of Roman historians, offered often cynical and piquant critiques of the exercise of Roman power in works that included a biography of his father-in-law, Gnaeus Julius Agricola, a governor of Britain for several years. We have, too, the writings of ordinary Roman officers, vivid snatches of real life in the form of letters and memos preserved from the late first century AD in the mud of northern England (the famous Vindolanda tablets, discovered in the 1970s and 1980s). So while Butterworth gives us warlike warrior queens in their chariots, it is the Romans who offered the first vivid accounts of such characters. Boudicca, according to Tacitus, ravaged and almost completely defeated the Roman forces in the 60s AD. (She wasn’t alone: the Yorkshire tribe of the Brigantes was also presided over by a queen, Cartimandua, who was friendly to the Romans.) And when Butterworth depicts the Britons as a shifty lot of argumentative, warring tribes, making alliances with the invaders when it suited them, that’s the picture we get from the Romans, too. One pretext for invading Britain was, according to the historian Cassius Dio, that a British potentate called Berikos had been expelled from Britain and sought asylum in Rome; Claudius was thus intervening to restore order, the kind of excuse for military action by a superpower that we might recognise from later eras. More important may have been the need for a big symbolic victory to shore up his reign’s shaky start: he had been installed on the imperial throne after his nephew, Caligula, was assassinated by his own elite bodyguard. By depicting the Britons as decidedly outlandish, if not a touch freakish, Butterworth has also developed a Roman literary trope – one rather undercut by recent archaeological evidence that suggests, at least in south-east Britain, a people strongly influenced by and connected to Roman Gaul, with elites enjoying Roman wine and Mediterranean figs. But in Roman literature, Britain is a byword for remoteness and peculiarity, both before its (partial) conquest and afterwards, when large tracts of it had become an artery in the complex system of bureaucracy, military might and trade that kept the Roman empire functioning. Somehow it always suited Rome to consider Britain as “quite cut off from the world”, as Virgil put it. Butterworth’s joke, in his opening scene, about Roman soldiers being afraid of giant squid in the seas around Britain is not so far from what was actually said. Tacitus wrote of the country’s bizarre currents and tides that nature behaved differently at the edge of the world. Depictions of druids form part of this exoticism. Caesar’s descriptions of this powerful people convey a picture of unimaginably superstitious creatures who sacrificed humans in strange wickerwork structures (yes, the origins of the “wicker man” are here). One can imagine scary passages giving readers, particularly those safely tucked up in Rome, a delicious frisson of distant danger. Pliny the Elder wrote: “Even today Britain practises magic in awe, with such grand ritual that it might seem that she gave it to the Persians.” The Britons and the Persians. Weirdos, the lot of them. One of the most intriguing characteristics of Roman writing was its ability to give voice, character and point of view to the empire’s bitterest foes. There is a strong sense (as ancient historian Greg Woolf has pointed out) that Tacitus, in his biography of his father-in-law Agricola, was creating a stage on which the governor could appear both heroic and, importantly, unbesmirched by the moral corruption of Rome itself. And so Tacitus gave Agricola adversaries worthy of him, such as the Caledonian chief Calgacus who, about to be defeated at the battle of Mons Graupius, delivers a speech to his troops containing the immortal line that the Romans “create a desert and call it peace”. There’s no evidence that Calgacus really did deliver such a speech. It seems highly unlikely and, even if he did, one can’t imagine how Tacitus would have accessed an accurate record of it. But the episode certainly scorches Calgacus into the mind: he is the first named character in the late-19th-century frieze of heroes that adorns the great hall of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, and the aphorism attributed to him has echoed down the ages. It is characters like this who are the ancestors of Kelly Reilly’s flame-haired, bow-and-arrow-wielding Kerra in Britannia. Butterworth is about to begin writing a second series. There is plenty of room for more. Rome’s conquest of Britain was always shaky and incomplete – the province was, Mary Beard has provocatively suggested, “Rome’s Afghanistan”, a long-term thorn in the side of its would-be masters. There are another 400 years of Romano-British history to go. Just as important for the writer, there are innumerable gaps in our knowledge – and that is the void into which the imagination of a writer may flow. Butterworth, with his psychedelic, spooky, sex-obsessed Britons, is not the first to try to fill it, nor will he be the last.

The troubled contractor – which has 20,000 UK staff and is an important supplier to the government, including a contract for work on the HS2 rail link – held crunch talks with its creditors on Wednesday to try to persuade them to back a rescue plan. The company ran into financial difficulties last year after issuing three profit warnings in five months and writing down more than £1bn from the value of contracts. It has debts of about £1bn and a £600m pension deficit, but a stock market value of just £100m after its shares collapsed 90%. Last week it emerged Carillion was being investigated by the Financial Conduct Authority over the “timeliness and content of announcements” made by the company between 7 December 2016 and 10 July 2017. The proposed refinancing is expected to involve its lenders swapping their debt for Carillion shares, which would leave existing investors with little or nothing. As part of the package, its pension fund or the pension protection fund could end up as a major shareholder. Lenders including HSBC, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, which saw the details of the restructuring proposals for the first time at Wednesday’s meeting, were not expected to rush into making an immediate decision. If no agreement can be reached, the company could be forced to seek emergency financial support from the government. This could take the form of an emergency loan, a repricing of some deals or the company handing back loss-making contracts. The Labour MP Jon Trickett told parliament: “Despite being investigated by FSA and with debts of £1.5bn Carillion remains a major supplier in terms of government procurement. If they were to collapse it would risk massive damage to a range of public services. “Does the government have a contingency plan for such an eventuality and what is the cost to the taxpayer?” Oliver Dowden, the Cabinet Office parliamentary secretary, replied: “We of course make contingency plans for all eventualities … Carillion is a major supplier to the government with a number of long-term contracts. We are committed to maintaining a healthy supply market and working closely with key suppliers.“Carillion’s operational performance has continued to be positive, for example they advanced their work on Crossrail over the Christmas period.” A government spokesperson said earlier: “The company has kept us informed of the steps it is taking to restructure the business. We remain supportive of their ongoing discussions with their stakeholders and await future updates on their progress.” The company, which employs 10,000 people overseas, has been working on the revamp of Battersea power station, Liverpool Football Club’s new main stand, and the £335m Royal Liverpool University hospital. It is the second largest supplier to Network Rail and maintains 50,000 homes for the Ministry of Defence, as well as running prisons. It came close to breaching the terms of its borrowings last month, but its lenders agreed to a four-month extension until the end of April. Before the meeting on Wednesday, a spokesperson for the company said: “Carillion is in constructive discussions with a broad range of stakeholders regarding its options to reduce net debt and recapitalise and/or restructure the group’s balance sheet. “The group is currently finalising its business plan, which … will provide the basis for the agreement of a proposal to restore Carillion’s balance sheet.” The company’s chief executive, Richard Howson, stepped down in July after the first profit warning. Its new boss, Andrew Davies, is due this month to take over from the interim chief executive, Keith Cochrane, three months earlier than planned. Carillion’s shares rose 8% to 22.6p on Wednesday on hopes it would reach an agreement on the refinancing. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2018/jan/16/doctors-uganda-warn-crisis-level-blood-shortage-risks-lives","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-16T06:30:17Z","webTitle":"Doctors in Uganda warn 'crisis level' blood shortage is putting lives at risk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jan/16/doctors-uganda-warn-crisis-level-blood-shortage-risks-lives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/jan/16/doctors-uganda-warn-crisis-level-blood-shortage-risks-lives","fields":{"headline":"Doctors in Uganda warn 'crisis level' blood shortage is putting lives at risk","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Uganda is grappling with a critical shortage of blood that is affecting services and putting patients’ lives at risk. The health ministry’s blood bank facility in the capital, Kampala, which stores and distributes supplies to hospitals, is practically empty. It has just 150 units of blood remaining, not enough to meet requirements on an average day in the city. Nationally, Uganda needs at least 340,000 units of safe blood annually, but usually only collects 200,000 a year. A six-day countrywide blood collection drive was launched by the ministry on Monday. The Uganda Medical Association, an umbrella organisation of doctors in public health facilities, said the shortage was “almost [at] crisis level”, resulting in the cancellation of hospital operations and prioritisation of cases. Mukuzi Muhereza, the association’s secretary-general, said: “It’s a big, nationwide problem. It’s emergency level, a crisis. Nearly every hospital is crying [out] for blood. Nearly every regional referral hospital is complaining about blood.” An extra 7 billion shillings (£1.4m) is needed to procure donor and testing kits, and to fund blood donation drives, to get the service back on track for the next six months. Sarah Opendi, state minister for health, said the extra money has been requested from the Ugandan government. She dismissed media reports that some patients have died after being unable to get blood transfusions. Last year, 14bn shillings was allocated to the national blood transfusion service and national medical stores. At least 21bn shillings was required, however. The health budget has been cut from 1,850tn shillings in the current financial year to 1,714tn in 2018-19. “What we are seeing with the blood crisis is synonymous with the rot in the healthcare delivery systems in the country. We do not seem to think ahead,” said Milly Katana, a public health specialist and HIV prevention campaigner. “The people responsible for the blood chain system must be brought to account for their offices and not simply sit and enjoy trips abroad where they go present papers.” Dennis Odwe, health and policy specialist at the Foundation for Integrated Rural Development, said government priorities did not align with the needs of Ugandans. “The blood bank, which should have more money to do its specialised work of collecting blood and saving lives, will be rendered useless by the budget cut … yet the demand for blood is very high in the country. “Blood is needed by mothers in the delivery wards, accident patients and other clients that go to the hospitals. Investing less in blood means losing lives, yet this is something government can have control over.” Opendi said it was up to everyone to donate blood. Existing blood drives are aimed at students, but anyone between the ages of 17 and 65 is eligible to donate. “What can we do? There is no factory for manufacturing blood,” said Opendi. It should be everybody’s responsibility to ensure that they turn up and donate blood wherever Uganda Blood Transfusion Services requests.” Muhereza said blood collections need to be decentralised to allow regional and district hospitals to do their own collections. “This is very possible … We have lab technology all over the country,” said Muhereza. “If you decentralise at source we can always encourage people to donate. But you can’t donate blood in Gulu when the blood transfusions services is in Kampala.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/14/kintu-jennifer-nansubuga-makumbi-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T12:00:26Z","webTitle":"Kintu by Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi review – hallucinatory history of Uganda","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/14/kintu-jennifer-nansubuga-makumbi-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/14/kintu-jennifer-nansubuga-makumbi-review","fields":{"headline":"Kintu by Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi review – hallucinatory history of Uganda","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"This epic about Uganda’s history from a debut author who grew up in the country and now lives in Manchester starts with a man beaten to death outside Kampala in 2004.

All of those drugs need to be authorised by the European Medicines Agency, which is moving from the UK to Amsterdam after Brexit. If there is no agreement struck that the EMA will remain the “marketing authorisation holder” for the UK, then there will be a fracture. All drugs made in the UK and going to the EU will need to be retested once exported, and vice versa. The process of tests on both sides of the Channel and Irish Sea will slow down the supply of new drugs on to the market. The EU has warned the pharma sector to rethink its supply chains, and make contingency plans. Seafarers The EU has said seafarers will not be allowed to use their UK certification to work on vessels going under the flags of the 27 EU member states, be they fishing boats, ferries or super-yachts. The development has alarmed the seafarers’ union, Nautilus International, which has demanded the UK government ensure that there are no barriers to British sailors’ employment. Haulage Long-haul lorry and coach drivers will no longer be able to rely on their UK certificate of professional competence and will need to obtain certification from one of the 27 member states if they want to continue to work across Europe, the European commission has warned. UK companies involved in transporting goods across the EU will also need to have a base on the continent or Ireland if they wish to continue to operate. Aviation In order to fly passengers and luggage on routes within the EU, a carrier must have its headquarters in an EU member state. For this reason, easyJet has established a headquarters in Austria. There are also ownership strictures. A carrier must be majority-owned or effectively controlled by EU member states or nationals of EU member states. The pan-European company, IAG, which owns Iberia and British Airways, faces a problem. As it stands, it will need to disinvest UK shareholders in order to become EU majority-owned or face being told that Iberia cannot fly between Madrid and Barcelona. UK carriers will also fall out of aviation agreements with third countries such as the US, imperilling pan-Atlantic services, unless bilateral agreements can be struck. Agriculture, food and drink Pig breeders, mineral water exporters and horse owners have been warned that contingency plans should be made. UK-based breeders of pure-bred and hybrid breeding pigs are told that they need to register their breeds in the books of the other 27 member states in order for them to be recognised in the rest of Europe. Brexit could potentially deal a blow to the racing community in the UK and Ireland. It could end the arrangements by which horses need only to have an EU passport and be on a livestock database to move between the UK and EU states. Currently they do not require a veterinary export health certification or customs documentation. Mineral water exporters will need the approval of the EU member states, who have their own industries to protect, if they are to sell them on the continent. Law The courts in member states and the UK would no longer recognise and enforce each others’ judgments and “judicial cooperation with the UK (eg in relation to the service of documents and evidence) … will cease”, the European commission says. The current mechanism, whereby UK citizens can apply to courts across the EU for small claims and vice versa, will also come to an end. With regard to data transfers, the commission has warned that businesses transferring data between the UK and EU member states will have to take extra safeguards or prove that they should be given a derogation from the regulations pertaining to the sharing of data with third countries. Development and aid UK-based companies and NGOs successful in securing grants, prizes or contracts with the European commission to carry out development work around the world will lose their funding on 29 March 2019. Those who have submitted a tender for a contract will be rejected outright if the procurement process drags on beyond Brexit day, and they will not be able to recoup their costs. Financial services A notice to stakeholders is yet to emerge, but Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, said in a speech in Brussels on Tuesday that it was “important that all businesses clearly analyse their exposure to the United Kingdom and are ready to adapt their logistical channels, supply chains and contractual clauses, including in the financial services sector”. Without the continuation of passporting rights, which allow financial service providers in the UK to operate across the EU, those headquartered in London need to establish a base in an EU member state to continue their operations, as many are today are doing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/12/suggs-my-life-story-review-julien-temple-madness","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T07:00:22Z","webTitle":"My Life Story review – fluent portrait of Suggs as the next national treasure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/12/suggs-my-life-story-review-julien-temple-madness","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/12/suggs-my-life-story-review-julien-temple-madness","fields":{"headline":"My Life Story review – fluent portrait of Suggs as the next national treasure","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It takes a while to get into its stride, but this filmed record of Suggs’s autobiographical stage show in London’s Hoxton Hall is amiable, fluent and often intriguing.

Director Julien Temple uses some of his trademark archival footage for Suggs’s Soho and west London memories; there are clips of the band in their extreme youth, with some cod-dramatised scenes as Suggs goes in search of information about his late dad. But mostly, and wisely, Temple lets Suggs do the talking on stage: cheerily inviting the crowd to sing along as he goes into bits of his greatest hits. He’s got a very distinctive singing voice; speaking, he sounds weirdly like the actor Kenneth Cranham. It’s probably better live, but this screen version is entertaining as Suggs continues his stately process to national treasure status."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/10/tommy-lawrence-former-liverpool-goalkeeper-dies-aged-77","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T11:30:43Z","webTitle":"Tommy Lawrence, former Liverpool goalkeeper, dies aged 77","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/10/tommy-lawrence-former-liverpool-goalkeeper-dies-aged-77","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/10/tommy-lawrence-former-liverpool-goalkeeper-dies-aged-77","fields":{"headline":"Tommy Lawrence, former Liverpool goalkeeper, dies aged 77","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The former Liverpool goalkeeper Tommy Lawrence, a key member of Bill Shankly’s side in the early 1960s, has died aged 77.

He became affectionately known as “The Flying Pig” due to both his physique and flair for spectacular, acrobatic saves.

He set a then record for the fewest goals conceded in a season in 1968-69 when he let in only 24 league goals. Lawrence made 390 appearance for Liverpool before moving to Tranmere Rovers in 1971, where he made 80 league appearances before joining non-league Chorley. In February 2015, the Scot made the news when BBC reporter Stuart Finders was conducting vox pops on the street in Liverpool, asking for memories of the Reds’ 1967 Merseyside derby against Everton at Goodison Park. After unwittingly approaching Lawrence and asking if he could remember the match, the goalkeeper replied that he had: “I played in it – I was goalkeeper for Liverpool. It was a great game.” A Liverpool club statement read: “The thoughts of everybody at the club are with Tommy’s family and friends at this sad time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/11/thursdays-best-tv-big-cats-transformation-street-the-tunnel","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T06:00:13Z","webTitle":"Thursday’s best TV: Big Cats, Transformation Street, The Tunnel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/11/thursdays-best-tv-big-cats-transformation-street-the-tunnel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/11/thursdays-best-tv-big-cats-transformation-street-the-tunnel","fields":{"headline":"Thursday’s best TV: Big Cats, Transformation Street, The Tunnel","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Big Cats 8pm, BBC One Following the success of Blue Planet II, we move on to dry land to follow the paw steps of the wild cat.

Tamara Rojo’s decision to challenge English National Ballet’s dancers to take it on may have been sparked by her brilliantly bold investigation of its sister classic, Giselle, last season, with a traditional staging danced alongside a radically updated version by Akram Khan. But ENB do not convince in Sylphide as they did in Giselle, in part because Frank Andersen’s production is a tad overliteral in its characterisation, but also because too many of the performances are limited to one note. As the titular spirit Sylphide, who seduces mortal James away from his intended bride, Jurgita Dronina is appealingly light-spun: her arms are pretty, her footwork skimmingly fast; emotions flit across her face with sweet transparency. But there should be a lethally capricious quality to her innocence. We should see James fuddled and intoxicated by her changeable moods, her disarming freedom from moral scruples. And if Dronina’s Sylphide is too benign, Jane Haworth’s Madge, her witchy nemesis, is also insufficiently dark. While Haworth hobbles around with a crackle of sardonic energy, she doesn’t plumb the depths of Madge’s anger, her outsider’s hatred against the world of entitled men such as James. Isaac Hernández’s James does look like a man worth fighting over: his beautifully filleted beats and bounding jetés are among the evening’s highlights. As the rivalrous Gurn, Daniel Kraus is also very good – joyously embodying the mobile twists and turns of Bournonville’s épaulement. But Hernández’s expressive range doesn’t fully encompass tragedy; in contrast to Anjuli Hudson, whose Effie is made convincingly distraught by James’s betrayal, Sylphide’s death leaves Hernández more rumpled than shattered. It doesn’t help the ballet that the orchestra plays with so little love; nor that it’s programmed to follow Kenneth MacMillan’s magisterial Song of the Earth. This is a work against which many ballets would struggle to compete, although ENB’s dancers do not yet have the measure of it, either. As the Woman, Rojo is physically extraordinary, articulating both the delicate chinoiserie and stark expressionism of her choreography with a compelling, musical authority. Yet neither of her two male partners come close to matching her power, and with so little to react against, Rojo is left dancing in emotional limbo. At the Coliseum, London, until 13 January.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it “uncovered areas of serious concern” in the contracts for difference market, which is a type of betting on financial products banned in the US, but legal in the UK with a severe health warning. CFDs are a type of high-risk, complex derivative that allow investors to gamble on the price of an asset without owning it. Shares in London-listed Plus500 fell by almost 5%, CMC Markets was down by nearly 4% in early trading and IG Group lost almost 5%. The intervention follows repeated warnings from European regulators about the risks posed by CFDs and a crackdown on the market. In a letter to the industry after a year-long review, the City watchdog said it found 76% of consumers had lost money on CFDs between July 2015 and June 2016, and was worried companies were operating outside its rules. The FCA said it assessed 19 businesses that provide CFDs to companies, which then sell them to consumers, as well as 15 that sell them directly. Most of them were unable to offer a satisfactory definition of their target market, or why CFDs might be an appropriate bet for them, which the FCA said raised the risk of companies selling CFDs to inappropriate customers. All distributors in the review had inadequate procedures to manage conflicts of interest, while the FCA found some companies paid their employees solely in bonuses, which raised the risk of mis-selling, as staff come under pressure to achieve sales targets. The FCA said it uncovered practices so poor at one business that it “intend[ed] to take further action”, although did not name the company or say what it would do. There has been a rapid growth in spread betting companies looking to cash in on the recent rise of bitcoin, which experts have warned could make losses worse for consumers.

It is understood Mourinho has no plans to escalate the situation, the 54-year-old’s attitude being that he prefers to focus on United’s campaign. Mourinho is surprised at Conte’s stance, believing himself blameless because of the Chelsea manager mistakenly thinking he was the “clown on the touchline” the Portuguese spoke of last week. This caused Conte to state Mourinho was suffering from “demenza senile” last Friday. Mourinho said that night that he was referring to his younger self as a manager with the clown remark but then apparently referenced the Chelsea manager’s four-month ban for failing to report alleged match-fixing. Mourinho stated he never would be banned for the practice. Conte’s response was to brand Mourinho a “little man”, saying: “It’s really difficult to answer these comments. When a person has the target to offend, you are a little man.” On Tuesday Conte followed stated he would not forget the United manager’s words but Mourinho is unmoved.

Speaking to Deadline, Douglas said he was taking the unusual step of making a pre-emptive denial after he was informed by his lawyer that film industry trade magazine the Hollywood Reporter was preparing to run a story on the allegations of a woman who worked for Douglas in the mid-1980s. Douglas describes the suggestion that he masturbated in front of her as “a complete lie, fabrication, no truth to it whatsoever”. Douglas said that the accusations also included a claim that he “used colourful language” in her earshot, as well as on the phone in private conversations, and that he “blackballed” the unnamed woman after she left his employ. Describing the former accusation as “minimal”, Douglas said: “I am sorry if I used coarse language with my friends.” However he denied the claim he had prevented her getting further employment in the film industry, as “completely untrue”. Saying he had no contact with his accuser for “30-plus years”, Douglas added he was “floored” by the accusations, and that he would “confess to anything I thought I was responsible for”. “There is no evidence.

The discussions are expected to start in February. Sterling’s existing contract expires in summer 2020, the England international having agreed a five-year deal when joining from Liverpool in the summer of 2015. Sterling earns around £170,000 a week basic and can expect a rise of at least £50,000 a week, along with lucrative incentives that would push the 23-year-old’s salary beyond £250,000 a week. This would put him in the top band of earners at City. Kevin De Bruyne is in the final stages of negotiating a contract which when agreed will put the 26-year-old ahead of Sterling. Alexis Sánchez, should he join from Arsenal in January as City hope, is likely to be the only player in Pep Guardiola’s squad on a higher salary. Sterling is enjoying a standout season. His 18 goals for City are his best tally in a season, making him the second‑highest scorer behind Sergio Agüero. This has repaid Guardiola’s faith after the manager refused to allow him to be a makeweight in a deal that would have taken Sánchez to City on the final day of the summer transfer window. De Bruyne said of his new deal: “We are still in negotiations. I am waiting for an offer from the club but my agent has been on holiday for three weeks. There is nothing really new for the moment. I’m not in a hurry. I still have three-and-a-half years on the contract.” Asked if he could expect a big pay rise, the midfielder said: “I cannot complain for the moment. We will see what happens. Negotiations are going good but they are going quietly. That is the way I think it should be.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/10/moon-jae-in-credits-donald-trump-for-inter-korea-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T10:12:38Z","webTitle":"Moon Jae-in credits Donald Trump for inter-Korea talks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/10/moon-jae-in-credits-donald-trump-for-inter-korea-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/10/moon-jae-in-credits-donald-trump-for-inter-korea-talks","fields":{"headline":"Moon Jae-in credits Donald Trump for inter-Korea talks","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, has credited Donald Trump for creating the political backdrop to this week’s inter-Korea talks, and echoed the US president’s warning that Pyongyang faced more pressure if it continued to conduct missile and nuclear tests. Speaking a day after senior North and South Korean officials met for the first time in more than two years, Moon suggested that US-led pressure on North Korea over the past year had helped bring the two sides together. “I think President Trump deserves big credit for bringing about the inter-Korean talks, and I want to show my gratitude,” he told reporters in Seoul. “It could be the result of US-led sanctions and pressure.” Trump had already claimed credit for facilitating the talks – which focused on North Korea’s participation in next month’s Winter Olympics – saying at the weekend: “If I weren’t involved, they wouldn’t be talking about the Olympics right now, they’d be doing no talking.” Moon’s praise for Trump is being seen as an attempt to ease US concerns that the recent thaw in cross-border ties could drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington. On Tuesday, North Korea agreed to send a large delegation to the Games, which open in Pyeongchang on 9 February. The two sides also agreed to hold military talks in an attempt to prevent an accidental conflict on the peninsula. While Moon has been more open to the idea of engagement than either of his two conservative predecessors, he said Seoul and Washington shared a common aim: the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. “This initial round of talks is for the improvement of relations between North and South Korea,” he said. “Our task going forward is to draw North Korea to talks aimed at the denuclearisation of the North. That is our basic stance, and that will never be given up.” He added: “We cannot say talks are the sole answer. If North Korea engages in provocations again or does not show sincerity in resolving this issue, the international community will continue applying strong pressure and sanctions.” The White House responded positively to Tuesday’s talks, held on the southern side of the border village of Panmunjom, with the state department saying it would be interested in joining future negotiations provided the goal was ridding North Korea of nuclear weapons. Moon said he was open to meeting his counterpart, Kim Jong-un, but he would not engage in “talks for the sake of talks”. “To hold a summit, the right conditions must be created and certain outcomes must be guaranteed,” he said. Trump recently expressed a willingness to meet Kim, but Washington has said that Pyongyang must cease nuclear and missile tests for a significant period before any negotiations can take place. Lee Woo-young, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said Moon had been right to praise Trump. “By doing that, he can help the US build logic for moving toward negotiations and turning around the state of affairs in the future, so when they were ready to talk to the North, they can say the North came out of isolation because the sanctions were effective,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2018/mar/06/the-0-city-how-manchester-developers-dodge-affordable-housing","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T07:15:04Z","webTitle":"How Manchester developers dodge affordable housing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/mar/06/the-0-city-how-manchester-developers-dodge-affordable-housing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/mar/06/the-0-city-how-manchester-developers-dodge-affordable-housing","fields":{"headline":"How Manchester developers dodge affordable housing","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In February, consultants Deloitte named Manchester one of Europe’s fastest-growing cities. Much of that growth is centred around the centre, where in the year 2000, four years after an IRA bomb blew up much of the downtown shopping district, just 10,000 people lived. By 2016, there were 50,000 residents, split between warehouse conversions and shiny new builds. Come 2024, about 80,000 people are expected to have made their home at the heart of the onetime Cottonopolis. Many will live in huge and exclusive new skyscrapers, including on a former BBC site on Oxford Road and in the old Granada Studios, where Coronation Street was filmed until 2013. Manchester’s rapid expansion can be credited to the council’s friendly relationship with the big developers it has been aggressively wooing over the past few years. Whereas some cities, like Cardiff and Newcastle, are strict with developers who want to put up big apartment blocks without including any affordable provision, Manchester has taken a more relaxed view. Of the 61 big residential developments granted planning permission by Manchester city council’s planning committee in 2016 and 2017, not one of the 14,667 planned flats or houses met the government’s definition of affordable, being neither for social rent nor offered at 80% of the market rate. Just 65 of the total will be shared-ownership properties, where the owner buys a proportion of the property and pays rent on the remainder, typically to a local authority or housing association. None are central: 30 are in Gorton, where the Channel 4 series Shameless was set; 27 will be in Openshaw, which is in the most deprived ward in Manchester and in the 1% most deprived in the whole of England; and eight in Moss Side, which, though vastly improved since its “Gunchester” days, still has its issues. Meanwhile, the city itself is building almost 700 properties set to be rented at “market rates” in a partnership with the Abu Dhabi United Group, formed after a group of Abu Dhabi investors bought Manchester City football club in 2008. Some of the developments offer the trappings of a five-star hotel. In June 2016 developer Renaker got planning permission for a huge new development on Owen Street, just off a key southern approach road into the city centre. Construction is well under way of what they are now calling Deansgate Square, comprising four residential towers containing 1,508 apartments with use of a 25m swimming pool, tennis court, 1,900 sq ft gym and roof terrace. The tallest skyscraper will be 64 storeys high, dwarfing the 47-storey Beetham Tower, which has held the title of Manchester’s tallest building since its completion in 2006. A confidential viability appraisal successfully argued that the inclusion of affordable housing within the scheme would “prejudice the achievement of other important planning and regeneration objectives, and would undermine a significant development proposal critical to economic growth within the city”. Not all councillors on the planning committee were happy about it. Meeting minutes show some were “very disappointed that a scheme of this scale should have no provision for affordable housing”. According to Manchester city council’s own planning rules, any development of 16 or more units or on a site larger than 0.3 hectares should include 20% affordable provision. The committee also raised concerns that “again affordable housing was not being proposed in a very large development due to an apparent viability assessment of the scheme overall and expressed scepticism that a development of this scale would not be feasible with any provision for affordable housing”. Developers routinely argue that being forced to include affordable housing would make their projects unviable, and sometimes pay a fee instead. They say they are carrying huge risk investing in the city and that it is impossible to meet the “affordable” criteria in quality new builds. Adam Higgins, chief of Capital &amp; Centric – which in the last two years received planning permission to create 681 flats in two old mills and part of Manchester Metropolitan University’s 1960s campus – said his developments would not happen if they had to sell the apartments at prices deemed affordable to the average Mancunian. The council’s focus is about increasing quality at the same time as increasing supply, said Higgins: “Ultimately as a private sector developer the only way you can build it cheaper is to build poorer quality and what everybody is paranoid about doing, including the council, all credit to them, is to start repeating the mistakes of the 1960s. Look at Grenfell Tower and places like that.” Capital &amp; Centric recently agreed to pay an undisclosed fee to the council’s affordability fund in return for not including any “affordable” flats in Talbot Mill, a cotton mill it is developing in the city centre. “The tide is turning a little bit,” he said. “Values and viability are such now that people are starting to be able to say yes, there is a [profit] margin there and we can afford to pay it.” In 2017 Manchester city council negotiated £1.5m in developer fees, which it says will be used to build more affordable homes. But these will not be in the city centre. They will be in cheaper areas of north Manchester, Clayton and Beswick in the east and Wythenshawe in the south. Bernard Priest, deputy leader of Manchester city council, said it made sense to build affordable homes outside the city centre, where land is cheaper. “It should be remembered that the geography of Manchester is such that a significant proportion of the city is within 15-20 minutes travel time of the city centre so people don’t necessarily need to live in the city centre to have easy and convenient access to its amenities,” he said. Were Manchester to follow the example of Leeds and insist on a percentage of affordable homes in each development, even just 5%, developers may look elsewhere, said Higgins: “Some projects won’t happen and I think inevitably the quality goes down. I would say that the quality of residential projects in Manchester is higher than most other cities in the UK.” Manchester city council said that 41% of the homes (old and new) sold in Manchester in 2016/17 were affordable, by its own definition, in that the mortgage payments were affordable to households with the average income of £27,000.

After publication the city’s council explained that in the last two years, 19 further developments containing affordable housing were given planning permission, but those didn’t go through the planning committee because no one objected to them. Those developments are set to contain 850 affordable homes, 136 of which will be social housing.

Meanwhile the issue has been politicised thanks to statements by the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, blaming the state government of Victoria for going soft on the issue. But how real is the supposed spate of African gang violence in Melbourne’s suburbs? In at least one case, it seems that the media’s reporting is having a toxic observer effect. A scuffle described by the media last week as “the latest gang flare-up” involving African teenagers was in fact entirely provoked by the journalists who reported it, according to Victoria police. The article, published by the Daily Mail on 3 January, was billed as an exclusive and headlined “Police SPAT ON and abused as officers arrest African teenagers outside a shopping centre in Melbourne’s west in broad daylight – in latest gang flare up”. But according to Victoria police, there was no “gang” involved and no “flare-up” until the aggressive behaviour of the Daily Mail photographer provoked a group of teenagers who were innocently socialising at the shopping centre. Two days after the article was published, the Victoria police executive director of media and corporate communications, Merita Tabain, wrote a confidential email to the editors of Melbourne’s main media outlets expressing concern that aggressive behaviour by journalists might “exacerbate the current tensions”. She gave the incident at the Tarneit Central shopping centre as an example. Tabain wrote that the incident had been provoked by the photographer’s decision to “move in to take closeup photos of a group of African teenagers socialising”. “The teenagers had been doing nothing of public interest prior to the photographer’s decision to move in and take the photos and [the group] reacted to the photographer and what he was doing. “This led to police being called in and a scuffle ensued in which police were spat on and arrests were made. After the event, the photographer acknowledged that his actions had provoked the incident and apologised.” Yet the article published by the Daily Mail made no reference to this. It did claim that abuse had been directed at the Daily Mail photographer and reporter. The article included a number of closeup shots of police struggling with a youth and talking to others. The text of the article described the “flare-up” as coming amid “fears that a new gang of African youths is rising up in the city’s west” and described it as part of “a spate of violence and crime” in the area. The Mail’s piece also quoted, and included a photograph of, Nelly Yoa, described as a “leading Sudanese youth worker”. Yoa was quoted by a number of media outlets including the Guardian, ABC and News Corp after he contradicted claims from senior police that there was not a problem with African gang violence in a New Year’s Day opinion piece in the Melbourne Age. But now, the Age opinion piece has been augmented with an editorial note saying that several assertions made by Yoa in that article “have been challenged, exaggerated or found not to be true”. The Age article also said parts of the piece were plagiarised, a claim Yoa denies. Needless to say, none of this is regarded as particularly helpful by those on the front line of dealing with crime, including Victorian police. When contacted by the Guardian, Tabain confirmed the authenticity of the email, but declined to provide further comment. The email, marked “confidential – not for publication” was sent to the editorial heads of the main media organisations that have been reporting on so called gang violence – the Herald Sun, Macquarie Media, Channel Nine, Channel Seven, Network Ten, Fairfax Media, the ABC, SBS and the Australian. Guardian Australia was not included. “Victoria police does not want to see further incidents such as [the Tarneit incident] and I am therefore respectfully asking that you remind your media teams about the importance of not inflaming situations or inciting conflict, and acting responsibly at all times,” Tabain wrote. Previously, police had called on the state’s media to stop referring to African youths behind recent riots and vandalism as “gangs”. The deputy police commissioner, Andrew Crisp, told 3AW the week before that there was no evidence that gangs were responsible for a riot in Werribee. The police commissioner, Graham Ashton, has rubbished Dutton’s claims that Victorians are too scared to go out at night. The Daily Mail was contacted for comment but had not responded by deadline."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/jan/10/talking-horses-thistlecrack-fears-played-down-but-is-he-past-his-best","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T10:14:18Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Thistlecrack fears played down but is he past his best?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/10/talking-horses-thistlecrack-fears-played-down-but-is-he-past-his-best","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/10/talking-horses-thistlecrack-fears-played-down-but-is-he-past-his-best","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Thistlecrack fears played down but is he past his best?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Today’s best bets, by Chris Cook Colin Tizzard was inclined to play down the gravity of this week’s Thistlecrack news when I had a quick word with him at Taunton on Tuesday. The trainer talked down the extent of the horse’s injury and the significance of his consequent absence, which will keep him on the sidelines through the rest of this season. Tizzard told me: “All I will say is, he had a tear in his tendon from the Cotswold Chase [last year] and it was touch and go whether we even raced him this year and we have, he’s run two races, he ran very well in the King George after having nine months doing zero. At least his tendon’s all right. “This stress fracture will heal up in a month. It’s high profile because it’s Thistlecrack but, believe me, it’s much more common than you think. So, he’ll get a month in the box and then he can go out in a field.” Our conversation ended with Tizzard looking for the bright side. “He’ll only be a few months older in October, so that’ll make no difference. We’ll have a full season with him next year.” We all hope that turns out to be true but I can’t help feeling we must have seen the best of Thistlecrack, who will be nearly 11 by the time he races again. Anyway, good luck to all concerned. Ayr having been abandoned, Ludlow provides our jumps action for the day and its card includes one of those races where you go through the form thinking: ‘Nothing’s going to win this.’ Or at least that was true for me of the staying handicap chase, until I got to the bottom one, Tb Broke Her (3.00). This is not an especially original choice, as Matt Sheppard’s charge is favourite, but still a good price, for me, at 7-2. Previously trained in Ireland by Arthur Moore, whose strike-rate has sadly dwindled in recent years, Tb Broke Her won by nine lengths on her second start for Sheppard, when a step up to three miles seemed to help. I don’t think another 7lb is going to hold her if she gets a clear run. Earlier, Megabucks (1.55) could go well for the in-form Henry Oliver yard at a tempting 10-1. He’s a points winner in England and Ireland, where he dead-heated in 2015 with Burrenbridge Hotel, who also found his way to Oliver’s yard and hosed up last month on a mark of 111. Oh, and who was 10 lengths back in third? That’s right, Poetic Rhythm, the Challow winner. I mean, I don’t want to go overboard on ancient point-to-point form but that’s pretty strong. Anyway, Megabucks fared just OK in three hurdles starts at the end of last year but here he is over fences from a mark of 112, with Tom O’Brien replacing Robert Hawker. I like the look of it. Also 10-1 is Ice Canyon (5.45) at Kempton, having run a huge debut for Mark Brisbourne when beaten by a length at 50-1 last month at Wolves (tipped by the Guardian; drat, drat, drat). Brisbourne stepped him up radically on the distances he’d been tackling in Ireland and it seemed to make a difference, which in fairness his pedigree suggested it would. From just 1lb higher, he’s well worth another go."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2018/jan/10/pmqs-brexit-hammond-davis-excluding-city-from-single-market-after-brexit-will-put-eu-financial-stability-at-risk-hammond-and-davis-claim-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T17:46:23Z","webTitle":"Hunt calls for consensus on 10-year funding deal for NHS with 'significantly' more money -  Politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/jan/10/pmqs-brexit-hammond-davis-excluding-city-from-single-market-after-brexit-will-put-eu-financial-stability-at-risk-hammond-and-davis-claim-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2018/jan/10/pmqs-brexit-hammond-davis-excluding-city-from-single-market-after-brexit-will-put-eu-financial-stability-at-risk-hammond-and-davis-claim-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Hunt calls for consensus on 10-year funding deal for NHS with 'significantly' more money -  Politics live","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has said that he wants to reach a consensus on a 10-year funding settlement for the NHS involving giving it “significantly” more money. (See 4.52pm.) The National Audit Office has announced that it will hold an investigation into the government’s decision to spend up to £39bn on payments to the EU as part of the withdrawal agreement. (See 2.26pm.) Philip Hammond will use a speech in Germany tonight to urge European Union governments to make the case publicly for a close future relationship with Britain after Brexit, saying: “It takes two to tango.” Jeremy Corbyn has used the first prime minister’s questions of 2018 to castigate Theresa May for presiding over what he described as a crisis in the NHS, chiding her for being “too weak” to sack the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt. UK companies working in fields from development to aviation and haulage are being warned that the EU will shut down their ability to operate across Europeand block funding streams from Brussels in the event of a “no deal” Brexit. Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, has been accused of passing the buck over severe rail disruption on Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern trains, for which he blamed staff shortages caused by “militant unions”. The former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron has said he regrets telling people he does not believe gay sex is a sin when he was forced to clarify his position during the election campaign. Jeremy Corbyn believes the appointment of Esther McVey as work and pensions secretary is alarming, his spokesman has said, while condemning online abuse of the newly promoted MP. The Scottish government has announced that it is preparing it own EU continuity bill in case it fails to reach agreement with the UK government over the EU withdrawal bill. The Scottish government is still minded to refuse the UK bill legislative consent. As a contingency, it is planning to introduce its own bill in the Scottish parliament in February to ensure there are no gaps in legislation when the UK leaves the EU. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has said Sinn Fein’s continued “eulogising” of the IRA is thwarting efforts to build a shared future in Northern Ireland. Referring to the controversy generated by a Sinn Fein MP appearing to mark the anniversary of an IRA massacre with a joke, she said: They have to stop eulogising terrorists. They have to stop that, it cannot continue. If we are building a new shared future for the people of Northern Ireland, let’s build it, but let’s move away from the past and move away from the eulogising of terrorists. Apple Europe has agreed to pay more than £100m of extra taxes following an “extensive audit” by HMRC, the firm revealed in accounts filed on Monday. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. On Monday the Daily Telegraph splashed on a story saying Theresa May was going to use the reshuffle to have what would amount to a minister for a no deal Brexit attending cabinet. It said Steve Baker, a Brexit minister already in charge of Brexit planning, would start attending cabinet, showing how serious the government was about a no deal Brexit. As you will have noticed, this never happened. The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg says Brexiters are very angry about this. The Telegraph’s Christopher Hope, who wrote the story, says he thinks Baker may have been bounced out at the last minute May wanted to allocated the cabinet attendee slot lined up for him to a woman. The Commons debate on the Labour motion on the NHS has just finished. Here are the key points. Jeremy Hunt, the health and social care secretary, said that he wanted to reach a consensus on a 10-year funding settlement for the NHS involving “significantly” more money. But he refused to commit himself to cross-party talks on this issue, and he spoke after Theresa May conspicuously failed to back calls for a royal commission on health and social care. Norman Lamb, the Lib Dem former health minister, told Hunt that Tories like Nick Timothy, May’s former co chief of staff (here), Lord Saatchi and David Cameron’s former policy chief Camilla Cavendish (here) were in favour of a royal commission. Lamb asked Hunt to back this approach, saying it would enable the government to develop a consensus on funding health care. Hunt replied: I have said publicly that I think as we come to the end of the five-year forward view we do need to look to find a consensus for the next phase of the NHS. We will need significantly more funding in the years ahead. We need to build a national consensus as to how we are going to find that funding. And my own view is that we should try and do that for a 10-year period, not a five-year period. The current NHS plan, running to the end of the decade, is the Five Year Forward View. Earlier, at PMQs, the Tory MP Andrew Murrison asked May to set up a royal commission on NHS funding. Theresa May sidestepped the question, and just said the government was “putting more funding in and looking at the better integration of health and social care on the ground.” Hunt denied a report in the Times saying patients needing cancer treatment were facing delays. The Times story was based on a leaked memo circulated to staff at Churchill Hospital in Oxford. According to The Times, the memo warned the number of chemotherapy cycles offered to the terminally ill would have to be cut because of a lack of staff trained to deal with medication. But when the issue was raised at PMQs May said: The trust has made clear there are absolutely no plans to delay the start of chemotherapy treatment or reduce the number of cycles of treatment given to cancer patients. And, in the debate, Hunt said: The instructions from NHS England could not have been clearer that cancer operations should not be cancelled because they are deemed to be urgent. MPs backed a motion saying that the government should put more money into the NHS, and that Hunt should return to the Commons to explain how. The Tories did not vote against the Labour motion, and so it was passed without opposition. But it is not binding on the government, and ministers now routinely ignore Labour motions passed by MPs. This one said: That this House expresses concern at the effect on patient care of the closure of 14,000 hospital beds since 2010; records its alarm at there being vacancies for 100,000 posts across the NHS; regrets the decision of the government to reduce social care funding since 2010; notes that hospital trusts have been compelled by NHS England to delay elective operations because of the government’s failure to allocate adequate resources to the NHS; condemns the privatisation of community health services; and calls on the government to increase cash limits for the current year to enable hospitals to resume a full service to the public, including rescheduling elective operations, and to report to the House by oral statement and written report before 1 February 2018 on what steps it is taking to comply with this resolution. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said Hunt was to blame for the NHS winter crisis. He said: This is not just a winter crisis. This is an all year round funding crisis, a year round staffing crisis, a year round social care crisis, a year round health inequality crisis - manufactured in Downing Street by this government ... Isn’t the truth that doctors and nurses have lost confidence in him, patients have lost confidence in him, the prime minister it seems has lost confidence in him. He fights for his own job but he won’t fight for the NHS. Our patients are crying out for change and they will look at the health secretary still in post today and see - to coin a phrase - nothing has changed, nothing has changed. Hunt criticised Labour for seeking to “politicise” the pressures on the NHS, saying the party was making a “serious mistake”. He said the last time the NHS faced a really difficult winter was in 2009. At the time Andrew Lansley, the then shadow health secretary, refused to attack the government over the matter, treating it as an operational issue, Hunt said. He went on: Andy Burnham, who was the health secretary, actually thanked him for his measured tone so that together we can give a reassuring message to the public. Sadly, I cannot say that today. Hunt defended the performance of the NHS. He said: [Ashworth] says the NHS is on its knees. So let’s look at the facts - 14,000 more doctors since 2010, 12,000 more nurses on our wards, 5,000 more operations every single day. In A&amp;Es, which he’s been talking about a lot, 1,800 more people being seen and treated within four hours every single day than 2010. Top of Esther McVey’s in-tray at the department for work and pensions should be the so-called ‘rape clause’, according to two campaigning Scottish women politicians. The SNP’s Alison Thewlis has written to McVey regarding the cuts to child tax credits – which she has been fighting since they appeared in the 2015 budget – which limit the benefit to the first two children in a family and require women who have conceived a third or subsequent child as a result of rape to apply for an exemption. Thewliss said: Esther McVey is now the fifth secretary of state for the DWP since I was elected in 2015, and the first woman in that time. I want to know from her whether she is comfortable in making a woman who has suffered the trauma of rape, domestic violence and coercive control go through the shame of proving her child was conceived as a result of that sexual abuse. Former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has also written to McVey about what she describes as “one of the most abhorrent policies of a government in my adult lifetime”. Noting their different political ideologies, Dugdale argues: The rape clause isn’t a question of how much we spend on the welfare state, or indeed whether it is fair to cap child tax credits for families with two children. This is about whether or not women should be punished by the state for being the victim of a violent act. Karen Bradley, the new Northern Ireland secretary, said that her priority was to get devolved government restored “as soon as possible” on her first visit to Belfast (not just in this job, but ever). She said she wanted to work collaboratively with local parties to forge an agreement to get the power-sharing executive restored. Asked if she intended to adopt a new approach to the negotiation process, Bradley stressed she was still in learning mode. She said: I am here to learn, I am here to find out, I am here to meet all the leaders, I’m here to look at what needs to be done. I know there are challenges but I am determined we will find a way through those challenges. We need to deliver devolved government to Northern Ireland as soon as possible and that’s what I am determined to do. The World at One carried a lengthy report about the Philip Hammond/David Davis Brexit article. (See 9.26am.) As part of their package, they carried an interview with the chief executive of the Berlin stock exchange, Artur Fischer, played down talk of a bespoke Brexit deal for the UK (ie, one that would involve the UK getting the benefits of a Norway-type deal, and the regulatory freedom of a Canada-type deal), saying the scenario was “very unlikely”. Fischer said: “It is certainly possible, but not probable.” He said such an agreement would go against the EU system of cross-border regulation, stating: If you want the one thing but not the other, we come back to the famous words ‘let’s have the cake and eat it’. We don’t believe that that’s possible. Fischer also said that if German Social Democrat leader and former European parliament chairman Martin Schulz went into coalition with Angela Merkel, he would be more focused on protecting the interests of Brussels. Fischer said: EU interests would not allow for such a nice, special deal David Davis has announced and made a possibility. Fischer predicted a hard Brexit for the City which he said would be bad for the UK and Germany. My feeling is that now for about one year we more and more come to the conclusion that it will be a hard Brexit when it comes to financial services. And Jeremy Corbyn believes the appointment of Esther McVey as work and pensions secretary is alarming, his spokesman has said, while condemning online abuse of the newly promoted MP, my colleague Heather Stewart reports. The former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron has said he regrets telling people he does not believe gay sex is a sin when he was forced to clarify his position during the election campaign, my colleague Rowena Mason reports. Steven Woolfe, the MEP who was once a potential Ukip leadership candidate before leaving the party to sit as an independent, is part of the delegation of Brexiters meeting Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator. He has taken along a hamper of British goodies as a present. Obviously it’s not a complete compendium of British greatness, because there’s no blue passport. My colleague Anushka Asthana says Woolfe may want to throw out the Marmite when he discovers who invented it. Theresa May will meet finance leaders in Downing Street on Thursday as part of efforts to keep the business community updated about the Brexit process, No 10 said. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, and Robin Walker, the Brexit minister, will also be at the meeting with “various CEOs” and “European chiefs of financial institutions who have a presence in the UK”, the prime minister’s spokesman said. The National Audit Office has announced that it will investigate the government’s decision to spend up to £39bn on payments to the EU as part of the withdrawal agreement. It made the announcement in response to a request for an investigation of this kind from Nicky Morgan, the chair of the Commons Treasury committee. (See 11.35am.) In response to Morgan’s letter Sir Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said: I can confirm that we intend to report on the main elements of the financial settlement with the EU. We are already in discussions with HM Treasury aimed at planning our work. I expect our report to be published in late March. Morgan asked the NAO to investigate the “reasonableness” of the payments, and the assumptions used to calculate how much the UK should pay. Theresa May offered the money after the EU made it clear that it would not open talks on a future trade deal unless the UK agreed to honour financial commitments it has made as an EU member. The exact sum to be paid has not been finalised, but May has said it would come out at between £35bn and £39bn. Some Brexiters claim there will be no legal requirement for the UK to pay anything to the EU once it has left. The NAO investigation is likely to clarify this. It may also shed light on claims that, under the deal reached between the UK and the EU, UK will end up paying significantly more than £39bn but that both sides have agreed to conceal this to minimise political opposition to the payments in Britain. On the subject of the Virgin Trains’ Daily Mail ban (see 1.44pm), Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has piled in. He posted this on Twitter. Here is a Telegraph article with details of the case Jeremy Corbyn raised at PMQs about Virgin Care being paid compensation after it failed to win an NHS contract. (See 12.21pm.) And here is an extract. Virgin Care Services started High Court proceedings against NHS England, Surrey County Council and the CCGs in November last year, after its bid failed. It said there were “serious flaws in the procurement process” which had left it “so concerned” that it had launched the proceedings. It sued six Surrey clinical commissioning groups, NHS England and Surrey County Council. Virgin and the CCGs said the matter had been resolved, stating that the terms were confidential. But board papers for one of the six CCGs involved state that its “liability” in the case is £328,000. And at the Labour press huddle after PMQs Jeremy Corbyn’s spokesman revealed that, if any Virgin Trains passengers want the ban on buying a copy of the Daily Mail lifted, they should back Labour’s plans for nationalisation. This is from PoliticsHome’s Kevin Schofield. A government source confirmed that the Tories’ approach to this afternoon’s Labour-led debates on the health service winter crisis and the East Coast rail franchise will be to ask MPs to abstain. “We will be abstaining on both the motions - people are not being whipped to turn up”, the source said, after PMQs. Opposition day debates are ways for other parties to raise pressing political issues; but rather than risk a series of embarrassing defeats, May’s minority government has advised its MPs not to vote - or even to attend. Journalists were also told that, as May suggested in the House, the Department of Health will be “looking at the evidence,” on the impact of high-sugar energy drinks on public health, after a case raised by Conservative MP Maria Caulfield, involving the suicide of a young constituent. Here is the main Press Association story about the exchanges between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. Theresa May has accused Jeremy Corbyn of giving the impression that the NHS is failing everybody amid claims she was “too weak” to sack the health secretary. The prime minister reiterated her apology to patients affected by winter pressures, including to the thousands who have seen their operations cancelled, as she defended the preparations. But Labour leader Corbyn said May had recognised there is a “crisis” in the NHS because she initially wanted to sack Mr Hunt, who ultimately survived the reshuffle and saw social care added to his portfolio. The NHS dominated the pair’s exchanges at the first PMQs of 2018. Corbyn cited reports that nurses were “spending their entire shift treating people in car parks” due to backed-up ambulances. He added: “We know the prime minister recognises there’s a crisis in our NHS because she wanted to sack the health secretary last week but was too weak to do it. “And if the NHS is so well-resourced and so well-prepared, why was a decision taken last week to cancel the operations of 55,000 patients during the month of January?” Labour frontbenchers shouted “apologise” at May, who said she had already made clear her apology during PMQs. She added: “We will make sure those operations are reinstated as soon as possible. We are putting record funding into the NHS and record funding into mental health.” Corbyn raised the case of an 82-year-old woman who spent 13 hours on a trolley in a corridor, noting she arrived at hospital three hours after first dialling 999. He said this is not an “isolated” case, adding: “Does the prime minister really believe the NHS is better prepared than ever for the crisis it’s now going through?” May offered to examine the case, adding: “Week in and week out, in the run-up to Christmas and now today, what [Corbyn] is doing is giving the impression of a National Health Service that is failing everybody that goes to use the NHS. “The reality in our NHS is that we are seeing 2.9m more people now going to accident and emergency, over 2m more operations taking place each year. “Our National Health Service is something we should be proud of and that’s why it’s a first-class National Health Service.” This is what political commentators and journalists are saying about PMQs. There is more praise for Corbyn than May, but generally the hacks are underwhelmed. From the FT’s Sebastian Payne From the New Statesman’s George Eaton From the Daily Mirror’s Jason Beattie From the Guardian’s Heather Stewart From the Spectator’s Isabel Hardman From the Sun’s Steve Hawkes From the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg From the Telegraph’s Christopher Hope This is from the Daily Mirror’s Dan Bloom. As usual, I missed the questions from Ian Blackford, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, because I was writing the snap verdict. So here they are. Blackford asked May to accept that clause 11 of the EU withdrawal bill, which would limit the Scottish parliament’s right to legislate on devolution-related areas using powers being repatriated from Brussels, must be changed. He said: Does the prime minister agree with her colleague that we must amend clause 11, which is nothing more than a power grab from Scotland? May said the the government was still discussing this with the devolved administrations. She said: We continue to amend clause 11, we are looking to work with the devolved administrations to ensure we put the right frameworks in place so when we come to put any amendments forward it is in the best interests of all concerned. Blackford said that was “not good enough”. He went on: The Tories always promise Scotland everything and deliver nothing. The prime minister has one more chance - will she assure the House that these amendments will be tabled next week, as promised? May said the government will amend clause 11. She said: [The SNP] say they want clause 11 amended and we are doing exactly that. [David Lidington] is intensifying his discussions with the Scottish government and the assembly in Wales. May also said Scotland got an extra £2bn in the budget. I’ve taken the quotes from PoliticsHome. Richard Drax, a Conservative, asks about the work of a lifeboat in Dorset who were called out over Christmas and averted a disaster. May says she is happy to praise volunteers in the RNLI. Labour’s Siobhain McDonagh asks about a foster parent in her constituency evicted by a landlord who refused to do a repair. Now the council won’t let her foster because her accommodation is not good enough. How does that make sense? May says that does not appear to make sense. She says she hopes the local council will look at this again. Simon Clarke, a Conservative, asks if government funds can be used to help workers affected by a closure in his constituency. May says the DWP’s rapid response service will step in to help. The business department is looking at this too, she says. Labour’s Fiona Onasanya says May said once not getting things done made her depressed. She says she wrote to May last year about a constituent kept waiting 18 months for a driving licence. But May has not replied. May says she will reply. PMQs - Snap verdict: In the light of the winter crisis, and the cancellation last week of 50,000-odd operations to free up beds and staff for A&amp;E patients, health was an open goal for Corbyn this week and he was solid and convincing, quite comfortably getting the upper hand. But it wasn’t quite the clear walkover that some Labour MPs may have expected, and May was reasonably resilient. That is because both leaders had a point; it is perfectly possible for NHS planning to be better than ever, and yet hospitals still be stretched to an extent that leaves some patients suffering an appalling service. Corbyn put the case against May well, but his best question was probably his first, where he managed to use May’s answer at the last PMQs of 2017 against her. (A good example of how a lacklustre PMQs performance, which was how I judged Corbyn’s at the end of December, can nevertheless set a boobytrap for the future.) The payment to Virgin Care in Surrey sounded as if it was worth developing at greater length, and Corbyn could have probed May more aggressively about the relatively meaninglessness of May’s social care name change at the Department of Health. May was better than in some of the other NHS-focused PMQs because it sounded as if she was engaging with what Corbyn said, not just reading out statistics, and she got the balance about right between apologising and defending her record. You could tell that she felt reasonably confident because she did not resort to banging on about Wales until question four. Her reference to Angela Rayner being absent backfired when she was told Rayner was ill, but May had the sense to apologise fully and quickly, which allowed her to recover her stride quite well. Corbyn says tax cuts are being paid for by longer NHS waits. Hunt said when he met May to ask to keep his job that he would not abandon the ship. Isn’t that an admission the ship is sinking? May says more people are being treated in the NHS. But you can only have a strong NHS with a strong economy. She says Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, who is not here ... Labour MPs say Rayner is not her because she is ill. May apologises for criticising that Rayner is not there. But she goes on, referring to Rayner saying Labour’s strategy amounts to a “shit or bust” strategy. (May just referred to “or bust”, leaving MPs to guess the missing word.) Corbyn says May’s government has cut funding for Wales. May is responsible for the NHS in England. Giving Hunt a new job title will not affect the fact that £6bn has been cut from social care budgets. And NHS money is being siphoned off to private health companies. This is happening in Surrey, Hunt’s constituency, where money was paid to Virgin Care because it did not win a contract. May says the government has given more money to Wales. It is the Labour government in Wales that has deprioritised health. And which government started bringing the private sector into health? (May is getting quite shouty at this point.) May repeats the point about Wales. And she says it was under the Labour government, of which Corbyn was a member [actually, he wasn’t] that the use of the private sector in health expanded. Corbyn quotes from Vicky. Her 82-year-old mother spent three hours on a trolley, having waited an hour to get to hospital. This is not an isolated case. Does May really believe the NHS is better prepared than ever? May says nobody wants to hear of people experiencing things like this. We must learn from these incidents. She says this case will be looked at. But week in, week out, Corbyn is implying the NHS is failing everyone. She says 2.9m more people are going to A&amp;E. Some 2m more operations are taking place every year. The NHS has been identified as the number one health system in the world. Corbyn says all MPs are proud of the principles of the NHS. But more than 500,000 people in the last year have spent time on trolleys in hospital. He turns to care, and asks why May has promoted the health secretary. May says many people, including from Labour, have called for better integration of health and social care. She has responded to this by changing Jeremy Hunt’s position. Age UK has welcomed this, she says. She says this is the way forward. She says the way Corbyn talks, you would think Labour had all the solutions. If so, why is funding being cut, and why are targets not being met in Wales? Jeremy Corbyn starts by wishing everyone a happy new year too. He says before Christmas he asked about the 12,000 people waiting in ambulances. She said the NHS was better prepared than ever before. So what will she say to the 17,000 people kept waiting in the week before Christmas. Is it “nothing is perfect” (as she said on the Marr Show on Sunday.) May says she has apologised to people who have had to wait. But the NHS was better prepared for every. There were more flu vaccinations than before. More than 2,000 extra beds were available, she says. She says Corbyn said at the last PMQs of 2017 that mental health budgets had been cut. That was wrong. Will he apologise? Corbyn says everyone knows mental health budgets have been raided. We have seen nurses treated people in car parks. We know the NHS is in trouble because she wanted to move the health secretary. Why were 50,000 operations delayed? May says she has apologised to those affected. Last week she visited a hospital to thank NHS staff. She says NHS staff do a fantastic job. She quotes NHS Providers saying that preparations for winter have been more extensive than ever before. James Cleverly, the new Tory deputy chair, asks May to passionately embrace the vision she set out last year, improving life chances and leaving the country in a better place. May says Cleverly never got the kiss from her he once asked for. (Apparently he said kiss about May in a snog/marry/avoid quizz.) UPDATE: Here’s the reference. Labour’s Mike Amesbury says at least 1.4m households have been victims of unfair practices in the leasehold market. It is a scandal, he says. What will the government do to help? May says the government is looking to see what it can do to ensure that people are not subject to unfair practices. Theresa May starts by wishing all MPs and staff a happy new year. This is from the Sun’s Steve Hawkes. This is from my colleague Dan Sabbagh, who has just started a new job covering politics at Westminster. PMQs is starting very soon. For an interesting take on the state of the nation as 2018 begins, this Britain Thinks report (pdf) is worth reading. It is based on the findings of focus groups and a poll. Here are some of the key slides. This is what the report says about people’s views of Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn. And these charts put views of Labour and the Tories into context. Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons Treasury committee, has written to the National Audit Office asking it to investigate whether paying the EU a “Brexit bill” of up to £39bn is reasonable. Here is the text of her letter, addressed to the NAO chief Sir Amyas Morse. Commenting on the letter, Morgan said: Various wide-ranging sums for the UK’s withdrawal payment to the EU have been bandied about. Last month, the prime minister told parliament that the so-called Brexit divorce bill will be £35-39bn. Parliament must be able to scrutinise the reasonableness of this bill. Accordingly, I have written to Sir Amyas to request that the NAO examines the withdrawal payment, including the assumptions and methodologies used. The NAO is independent and, even as chair of the Treasury committee, Morgan cannot force it to investigate the “Brexit bill.” But it may choose to do so anyway. An NAO spokesman said they would be issuing a response later today. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, told BBC Radio 5 Live this morning that she plans to publish details of the new procedures for dealing with harassment and bullying complaints involving MPs before the end of this month. In an interview with Emma Barnett she said she wanted to ensure the report had “some serious teeth” and that offenders could end up being suspended from the Commons and forced to fight a recall byelection if they want to remain an MP. Dismissing the suggestion that the report would not impose proper sanctions, Leadsom said: It will absolutely not just be an apology. As ever, with something like this, you want to focus on informal resolution, you want to focus on prevention, you want to focus on changing the culture. However there will be real sanctions at the end of this process. If it’s a member of parliament, then it would be a referral to the parliamentary commissioner for standards, and ultimately to the Commons committee for standards, which has the ability to suspend members of parliament. And there is of course then the Recall of MPs Act 2015, that itself does enable a constituency to decide to get rid of their member of parliament. So that would be the ultimate sanction. Leadsom also said she did not have to persuade Theresa May to let her stay in her post in the reshuffle. Describing her conversation with May on Monday, Leadsom said: We had quite a short conversation, and she asked me to continue doing the job. She told me there was some important work that I was doing, and that she would like me to stay in the role, and I was delighted to do that. On Sky’s All Out Politics, the Labour pro-European Chuka Umunna said that his party would eventually have to decide whether to vote for or against the final Brexit withdrawal deal expected to be agreed by the end of the year. He said if it involved leaving the single market and the customs union, he could not back it. If we are not in the single market and the customs union, I would not be able to support any deal. Jeremy Corbyn claims that the UK cannot remain in the single market after Brexit. But Labour’s position on staying in the customs union is more nuanced, and the Times today (paywall) is reporting that the party will come out in the spring favour of staying in some form of customs union with the EU. In their story Sam Coates and Lucy Fisher write: Labour is likely to announce by the spring that it wants to stay indefinitely in a modified version of the European customs union. Senior Labour figures, including MPs for Brexit-supporting areas, said the move was intended to mark a significant break from the government’s policy. The policy has not been agreed and still faces obstacles, but a range of senior figures have confirmed to The Times that the move is likely. “Things are fluid” a source said, but added that they hoped the party would modify its position by March or April. The new Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley makes her first ever visit to the region this morning. She is meeting staff and students at Belfast Metropolitan College in the city’s Titanic Quarter. The 47-year-old has replaced outgoing James Brokenshire who has stood down from the post as he faces lung surgery. Ahead of her trip to Belfast, the DUP North Antrim MP Ian Paisley claimed she has a “strong unionist outlook.” But the former culture secretary’s parliamentary record is at odds with many in the DUP. She has voted for for equal gay rights and same sex marriage - the latter which the DUP has consistently opposed in the currently deadlocked Northern Ireland assembly. Bradley’s main task will be to encourage the main unionist and nationalist parties - the DUP and Sinn Fein - to reach a compromise that could lead to the restoration of power sharing government in Northern Ireland. A year and a day ago the resignation of the late deputy first minister Martin McGuinness led to the collapse of devolved government in Belfast. McGuinness and Sinn Fein accused the DUP of disrespecting the Irish language and culture. DUP leader and then first minister Arlene Foster’s refusal to temporarily step down from her post over a bungled green heating scheme she and her party promoted was the other main reason for McGuinness’ resignation. Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, told the Today programme this morning that he was not bothered about the fact that he was wrongly named as the new Conservative chairman by a party Twitter account very briefly on Monday morning, as the reshuffle was taking place. He said there was always “endless speculation” with reshuffles. I think over the last two weeks I’ve been going to be sacked, I’ve been going to become deputy prime minister, I’ve been going to become party chairman; actually I’m the transport secretary who’s always wanted to be transport secretary, who’s very happy doing it. Nothing’s changed. Lots of media speculation and a mistaken tweet and that happens quite often these days. Asked if he was angry about the mistake, he replied: No, not in the slightest. I’m doing a job I really enjoy doing, I want to make a difference, I believe we are making a difference. Unusually, Grayling also found himself commenting on the prime minister’s weight. Earlier the Today programme hosted a discussion about similarities between today’s politics and the Tudor era and Grayling was asked at the end of his interview if he thought there were any similarities between Theresa May’s regime and Henry VIII. He replied: The prime minister has only got one husband rather than six and I don’t think she’s got quite the same build as Henry VIII. The Today discussion was prompted by the profile on the Conservative website of David Lidington, the new Cabinet Office minister (and now the most senior person in government after May, according to his position in the government table ranking cabinet ministers.) Lidington has a PhD in Elizabethan history and the website says he thinks “that Tudor court politics is a pretty good guide to life in Westminster today.” During the EU referendum campaign one argument constantly used by leave campaigners was that Brussels would have to offer the UK a good free trade deal because German car manufacturers, who export a lot to Britain, would insist on one and Angela Merkel would give in to their demands. So far there is little evidence that the “BMW factor” is having quite the effect Vote Leave expected, but the government has not given up and today Philip Hammond, the chancellor, and David Davis, the Brexit secretary, are both in Germany speaking to business figures and making the case that a wide-ranging free trade deal will be in Germany’s own interests. My colleagues Lisa O’Carroll and Philip Oltermann have written an overnight preview story. The two cabinet ministers have got a joint article in Frankfurter Allgemeine. It makes many of the usual arguments about the importance of keeping trade barriers to a minimum after Brexit, but Hammond and Davis also make a relatively new claim in relation to the City; the EU will put financial stability at risk if they block the City from access to the single market, they argue. They write: The economic partnership should cover the length and breadth of our economies including the service industries — and financial services. Because the 2008 Global Financial Crisis proved how fundamental financial services are to the real economy, and how easily contagion can spread from one economy to another without global and regional safeguards in place. That is why the UK has worked with our partners in the EU to ensure we led the world in making the regulation and supervision of finance safer. In particular, we’ve sought to ensure that financial authorities across the world can cooperate in rule-setting and supervising systemically important global firms, to make sure such a catastrophe doesn’t happen again. That work shouldn’t end because the UK is leaving the EU. On the contrary, we must re-double our collective effort to ensure that we do not put that hard-earned financial stability at risk, by getting a deal that supports collaboration within the European banking sector, rather than forcing it to fragment. Hammond is delivering a speech in Berlin, but it is not due until this evening. Here is the agenda for the day. 11.30am: David Lidington takes questions in the Commons for the first time in his new role as Cabinet Office minister. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQ for the first time this year. Around 1pm: MPs begin a debate on a Labour motion on the NHS. Later there will be a debate on the East Coast rail franchise bailout. 2pm: Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, meets Brexit campaigners including Leave Means Leave’s John Longworth, the independent MEP and former Ukip member Steven Woolfe, the former CBI director general Digby Jones and Labour Leave’s John Mills. Around 3.30pm: Peers debate the data protection bill. Opposition peers are threatening a vote on an amendment obliging the government to set up an inquiry into the press.

Marketed as Australia’s first foray into the Norwegian genre of slow TV, the program showed – without ad breaks – a driver’s seat view of the famous passenger train on its 3,000km trip from Adelaide to Darwin. Due to its popularity, SBS station Viceland will air the uninterrupted 17 hours from 2.40am on Sunday. The three hour version “got the nation talking, trending nationally on social media, and recorded an average of 583,000 viewers in metro and regional markets throughout the three hour program, making this the highest performing SBS program in the past 12 months,” SBS said to explain the novel programming decision. The vision of outback scenery and train tracks was accompanied by text explaining the local history of each new area – with a focus on Indigenous history and early European, Chinese and Afghan immigrants. Even the 17-hour clip is an edited version. The actual journey of the Ghan goes for 54 hours and is the world’s longest passenger train, stopping at Alice Springs and Katherine over the course of three days before arriving at Darwin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/10/christians-egypt-unprecedented-persecution-report","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T13:00:48Z","webTitle":"Christians in Egypt face unprecedented persecution, report says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/10/christians-egypt-unprecedented-persecution-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/10/christians-egypt-unprecedented-persecution-report","fields":{"headline":"Christians in Egypt face unprecedented persecution, report says","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Christians in Egypt are facing unprecedented levels of persecution, with attacks on churches and the kidnap of girls by Islamist extremists intent on forcing them to marry Muslims, a report says. In the past year, Egypt has moved up an annual league table of persecution of Christians compiled by the charity Open Doors. According to its World Watch List, North Korea is still the most dangerous country in the world in which to be a Christian, and Nepal has had the biggest increase in persecution. But Egypt, home to the largest Christian community in the Middle East, is of particular worry. Officially about 10% of the 95 million population are Christian, although many believe the figure is significantly higher. The overwhelming majority are Orthodox, with up to 1 million evangelical Christians and 250,000 Catholics. Orthodox Christians celebrated Christmas on Sunday amid tight security, days after at least 11 were killed in attacks. The president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, attended midnight mass at a new cathedral 30 miles (45km) east of the capital as tens of thousands of armed soldiers patrolled streets around churches all over Egypt. According to Open Doors, 128 Christians were killed in Egypt for their faith and more than 200 were driven out of their homes in 2017. It attributed the rise in persecution to “the overspill of Islamic terrorists driven out of Iraq and Syria”. Last Easter, two church bombings killed 49 people, and another 29 were killed when extremists attacked people travelling to a monastery in May. More than 15 girls in Minya governorate were kidnapped in 2017 to be forced to marry Muslims and convert to Islam, Open Doors said. “Michael Jones”, a Cairo-based businessman and evangelical Christian, told the Guardian there was a gulf between statements from the national leadership regarding the Christian community and actions at a local level. “You hear the president speaking about Christians with a lot of respect and sympathy. Just a few days ago, he made a beautiful, emotional speech when inaugurating our new cathedral. It looked like an amazing affirmation that the state is supporting the church and the Christian community, and doing everything it can to guarantee our welfare,” said Jones, who asked for his real name not to be used. “Then you have have the local authorities in villages and towns – police, judges, business owners – and it’s evident that many of them are infected with a rejection of Christianity. You see this in daily practices – not usually violence, but discrimination.” Jones said Christians were overlooked for jobs or promotion, university students were given bad grades or failed, schoolchildren were made to sit at the back of the class, shop owners were boycotted and hospital patients were not given proper treatment. “There is only a minority of violent extremists, but the culture in Egypt cherishes the perception that Christians are infidels,” he said. The response of the Christian community was one of endurance, prayer and forgiveness, he said. “By forgiving our attackers, we’re not saying they should not be punished but retaliation and revenge is not our response. We don’t want to be part of a cycle of violence.” Jones, who is to address MPs and peers in parliament next week, said many Christians had left Egypt because of discrimination and persecution. “I have thought about leaving many times, but I believe God will take care of me. I don’t want my life defined by fear,” he said. Lisa Pearce of Open Doors said: “Christians in Egypt face a barrage of discrimination and intimidation yet they refuse to give up their faith. It is hard for us … to imagine being defined by our religion every single day in every sphere of life. “In Egypt, as in many other Middle Eastern countries, your religion is stated on your identity card. This makes discrimination and persecution easy – you are overlooked for jobs, planning permits are hard to obtain and you are a target when you go to church.” As well as highlighting persecution of Christians in Egypt, Open Doors said south-east Asia was the next emerging hotspot, fuelled by Islamist extremism in Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and the Maldives."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/12/vicar-unchained-tree-protest-hs2-work-euston","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T15:44:33Z","webTitle":"Vicar unchained from tree after protest against HS2 work at Euston","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/12/vicar-unchained-tree-protest-hs2-work-euston","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/12/vicar-unchained-tree-protest-hs2-work-euston","fields":{"headline":"Vicar unchained from tree after protest against HS2 work at Euston","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A protesting priest has been voluntarily unchained from one of 200 trees around Euston that HS2 is felling in preparation for the high-speed rail line. The Rev Anne Stevens, the vicar of neighbouring St Pancras church, was padlocked and fastened with a heavy-duty chain to a doomed century-old London plane tree. Stevens said it was a “symbolic act” and she did not expect to stay to block construction work. HS2 Ltd said it had no plans to forcibly remove the vicar before Monday, when it takes possession of the land and starts to seal off Euston Square Gardens. The park in front of Euston station contains dozens of giant London planes, which will be cut down to provide space for construction vehicles and a temporary taxi rank. Chained alongside Stevens was Jo Hurford, 46, a local parishioner and artist. Asked if she would repeat the protest when construction workers moved in, she said: “We aren’t ruling anything out.” Construction work to redevelop and expand Euston for high-speed trains is expected to last up to 17 years, adding to congestion and pollution in the area. Stevens said: “We’ve been to parliament, committees, endless meetings, it’s a last attempt to hope HS2 will see reason. I don’t entirely oppose the project but the way it’s been brought in here is devastating, and has enraged the local community. “This green space until now has offered some respite. The people losing this space are in the middle of a construction project which will have an enormous impact on air quality and their health. There is something soul-destroying about seeing so many trees lost.” Protesters accused HS2 and the government of conducting a land grab of the surrounding area, with subsequent redevelopment helping to pay for the £55bn high-speed rail network. Nearby St James Gardens, a park and a former burial ground behind the station, has been taken by HS2, and dozens of trees cut down. John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, was also among the protesters. He said the design of HS2 was causing unnecessary environmental damage: “These are beautiful trees in one of the most polluted areas of London. The HS2 line itself is threatening 100 ancient woodlands. Environmental arguments were made to switch to rail, instead of domestic flights. All we are seeing now is airport expansion and HS2.” HS2 has promised to plant more trees and to enhance some local public space, but residents fear the park will also be lost in the building of the rail network linking London, Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. A spokesperson said HS2 would create a green corridor of new woodland and habitats along the route. He said: “Supporting the natural environment is just as important to us as building stations, regenerating city centres and supporting the economy. “HS2 will provide much-needed extra capacity at Euston … while also creating thousands of jobs and acting as a catalyst for economic growth across the UK.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/jan/17/rita-sue-and-bob-too-royal-court-theatre-london","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T16:23:53Z","webTitle":"Rita, Sue and #MeToo: 'There'd be outrage if it was written today'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/17/rita-sue-and-bob-too-royal-court-theatre-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jan/17/rita-sue-and-bob-too-royal-court-theatre-london","fields":{"headline":"Rita, Sue and #MeToo: 'There'd be outrage if it was written today'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ella Carmen Greenhill (Coronation Street, Plastic Figurines) I was shocked when the Royal Court cancelled Rita, Sue and Bob Too. I know they had their day of action against sexual misconduct, which saw 150 accounts of harassment read out on stage, but this play has strong female characters, it’s written by a woman and directed by a woman. So they were right to reinstate it: we need to see Andrea Dunbar’s play in the #MeToo era. Kate Wasserberg’s production opens with a backdrop of Bradford, made to look slightly magical. You hear 80s music and think you’re going to have a laugh. Bob is driving the babysitters home and it’s clear they’re just kids. He’s got a plan – he’s bought condoms – and as soon as he asks if they are virgins, you want to scream: “Get out of that car!” So I was surprised by the audience laughing as Bob has sex with them. I mean, a bum is funny, we’ll all laugh at a bum – but then the house lights gradually come up, putting the audience on the spot, asking us how comfortable we feel watching this. There’d be outrage if it was written today: a story about a paedophile told with light-hearted comedy. The portrayal of Bob is quite complex. He’s not a monster – that would leave you thinking you’re OK as you don’t know men like that. Instead, he’s presented as this nice bloke who has given the girls a lift. Later, he cries when he tells them he has to sell his car because he’s got no work. His masculinity is threatened by unemployment. “There’s no hope for kids today and it’s all Maggie Thatcher’s fault,” he says. “She’s for the rich people, not the poor.” Change the name of the prime minister and put on different background music and it could be today. Dunbar still stands out as a young female working-class playwright. Why aren’t there more coming through today? Look at who is going to the theatre. You don’t think of writing a play if you haven’t been to the theatre yourself – and it’s difficult to feel like you belong there if you’re from a certain kind of background. It’s about entitlement - if you have the freedom to do whatever you want, then maybe you’ll write that first play. But if you’re from Rita and Sue’s world, I don’t know whether you’d think that anything you had to say was worth hearing – although of course it is, as Dunbar showed. I’m from Radford, a deprived area close to the centre of Nottingham. I don’t think there are many other playwrights who have come out of Radford. I feel the experiences I have from growing up there are an essential part of me as a writer. The play’s ending is bittersweet. Sue should be hurt by the fact that Rita has had a baby with Bob and lives with him. But you feel like the two girls are still loyal to each other even though they haven’t met up for ages. And then you find out that Rita has called her baby Sue, which is so beautiful. Really, it’s a love story between Rita and Sue. Atiha Sen Gupta (What Fatima Did, Counting Stars) That title, with its jaunty rhythm, suggests a light-hearted love triangle, and when the play was staged by Max Stafford-Clark in 1982 it was received as a tongue-in-cheek romantic comedy. But, while the text is the same, times have changed: this is a tale of grooming, underage sex and “slut-shaming”. I found the opening excruciating: 27-year-old Bob (complete with dodgy mullet) shows giggly 15-year-olds Rita and Sue how to put on a condom. The scene is realised very literally: schoolgirl socks up, Y-fronts down. Yes, the girls are as keen for “a jump” as Bob is, seduced by an older man with his own car. But are they fully able to consent? Would the audience laugh so loudly if they were 14? The play still speaks to us today, in the era of Rotherham and Weinstein. When it was cancelled at the Royal Court, in the wake of harassment allegations against Stafford-Clark and others in the entertainment industry, much was made of the “authenticity” of Dunbar as a working-class, northern, female voice. But, while Rita and Sue are certainly dynamic, rounded characters, the others are crudely drawn. Sue’s dad is a swearing, violent grump, all one-note in his rage. If a playwright from the so-called liberal metropolitan elite sketched such a character, it would rightly be dismissed as inauthentic. In this revival, Rita is Asian – which makes sense, given the play is set in Bradford. It’s also a subtle nod to the underreported fact that Asian girls, as well as their white counterparts, are subject to sexual exploitation by adult men. When Rita, Sue and Bob’s secret is found out, Dunbar captures brilliantly double standards that are still in currency. Rita and Sue are denounced as “schoolgirl sluts” by Bob’s wife, Michelle, who defends him: “If it’s put there on a plate, he’s gonna take it isn’t he? He wouldn’t be much of a man if he didn’t.” Dunbar once remarked: “You write what’s said, you don’t lie.” This semi-autobiographical play observes its characters rather than judges them. Most modern plays have a moral code built in. But I think Dunbar lets Bob off the hook at the end. April De Angelis (Jumpy, My Brilliant Friend) I remember what it was like as a teenager – becoming a sexual being but feeling disorientated, having no real information about my body. You get a sense of that alienation in the opening scene and, gradually, you realise Sue probably isn’t a virgin but maybe Rita is. You don’t know if they’re pretending or what is bravado. They’re not really owning their virginity so they’re not owning their sexuality in a way. The writer Dunbar reminds me of is Caryl Churchill, particularly her unsentimental portrayal of working-class women. Women are very good at talking but often their speech isn’t given gravitas. It’s seen as gossip or discredited. Dunbar’s women are challenging because they’re not easily likable but very direct. They have all the witty lines – like when Bob complains to Michelle about their sex life and says: “I don’t get nowt off you.” She replies: “Well, what do you fucking want? Jam on it?” That brought the house down. Bob is the focal point for all the female characters. It’s so sad when Rita and Sue argue over who is going to have sex first. You think: “Is that all they aspire to?” But they challenge him as well: he gets slapped in the face with a condom and the girls decide to change the order. They are in control in that scene, not him, and it results in him losing his erection. It’s all about who has the power. Why are there two girls instead of one? Two makes it funnier but also presents Rita and Sue as a class of young women in Thatcher’s Britain rather than individuals. And it gives the possibility of solidarity. That chimes with what #MeToo is about. When I was a young woman, there was a thing in the feminist movement where if someone grabbed you inappropriately, you called them out. I did this at a train station and a woman I didn’t know joined in with me. The play explores the strength of women speaking together. Rita, Sue and Bob Too is at the Royal Court theatre, London, until 27 January. Box office: 020-7565-5000. Then at Lawrence Batley theatre, Huddersfield, and Theatr Clwyd, Mold."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2018/jan/17/sony-ceo-kaz-hirai-aibo-ces-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T12:00:00Z","webTitle":"CEO Kaz Hirai on Sony turnaround: 'My job has been to revive pride in what we do'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/17/sony-ceo-kaz-hirai-aibo-ces-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jan/17/sony-ceo-kaz-hirai-aibo-ces-2018","fields":{"headline":"CEO Kaz Hirai on Sony turnaround: 'My job has been to revive pride in what we do'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The secret to rekindling Sony’s return to form, according to the company’s chief executive, is personalisation – achieved not by the mass collection of customer data in the way some big tech firms do, but by eliciting an emotional response to its products. “Getting in close is the only way,” says Kaz Hirai, who took the helm of Sony five-and-half-years ago charged with turning the company around; he has succeeded, with Sony projecting its largest-ever annual operating profit of £4.2bn this year. Hirai is a passionate believer in the Japanese concept of Kando, which is about establishing an emotional connection across what Sony calls “the last one inch” to the consumer – the wow factor that creates enthusiasm and loyalty. “My father and grandfather were Sony fanatics,” he says. “When I was about five years old, my father recorded my voice on his open reel tape deck and played it back. Hearing my own voice was a technological wonder. “We had a huge TV, but we also had a five-inch TV, and I found it wonderful that Sony could miniaturise these products.” But by the time Hirai took over as chief executive that wow factor had faded. “Sony products need to have functional and emotional value,” says Hirai, who made it his mission to apply Kando across every business unit and revive faded glory. “Anybody can provide functional value in this commoditised space, but emotional value is something that has been part of the Sony design philosophy, part of the Sony DNA since the company started 71 years ago. We kind of lost it for a while, and my job has been to revive that pride in what we do in terms of providing emotional value.” Aibo, Sony’s revived robotic dog, embodies Kando, showcasing Sony’s AI and robotics by replicating some of the endearing qualities of a real dog. Aibo can recognise faces and voices, while sensors on his head, chin and back mean that it responds physical stimuli. Hands on fire-fighting “If there’s a challenge, organisationally or financially, I have to get in there and do it myself,” Hirai says. “When businesses are running well, we have fine executives who can run them day to day. But when the fires are up, somebody’s got to get in there and do the hard work, stop the fires and turn the business around.” Hirai’s hands-on approach to leadership extends to the highly-charged environment of Hollywood, which has been rocked by the recent sexual harassment scandals, where he sought to extend Sony’s positive corporate culture following Sony’s own damaging leaked email scandal in 2014. “At Sony, we have absolute zero tolerance not just for sexual harassment, but for any type of harassment,” he says. “We want to provide a safe, comfortable and trusting environment for our employees all over the world. “We have about 120,000 employees and we have policies in place to ensure that employees and management understand that we have zero tolerance for any of this stuff and if there are infractions, employees should feel comfortable reporting them to management as quickly as possible in the knowledge that each and every one of these incidents will be investigated, and if appropriate action needs to be taken, it will be taken very swiftly. We have a good policy in place, and we continue reinforcing it.” From February to August last year, when Hirai was looking for a new head for Sony Pictures Entertainment following the departure of Michael Lynton to Snapchat, hespent two weeks a month at the studio in Culver City, California. “I wanted to get to know the business better,” he says. “I wanted to be able to have an intelligent dialogue with potential candidates so that I could answer their questions and say here are some things I expect you to do.” While he was there, he took the opportunity to walk the floor, meeting rank-and-file employees to understand their issues and motivations. “Sony Pictures is a big lot, and I didn’t want to zip by in a golf cart. I wanted people to see me walking from one end of the studio to the other meeting and greeting employees.” “Through these interactions, I got the message across to them that the president of the organisation from Tokyo was willing to spend two weeks a month getting to understand it and finding it the right CEO. And the culture at Sony Pictures Entertainment has shifted because people understand that Tokyo has got their back.” Great design should remain unchanged Hirai has turned around every business he has led. In 2006, when he became president of Sony Computer Entertainment, PlayStation reported losses of ¥230bn following the PS3 debacle. Hirai turned the business around and brought in new management, who produced the phenomenally successful PS4. Central to Hirai’s strategy is creating enduring brands, which involved shifting Sony’s design culture. When Hirai became chief executive, as is typical in consumer electronics, every product iteration would include a redesign. “I sat down with the managers of each major product category and said to them, ‘if you think it’s a great design, don’t change it. Be proud of what you did, and be proud enough to stick with it.’ “It’s a cultural change that we brought about. It shows Sony’s respect for the products we make. If it’s good enough for the customers, it should be good enough for us not to change designs every year. That is how we create emotional value.” This approach has proved particularly effective with the company’s high-end RX cameras and headphones brands. But away from consumer electronics, Sony’s focus has shifted towards AI and robotics, image sensors (via its semiconductor business) and PlayStation, which has 70 million users worldwide. Hirai is not complacent about PlayStation’s lead in gaming or Sony Pictures’ string of hit movies. “Sony Pictures has had some great hits this year, but they need a sustainable model. We had a hit with Spider-Man [Homecoming] last year, and that means that we get to do a lot of business with DVDs, Blu-rays and licensing of Spiderman this year and beyond. How successful you are or not in year one determines the business in year two and year three going forward, and then it’s staggered. It is a complex business.” The company is seeking new applications for its AI, sensors and robotics in autonomous vehicles. The firm says, for instance, that its market-leading image sensors can help vehicles “see” better than humans, with wide-angle lenses for better visibility and the ability to adjust instantly to low or changing light conditions. Hirai announced partnerships with leading automotive manufacturers at CES in Las Vegas, but admits that this is still a nascent venture that isn’t expected to bring in revenue for several years. “For now, the main drivers of the image-sensor business are smartphones, digital cameras and some surveillance and IoT [Internet of Things]. We need to make sure that we have a stable business today so that we can segue into the automotive tomorrow.” Sony’s image sensors are used in leading smartphone brands – Hirai jokes about supplying “little” companies in Cupertino, South Korea and China – but its own smartphones struggle outside Japan. Some have suggested Sony Mobile should throw in the towel, but Hirai disagrees: “The reason we’re doing that is not because we think smartphones are the future, but because we have to have some devices connected to a network in order to communicate. If we get out of the [communications] space, we won’t have the opportunity to play in the next paradigm shift.” “It’s not about the smartphones of today; it’s more about looking beyond smartphones – at what are we going to be doing – and to be a player in this space; ideally to be a leader. For that strategic reason, I want to make sure we stay, not in the smartphone business, per se, but in the communications business.” Sony’s restructuring appears to be paying off, reporting what analysts called “blowout results” for the second quarter based on a mix of old and new business, and projecting full-year profits up 20% on last year - quite a change from an organisation in decline reporting £3bn losses when Hirai took over. But he is not complacent: “This is not the time to be doing a victory lap because we still have another quarter to go before the end of the fiscal year. We have to make sure we hit the numbers or even do better. That’s job one. Job two is to ensure that we don’t fall off the cliff next year, as we’ve done that in the past.” While Hirai may not believe that smartphones are the future, and his focus for 2018 is sustainable profit, Sony is still open to new technology, whichever path that takes. “We need to make sure we are proactively investing for future businesses in terms of technology as well as business models, so that we can leave the company in better shape as we hand it off to the next generation,” said Hirai."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/27/boy-12-internet-porn-keep-safe-annalisa-barbieri","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T09:00:45Z","webTitle":"Should my friend block her 12-year-old son’s access to pornography?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/27/boy-12-internet-porn-keep-safe-annalisa-barbieri","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/27/boy-12-internet-porn-keep-safe-annalisa-barbieri","fields":{"headline":"Should my friend block her 12-year-old son’s access to pornography?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My friend’s 12-year-old son has recently discovered online pornography, and she’s struggling to find advice on how to support him. To my mind, she is doing everything right – being positive and supportive, and not disciplining him overly. She’s asked him if he has any questions about what he’s seen, and explained the harmful side of pornography as well as the truth behind how the images are produced. She’s also limited access to his phone and the family iPad and keeps devices downstairs at night. But she can’t monitor him 24 hours a day, and she’s concerned about the impact the images could have on him emotionally – and that he might accidentally stray into something extreme. She’s looking into installing protective software but doubts how effective this will be. Do you have any advice on software to prevent him accessing pornography, or suggestions on forums or organisations she could go to for advice? How should she support him emotionally? She doesn’t want to suppress his developing sexuality or make him feel ashamed, but does need him to be safe and supported. Parental controls come free from most broadband providers and can be helpful for very young children. I took them off our home computers because they don’t allow children to learn how to navigate the internet safely – and children won’t always be on their “safe” computer at home. Far better to have regular conversations about these things and make sure screens are used in view, and not hidden away. I think your friend has done lots of the right things, not least in refusing to freak out. Pornography is an emotive subject, but overreacting isn’t going to help; if he is humiliated, or becomes scared of her, it won’t stop him watching it, but it will stop him talking about it. I contacted Ann Horne, a child and adolescent psychotherapist (childpsychotherapy.org.uk) and John Carr, secretary of the Children’s Charities’ Coalition on Internet Safety. Carr also writes a blog on technology, with an emphasis on security and safety. Apart from the standard parental controls, your friend can go down the software-blocking route. Carr said that most well-known filtering packages are very good: “The big-brand names in the UK are McAfee, Norton, Net Nanny, Kaspersky and Symantec.” Horne made a good point: where are the men in this scenario? It could be that you omitted to mention them, but a 12-year-old boy may not be comfortable talking about this to his mum. And, if he’s uncomfortable talking to his dad, she wondered if there is a trusted male friend or family member whom he would feel able to chat to. “Usually boys of that age are discovering their sexuality and what excites and what shocks them,” she said. The issue with internet pornography is that “it’s not like flicking through Playboy – the visual impact can be shocking: it hits you, rather than you sneaking up on it.” Is your friend’s son generally happy, with a good set of friends? Or is he a loner seeking out pornography that is shocking and traumatising? This can help to build a picture, so that you can judge whether his actions warrant a pastoral conversation or something more. If a teen shuts himself away and accesses extreme pornography, that would hint at something darker going on; then you would be looking at outside involvement from a child psychologist or therapist. Restricting devices may be helpful but simply taking his away wouldn’t really work (although it’s a popular choice), and I would argue it may make things worse if the child is troubled, because he will find other ways to get what he wants. Ultimately what’s important is to establish that he has someone calm and non-judgmental to go to if he’s worried about what he’s seen; that he knows how to report something; that he’s aware of scams (which can ask teenagers for money “to stop us telling your parents you’ve accessed pornography”); and that he understands what is legal and what isn’t. And, of course, that he understands what constitutes a normal, consensual relationship. There’s a really great video on Childline (Porn: Fantasy vs Reality), which does that job, and should be the first port of call for any teenager or parent.

Sales were up 33% at Christmas as shoppers bagged vintage and designer clothes for the party season but the company is not listed on the stock exchange like the web giant Asos and there is no chance of it ever being taken over. And if you look closely some of the clothes might seem familiar. In fact they might actually be your clothes – because Oxfam has emerged as an unlikely rising star of the UK’s fast-growing online fashion scene as it casts an increasingly canny eye over the branded cast-offs and vintage styles dumped in bin bags on its shops’ doorsteps every day. “It is a big secret but when people hear about our website they are really intrigued,” says Oxfam trading director Andrew Horton who wants to double the size of the web operation to reach 10% of retail sales over the next three years. The website is run out of a cavernous warehouse in Batley, West Yorkshire. The building is home to Wastesaver, the charity’s sorting and recycling centre, where every week 50 paid staff sift though 80 tonnes of clothing delivered to its door. “The shops get donations every day,” explains Horton. “If we don’t have the logistics in place to collect donations they can get clogged up. Some shops only have small stock rooms and we don’t like to turn donations away.” The 80,000 sq ft warehouse, which is a short drive away from web giant Asos’s hub in Barnsley, receives drops of clothing every weekday. The bags are tipped on to conveyor belts which pickers scan for the most saleable items, dropping them into white sacks labelled by category “shoes”, “retro”, “leather”. There is also a second sorting centre in Milton Keynes. The sacks are then passed on to a small team who are surrounded by moodboards created by fashion students which alert them to the latest trends so that they can select them for the online shop. Duster jackets and ponchos are expected to be very big in 2018, along with graphic bags, leather gloves and anything in acid yellow. There are more than 125,000 one-off products listed on the Oxfam website, a vast catalogue that includes books as well as music and clothing. At Christmas the most searched for brands on the website included Barbour, Gucci, Whistles and Boden. At the moment a trawl of Oxfam’s designer boutique turns up a silk Hermès scarf, with a £190 price tag, and a Burberry trench coat for £110. “I was in Batley to help pack Christmas orders and one was a Karl Lagerfeld jacket from the 80s,” says Horton. “We always take the view that people who donate want us to try and raise as much money as we can. Generally that’s about a third of the retail cost. The Lagerfeld jacket was £75 and people who like vintage clothing will know that is a good price.” The site’s fashion credentials were boosted by Oxfam’s first catwalk show at London fashion week in 2017 where models paraded the cream of its “preloved” clothes. The charity is repeating the exercise this year with stylist Bay Garnett currently assembling the collection. In the neighbouring warehouse to Wastesaver a team of volunteers is tasked with giving the clothes the Asos treatment, by photographing them on mannequins and uploading their descriptions on the website. About half of Oxfam’s 620 stores perform this task themselves and the charity is investing in technology to speed up what is a time-consuming process. Some of the desirable items unearthed by Wastesaver staff are sent back to shops that don’t receive enough donations, including branches in Cleveleys, Guisborough and Bury. More outlandish items, and anything screaming fancy dress, are saved for Oxfam’s festival pop-up shops at Glastonbury and Bestival. Just 3% of the clothes sorted in Batley are returned to stores or sold online with the remainder diverted overseas or recycled. The summery stuff in decent nick, plus any old bras, is rolled up into hay-style bales and sold to Frip Ethique, Oxfam’s west African social enterprise. Winter clothes that UK shoppers may dismiss — such as supermarkets’ own brands which are almost as cheap to buy new — are packed off to eastern Europe. For clothes that have reached the end of their wearable life the future is shoddy rather than shabby chic. Oxfam sells its leftovers to recycling companies who turn them into the cheap woollen yarn used to make carpet underlay or car seat linings. It was a tough Christmas for the UK retailers but Oxfam recorded like-for-like sales growth of 1.6%. Total sales were up 1.2%, raking in £16.9m in the eight weeks to 23 December. The figures are a drop in the ocean compared with high street giants such as Marks &amp; Spencer but with annual sales on track to exceed £74m this year, Oxfam’s success is measured not by its share price but clean water, with its progress at Christmas enough to help 200,000 people in an emergency. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/jan/12/christian-pulisic-rumors-manchester-united-liverpool","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T15:15:00Z","webTitle":"Christian Pulisic has succeeded in spite of American soccer, not because of it","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/jan/12/christian-pulisic-rumors-manchester-united-liverpool","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/jan/12/christian-pulisic-rumors-manchester-united-liverpool","fields":{"headline":"Christian Pulisic has succeeded in spite of American soccer, not because of it","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Christian Pulisic is already at one of the biggest soccer clubs in Europe. Borussia Dortmund are perennial Bundesliga challengers, consistent performers at Champions League level and average crowds of just under 80,000 fans per game, but still, this is only viewed as a rung on the young American’s ladder to the top. That says a lot about what is expected of Pulisic. He is a superstar in-waiting. Indeed, the 19-year-old’s upward trajectory is predicted to swing even higher than Dortmund, with Europe’s elite perpetually reported to be interested in the attacker. Transfer speculation has become part of Pulisic’s day-to-day life over the past two seasons, with Manchester United the latest to be linked with a move for the teenager this week. The Old Trafford side, it’s reported, are ready to go up against long-time suitors Liverpool for Pulisic as Jose Mourinho looks to add something different to his attack. Any big money move to the Premier League for Pulisic would send a familiar narrative into overdrive. You’d read countless takes about the ‘American Messi’, about the biggest untapped soccer nation in the world finally producing its first genuine great. If Pulisic thought the pressure, which this week he admitted can get “too much”, weighed heavy at Dortmund, just wait until he ends up at a Man United or a Liverpool. Of course, this narrative is grounded in an element of truth. Pulisic might already be the best American soccer player in history, becoming the face of the US men’s national team as a teenager. But his rise, which would reach meteoric proportions with a move to the Premier League, has coincided with an extremely volatile time in the American game. There is a compelling contrast to be made. The temptation is to credit Pulisic’s success, at least in part, to US Soccer. But at a time when the sport in the country is tearing itself apart following the failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, with a presidential election being contested, this presents something of a paradox. The rise of America’s best player to date coinciding with US Soccer’s existential crisis doesn’t quite fit. That’s because Pulisic has succeeded in spite of the American game, not because of it. It’s true that Pulisic was given his elementary grounding in the game stateside, only leaving Hershey, Pennsylvania for Germany at the age of 16. He was part of the USSF’s US Soccer Development Academy, representing the States at under-15 and under-17 level. But Pulisic reached fruition and maturity elsewhere. As he wrote himself in a Players’ Tribune article, “it’s the age where a player’s growth and skill sort of intersect, in just the right way – and where, with the right direction, a player can make their biggest leap in development by far.” How many times have you read or heard someone ponder a scenario in which the USA’s best athletes played soccer over basketball or football? It’s a thought uttered so frequently, it has become the subject of derision. Ignoring the lack of nuance in such a point, though, and the central argument comes down to a perceived lack of talent in the American game. A lack of talent for US Soccer to mold. Pulisic’s success suggests this is a moot point. It’s not so much that the American game failed Pulisic, it’s that it cannot take credit for his success in a way that would conveniently counter the less than positive discussion being had by many right now. US Soccer as a governing body finds itself at a critical juncture and youth development must be a primary focus of whoever wins its presidential election. In fact, it should form the basis of every candidate’s manifesto. Rather than championing Pulisic as the embodiment of American soccer potential, lessons must be learned from the teenager’s specific case. For starters, a more effective path from youth to senior soccer must be established Stateside. Pulisic was likely lured to Germany by all the prestige and romance that comes with playing for a team like Borussia Dortmund, but he also probably saw a clear career route. Going back to that Players’ Tribune article by Pulisic, he summarized his feelings on this fundamental flaw in the structure of American soccer. “I’ve gotta say…” he wrote, “it really does frustrate me, when I watch MLS, and I see our best U-17 players – who, again, are so talented and so capable – being rostered … but then not being put on the field much to actually play. I watch that, and I just think about how I was given a chance … a real chance … and it changed my life. Why then are we seemingly hesitant to allow these other talents to blossom?” Perhaps US Soccer shouldn’t beat itself up too much. This is a common theme across all sports, not just soccer. Look at Lionel Messi, the greatest player in history, who left his homeland of Argentina for Spain as a 13-year-old. Or Andy Murray, Britain’s first Grand Slam champion in 76 years, who made the move to Barcelona to train at a similarly young age. The best young talent will always look to the best programs, and for Pulisic that could be found in Germany. The point isn’t necessarily that US Soccer should have a better youth infrastructure than Germany, a country that sets the standard for the sport as a whole, but that the example of Pulisic shows just how much more could be achieved. It’s a sporting tragedy that Pulisic won’t get a chance to play at next summer’s World Cup. The teenager is one of the brightest young talents in the game right now and deserved a platform to show that to the world. But he will get other opportunities, particularly if Man United or Liverpool come calling. Opportunities will be scarcer for others, though, and US Soccer must be in a better place to help those players take them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2018/jan/14/bbc-pay-admire-colleagues-hugely-some-earn-far-too-much","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T06:59:20Z","webTitle":"I admire my old BBC colleagues hugely.

But some earn far too much","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"When I started working for the BBC nearly 30 years ago, what I was going to get paid never even came up for discussion. I was just starting out as a freelance radio news presenter, with nearly 20 years’ experience as a journalist under my belt (including more than a decade on this newspaper), and I was simply paid per programme. The BBC set the rate, I accepted it, and that was that. It never occurred to me that had I been a woman, they might have offered me less. My earliest records date from 1991, when I was paid £260 for presenting an edition of The World Tonight on Radio 4, and £235 for Newshour on the World Service. So if I had presented three programmes a week for 46 weeks a year, I would have earned between £32,430 and £35,880 per annum, roughly equivalent to between £67,000 and £75,000 today. Compare and contrast. John Humphrys, king of Today, is paid more than £600,000 a year – or at least, he was in the year up to last April, and that did include his duties on Mastermind. He says he has taken a sizeable pay cut since then, although to judge by his secretly recorded off-air comments to a colleague, he did so less than willingly. Jeremy Vine of Radio 2 is on more than £700,000, and Eddie Mair of the PM programme is on more than £300,000. The BBC pay scandal is really three scandals in one. First, there is the gender pay gap, due to there being far more men in senior positions than women. Interestingly, many of the most impressive bosses I worked for were women, including the head of audio and music, Jenny Abramsky; the controller of Radio 4, Helen Boaden; and the head of World Service news programmes, Liliane Landor. Second, as the Carrie Gracie episode has revealed, there appears to be gender discrimination, which would be illegal and would result in women like Sarah Montague and Ritula Shah being paid substantially less than their male counterparts for doing the same job. And third, there is the undeniable fact that some of the BBC’s most senior journalists, most of them men, are being paid grotesquely inflated salaries for which there is absolutely no justification. It gives me no pleasure to write this; they are, after all, my former colleagues and many of them are extremely good at their jobs, but take them into a quiet corner somewhere and they will admit that I am right. Full disclosure: when I left the BBC in 2012, I was being paid £135,000 a year to present both The World Tonight and Newshour. I did not complain that I was overpaid (does anyone?), nor did I check whether my female colleagues were on the same rates. I now know that they were not, and I deeply regret that it never occurred to me to ask. But nor did I ask how my pay compared with, say, Eddie Mair’s. If I had known he was getting more than twice as much as I was, I might well have felt hard done by, even though I am among his most devoted admirers. So why has BBC journalists’ pay gone haywire, and what can be done to put it right? Until recently, most news presenters were freelances who negotiated their own pay, either directly or through their agents. Correspondents, on the other hand, were employees, on set salary scales. It is no coincidence that the BBC’s two male international editors, who are both paid substantially more than ex-China editor Carrie Gracie or Europe editor Katya Adler, have both worked previously as presenters (North America editor Jon Sopel on The Politics Show, and Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen on BBC Breakfast). Neither will have taken a pay cut when they returned to reporting. True, Gracie has also worked as a presenter, but only on the News Channel and the BBC World Service, where pay levels are far lower than on BBC1 or BBC2. I used to have some sympathy with the BBC’s argument that it has to pay “market rates” to keep its best journalists on board – but I have changed my mind. If a senior BBC journalist is offered a better-paid job by a rival broadcaster, I now think the response should simply be: “Good luck.” Did the BBC suffer grievous harm when economics editor Robert Peston jumped ship to join ITV? Or when both Nick Robinson and his successor as BBC political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, moved briefly from the BBC to ITV before being enticed back again? The truth is it managed just fine, for the simple reason that there are dozens of equally talented, younger journalists only too happy to step into the breach. Does Kuenssberg “deserve” more than £200,000 a year? Does Robinson, now on the Today programme, “deserve” more than £250,000? Perhaps it is unfair to single them out. So what about Andrew Marr on more than £400,000? Or Huw Edwards on more than £550,000? I have worked with – and respect – all of them, and although I have never discussed pay with them (God forbid!), I strongly suspect they would find it hard to defend what they are paid. Humphrys, to his credit, admitted as much when asked to explain his own salary. “I’m not sure I could explain it, to be absolutely honest.” So the answer is simple: full pay transparency, and a pay cap for all BBC journalists, male and female, whether in the studio or in the field, of £150,000 a year, with extra allowances payable for exceptional difficulty or danger (Bowen, Lyse Doucet, Orla Guerin, Quentin Sommerville, and, yes, Gracie). And with apologies to some of my better-paid former colleagues, if it means you have to take a sizeable pay cut, by all means try your luck elsewhere. It is time to stop trying to defend the indefensible.

James Vince, for all his seductive talent, is the antonym of a Test No3. There will be more calls for Joe Root to move up, though few captains have had long-term success in that position – Ricky Ponting is a spectacular exception – and there’s a reason why Steve Smith and Virat Kohli bat No4. Dawid Malan has the temperament and adaptability, though exposing him to high-class new-ball bowling might kill the golden goose. Should the chosen No3 struggle in New Zealand, England might consider moving Cook down the order for the summer series against Pakistan and India. It would give him the stimulation of a fresh challenge and England a bridge between the openers and the middle order. Haseeb Hameed or Keaton Jennings could then come in alongside Mark Stoneman. And if nothing else, it would be a creative way to end the search for Cook’s opening partner. 2)Pick a specialist spinner Moeen Ali is a role model in need of a role. He was picked as a temporary solution to England’s spin-bowling problems in 2014 and is still doing the job. Unless England are to embrace a more flexible approach to selection, which would allow Moeen to be a priceless utility player whose role and selection would depend on conditions and confidence, they surely need to clarify his position. All things being equal, England should consider him as a batsman who bowls – even if that means he doesn’t make it into the first XI in New Zealand – and pick a specialist spinner. The situation is complicated by the absence of a must-pick spinner and the wild fluctuations in Moeen’s performance levels: he was England’s best player last summer and their worst this winter. It also depends on other decisions. If Malan moves to No3, say, Moeen has a much greater chance of staying in the team as a middle-order batsman. For most of his Test career he has been an adorable but often insubstantial loose cannon down the order; a glorified bits-and-pieces player. It’s not his fault, but Moeen has become a symbol of a short-term thinking that probably needs to stop. 3) Prepare for life without Branderson In the next few years England will lose two bowlers with around 1,000 Test wickets and a combined bowling IQ approaching 300. Though Jimmy Anderson is 35 and Stuart Broad 31, recent performances suggest it’s unlikely there will be four years between their retirements. Losing two great bowlers in quick succession can do untold damage, as Australia (Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne) and West Indies (Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh) found out. And while fast bowlers’ bodies do not give a solitary hoot about best-laid plans, England should at least try to stagger the retirements – and to prepare for them. That means giving Chris Woakes, Toby Roland-Jones and others as much experience as possible. With so many Test matches squashed together in the next two years, England might do well to think less of Anderson and Broad and more of Anderson or Broad. 4) Prioritise Test cricket English Test cricket could really use a hug right now. It’s severely homesick, down in the dumps and, for the first time since it became a big brother on 5 January 1971 with the birth of one-day internationals, it’s not even the most popular sibling in the family. All anyone keeps talking about is how dynamic and successful the white‑ball twins have become. It would have been naive of the England and Wales Cricket Board chiefs to think they could improve England’s one-day cricket so spectacularly without a knock-on effect on the Test team. Yet the extent and speed of that impact must have surprised them. There are a few potential solutions to consider, both short-term (specialist coaches for the red- and white-ball teams, even before Trevor Bayliss’s departure in 2019) and particularly long‑term (playing the County Championship at the height of summer on flatter pitches; using a Kookaburra ball; giving a long run in the side to potential stars such as Mason Crane, Hameed, Liam Livingstone and Sam Curran). But with the Ashes and the World Cup in 2019, it could be a while before Test cricket emerges from the shadow of its younger siblings. 5) Find an X-factor bowler “Raw Pace and Mystery Spin” would be a good title for an existential play about a series of England captains tormented unto madness by recurring dreams of 82mph right-arm seamers. If England are to compete overseas they need to invest in some players with more transferable skills, whether it is the leg‑spin of Crane (or a high-class finger spinner such as Graeme Swann and Nathan Lyon), the pace of Mark Wood, Jamie Overton or Olly Stone, or even the left‑handedness of Sam Curran. They could even have an unofficial quota system: every Test XI or squad would have to include at one least wildcard. It’s radical, and would invite ridicule; but then so does losing consecutive away series 4-0. If England don’t do something to ensure the recent promises of long‑term change are more than idle new year’s resolutions, we will be having the same conversation in four years’ time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2018/jan/14/fauna-review-mixed-bag-menagerie-london-international-mime-festival-circus","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T08:00:22Z","webTitle":"Fauna review – a mixed-bag menagerie","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/14/fauna-review-mixed-bag-menagerie-london-international-mime-festival-circus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jan/14/fauna-review-mixed-bag-menagerie-london-international-mime-festival-circus","fields":{"headline":"Fauna review – a mixed-bag menagerie","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Surprising, amusing, frequently physically impressive, occasionally frustrating – Fauna is a not quite circus, almost dance and nearly theatre. Such a cross-genre mix has been a feature of the London international mime festival since it launched in 1977. One of the few forms seldom seen there is the sort of white-faced, body-stockinged, silent gestural movement – often associated with Marcel Marceau – that, for a time, seemed to epitomise the work “mime”. This year’s festival, which has just launched (and runs until 3 February), includes 16 productions (some plan to tour). They feature, variously, juggling, dance, masks, mechanical objects, recalcitrant objects, aerialists, film, magic and, even, words. Themes range from “challenging” explorations of post-traumatic stress (A Brave Face, touring until 30 May) to feelgood fantasies fit for children as well as adults (Bêtes de foire). Fauna is family-friendly. Across the initially empty space, whistles like bird calls evoke a tropical forest (the action is accompanied throughout by music created by the Australian percussive guitarist Geordie Little). On this stage, bare of everything but a trapeze and a small copse of canes (sticks topped with blocks of wood the area of the palm of a hand), five young circus performers create a world inspired by the movements of spiders, lemurs, tree frogs, birds of paradise, etc. Rather than directly imitating these animal models, the performers amalgamate their shapes and distil their qualities – inquisitiveness, combativeness, tactility – into a series of vignettes and encounters. Rhiannon and Daniel Cave-Walker attract and repel one another through springs, throws, jumps and intertwinings; Imogen Huzel hand-balances, bird-like, on the canes; Matt Pasquet’s frog- and reptile-suggesting sequences at times extend towards self-indulgence.

No longer, 12 January) bears striking and therefore credible resemblance to Tony Blair’s recent intervention (Tony Blair: timid Labour risks becoming handmaiden of Brexit, 3 January). For those who have swung behind Corbyn in the spirit of a party unity that Kettle rightly says matters, it is now time for the Labour leader to have the courage of his office to make the audacious case for as close a relationship with the EU as is possible. Readers of these pages today say a fond au revoir to the Berliner Guardian with faith in the editorial drive to embrace change while maintaining the highest journalistic integrity. Likewise, Corbyn has a chance to take inspiration from Blair’s and others’ wise pro-EU counsel to deliver an audacious plan for collaboration with a reforming and improving EU. Be it the Guardian or the EU, the format can and must change but the invaluable substance is to be safeguarded; Corbyn must use his political capital and grasp the chance to lead the UK back to the heart of an ever better EU that we can all embrace, even if the Berliner is no more. Nick Mayer Southampton • Sarah Ansell (Letters, 11 January) praises Larry Elliott on his take on buyer’s remorse for Brexit. Her view is that the EU never works in the interests of workers. But years of peace worked in the interests of us all, including workers. Safety regulations, food quality rules, workers’ rights, paternity leave and sick leave all work to the benefit of employees. In 1974, this country was the sick man of Europe and our economy was a basket case. We entered the EU and over the following years our economy improved – much to the benefit of the working class. The increase in trade benefited workers as well as bosses, and the right to travel and work meant that, in the 1980s, many tradesmen from these islands travelled into Europe for jobs – remember Auf Wiedersehen, Pet? It wasn’t science fiction. She says EU treaties have allowed the capitalist class to cut public spending, privatise and sell our assets abroad. No, that was the Tories from Thatcher onwards and has nothing to do with the EU. The rest of her letter is sadly pie in the sky, Labour cakery. An “alternative workers’ sovereignty”? What’s that? Only Corbyn understands all this, she claims. I’m 73 and have voted Labour all my life. I stood on platforms with Tony Benn, Ann Taylor, Dennis Skinner and Arthur Scargill, and fought for the left all my life. This year, more left than ever, I tore up my Labour party membership card in disgust. An insular, sloganising, Leninist little England run by a party that is eating itself and has failed in opposition (we should be creaming the Tories now) is something I no longer want to be part of.

One glance at singing guitarist Heather Baron-Gracie and drummer Ciara Doran – Gothic china dolls with yin-and-yang raven and bleached blond hair – and it’s safe to assume their music would be all po-faced, emo sturm-und-drang, that their dream gig would be the cover of Kerrang! magazine. Instead, as the Manchester four-piece launch into Television Romance, their biggest tune to date (2.9m YouTube views), Pale Waves reveal themselves to be less pale and interesting and more sly and funky. Baron-Gracie is letting some guy down gently – “You and I haven’t got it / Television romance” – but the tune is pure pop, the guitar lines bejewelled, and the uptight bass harks back to the era of Whitney Houston’s I Wanna Dance With Somebody. The women – Baron-Gracie and Doran – are the prime movers. Bassist Charlie Wood, poached from another Manchester band, and guitarist Hugo Silvani, a veteran of less ambitious outfits, are the capable, ungothic hands hired to fulfil the pair’s creative vision. That vision is playing out nicely: Pale Waves placed fifth on the BBC’s bellwether Sound of 2018 poll, one of only two guitar bands of 16 hopefuls. Doran is producing the band’s debut album, currently being recorded. They’re touring all spring and into the festival season. Pale Waves are primed and ready to be obsessed over by an audience for whom visual genre cues are a vestigial concern. For now, though, there is a throat-clearing four-song EP, All the Things I Never Said, and songs like My Obsession. Tonight, it exhibits some black-clad leanings. “When death comes you should be heaven’s obsession,” sings Baron-Gracie. But it also sounds like someone has left a vintage Walkman to play Don Henley’s The Boys of Summer underneath the stage. Songs like Kiss and The Tide, meanwhile, join the dots between white funk, the Cure and Taylor Swift – dots that were not hugely obvious until Baron-Gracie and Doran traced them with eyeliner. Someone did get there first, though: Pale Waves’ labelmates and mentors, the 1975 – another Manchester guitar band who decided 80s funk-pop was the new indie guitar rock, and promptly scored a No 1 album not just in the UK but the US with I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware of It (2016). They are now readying their hotly anticipated follow-up, Music for Cars. The 1975 produced two of Pale Waves’ early singles – There’s a Honey and Television Romance – and 1975 singer Matt Healy directed the nicely turned video for the latter. Pretty much every Pale Waves song recalls the 1975, and maybe even one specific 1975 song – She’s American. While Baron-Gracie and Doran might look like they love the gloom, Pale Waves are going to have to work hard to emerge from their mentors’ shadow. Their pop songs are strong, though. Recent single New Year’s Eve captures the angst of that overhyped party night with an earworm of a melody. Its eloquent uncertainty – Pale Waves’ most discernible theme – is repeated on swirly set closer There’s a Honey. “I would give you my body, but am I sure that you want me?” sings Baron-Gracie – only to be cut short by a good-natured stage invasion."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"healthcare-network/2018/jan/23/patients-put-danger-poor-nhs-tech-created-app-help","type":"article","sectionId":"healthcare-network","sectionName":"Healthcare Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T09:47:22Z","webTitle":"'Patients are put in danger by poor NHS tech.

I wanted to change that’ “When you experience IT in the NHS, you feel like you’re walking back into a disorganised version of the 1980s,” says Lydia Yarlott. “People say things like, ‘Oh well, there’s no way of referring this person unless you send us a fax’. Then you end up spending an hour trying to work a fax machine. The amount of wasted time would really shock people.” It’s not just wasted time – the situation is dangerous for patients, says Yarlott: “Tech gets in the way of caring for your patients. I have 10 logins a day at work. One system will stop working. It makes you feel alone. In what business would you, in a crisis, not be able to contact the person you really needed? That happens every day in the NHS. Patients are put in danger because of the lack of tools we have available.” So junior doctors have turned to WhatsApp and Snapchat to get around the problem, which raises issues about security and confidentiality. With a team of junior doctor colleagues, Yarlott set about solving some of the tech challenges she faced. Forward App, which supports complex and secure communications, is the result. The app comprises a directory of contacts so that junior doctors can find the relevant person when they need them, which, says Yarlott, is currently impossible. It also acts as a notebook to replace the scribbled notes that fill doctors’ pockets. “The idea isn’t very innovative at all. It’s just technology that is used ubiquitously across other sectors and applying it to the NHS,” she says. The app is still in the testing phase but is being rolled out at Medway NHS foundation trust and potentially another two or three trusts in the near future, says Yarlott. However, she says: “The NHS is encouraging this kind of project and there is a sense that there’s a need to change because the system is crumbling. In terms of implementing that, there aren’t the protocols in place. If you want to change something, you’re looking at a five-year procurement cycle.” The speech and language therapist: ‘There’s a lack of speech therapists trained to work with trans women. I created an app to help’ “NHS IT systems aren’t innovative and don’t allow me to do great practice,” says Sam Brady. “That’s what led me to designing apps to improve [my work].” One of the five apps Brady has developed, in partnership with her husband, who has a professional background in IT, caters for the growing numbers of transgender patients using the NHS. In the trust where she works, there are two therapists trained in working with trans women. However, there is a nationwide shortage of therapists with the skills to treat transgender voice. Brady explains: “Christella Antoni is the leading speech therapist in transgender voice in the UK. She runs courses about once a year, so not many therapists can attend. A lot of trusts are cutting back on funding and so lots of patients won’t be able to access her techniques. They sit on waiting lists that are around one to two years long to have an initial assessment.” Brady teamed up with Antoni to make her training accessible to a wider audience by including it in the Christella VoiceUp app. Now, patients and therapists can access the training and exercises. “Before I developed a series of apps, [at my trust] we didn’t use them or recommend them,” says Brady. “Now we can show patients what they can do at home. It facilitates people with their therapy.” She adds: “Apps make my time with patients much more effective because things can be done quicker. I can also reach other therapists who don’t have the same skills. The apps have all been developed to help me in my work. They make me a better speech therapist.” The physiotherapist: ‘I developed an award-winning app to help patients but would have given up if I’d relied on the NHS to help’ Myra Robson, who specialises in pelvic health, was talking to a friend who owned a tech company about the most difficult thing in her job, when the idea for her award-winning app was born. Robson told her friend that getting patients to remember their exercises was challenging: “Pelvic floor exercises are a critical part of what we do in pelvic health. My friend said he could do an app to help with that.” The pair set about developing a prototype. Although the funding Robson thought she had secured fell through, the company liked the idea so much it created the app for free. Since then, the Squeezy app has notched up more than 65,000 sales worldwide. It has had excellent reviews, feedback from users suggests that it improves compliance with exercises and it helps spread the word that this stigmatised group of conditions is treatable. Robson says it would have been impossible to do alone, and that she wasn’t able to develop the idea during work time (she works part-time). It took a member of the tech team one week to fulfil all the requirements to get Squeezy into the NHS app store. “It was a huge piece of work. Had it been up to me, I would have failed. So much of it was a really challenging and expensive process,” says Robson. She adds: “I think if the NHS wants innovation, the situation has to change. In an individual trust, people can’t get the support they need to put their ideas into action. If I hadn’t been so determined and had the tech company do it for me, I would have given up.” Join the Healthcare Professionals Network to read more pieces like this.

The Belfast-based libel and privacy expert Paul Tweed has also told the Guardian his office was being “deluged” by inquiries from people who claim naked and compromising pictures had been posted on Facebook, Twitter and other sites. Tweed said this was in addition to a “very significant number of cases” his Belfast office was already dealing with in relation to complaints about revenge porn being posted on social networks. “Because Facebook, Twitter and other social media giants have their European headquarters in Dublin most of these cases will be heard in the Dublin courts. There are quite a number pending and the settlement in the case last week at Belfast high court will undoubtedly have a bearing on them.” Facebook reached a confidential settlement with a 14-year-old girl this week who sued them after a photo of her was posted on a so-called “shame page” on the site. The child’s legal team took on the case after her photo appeared several times between November 2014 and January 2016. She alleged misuse of private information, negligence and breaching the Data Protection Act. Her lawyers at McCann and McCann solicitors claimed the settlement had “moved the goalposts” in terms of how social media networks such as Facebook would have to respond to indecent and abusive messages and images being posted on their sites. “The social networks’ presence in Dublin also means they are subject not only to Irish laws but also European privacy legislation, which entails they could be sued anywhere in Europe over this issue of so-called revenge porn,” they said. Tweed said Facebook already has an algorithm that has removed naked images, after the site took down the image of the nine-year-old Vietnamese girl Kim Phuc running away from an American napalm attack in 1972. “It was an algorithm that picked up that image and censored it initially and it is obvious that the same algorithm could easily be used to filter out naked pictures of people that are posted for more sinister reasons on Facebook. The network cannot argue it doesn’t have the power to filter out these images,” he said. The international outrage forced Facebook to reinstate the image on its site. Tweed said he was unable to reveal further details of the cases pending in the Irish Republic to protect the privacy of his clients. He established his own practice last summer and opened a new office after 39 years as a senior partner in the Johnsons law firm. Part of the reason for opening new premises and recruiting a larger legal team was due to the increase in the number of cases being taken against social media giants, he said. Facebook said that it has developed new technological tools to help victims of so called revenge porn and that the network takes the issue seriously. A spokesperson for the social network site said that a “Report” element on Facebook could be used by victims. The Facebook spokesperson said that clicking on this and reporting the posting of intimate or indecent images would lead to new “specially trained representatives from our Community Operations team” to remove personal and offensive material.Facebook would use new “photo-matching technologies” to prevent the further sharing of images on the networks, the spokesperson said. On the Belfast high court case this week, the Facebook spokesperson added: “This case has been ongoing for several years. For legal reasons, we are only at liberty to state that no judgment has been rendered in this case and that there has been no determination of any actual or potential liability for Facebook.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2018/jan/12/losing-motivation-stay-strong","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T15:40:23Z","webTitle":"Losing motivation?

Of course, you might just need a break, or a day off – and that’s absolutely the right thing to do. But if it’s less tiredness and more a general motivational dip, then running and cycling website Strava might have some tips for you. Data from its members (and given we are talking about 1 million new athletes joining every 40 days, that’s a fair sample size) suggests some ways in which you might find the grit you need. Its key findings may not be rocket science, but everyone needs a prompt now and again. So on that note: Exercise with friends: the athlete’s social network suggests that exercising with a mate leads to people being 22% more active than staying solo. Likewise, joining a club leads to a massive 46% boost of energy. Setting a specific goal makes a big difference and, interestingly, that effect doesn’t wear off when the goal is done and dusted: 92% of users who set a January race goal last year were still active 10 months on. Train in the morning: people who are most regularly active are likely to exercise in the morning. While there may be a ‘chicken and egg’ effect here, it’s certainly true that during the winter months, many of us feel less inclined to hit the pavements or a class once darkness hits. Start run or bike commuting. Even outside the office running (or biking) people who commute under their own steam are 43% more active at the weekends."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/14/hollywood-still-doesnt-get-it-jessica-chastain","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T00:05:12Z","webTitle":"Molly tries to shuffle the pack | Victoria Coren Mitchell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/14/hollywood-still-doesnt-get-it-jessica-chastain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/14/hollywood-still-doesnt-get-it-jessica-chastain","fields":{"headline":"Molly tries to shuffle the pack","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Can Hollywood fix itself? Is that already happening? Let’s go to the cinema together and find out. It’ll have to be my local Everyman – a genteel chain where they transmit a lot of productions live from the National Theatre and sell yoghurt-coated nuts instead of Minstrels. Might not be your cup of tea. On the plus side, you can also get a cup of tea. It has to be that venue, because the trip has already happened. I’d like you to come with me on the trip I took, last week, to see Molly’s Game. The experience was complicated, raising unexpectedly intense thoughts about the topical issue of Hollywood’s women, and I’d like to talk it over with a bigger group. As my friend the Chimney Sweep would say: “Let’s have a mass debate!” The Sweep was actually with me at the cinema. He and I have held a weekly poker game for nearly 20 years, so you can imagine why we might be interested in this biopic of Molly Bloom, who ran high-stakes games in New York and Los Angeles. The Sweep loved her book. I thought the font was too small. So we were both, in our different ways, delighted when Aaron Sorkin announced a film version. Factor in that my own poker memoir, For Richer For Poorer: Confessions of a Player, has been “under option” for five years without anyone figuring out how to film it, and I was so interested to see Molly’s Game that I could barely sleep at night. Although that may just have been the noise of my teeth gnashing. I went to see it with the Chimney Sweep so that we could spend pleasurable hours afterwards discussing poker and the accuracy or otherwise of its depiction. Knowing that it couldn’t be better than The Cincinnati Kid or worse than Runner Runner, we stuffed our smuggled Minstrels into a rucksack and hurried in. Before the main feature, there were two refreshing – even exhilarating – trailers. One was for The Post (which has just opened), in which Meryl Streep plays the celebrated 1970s newspaper publisher Katharine Graham in her battle with major government corruption. The other was for I, Tonya, which opens in February, about the controversial figure skater Tonya Harding, played with challenging defiance by Margot Robbie, and her mother, played with savage comedy by Allison Janney (“I made you a champion knowing you’d hate me for it; that’s the sacrifice a mother makes”…) Even in the promo, both mother and daughter managed to be simultaneously unsympathetic and likable. Historically, in most films, women are only allowed to be one or the other. Interesting. And both these trailers were in advance of a film about Molly Bloom: a clever, determined, greedy ex-skiing champion who ran an illegal poker game! Not a cute girl running a pastry shop in a romantic comedy, nor a kooky, wise-cracking friend; not a staunch/frightened wife in a thriller; not a brave virgin in a horror film; a really weird and uncategorisable person. I was properly excited. On TV at home, we’ve been watching Feud: Bette and Joan on BBC iPlayer, a joyful series that relishes all the nuance of having Joan Crawford and Bette Davis reminisce about a Hollywood in which “everything written for women fell into three categories – ingenues, mothers or gorgons”, when the roles of Crawford and Davis in the 21st-century show (taken by Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon) are so juicy, unpredictable and complex. What with that, the Graham and Harding trailers and the promise of Molly’s Game, fortuitously hot on the black heels of the Golden Globes protest, it all felt like real change in the type of stories being told. Whether you think it matters or not – and maybe it doesn’t – there has been an ongoing problem with the representation of women on screen, before you even get to the weird idea that it’s such an honour to embody some lame and hackneyed “ingenue” that actresses can hardly complain about the odd rape as they wait in the queue. In British television and radio – while it’s embarrassing how little power or equality female performers continue to have – at least nobody argues that, if you want to be one of them, you shouldn’t mind if people wank on you. So, by the time Jessica Chastain skiied on to the screen in the quirky, multidimensional character of Molly Bloom, her own golden globes a thing of healthy magnificence, I was already full of hope and optimism for a more interesting and realistic world. And it’s a great film! Great performances, great dialogue, great portrait of a modern poker landscape. I loved it and recognised it. And then Molly Bloom got beaten up. Just as I was feeling all excited and happy: punch, thud, scream, bleed. I mean, zzzzzzzzz. It’s an important part of Molly’s true story, of course. But did we have to watch it in such visceral detail? Could the attack have been depicted with metaphor or sound? With anything oblique, surprising, new or imaginative? Whether it could or not, it wasn’t. On and on and on went the attack. Fists to the face. Boots to the stomach. Beautiful, proud Molly helpless on the ground. It sure showed her. And we all got to watch. What instinct is that playing to? Who is it for? I love the film but I really hated this section. Will we ever get away from glossy, sexy violence? But maybe I’m wrong. Was it actually a good, honest way to show the horrible truth of what happens to women? Maybe it was. After the beating, Molly strips off and has a long, painful shower. Like they always do on camera. She doesn’t just stay, shocked, where she is. Or go somewhere safe. Or scrunch up under the duvet. Or sit with her back to the door, making sure it’s locked. Nah. Kit off and under the water.

Countries Trump would have called ‘shitholes’","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The time and place were grim. The country’s population had doubled in a century and tillable land for farming was becoming scarce. Then came a three-year cycle of heavy rains and drought that drove many from their land, hungry, to seek new economic opportunities abroad. Faced with such hardship, 60,000 people fled during these three years to the US. Many more, in a familiar pattern, would follow those first migrants in the years to come to the communities they founded. If this story sounds utterly modern in its familiarity, it isn’t. Because the country described above is not Haiti or El Salvador or an African nation – places reportedly derided this week as “shitholes” by Donald Trump (who now denies he used precisely these words). Instead, it describes a Scandinavia – or more precisely the Sweden of the mid-1860s – whose migrants would become one of the engines of the American push west, with many settling in the prairies of the midwest. And it was not only poor Swedes who came to America looking for a better future. The reality is that migration to America has long been fuelled by grinding poverty and inequality, and the promise of something better. Irish immigrants left for broadly similar reasons to the Swedes and other Scandinavians. The 4 million Italians who arrived in America between 1880 and 1924 – half of them in the decade between 1900 and 1910 – were often from the poorest, rural backgrounds. And just as familiar as those waves of migration – and the factors driving them – is the response of nativists like Trump. The US is a nation built on migration and cheap labour from disadvantaged countries, but each nativist moment in its history has been accompanied by similar rhetoric, words that have treated an impoverished or troubled place of origin as a judgment on those fleeing, rather than seeing them simply as victims of circumstance. For the Know Nothing movement of the 1850s, and the American Party it briefly spawned – whose views have so much in common with the current anti-Muslim sentiment of Trump’s populist moment – that hostility was aimed at poor Irish Catholic migrants. It feared they would take jobs and move into positions of influence, not least in government, while maintaining allegiance to the pope. And while the Know Nothings quickly imploded over the question of slavery, they set a template for all the periodic outbreaks of nativism that would follow. The origin of migrants, it would argued again and again by populist politicians, made them inferior. Their arrival threatened jobs and their tendencies were criminal. Their beliefs were inimical to traditional American values. Twenty years after the Know Nothings, the same sentiment re-emerged as fear of Chinese immigrant labour, gaining enough traction to see the passage in 1882 of the Chinese Exclusion Act severely limiting future immigration and barring Chinese residents from obtaining US citizenship – the first major piece of US anti-immigration legislation. That in turn would be followed by the Immigration Acts of 1921 and 1924 restricting the immigration of European and Asian immigrants. If Trump’s “shithole” comments are unsurprising it is because he has built a political movement on these kinds of judgments. It was of Mexico, during his the campaign, that he suggested “when [it] sends its people, they’re not sending their best … they’re bringing crime … they’re rapists”. For Trump, like the American nativist movements that preceded him, only the white and wealthy are attractive as new Americans – like the wealthy Norwegians of today – not the Scandinavians of the 1860s. What he forgets – perhaps more likely doesn’t know – is that America was built by those migrating from what a Trump of that era would have doubtless called “shitholes”. • Peter Beaumont is a Guardian correspondent"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"global-development/2018/jan/12/woman-nepal-dies-exiled-outdoor-hut-period-menstruation","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T14:04:33Z","webTitle":"Woman in Nepal dies after being exiled to outdoor hut during her period","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jan/12/woman-nepal-dies-exiled-outdoor-hut-period-menstruation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/jan/12/woman-nepal-dies-exiled-outdoor-hut-period-menstruation","fields":{"headline":"Woman in Nepal dies after being exiled to outdoor hut during her period","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A woman has died in a remote village in Nepal because of a controversial tradition that means menstruating women are required to sleep in huts. Temperatures in Nepal can fall below zero degrees celsius in the winter months, but women are still forced to sleep in outdoor sheds that are often poorly insulated and unheated. Government administrator Tul Bahadur Kawcha said the 21-year-old woman is believed to have died from smoke inhalation after lighting a fire to keep warm. The Hindu tradition of consigning menstruating women to sleep outside stems from fear that they will anger the gods or contaminate the home if they remain indoors. In rural areas, it is widely believed that failure to observe the practice will lead to bad fortune in the form of death or sickness among family members or livestock. While married women usually stay outside for only a few days, others remain banished for up to a week. Kawcha said menstrual exclusion is still common practice in remote villages, despite a supreme court ban and the imminent introduction of a law to punish anyone guilty of enforcing the custom with three months in prison or a fine of 3,000 Nepalese rupees ($29). The new law comes into effect in August. The news follows numerous cases of deaths in relation to menstrual exclusion. In November 2016, Dambara Upadhyay died alone after spending four nights outside. Dambara, 21, was found by her sister-in-law found with blood coming out of her nose. Though local police suggested she might have suffered a heart attack, the initial post-mortem report could not determine a cause of death. Other fatalities have been attributed to wild animal attacks, but the most common cause is smoke inhalation from fires started in an effort to keep warm. Aid workers in Nepal have encouraged people to follow safe menstrual practices but, with belief in the practice remaining deep-rooted, change has been slow. A little progress has been made, however, with some families persuaded to allow menstruating women to sleep in secluded indoor rooms and others reducing the number of days spent outside."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/12/surgeon-burned-initials-livers-two-patients-fined-simon-bramhall-assault-transplant","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T14:10:09Z","webTitle":"Surgeon who burned initials into livers of two patients fined £10,000","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/12/surgeon-burned-initials-livers-two-patients-fined-simon-bramhall-assault-transplant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/12/surgeon-burned-initials-livers-two-patients-fined-simon-bramhall-assault-transplant","fields":{"headline":"Surgeon who burned initials into livers of two patients fined £10,000","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A surgeon who burned his initials on to the livers of two patients during transplant surgery has been given a 12-month community order and fined £10,000. Simon Bramhall, 53, used an argon beam – used to stop livers bleeding during operations and to highlight an area to be worked on – to sign “SB” into his patient’s livers. The marks left by argon do not impair the liver’s function and disappear by themselves. In December, the liver, spleen and pancreas surgeon admitted two counts of assault by beating. The offences relate to the incidents on 9 February and 21 August 2013. Prosecutors accepted his not guilty pleas to the more serious charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Bramhall was first suspended from his post as a consultant surgeon at Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth hospital in 2013 after another surgeon spotted the initials during follow-up surgery on one of his patients. A photograph of the 4cm-high branding was taken on a mobile phone. Bramhall tendered his resignation the following summer amid an internal disciplinary investigation into his conduct. Speaking to the press at the time, he said marking his initials on to his patients’ livers had been a mistake. He now works for the NHS in Herefordshire. Opening the facts of the case against Bramhall, Tony Badenoch QC, prosecuting, said one of the surgeon’s victims had been left feeling violated and suffering psychological harm. “This case is about his practice on two occasions, without the consent of the patient and for no clinical reason whatever, to burn his initials on to the surface of a newly transplanted liver,” said Badenoch. Badenoch said of the initial transplant operation: “Mr Bramhall had to work exceptionally hard and use all of his skill to complete the operation. At the end of the operation he performed a liver biopsy using the argon beam coagulator, and then used it to burn his initials.” The court heard that a nurse had asked what the marks were and Bramhall replied: “I do this.” The surgeon later told police he had “flicked his wrist” and made the mark within a few seconds. “He knew that the action could cause no harm to the patient. He also said that in hindsight this was naive and foolhardy – a misjudged attempt to relieve the tension in theatre,” Badenoch said The judge, Paul Farrer QC, ordered Bramhall to carry out 120 hours of unpaid work. He told Bramhall: “Both of the operations were long and difficult. I accept that on both occasions you were tired and stressed and I accept that this may have affected your judgment. This was conduct born of professional arrogance of such magnitude that it strayed into criminal behaviour. “What you did was an abuse of power and a betrayal of trust that these patients had invested in you. I accept that you didn’t intend or foresee anything but the most trivial of harm would be caused.” The Queen Elizabeth hospital said in a statement: “The trust is clear that Mr Bramhall made a mistake in the context of a complex clinical situation and this has been dealt with via the appropriate authorities, including the trust as his then employer. We can reassure his patients that there was no impact whatsoever on the quality of his clinical outcomes.” Bramhall was issued with a formal warning by the General Medical Council in February 2017. The body said his conduct had not met the standards required of a doctor. “While this failing in itself is not so serious as to require any restriction on Mr Bramhall’s registration, it is necessary in response to issue this formal warning,” it said at the time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/jan/15/how-to-reduce-food-waste-without-eating-avocado-stones","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T07:00:49Z","webTitle":"How  to reduce food waste (without eating avocado stones)","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/jan/15/how-to-reduce-food-waste-without-eating-avocado-stones","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/jan/15/how-to-reduce-food-waste-without-eating-avocado-stones","fields":{"headline":"How  to reduce food waste (without eating avocado stones)","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Just when you thought avocados were over; that, having made them into vegan burger buns, blended them into chocolate mousse and used the skins as ironic hipster coffee cups, the internet would move on to some new and hopefully yet-more-ridiculous obsession, we learn that in fact we have been throwing away the best part all along. According to Xavier Equihua, the CEO of the World Avocado Organization, “the most important nutrients are in the pit”, which, he claims, can be turned into a “healthy flour”. “It’s popular in the US,” he adds, as if that were a fail-safe culinary recommendation. Popular may be overstating it; even the California Avocado Commission warns against consuming the pit, given the lack of research into benefits or risks. But of the few who do recommend it, one “online platform for the growing compassionate and eco-conscious generation” suggests combining the bitter, tannic powder (made by baking the stone until soft, then whizzing it in a food processor) with “other strong flavours that’ll mask it a bit”. This tip confirms my suspicion: it’s probably one best left to the prehistoric sloth. If you’re keen to reduce your waste in the kitchen, however, here are a few more useful ideas to try. Pumpkin and squash seeds Rinse clean, toss in oil and seasoning and bake at 180C (gas mark 4) for about 10 minutes, until golden. Cauliflower leaves and beetroot tops Wash, chop and use like any other leafy green veg. Cheese rinds Freeze odds and ends of hard cheese, cutting off any wax or cloth, then chuck them into soups and broths to add extra flavour, scooping them out before serving. Citrus peel To turn into candied peel, cut into thick strips, put in a pan of cold water and bring to the boil. Simmer for 5 minutes, then drain and repeat, simmering for 30 minutes this time. Lift out the peel and pour the cooking water into a measuring jug. Add 100g of white sugar for each 100ml, then return to the pan and bring back to a simmer, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Replace the peel and cook gently for half an hour, until soft. Cool in the syrup, then put on a rack in the sink to drain. Pickle brine Reuse the brine in jars of gherkins and the like to pickle your own vegetables or boiled eggs (retro), or use it in salad dressings instead of vinegar. Stale bread Turn vintage bread that’s too tough to toast into breadcrumbs and toss through pasta. Alternatively, cut into cubes and bake to turn into croutons for soup, or make into panzanella – or, of course, good old British bread pudding. Chickpea water More attractively rebranded as aquafaba, this makes an amazingly good substitute for egg whites in vegan-friendly meringues, yorkshire puddings and many other recipes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/15/roast-battles-insult-comedy-jimmy-carr-russell-brand-comedy-centrl","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T08:30:51Z","webTitle":"Roast battles and insult comedy?

No thanks. We're British","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In the US, the comedy roast and its bastard child, the roast battle - an exchange of personal insults, basically, in the name of comedy - have a proud lineage, dating back to the Rat Pack era where comics like Don Rickles would take shots at Dean Martin and Sinatra. It’s not a practice that’s made it to the UK, where perhaps we consider our own tradition of panel shows to be quite smirking and competitive enough, thanks very much. But all that changes as of Monday night, when Comedy Central launches Roast Battle UK, hosted by one of the few Brit comics to have participated in the US version of the show – you guessed it, Jimmy Carr. So: does the format travel well? Or are we genteel Brits not the right audience for a show that glamourises insults, personal abuse and mutual humiliation? If you believed the latter, you’d have a job explaining the persistent popularity of Carr, whose standup is just as obnoxious as any American roast, and to whose strengths the roast battle seems ideally tailored. “We’ve basically turned comedy into sport,” says Carr in Monday’s debut, from somewhere behind his dead-eyed stare, “albeit for people who are shit at actual sport. A bit like women’s football.” I can find Carr’s shtick hard to take, so was prepared to be unamused by Roast Battle UK – filmed last autumn at the Electric in Brixton. But the first episode is good fun. It’s got a stellar panel of judges, with Russell Brand and Katherine Ryan alongside Carr, and an onstage MC in the form of US comic Brian Moses, who conceived of roast battle (runs the legend) after mediating a comedian’s quarrel in a parking lot. (The comedy roast – i.e. a one-way rather than tit-for-tat public mocking – is the older tradition, dating back to the Friars Club in New York City in the 1950s, where the likes of Groucho Marx, Johnny Carson and Frank Sinatra took turns about to be lampooned.) The first of the episode’s two battles is between Tom Allen and Suzi Ruffell, and immediately dispels the thought that Roast Battle might be overly brutal or macho. This encounter – between high-camp Allen and his lesbian “best friend” Ruffell – unfolds with solicitous concern for one another’s welfare, and an aghast reaction from Allen when their barbs are underscored by gunshot sound effects. “This,” says judge Brand proudly, “is roasting from Blighty” – a confrontational tradition now leavened with British primness and ironic detachment. Not that Britain is any stranger to the formalised exchange of insults, from medieval flyting (proto rap battles in the court of the Scottish King James IV) to sledging in cricket and beyond. Live comedy fans might find in Roast Battle an echo of the cult Edinburgh Fringe event The Wrestling, an extraordinary contact-sport-meets-comedy floorshow in which standup acts trash-talk and body-slam one another for big laughs. Certainly, the second round in Monday night’s show is a more cutting affair, as Phil Wang squares up to Ed Gamble, who looks (says Wang) “like a YouTuber who denies the Holocaust.” Much of what ensues is based on Wang’s ethnic identity and Gamble’s fluctuating weight. “No area is off-limits,” as Moses explains, and at its best, you could see roast battle operating as a great leveller, allowing insults about race, gender, body shape and alt-right personal styling to be bandied equally – and maybe even drawing their sting. Worst case scenario, every non-white comic will be obliged to gamely field jokes about their ethnicity: Wang’s “funniest joke of the show” in Monday’s episode is about Chinese people eating dogs. The format might take some getting used to: the two-bout structure seems to imply a final face-off that doesn’t materialise. But for starters at least, Roast Battle is easy to enjoy: close to the bone, but not below the belt, and with some very good gags. (Multiple writers are cited in the credits; it’d be interesting to know who they’re writing for.) There’s a sense – which sets this episode at least apart from panel shows – of something at stake, if only professional pride, and the pleasure these comics take in a straightforward clash of their wit and invective prowess. It turns out, on this evidence, that we can do personal abuse just as entertainingly as the Americans – as long we’re not put off by the sound of gunfire.

And it’s clear that your voice is more important than ever. CES 2018 rammed home that big technology thinks voice is the next major evolution in computing. First we had the computer, then the smartphone and now voice assistants. Smart speakers such as Amazon’s popular Echo devices and Google’s Home, which both had a killer Christmas, are just one outlet for the artificial intelligence-powered voice assistant. Google reverse-ferreted from its Google own-brand strategy to follow Amazon’s lead in opening up its Assistant voice system to third-parties. Manufacturers from all ends of the scale, from the high-end Danish firm Bang &amp; Olufsen to the cheap and cheerful Anker, fired out announcements of new smart speakers. Some, such as LG, also launched so called smart displays with Google Assistant – a direct shot at Amazon’s Echo Show smart speaker with a screen. But while Google’s battle strategy for the home was clearly to catch up with Amazon, the market leader’s CES was quite different. Its Alexa voice assistant cropped up in things as diverse as showers, mirrors, light switches, microwave ovens and cars, clearly freed from the confines of speaker-like things – no matter whether or not anyone actually wants a voice-controlled shower. Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, said: “Google, Amazon, Microsoft and others are fighting not only to cement their voice technologies, but also to ensure their assistant platforms are deeply embedded across the full spectrum of consumer electronics to maintain and deepen consumer engagement.” “Based on what we’ve seen so far, there’s no question that Amazon’s Alexa continues to lead the charge when it comes to voice assistant integration.” One place Alexa and Google have notably lost out is Mercedes cars. The German automotive power house unveiled a new “Hey Mercedes” system for voice-control system for its cars, deciding to go it alone in a move Geoff Blaber from CCS Insight called “perplexing”. “Just as most of the industry is recognising the need to integrate technology and improve time to market through collaboration, partnerships and open platforms, Mercedes is deciding to reinvent the wheel with an entirely proprietary approach,” said Blaber. Smart home overload As if voice-enabled everything wasn’t enough, the show floors were filled with a bewildering array of smart home gadgets vying for consumer cash. Smart speakers have reignited interest in the smart home market, acting as a central hub and therefore a gateway drug to smart everything, although mainly lightbulbs until now. Some “smart” things, such as the leak detection devices showcased at CES, appear to make sense, simply by alerting you to issues about your home that might dent the bank account if not dealt with immediately. Others, such as Kohler’s $6,000 Numi smart toilet, not so much. It’s voice-activated, has mood lighting, a heated seat, foot warmer and advanced bidet functionality with air dryer. Lovely. “I pity the poor consumer,” said Wood. “The smart home now has such a bewildering set of choices it is virtually impossible to figure out what is the best solution.” Flying taxis and light-up drones So far so not-so-future, until the drones showed up. Intel set the drone agenda by flying its 18-rotor, two-person Volocopter taxi drone on stage at its opening keynote. It then lit up the famous Bellagio fountains on the Las Vegas strip with 250 of its Shooting Star drones, performing a lightshow coordinated to Kygo’s Stargazing. Where there were drones there were also companies exhibiting anti-drone solutions, from radar tracking and signal jamming to more aggressive tactics, all promising to “bring it down”. Analysts may be sceptical about consumer drones surviving as a mainstream item. But excitement still remains around flying taxis, even though SureFly’s demos of its $200,000 two-person diesel-electric hybrid drone were thwarted by what was reported as “mild drizzle”. Passenger drone flights in the UK might be a while. Computer says no But if CES 2018 was to be remembered for anything, it’ll be for non-compliant robots. LG showed off its Cloi home-helping robot that was meant to act as an interface between you and the mundane things in your life such as the washer dryer or the oven. Sadly, minutes into the live demo Cloi stopped responding to LG’s vice president of marketing David VanderWaal creating an embarrassing one-way conversation as he tried to elicit a response. “The episode proved to be an apt metaphor for a lot of the technology on show at CES this year, particularly in the area of consumer robotics,” said Wood. “It seemed like many of the devices on show weren’t quite ready for primetime.” That even extended to the show itself, which, due to heavy rainfall, suffered a blackout mid-exhibit leaving attendees under emergency lighting for three hours."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/15/roseanne-barr-trump-politics-alan-partridge-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T06:00:48Z","webTitle":"From Roseanne to Partridge: what happens when TV characters get political?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/15/roseanne-barr-trump-politics-alan-partridge-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/15/roseanne-barr-trump-politics-alan-partridge-brexit","fields":{"headline":"From Roseanne to Partridge: what happens when TV characters get political?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“Half the people voted for Trump,” said Roseanne Barr last week at the press launch for the 2018 revival of Roseanne, her classic sitcom about a blue-collar American family, “and half didn’t. It’s just realistic.” Barr was fielding reporters’ strong reactions to news that has settled a long debate about Roseanne, which is returning in March after 21 years off-screen: would Barr’s alter ego Roseanne Conner and her clan have voted for Trump? The show had always dealt forthrightly with the pain of living from paycheck to paycheck, making the Conners the sort of economically disenfranchised people who might have swung right. On the other hand, their robustly humane approach to social issues drove many observers to paint them as liberals at heart. The answer Barr has come up with is that Roseanne did vote for Trump, but other members of her family, notably her sister Jackie (Laurie Metcalf), are outraged by this, causing a rift that powers the new season. This creative decision is indicative of a trend: society has become so politically polarised, even comedy characters are being forced to make their allegiances known. Over here, the funny monster who’s now political is Alan Partridge, set to return to the BBC this year as the “voice of Brexit”. Steve Coogan and his co-writers have rarely put a foot wrong in the past, but this will be a new test. Remainers might have pegged Alan – with his chippy posturing, narrow worldview and paranoid prejudices – as the Brexit type, him actually picking a side is different. Comedy characters generally work best, politically, when they’re a prescient sketch that we colour in later. See for example Edward and Tubbs, the permanently fearful grotesques who ran a “local shop for local people” in The League of Gentlemen back in 1999. They were intolerant of people explaining the modern world to them, to the point that such people entering the shop were hogtied, subjected to a nonsensical lecture, and then burned. That Britain had, in the subsequent two decades, fallen under the influence of politicians who wanted it to be a local country for local people was already apparent long before the League made their BBC2 comeback at the end of 2017. The comeback cast Edward and Tubbs in an unsubtle Brexit allegory, where the shopkeepers’ mad bilge somehow sparked a wider movement, and wasn’t necessary. Attempts to make political points have sometimes, historically, been counter-productive rather than just ineffective, the most famous example being Harry Enfield’s 1980s creation Loadsamoney. An aggressively acquisitive boor, Loadsamoney was a satire on Thatcherism, but the selfishness he embodied was so dominant in the culture of the time that he was quickly appropriated and celebrated by the people Enfield was trying to lampoon. Now, however, there’s no going back. Over in the States, Roseanne Conner’s Trump vote follows in the wake of a sitcom that’s belatedly coming to the UK this month: on Monday, Channel 5 starts airing Last Man Standing, a vehicle for Home Improvement star Tim Allen. It directly tackles one of the defining political phenomena of the age, namely middle-aged white men who are aghast at their dominance being even slightly challenged, and who respond by putting their views forward more aggressively than ever. Allen plays Mike Baxter, a man who, through changes of circumstance at work and at home, finds himself adrift in a female-dominated world. Baxter’s bluntly expressed conservative beliefs, which reflect Allen’s own leanings, aren’t incidental to the show. They’re its selling point. We’re suddenly a long way from Parks &amp; Recreation, with its mutual respect between the broadly but not explicitly liberal Leslie Knope and the broadly but not explicitly libertarian Ron Swanson reflecting the show’s ethos that politics is about more than partisanship. The Simpsons only occasionally spelled out allegiances such as Ned Flanders’ Republicanism and Marge’s two votes for Jimmy Carter. (Homer, of course, voted for Mitt Romney to reward him for inventing Obamacare.) Discussion around Roseanne has been coloured by the fact that, like Allen, Barr is outspoken in real life. She supports Trump. However, the new episodes try to find the comedy in a group of people who can’t not talk about their differences. Perhaps, like Brexit, the 45th President is too big an issue for comedy to remain neutral on: even the re-animated Will &amp; Grace felt obliged to devote its first episode last September to attacking the Donald. The problem was, the resulting script wasn’t that funny. Card-carrying characters might now be the norm, but they’re often not a winning strategy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/jan/13/jurgen-klopp-manchester-city-liverpool-philippe-coutinho","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-13T19:00:05Z","webTitle":"Jürgen Klopp can show Manchester City that Liverpool’s real star remains | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/jan/13/jurgen-klopp-manchester-city-liverpool-philippe-coutinho","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/jan/13/jurgen-klopp-manchester-city-liverpool-philippe-coutinho","fields":{"headline":"Jürgen Klopp can show Manchester City that Liverpool’s real star remains","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"There was an interesting moment towards the start of Jürgen Klopp’s time at Liverpool, back in the days when he still felt the need to apologise for his already-excellent if amusingly sweary English. Asked about transfer targets, budgets and spending big on new players, Klopp didn’t really answer the question. Instead he grimaced and grumbled, rubbing his eyes behind his glasses like a weary, drink-sozzled chief inspector with a short fuse but a heart of gold being told by one of his hair-gelled sergeants that there are no suspicious circumstances so should he close the case on the mysterious death of Lord Sinister. Klopp went on to talk about trusting his existing players, about chemistry and coaching and the moral obligation to improve what he had rather than team-build by numbers. Six months later, more confident in his systems, not to mention his command of English metaphor, he came up with the train analogy to describe his idea of a team as something entirely collective, fired by a shared momentum as opposed to opportunist chop and change. “If I spoke to a player and he told me: ‘If you were playing in the Champions League next year then I would be really interested,’ I would put the phone down. That is what I would say to players. It is about pushing the train, not jumping on a running train.” Liverpool supporters have had a week to worry away at the question of how to replace Philippe Coutinho, how to fill the obvious gap his departing star quality will leave. But as the club adjusts to losing its best player for the third time in four years it is worth remembering that there is a difference now. From Dortmund to Liverpool, Klopp’s notion of team-building is designed to survive exactly this, the vicissitudes of life as a selling club at the highest level, of success always placing your best players in the crosshairs of those with bottomless funds and the promise of a kind of club football ultimacy in Madrid or Barcelona. This is the way Klopp’s Liverpool are geared to work. Soft-shoed Brazilian playmakers will come and go, but unlike Brendan-Luis, or even Brendan-Raheem, the manager is the real star here, the one irreplaceable part around which all progress revolves. The most important person at the club is still in place. Klopp isn’t just in the cab, shovelling his furnace, tooting the whistle. He’s the guard, the engine, the coal scuttle, the pressure gauge. Klopp is the train. With this in mind, the visit of Manchester City on Sunday is unexpectedly timely. In a way Pep Guardiola’s league leaders are the ideal opponents. City have crossed over into another place in the last few weeks, the most dominant leaders in any major league, 15 points clear of second place before the weekend’s fixtures and with further clear blue sky opening every week. In effect City’s role right now is to act as a kind of control experiment for the rest of the league, a point against which every other ambitious team must for now measure itself. The interest for the neutral lies in how each opponent will try to cope with City’s width and fluency, their mastery of the ball, as much as it does in another frictionless demolition. Klopp has an opportunity straight away to demonstrate the reserves of strength left in his squad, and also to reaffirm his own capacities, that ability to keep the train running whatever the snags and jolts along the way. There is already a sense that Sunday could be a game of fine details, or at least something more refined than Liverpool’s oddly flaccid 5-0 defeat at the Etihad in September. Liverpool were already losing that game when Sadio Mané was sent off but their subsequent collapse crystallised the idea of this team as defensively flaky free-wheelers, City as a kind of surging, pirouetting goal machine. Things have changed a bit since then. City’s run of form has narrowed. This is a team marked out currently as much by its control as its rapier attack. A defence that was once widely snarked at has not conceded more than one goal in its last 14 domestic matches, and has not conceded more than two in a domestic game in exactly a year. Meanwhile, Liverpool have been on a wonderful run of their own, with no defeat in 17 since the shellacking by Spurs at Wembley. Coutinho was involved in a quarter of their 54 goals in that time, despite playing only 11 matches. But the team have produced excellent results without him. Coutinho didn’t play in the defeat of Manchester City a year ago. He didn’t play in the 4-0 devouring of Arsenal this season. It might seem odd to suggest the departure of Liverpool’s best player is a chance to show the progress made under Klopp. Those who are innately hostile will point to the absence of a title challenge, an objection known as the no-better-than-Brendan delusion. But Klopp has burnished his reputation, has pulled together the seams, has shown he can call a club to order. Liverpool are currently en route to a second successive season in the top four for the first time since 2009. That fluent, fun, workaholic attack is a genuinely notable creation. If it feels as though the team are being built from the front, then at least something is being built. Best of all Anfield still seems energised by Klopp, at ease with itself, a place the manager really does seem to fill and feed off and nourish with his presence. Klopp has kept his word, too, creating a team out of high-grade component parts rather than star signings. Liverpool’s starting XI in their last Premier League game featured six players Klopp inherited. There have been some post‑inflationary signings but under Klopp £225m has been spent to date and £270m raked back. Right now, the biggest challenge is not so much to replace Coutinho as to ensure the aftermath is managed to Klopp’s satisfaction, that their most valuable asset remains settled. Christian Purslow might not be everyone’s idea of an all-seeing footballing sage but there is something in the observation by the club’s former managing director this week that Klopp remains “absolutely A-list… the next manager for one of those bigger clubs if Liverpool do not fulfil his ambitions”. Sunday is another opportunity to show that train is still running on, that this is a team geared to absorb a high-level departure without losing their head of steam. There have been various tactical offerings in the continuing mystery of how to go about derailing this Manchester City machine. For a while in autumn the idea of sitting deep and trying to disrupt the midfield fulcrum of Fernandinho and Ilkay Gündogan gained some traction, although this always felt a bit like placing your neck on the block and waiting for the blade to fall. Roy Hodgson’s approach at Selhurst Park on New Year’s Eve was successful, as Crystal Palace succeeded for 45 minutes in applying genuine pressure to City’s weak points, pressing hard in midfield and isolating City’s defenders one on one against Wilfred Zaha. This is also the most natural approach for Klopp’s Liverpool, with a mobile, powerful midfield and a hard-pressing front three pushed right up against City’s defenders. The absence of Coutinho hardly hampers this system. Klopp might just feel this team, with the midfield fury of Naby Keïta to come from RB Leipzig, is a little closer to a vision of the pure Klopp style. Either way the Premier League could do with at least one desperately fought top-of-the-table match before the season turns entirely Sky Blue. Sunday at Anfield could yet be the moment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/12/a-tipping-point-women-writers-pledge-to-boycott-gender-biased-books-after-very-male-anthology","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T15:15:35Z","webTitle":"‘A tipping point’: women writers pledge to boycott gender biased books after very male anthology","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/12/a-tipping-point-women-writers-pledge-to-boycott-gender-biased-books-after-very-male-anthology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/12/a-tipping-point-women-writers-pledge-to-boycott-gender-biased-books-after-very-male-anthology","fields":{"headline":"‘A tipping point’: women writers pledge to boycott gender biased books after very male anthology","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Irish women poets are rising up en masse against their repeated exclusion from literary history, signing a pledge of refusal to participate in anthologies, conferences and festivals in which the gender balance is skewed. The pledge was conceived after the publication of the Cambridge Companion to Irish Poets in 2017. Covering Irish poetry from the 17th century to the present, it features essays on four women poets and 26 men, with just four female contributors. According to the 250 poets, academics and writers who have now signed the pledge, the book “repeats the minimisation or obliteration of women’s poetry by previous anthologies and surveys” and “leads to a distorted impression of our national literature and to a simplification of women’s roles within it”. The Cambridge guide is by no means the first time women writers have been left out. Research from Irish publisher Lagan found in December that women are underrepresented in a host of Irish anthologies: last year’s A Treasury of Irish Literature featured only five female authors in a total of 32; An Anthology of Modern Irish Poetry featured 10 women out of 53 poets; and Modern Irish Poetry: An Anthology contained 22 female poets among 177. “The Companion is part of a larger process by which the significance of works by women is attenuated as they become inaccessible or obscured, simply by virtue of their absence from canonical textbooks,” says the preamble to the pledge, going on to name a panoply of Irish women writers who could have been included in the Cambridge anthology: 19th-century poet Emily Lawless, 18th-century poet Laetitia Pilkington, 20th-century author Katharine Tynan and modernists Freda Laughton and Maighread Medbh, among others. Poets including Christine Murray, Ailbhe D’Arcy and Mary O’Donnell worked together to come up with the pledge, which they have dubbed Fired! Irish Women Poets and the Canon. “Our pledge is short and simple. It commits us to asking questions about gender representation early on in collaborative projects such as edited collections, conferences and festivals. It commits us to withdrawing our participation when, in our opinion, insufficient effort is made to render representation fair,” they write. “In many cases implicit bias will have been involved in women being less famous, so editors and organisers should make an effort to include some slightly less famous female names.” The issue is not confined to Ireland, or to poetry: the first volume of the Penguin Book of the British Short Story is 75% male, while the second is 64% male; and in both the Oxford Book of American Poetry and in A Glimpse of Truth, the 100 Finest Short Stories, more than two thirds of the writers selected are men. O’Donnell, a novelist and poet, said: “I really hope it can make a difference. The Cambridge anthology has, once and for all, brought about a convergence of women, responding after decades of exclusion … This isn’t personal against the editor of the anthology – the anthology is a tipping point. We have had a whole history of exclusion.” O’Donnell called for high-profile writers to come on board and support the pledge – both men and women. “As long as ‘good men’ aren’t getting political about this, nothing will change,” she said. “The literary patriarchal door keeps slamming in our faces.” Booker prize-winning Irish novelist Anne Enright is one of the biggest names to sign up. The author, who has previously called out sexism in the literary scene in the London Review of Books, spoke of a festival she was invited to attend two years ago in order to redress the gender balance of a male-heavy line-up – and to speak about gender imbalances. “I had a book which was No 1 on the bestseller list, and longlisted for the Booker, and I still hadn’t been invited to talk about it. I was invited to restore the gender balance. There are multiple double-binds in that exclusion – even when you’re included, you’re excluded. It is maddening in the extreme,” said Enright. In 1991, the Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing famously drew heavy criticism for its male-heavy focus. “It comes in cycles – every generation does it again. It’s like they really can’t receive the memo. There’s an absolute aversion to having the conversation on the Irish scene. It’s unbelievable – here we go again,” said Enright. Enright, comparing the situation to the #MeToo movement, said that no one was willing to stand up and be counted over gender bias. “Prejudice against women is a universal crime with zero perpetrators. Irish men are lovely, Irish poets are especially lovely – what on earth could be the problem? There is an amazing series of defences between men and this conversation,” she said. “With the #MeToo movement, the fact there are misdemeanours and crimes involved, and sexual activity, means everyone can point fingers and individuals can be identified, and they can stand in for a whole culture of harassment. When there is no physical content, when it’s about aversion, when it’s about exclusion, it is extremely hard to identify and call out.” The pledge points to studies that “have suggested that both men and women tend to evaluate women more negatively than men in professional contexts”, so “women may need to do a lot more to be considered successful than men do”. Academics also feature on the list of signatories to the pledge. “To be clear, I studied zero female poets in college. I envy US students who have Emily Dickinson, Gertrude Stein, Mina Loy, Susan Howe, et al. We literally have huge gaps there and the narrative states that women poets emerged in the 1970s. Nope! They were ignored until the 1970s,” said Murray. Responding to the controversy, Cambridge University Press said in a statement that it was “committed to publishing fairly and without bias. The Press publishes many significant works about Irish literature and history. The Cambridge Companion to Irish Poets is one part of this ongoing and ambitious programme, which in 2018 will include titles such as A History of Modern Irish Women’s Literature, A History of Irish Women’s Poetry and A History of Working-Class Literature.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/jan/12/england-odi-series-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T15:41:04Z","webTitle":"England seek ODI redemption against Australia after one-sided Ashes | Vithushan Ehantharajah","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/12/england-odi-series-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/12/england-odi-series-australia","fields":{"headline":"England seek ODI redemption against Australia after one-sided Ashes","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The tour that seemingly never ends has reached the halfway stage. The travel time from England to Australia has been cut considerably from the two months spent on the seas during the 19th century but that has seemingly lent itself to a more relentless schedule. Sunday’s opener at the MCG begins England’s limited-overs bonanza of two five-match ODI series against Australia and New Zealand which sandwich a Twenty20 tri-series between the sides. All in the space of two months. Yet this period brings a palpable sense of relief. Even here, where they will watch Australia win at anything, there is a degree of apathy at the manner in which the Ashes were regained. Every local “four-nil” gloat is accompanied by dismay at the absence of a contest. That looks set to be rectified here. Australia and England sit third and fourth respectively in the ODI rankings. The former are defending 50-over champions; the latter are on a four-year learning curve of white-ball appreciation before next year’s home World Cup. Sunday’s match at the MCG will be the first of 10 ODIs between these two in the next seven months. Of the England squad on the wrong end of the 4-0 scoreline, only seven are staying on to continue the battle in coloured clothing, including the Test captain, Joe Root. If he had not felt like a piece of himself had been lost when the urn was relinquished, a bout of gastroenteritis has seen to that. Aside from a delay in announcing the Test squad for New Zealand, Root’s recovery from the illness has not impinged much on preparations. He had handed over captaincy duties to Eoin Morgan. Though there are enough fresh faces to dissipate any residual feelings of disappointment, Morgan may well feel like an Airbnb host returning home to find a couple of toilets blocked and a leak in the roof. As for Trevor Bayliss, this leg offers some creature comforts. And while he has been put at ease by the backing of the ECB’s chairman, Colin Graves, and chief executive, Tom Harrison – unlike in football, such a vote of confidence is no harbinger of doom – few will be more motivated than Bayliss to ensure England come out of these white-ball duels in credit. After all, it is why he was given the job in the first place. The Test side under his watch have been inconsistent but big strides have been made in 50-over cricket. Since taking over in May 2015, Bayliss has overseen 34 wins out of 52, with just 15 defeats. In that period, England have put 350 on the board six times, including two scores over 400 and also achieved their highest chase when they overcame a target of 350 set by New Zealand in Bayliss’s first summer. By way of comparison, the 52 ODIs before his appointment brought 21 wins and 29 defeats, with six first-inning scores above 300 and a top score of 316. The numbers tell two stories: that England have undoubtedly improved and the players, specifically the batsmen, value Bayliss’s output. The freedom the Australian brings is plain to see and can be considered a welcome antidote to an English system that has a track record of suppressing a player’s natural instinct. But the English public are harder to please. Lauding run and win rates is all well and good but they offer little to appease the discontent bubbling below the surface. Many domestic fans have been frustrated by the lean towards white-ball cricket and the manner in which the County Championship has been pushed to the far reaches of the domestic calendar to give Twenty20 prime real estate. Reaching the final of the 2016 World T20 and semis of last year’s Champions Trophy are improvements but only a global trophy or success in a marquee series can provide justification that this has all been worthwhile. The return of the northern powerhouses Mark Wood and Liam Plunkett to England colours addresses the pining for pace that dominated the Ashes. Both provide wicket-taking threats but such is the hysteria of the past few months and the phenomena of a player’s rising stock when he is outside a losing team that neither will be regarded higher than they are at this moment. Perhaps most intriguing of all will be the fortunes of Alex Hales. An ECB disciplinary commission hearing aside, he has been cleared of wrongdoing after the Bristol incident that sees Ben Stokes remain in international limbo. A decision will be made with purely cricket in mind as to whether he regains the opening spot in Melbourne he lost through suspension for the final two ODIs of last summer. Having opted to miss the tour to Bangladesh in 2016, the Nottinghamshire opener stands on thin ice yet remains one of England’s leading lights in the 50-over format, as evidenced by his record-breaking 187 not out against Surrey in the final of the Royal London Cup. His 52 from No3 in England’s sole warm-up against a Cricket Australia XI was a reminder of his talents (he was the quickest scorer on show with a strike rate of 148.57). He more than anyone will need to maintain a low profile and high standards on and off the field. As the Test series showed, that is easier said than done on these shores."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"theobserver/2018/jan/14/observer-letters-churches-working-in-harmony-rural-communities","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T00:05:12Z","webTitle":"Churches work in harmony in rural communities | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2018/jan/14/observer-letters-churches-working-in-harmony-rural-communities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2018/jan/14/observer-letters-churches-working-in-harmony-rural-communities","fields":{"headline":"Letters: churches work in harmony in rural communities","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"There is no doubt about the enormous contribution being made by clergy from the established church in responding to the challenges of poverty, isolation and cuts to public services in rural areas (“How rural vicars became the last social workers in the countryside”, News.

Rural churches are often at the core of the social fabric of villages and small towns. The C of E and the Methodist church signed an agreement to work together in 2003. This is known as the Anglican-Methodist Covenant and evidence of it being lived out can be found in many villages and rural communities. The C of E has much to offer.

Rev Ruth Fry Winchester When size does matter With reference to “How Hitler could solve our housing crisis”, New Review) concerning the objection people have against their road being called Bell End, as an 80-year-old, I was unfamiliar with this euphemism for the glans. At my age, I suppose one tends to take less interest in such things. As an amateur trombonist (of sorts) however, the expression has a different meaning. It being the flared end of the instrument from which the noise erupts. This is not to say the trombone has no sexy connections. I remember Terry Wogan disputing Ken Dodd’s assertion that love is like a violin, claiming that it is much more like a slide trombone. In the case of the bell end of the trombone, performance can be affected by size. Classical players tend to have larger ones to produce a deeper, more sonorous note, whereas those of us in the jazz and big band world have smaller ones to make a brighter sound. I would have thought the addition of road, way or avenue would have solved the good citizens’ problem. John Davies Bristol No calls for segregation Kenan Malik, in his interesting piece on class and race (“In British education, the central issue is class, not ethnicity”, Comment) says that “many prominent figures [including myself] called for black boys to be educated in separate schools”. To my knowledge, neither I nor anyone else in full possession of their faculties has called for black boys to be placed in separate schools. In 2004, I did point out that some small experiments in racially segregated US high schools showed that when African American boys were taught English and maths in all-male classes, their scores improved significantly and immediately. Kenan’s error is understandable due to an over-enthusiastic BBC PR operation selling this observation as a call for separate schools. Google doesn’t always tell the whole story – or even the real one. Trevor Phillips London N6 Brexit threat to our rights The EU (Withdrawal) bill, returning to the Commons this week, will not protect people’s rights in the UK as the government has promised. This is in large part because the bill removes the Charter of Fundamental Rights from our law. The charter protects rights to dignity, protection of personal data and health and protections for workers, women, children, older people, LGBTI and disabled people. The government’s analysis of the charter repeats its assurance that rights will not be weakened following Brexit. However, independent legal advice shows this to be wrong. Losing it creates a human rights hole because the charter provides some rights and judicial remedies that have no clear equivalents in UK law. Furthermore, by keeping the wide and complex body of EU law while throwing away the charter that is the code to unlock it, the government risks jamming itself in a mountain of legal cases. Rights without remedies are just symbols. We need legal guarantees in the bill about the kind of society we want to be after Brexit. For the government to honour its promise of preserving existing rights it must retain the protections in the charter.

We won’t accept to be bullied – not anymore. The recent comments by the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, sensationalising some sporadic and isolated incidents involving South Sudanese Australian youths in Melbourne have touched a nerve. We are not gangs. We are hard-working citizens. We put in a shift every day, just like any other Australian, to contribute to the progress of this country. Simply put, we have a voice in the affairs of this country, and it will be heard loud and clear henceforth. The Coalition government’s problem This is not the first time a Coalition government has put the South Sudanese Australian community in harm’s way, and for the wrong reason. Liberal MP Kevin Andrews did this before but it went largely unchallenged. Social and political commentator Andrew Bolt has also done it, time and again. Dutton’s recent comments, propped up by prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, will not go unchallenged. Africans, the South Sudanese Australian community in particular, have had it – enough is enough. We’re taking matters into our own hands. Together with all like-minded Australians, we will call out this government to stop targeting our community. We expect from an Australian government, be it Liberal or Labor, to be sensitive about issues involving a minority community – South Sudanese or other. Using a minority community for political point scoring is a sign of bad leadership. Politicking with a community’s welfare by making incendiary comments, without regard to the possible consequences to that community, is a sign of a government losing its grip on leadership. There’s a problem All that aside, there can be no resolution of a problem without acknowledging its very existence. The South Sudanese Australian community is deeply concerned by the actions of some of its young members – whether this is in Melbourne or anywhere else in this country. We’ve always acknowledged that some young members of our society are letting our community down. We suspect their actions are mainly down to youth, fuelled by alcohol consumption and other influences. We’ve seen our community leaders working tirelessly together with authorities to understand the underlying problems facing our youths. Above all the speculation of what these underlying problems might be, it is widely accepted that issues of transition are complex. The South Sudanese Australian community is just over a decade old in this country. Our community continues to be haunted by past experiences and confronted by the ongoing conflict in South Sudan. Cultural complexities continue to undermine our community’s smooth transition. Some of our parents are being challenged by the behaviours of their children. Culturally, a South Sudanese young person is expected to be obedient and never to question the authority of a parent. This is no longer the case with the young South Sudanese Australians, which might add to some parents’ despondency. Going forward There is no one-size-fits-all approach to the challenges we are facing. Relevant authorities just need to work together with the South Sudanese Australian community leaders to curb these problems. The Victorian government’s announcement of an African-Australian community taskforce is probably not a bad call. I am however cautious about it at this stage. I am worried that it may be used by some elements in the law enforcement agencies to undermine the privacy of our young people and their right to assemble as a group. The federal government needs to assist the community and sufficiently fund its social programmes. From this funding, the community must take up the responsibility of education, employment and all other activities that will enhance our young people’s social welfare. The South Sudanese Australian young people also need to take up this mantle. The social media campaign #AfricanGangs we’ve started shouldn’t just be the end of it. It’s been great; however, it needs to extend beyond social media. We need to engage the younger members of our community so that we can chart a way forward together. • Maker Mayek is a lawyer and the co-campaigner behind the #AfricanGangs social media campaign"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/12/conservationists-decry-nsw-shark-net-trial-after-protected-species-caught-and-killed","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T02:13:24Z","webTitle":"Conservationists decry NSW shark net trial after protected species caught and killed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/12/conservationists-decry-nsw-shark-net-trial-after-protected-species-caught-and-killed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/12/conservationists-decry-nsw-shark-net-trial-after-protected-species-caught-and-killed","fields":{"headline":"Conservationists decry NSW shark net trial after protected species caught and killed","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"New South Wales shark nets caught just one targeted shark but continued to kill protected species this summer, a result environmentalists have described as “unfathomable”. Figures released this week from a trial of shark nets on northern NSW’s beaches show they have caught a single bull shark in November and December. The nets caught no tiger or white sharks – the two other species they are aimed at – but did kill a series of turtles, rays and other sharks. The nets also caught a critically endangered grey nurse shark, although it was released alive. Humane Society International marine scientist Jessica Morris said the results showed the trial was “a complete disaster”. “Just as we feared, the nets have now captured a critically endangered grey nurse shark, more threatened and protected marine turtles, and an array of other harmless sharks and rays,” Morris said. “While the grey nurse shark was released alive from the nets, this species is highly susceptible to post-release mortality due to the stress of such an event.” The current trial is the second of its kind run by the state government at five beaches at Ballina and Evans Head. In the first trial, just nine of the 275 animals caught, or about 3%, were targeted sharks. The second trial was designed to reduce harm to bycatch, by using nets with a different design at different heights. The data suggests a very slight reduction in the overall number of animals caught than in the first trial. The trials rely on legal exemptions granted by the federal environment minister, Josh Frydenberg. Morris said the data should prompt a removal of that exemption. “The federal environment minister needs to rethink his decision to allow shark nets and focus on his real job which is to ensure our endangered species are protected,” she said. “Shark attacks are not the norm – they are traumatic but they are rare, and we need to realise that nets are doing more harm than good.” Frydenberg, however, said public safety was of “paramount importance”. “NSW’s shark net trials are being undertaken in accordance with national environmental law,” he told Guardian Australia. The NSW state minister for primary industries, Niall Blair, said the recently released data was an “important part of testing the north coast net trial”. “The second trial is one part of an overall shark management strategy being implemented by the NSW government, including Smart drumlines, helicopter surveillance, shark tracking and VR4G listening stations,” Blair said. “The NSW government is committed to trialling and testing the best technology in the world to address shark attacks in NSW and will continue to work closely with local communities and all affected stakeholders.” Nets are more regularly used off 51 beaches between Wollongong and Newcastle. The majority of marine animals caught in those nets were not dangerous sharks. Last season, the nets caught 56 endangered or vulnerable marine species. Six greynurse sharks were killed by the nets."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/01/poor-americans-poverty-rich-class","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-01T11:00:38Z","webTitle":"'Class-passing': how do you learn the rules of being rich?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/01/poor-americans-poverty-rich-class","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/feb/01/poor-americans-poverty-rich-class","fields":{"headline":"'Class-passing': how do you learn the rules of being rich?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"On an October night in 2003, a flat tire changed Muhammad Faridi’s life forever. Faridi was 20. An immigrant who’d moved from a small village in Pakistan to Brighton Beach, Brooklyn when he was 12, he split his time studying at City University of New York during the day, and driving his dad’s cab at night to make money. One of his professors had organized a human rights conference in New Jersey and, knowing about Faridi’s side job, asked him to drive the woman delivering the keynote lecture to the conference and back. And that’s what Faridi was doing until he got a flat and had to pull over in the dark on the side of Route 80. As it turned out, Faridi’s passenger was Mary Robinson: the first female president of Ireland and the United Nations high commissioner for human rights from 1997 to 2002. It took Faridi a while to change the tire – everything seemed to be going wrong that night – and as he was struggling with the car jack, the two got talking. It was coming up to the second anniversary of 9/11 and Faridi told Robinson that, as a Muslim, he was no longer sure what his place was in America. A lot of his Pakistani friends had been rounded up in immigration raids and had been deported. “You’ve got to become a lawyer,” Robinson told Faridi firmly. That would be the best way to help his community. Her words stuck with him. Fast forward 14 years, and Faridi is a partner at a prestigious New York law firm. As a kid, Faridi’s loftiest goal was maybe one day being a limo driver, doing just a little better than his father. He never thought he’d be where he is today: conducting billion-dollar lawsuits and leading pro bono cases, representing Muslim community centers and death row inmates. I’m talking to Faridi in his plush office on the 30th floor of a fancy Manhattan skyscraper. Our conversation is part of a number of interviews I’m conducting with people who have dramatically changed their social class. I want to find out what it’s like to be a class “migrant”. What you learn when you journey from one socioeconomic group to another, and whether it takes an emotional toll. Stories like Faridi’s are becoming increasingly rare. Economic mobility has fallen steeply in America over the last few decades; one study estimates it has almost halved since 1940. Increasingly, your class is your destiny. Nevertheless, the country remains enamored of these rags-to-riches tales which perpetuate the myth that, in the US, anything is possible if you pull yourself up by your bootstraps. It’s not just hard work that propels you up the social ladder. Success, as Faridi stresses repeatedly, is often large parts luck. But there’s also another, less tangible ingredient involved: “class-passing”. In the UK, class consciousness is woven into the national identity. In America, however, people often like to pretend that a class system doesn’t really exist. But, of course, it does. Going from a taxi driver’s son to a partner at a law firm isn’t just about academic qualifications. It’s also a matter of figuring out the right social cues. You have to understand the subtle signifiers that indicate to people that you’re one of them – whether that be the way you hold your fork, where you go on holiday or what brand of shoes you wear. As a young lawyer, Faridi spent large amounts of time trying to figure out how to crack the unspoken conventions of his new world. How to dress, for example. “I remember wearing a lot of cufflinks, because that was the thing to do,” he says. Fancy lunches with clients also became a minefield. “I was very nervous about how to pick up the cutlery so I watched a bunch of YouTube videos on proper ways to handle silverwear,” he says. Faridi grew up in a Muslim household, where you get taught to eat with your right hand. According to YouTube, Faridi chuckles, “the proper way of putting food in your mouth is by using your left hand. And I remember having a lot of discomfort with that because it was something I’d never done before.” In law school, Faridi clerked for a judge. One night, he helped the judge load some heavy documents into a taxi; the driver was his father. Faridi froze, not sure what to do. “I was embarrassed to go over and shake [my father’s] hand, so I waited until the judge had already gotten in the cab. I didn’t want the judge to see me, and I didn’t want my father to think that I was embarrassed to see him.” It wasn’t until he made partner in 2016 that Faridi lost his sense of embarrassment. After the big announcement, he remembers, he took the elevator down to the bottom of the building, where his dad was waiting in his taxi. “And he came out of the cab and we hugged each other for a good couple of minutes.” But there’s still a gulf between his new life and his old. His best friends from high school work as cab drivers and busboys or in Pathmark, a major supermarket chain, and he doesn’t get invited to poker nights at their houses. “None of them came to my wedding,” Faridi says sadly. While he’s proud of everything he’s achieved, there is part of him that mourns the person he used to be. The clean-energy CEO meeting Silicon Valley elites Donnel Baird spent part of his childhood in Brooklyn. In the years since, the borough has rapidly gentrified, and so has Baird. We’re chatting in a WeWork co-working office in the pricey Dumbo neighbourhood, where Baird is the CEO and founder of BlocPower, a clean-energy startup that has raised over $1m in funding from some of Silicon Valley’s biggest names – including Andreessen Horowitz, which has invested in the likes of Twitter and Airbnb. BlocPower had $4m in revenue in 2017 and has a contract to perform sustainability retrofits of 500 buildings in Brooklyn. It likely won’t be long before the company outgrows its current office space. There weren’t any trendy office spaces in Baird’s Bed-Stuy neighbourhood when he was a kid. Co-living, on the other hand, was common. He lived with his parents and sister in a in a one-bedroom apartment; two aunts and five of his cousins lived in a studio upstairs. They shared a bathroom in the hall with another family. Bed-Stuy in the 1980s was rough. Baird saw a teenager shoot another kid in the head when he was just six. It was all a far cry from the Baird family’s life in Guyana. Baird’s dad had had an important job and a big house, but in America they had to start from scratch. It took a toll on the marriage and, when Baird was eight, his parents split up and his mom moved with him down to Atlanta. In Atlanta, Baird managed to get a place at one of the better public schools, the one where rich white kids went. At first they told his mom there was no room; there literally wasn’t a spare desk. “So she got on the bus to Home Depot and bought a desk,” Baird remembers. “She dragged it back to the school and said, ‘You can just stick the desk in a corner of one of a classroom and my son will sit there. He’s extremely well behaved.’ And they said ‘OK’.” As a senior, Baird got offered a full scholarship by Howard, a historically black university. It was a great deal. But he’d also been accepted to Duke, a prestigious, largely white school. The financial aid package they offered was nowhere near as generous. Still, he ended up picking Duke, his mind swayed by a conversation with the father of one of his white friends. “Her dad was a lawyer and he told me, you know, I’m 55 years old and I come to an event like this with all these other rich, white guys, and they still ask me where I went to undergrad. I live next door to them. I have as much money as them. And they still ask me because it still matters to them.” Because he didn’t go to a prestigious school, the man told Baird, he’s always treated as somewhat inferior, no matter how much money makes. “Now, you’re black,” his friend’s dad said. “If you go to Howard you will never have a shot at getting the inside track. You have to go to Duke.” Having learned how to navigate the old-money world of Duke, Baird now finds himself struggling to adapt to the culture of new-money Silicon Valley as he attempts to fundraise. Rather than bonding over golf, the tech set play Settlers of Catan. They wear hoodies rather than suits. They have their own set of conventions and Baird has to code-switch accordingly. In his meetings with New York banks, for example, Baird dresses formally. “But if you go to Silicon Valley dressed like that,” he explains, “they’ll be like, this guy is a suit, he doesn’t dress like a tech person. That matters. The meeting is over.” He has even, he tells me with more than a tinge of embarrassment, bought a pair of Allbird loafers – which are de rigeur in the Valley. Class and colour are, of course, inextricably intertwined, and moving to a higher social class in America often seems to involve “acting white”. Throughout his life, Baird has been accused of betraying his race. “Early on, people say that I talked white, even in my own family, which was painful. I don’t think that they would say it to hurt my feelings, they were just stating it as a fact. There’s a mix across my family of people who are very proud of me, and people are kind of resentful.” “I have family members that are living here illegally, who can’t find work, who are addicted to crack cocaine. I’m still very much connected to them, but we live in very different worlds.” The real estate queen who went from South Bronx to Southampton Someone who knows more than most about moving between different worlds is Mary Ann Tighe, routinely ranked as one of the most powerful women in New York. The 69-year-old CEO of the New York Tri-State Region of CBRE, the world’s largest commercial real estate services firm, may be a property legend, but she got into the industry fairly late, at age 36. Before that she worked as an arts adviser in the White House and helping to launch the TV channel A&amp;E. Tighe grew up in a working-class Italian American family in the South Bronx. She’d always hoped to live in Manhattan one day, so she could visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art, but never thought she’d end up owning an apartment opposite the Met and be brokering billion-dollar deals. Her ambitions stretched nowhere near that high, nor were they encouraged to. One of the biggest revelations of her life, she tells me, is that many of the people around her “had lowered their own personal expectations because life had been hard. They didn’t expect to be special”. It’s a common phenomenon: research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation in 2015, for example, found that those experiencing poverty are significantly less confident in their own ability to succeed, which becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. For a short time, Tighe internalised this attitude. She was 13 and had just moved from a free elementary school into a fee-paying high school; her parents were working all hours to afford it and Tighe was acutely conscious of this. Her new high school had a policy whereby the five top-performing kids in the grade got free tuition. Tighe wondered if she might be able to get in the top five and mentioned it to her family and a teacher. All of them had the same reaction: “You were the smartest person in the class in elementary school but you’re in a much bigger pond now, so you’re not going to be the smartest any more.” Tighe says she took that to heart and didn’t bother trying hard in class. But even without trying, Tighe came number six in her first semester. “I had a kind of breakdown,” Tighe says. “I wept and wept.” She was so angry with herself, she says, for believing that she couldn’t be the best and for not working to relieve the financial burden on her parents. “Suffice to say I was never again not number one in that school,” she says. “It was at that moment that I realized that other people’s worldviews were not the same as mine. I couldn’t listen to them tell me that I couldn’t do something.” One of the most valuable (and least studied) aspects of growing up with economic privilege, I’ve observed, is the sense of entitlement and the confidence it gives you. “Almost unreasonable confidence,” Tighe notes. “The confidence that comes from the achievement of others. Your parents are successful and you think that’s you.” Today, Tighe is involved with her old high school in the Bronx and also works with the Inner City scholarship fund which gives free tuition to children. She has been funding scholarships since 1982, and she stays in touch with the recipients. “Every one of these kids tells me the same thing,” she says. “Getting that scholarship made me realize I was special and changed everything. That vote of confidence in someone is transformational.” From prep school to the managing director of an ad agency When Nancy Reyes was 11 she was selected for a diversity initiative called Prep for Prep. The program identifies promising students of colour in New York and sends them to private schools. Reyes was living in Queens at the time. Her dad was a taxi driver and her mom was a cleaner. She says: it was “a very paycheck-to-paycheck kind of life.” She went to the program after school to get caught up on things that private school kids learned, like Latin. Then, at age 13, she got a place at Trinity, one of the most prestigious schools in the US. Reyes credits Prep for Prep for where she is today: the managing director of New York ad agency TBWA/Chiat/Day, and one of the most respected women in advertising. But being plucked from working-class Queens and inserted into a school filled with Manhattan aristocracy was tough. “If you’re going to do these programs where you insert people of color into private schools, then they also need some therapy,” Reyes tells me. “I certainly did.” Her accent, for example, immediately marked her out as different. “I wanted so badly not to have an accent; to speak ‘properly.’” Kids would say “do the Rosie Perez,” to her a lot, Reyes remembers. In private, she was training herself to speak differently. “Not to say cawfee, for example, and not to do any of the things that I think were perceived as being people-of color-things. Like rolling your eyes or doing those kind of side-to-side head movements. I always thought, that’s not me, I’m not that person. I belong here, I’m gonna behave like everybody else behaves.” The fact that her parents would never be like the other kids’ parents, however, was sometimes frustrating. “I remember having a moment where I yelled at my mom because she wouldn’t learn English. I remember saying, ‘This is America, you have to speak English!’ I was so brutal to her.” So desperate was Reyes to fit that, on occasion, she – literally – almost died of embarrassment. Trinity students all knew how to swim well; the school had a big pool and everyone had summer houses with pools. She didn’t. One year, she was invited to a pool party. “Everybody was pushing everybody into the pool, messing around. I got pushed into the pool and I was treading water, because I didn’t know how to swim. I was too embarrassed to tell anyone or ask for help, even though I might have drowned.” When time came to apply for college, Reyes ended up getting accepted to all the Ivy League colleges she’d applied to. She came home one day and the acceptance letters were there waiting for her. That was the moment, Reyes says, when she thought for the first time, “Oh my God, I think I belong. I remember sitting on the stoop and opening them and thinking, I earned it.” At Harvard, Reyes was selected (“punched,” they call it in Harvardese) for the prestigious Hasty Pudding Club. She was excited about it until she started filling out the application, which asked about her parents’ occupation. “I remember thinking, ‘Why do you need to know their occupation?’ As soon as I put that down, you’re gonna be like, ‘No way a taxi driver’s kid can come here.’” Reyes shrugged. “So, I was like, fuck it, and I didn’t do it. I didn’t have to be reminded that I was poor, while everybody else was rich.” After years of trying to fit in with her over-privileged peers, Reyes realized that perhaps she didn’t want to be so much like them after all."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/jan/11/uber-developed-secret-system-to-lock-down-staff-computers-in-a-police-raid","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T21:48:17Z","webTitle":"Uber developed secret system to lock down staff computers in a police raid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/11/uber-developed-secret-system-to-lock-down-staff-computers-in-a-police-raid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jan/11/uber-developed-secret-system-to-lock-down-staff-computers-in-a-police-raid","fields":{"headline":"Uber developed secret system to lock down staff computers in a police raid","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Uber developed a secret system called Ripley that would lock down staff computers in the event of a police raid, preventing officials from accessing company data. The ride-sharing company used Ripley at least two dozen times in 2015 and 2016 in countries including Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Hong Kong, according to Bloomberg. In one case Ripley was deployed to prevent Canadian tax investigators, who believed Uber had violated tax laws, from collecting evidence even though they had a warrant. As soon as they burst into the Montreal office, Uber staff paged the headquarters in San Francisco who remotely logged everyone in that office off their devices. Uber first developed the system, initially called the “unexpected visitor protocol”, after a police raid in its Brussels office, where Belgian law enforcement officers accessed the company’s financial documents, payments system and worker data. A court order subsequently forced Uber to shut down its service for operating without proper licenses. It was nicknamed Ripley after a line spoken by the protagonist in the Alien movies, who decides that the only way to destroy all the murderous extraterrestrials is to destroy their entire habitat. “I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit. It’s the only way to be sure,” she says. The line has been reappropriated by information security teams to describe an extreme response to a detected threat. Uber downplayed the tool and said it was common practice to have such software to remotely change passwords or lock devices in the event they were lost or stolen. “Like every company with offices around the world, we have security procedures in place to protect corporate and customer data,” said an Uber spokeswoman. “When it comes to government investigations, it’s our policy to cooperate with all valid searches and requests for data. After the Montreal raid, a judge in the subsequent tax lawsuit wrote that Uber’s actions showed “all the characteristics of an attempt to obstruct justice” and that the company was trying to hide “evidence of its illegal activities”. Uber granted access to the relevant files once issued with a second, more specific search warrant. Albert Gidari, director of privacy at Stanford Law School’s Center for Internet &amp; Society, added that companies often protect networks and computers against dawn raids where the scope of authority is in question and the data to be seized is in another jurisdiction. “If a company centralises its business data in country X and the authorities in country Y raid the local office and try to access that data through computers at employee desktops, that’s a cross-border search,” he said. “It also generally may permit access to areas and data not covered by any warrant.” Ryan Kalember from cybersecurity firm Proofpoint added that although it is standard practice to be able to remotely lock all systems or wipe data from devices, it’s less typical to develop a specific tool and to give it such an evocative name. “That’s the only strange thing here to me,” he said. Even so, Uber has a history of developing tools to evade regulators, some of which are facing criminal investigations in the United States. Federal investigators are looking into a tool called Greyball, which was used to ensure drivers wouldn’t pick up law enforcement officials in cities where its service violated regulations and another code-named “Hell” which was designed to track the drivers at rival Lyft."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/11/newcastle-decision-peter-beardsley-future","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T19:59:25Z","webTitle":"Newcastle United set to decide Peter Beardsley’s future next week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/11/newcastle-decision-peter-beardsley-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/11/newcastle-decision-peter-beardsley-future","fields":{"headline":"Newcastle United set to decide Peter Beardsley’s future next week","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Peter Beardsley will almost certainly have to wait until the middle of next week before learning if he is to lose his job coaching Newcastle United’s under‑23 side. Yasin Ben El-Mhanni, a 22-year-old reserve winger, has accused the former England international of bullying and racism and on Thursday had a meeting with Lee Charnley, the club’s managing director, to discuss his allegations. Charnley, who spoke to Beardsley on Monday before placing him on gardening leave the following day, has spent the week speaking to assorted witnesses – El‑Mhanni’s claims were supported by written submissions from five team-mates – and hopes to conclude a wide-ranging internal investigation by the weekend. It is then understood Charnley will allow himself time to reflect on all the evidence before making a decision which could potentially involve sacking Beardsley. There is a sense at the club it will be difficult for the 56-year-old to return to his old role and it would be little surprise were a mutual parting of the ways or, possibly, resignation to be announced next week. Beardsley has issued a strong denial of the allegations through his solicitor and is understood to believe he has done nothing wrong. During discussions with Charnley he strongly rebutted all accusations. Given the nature of the grievances and Beardsley’s status as one of Newcastle’s greatest players, the situation is delicate. Potentially the most damaging claim involves an allegation centred on a squad outing to Go Ape, a Tyneside adventure playground. Spotting two young African players struggling on the climbing apparatus, Beardsley is alleged to have told one of them: “You lot should be good at this.” While it is believed the Under-23 coach does not dispute making the remark, Beardsley is understood to adamantly maintain this was a general reference to the wider group of fit, young, supposedly agile, footballers and had nothing to do with ethnicity. Given both the support for El-Mhanni -(a Londoner of Moroccan heritage) - within the Under-23 squad and the fact that the winger and his representatives declined an offer to undergo a form of arbitration involving Charnley mediating a meeting between the player and Beardsley, an amicable resolution of the situation seems unlikely. The lack of Under-23s graduating to Rafael Benitez’s first team is thought to have led Charnley to consider moving the reserve team coach to another role last summer before, ultimately, deciding against a switch. Whatever the outcome of the investigation, several club insiders feel the time may now be right to refresh, and modernise, the junior‑team management structure. Beardsley, who was supported by a PFA representative during Monday’s meeting with Charnley, is in the second of two coaching stints with Newcastle’s juniors. The first ran from 2001-2006 and involved him being cleared of bullying complaints from three academy players by a Premier League investigation in 2003. In 2006 the then first team manager, Glenn Roeder, instigated his switch into an ambassadorial role but Beardsley returned to coaching duties at the academy three years later, subsequently being promoted to take charge of the Under-23s. El-Mhanni has regularly been flown around the world by private jet in order to teach other players his trademark ball skills and tricks. A left-winger who has doubled for Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar in adverts for football boots, he has undeniable, if raw, talent but is struggling to make the grade in the professional game. His contract expires in June. Although the former Barnet player made two cup appearances for Rafael Benitez’s first team last season, he failed to make a positive impact. At the time Beardsley said: “Yasin’s got unbelievable ability but I would say, without being negative, he needs to learn the game. He needs to know when to defend, when to help, when to get himself organised but he’s a great kid.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/11/alex-oxlade-chamberlain-relishes-chance-philippe-coutinho-liverpool","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T22:30:12Z","webTitle":"Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain senses chance to step up after Philippe Coutinho exit | Andy Hunter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/11/alex-oxlade-chamberlain-relishes-chance-philippe-coutinho-liverpool","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/11/alex-oxlade-chamberlain-relishes-chance-philippe-coutinho-liverpool","fields":{"headline":"Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain senses chance to step up after Philippe Coutinho exit","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Liverpool sanctioned a seismic transfer while the bulk of Jürgen Klopp’s squad were in Dubai but, as far as Alex Oxlade‑Chamberlain is concerned, reverberations from Philippe Coutinho’s £142m move to Barcelona will not damage the dressing room. The “new boy” is not being cold or dismissive towards a team-mate of merely four months. It is, he says, strictly business, and the responsibility of every Liverpool player to compensate for the second biggest transfer fee of all time. “I haven’t really even thought about Phil leaving,” insists Liverpool’s summer arrival from Arsenal, fresh from the mid-season break that followed the FA Cup defeat of Everton. “You pay it attention and you realise it happens but you can’t think: ‘What are we going to do now that Phil is not here?’. It can’t be that at all. It’s business as usual. “When Phil didn’t play in some games we still played great football and we still have amazing players who can score goals – the likes of Mo [Salah], Sadio [Mané], Roberto [Firmino] and everyone else. We have goals and creativity all over the team. Obviously Phil added to that, there is no doubt about that. The fact is he has gone now and we have to think about what we have got that is going to get the job done. I have every faith in the boys that we just move on now. I don’t think it should affect us at all.” Oxlade-Chamberlain is effusive in his praise of the Brazil international; protective too, as witnessed by his defence of Coutinho when the then delicate subject of Barcelona cropped up on Sky after Liverpool’s win at Bournemouth last month. But he is a professional who witnessed big departures and big arrivals at Arsenal, and knows the effect of Coutinho’s transfer on Liverpool will be determined by the response of those he left behind. Virgil van Dijk’s £75m arrival and match-winning debut in the derby is, he believes, evidence that the process is under way positively. “I am the type of person who relishes the chance to stand up and perform under pressure, I have had to do that my whole career,” the 24-year-old says. “I was at a big club previously and being at a big one now, you know you are always going to have to perform under pressure. “I knew Phil was a world-class talent before I joined. Since I arrived I saw what an influential part he was of the side. In the short history he was here, Phil was a big character around the place, a fan favourite and rightly so. He was an amazing player who did great things for Liverpool. You want as many good players as possible in your team but that is football, that’s the business – people come, people go. Clubs will lose great players and great players will come in. “We have just brought in Virgil and what an amazing addition he has been. In the short time he has been here, he has brought that air of confidence with his persona and that has been a big lift for us. “At a massive club like Liverpool, people will come and go. It is our job to keep the wheels moving and momentum going. You don’t like to see friends go – Phil is a really good guy – but for me it is business as usual. I’ve got every respect for Phil and his decisions, I wish him all the best, but he is not in my thoughts right now moving on to Manchester City because he is not going to be able to affect the score on Sunday.” Oxlade-Chamberlain admits Coutinho’s absence from the Liverpool midfield represents “an opportunity for me, just as it is for the rest of the boys who want to play there”. The opportunity had been taken prior to the Brazilian’s exit, however. The midfielder required patience as well as receptiveness towards Klopp’s methods following his deadline day move from Arsenal for an initial £35m. Oxlade-Chamberlain started only three of Liverpool’s first 15 games after the transfer window but has begun seven of the last dozen. “You want to play as much as possible but I am not the type of character to go bursting walls down,” he says of the quiet start to life at Anfield. “I knew coming into a new environment that the manager would want me to learn the way he wants me to play and how to play best with the team. I respected I was the new boy and I had a lot of learning to do. So I got my head down and did exactly that. Slowly but surely I got my foot in the door and started playing a bit more but I know in football that can change quickly. “The biggest thing I’ve had to learn is how this manager likes to stop situations at source and how he likes to attack is slightly different to how my manager before [Arsène Wenger] liked to attack. There’s not really one right and one wrong way but after six years at one club certain things become second nature to you and it takes time to break that instinct.” Liverpool’s post-Coutinho world, and Oxlade-Chamberlain’s confidence in it, faces an immediate examination on Sunday when Pep Guardiola’s unbeaten Manchester City arrive at Anfield. It is another challenge he embraces. “Of course, they are not unbeatable,” the midfielder insists. “They haven’t lost many games but they’re still human. We know we can beat City. We have everything we need to get the right result.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/12/momentum-labour-transform-heartlands-corbyn-vision-mass-movement","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T07:59:23Z","webTitle":"Inspired by Momentum, Labour can transform the heartlands – and itself | Laura Parker","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/12/momentum-labour-transform-heartlands-corbyn-vision-mass-movement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/12/momentum-labour-transform-heartlands-corbyn-vision-mass-movement","fields":{"headline":"Inspired by Momentum, Labour can transform the heartlands – and itself","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"For too long, towns at the end of train lines and cities that once were bustling manufacturing hubs have been left behind by politics. In their glory days, places in my home county of Yorkshire such as Sheffield and Hull were heartlands of British industry. Building ships to protect the nation, making steel that was sold worldwide – these places thrived. Deindustrialisation and a lack of government investment have robbed these communities of well-paid jobs, opportunities and, for many, hope. They are scarred by job losses and unemployment; shops have fled from their high streets; and the lives of their young people are marred by uncertainty. These communities have been failed by politicians on both sides of parliament’s benches. But this week Labour has turned a corner. It launched a new, properly resourced department at the party’s HQ, committed to community organising in the places that need attention the most. Never mind Theresa May’s PR reshuffle – Labour is going to transform deindustrialised towns across the country now, even while in opposition. The idea is simple. Change doesn’t only come from Westminster. In fact, frequently Westminster is the last place to understand that change is happening. Instead, it comes from ordinary people in their local areas, working together to make things better. Take Deborah, a Momentum member in Lancaster. She didn’t wait for the government to help those going hungry in her community as a result of the government’s callous and failing policies. Instead she set up a local food club where anybody can become a member, pay £3 a week and receive £30-£40 of food that would have otherwise gone to waste. The idea is to help people who are up against it, but in a way that builds community and solidarity. Everybody pays their subs, so everybody is equal. The food clubs then become a springboard for other community activity and avoid the pitfalls of creating givers and receivers. They’ve inspired so many people that another seven food clubs have opened across Lancaster and Morecambe, with more in the pipeline, and Deborah now plans to open a food depot run on the same principles. Labour’s support for this way of doing politics is a clear break with the top-down centralisation of the New Labour years. Not only will it make a concrete difference to people’s lives now – demonstrating the potential of a Corbyn government – but it also represents a practical implementation of a fundamentally new politics, one that values the contribution of ordinary people and recognises their ability to change their communities for the better. It goes without saying that in order to transform Britain we’ll need a majority in parliament. But we will also need to build the skills, expertise and confidence of party members. This means a political party becoming a real vehicle for community empowerment – and more than just an election-winning machine. For many this is about returning to Labour’s roots, remembering that the party was born from a movement. For the new generation, it’s about developing a culture of solidarity that they may well have never experienced. Organisations such as Citizens UK have been doing just that for some time, helping to win the living wage and tackle bad housing. Across the pond, community organising is a fixed feature in American neighbourhoods that face gruelling social injustices and inequality. Importantly, at the heart of struggles for better lives and living conditions, campaigns are won. The seeds of a mass movement Labour party are already there. Labour members in Doncaster worked with the community to end rip-off lending by the rent-to-own firm BrightHouse – winning a payout of close to £15m for affected customers. Similarly, Momentum members across south London organised a community lobby to stop the cinema firm Picturehouse – which has faced vibrant protests over its refusal to pay the living wage – from winning a new contract in the area. For many of us, imagining what Labour’s new organising unit will reap is an exciting prospect. Getting into seaside and deindustrialised towns to rebuild trust and win campaigns that change lives will provide a bastion of hope in a renewed Labour party. The only way we will truly transform society is from the bottom as well as the top – through powerful government policy, and action within our communities. Alongside the new community organising department, Momentum will play its part. Building on our training programme, we’ll be equipping a new network of prospective councillors with the skills, resources and support to help their communities help themselves. No doubt 2018 is set to be a year where more Labour members than ever will be mobilised. And Labour’s turn towards being a member-led, movement party should scare the Tories. Not only did we outnumber them on the ground at the last general election, we will now be making a difference in the constituencies where it matters the most. With the weight of the party behind every community campaign, Labour members will be supported to transform their communities – soon to be backed up by a Labour government that will transform the country. • Laura Parker is Momentum’s national coordinator"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/12/abuse-isnt-romantic-feminists-eros-me-too","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T11:22:15Z","webTitle":"Abuse isn't romantic.

Iconic French actress Catherine Deneuve says the movement is puritanical and men should be able to “hit on women”. New York Times writer Daphne Merkin wants to know “whatever happened to flirting?” The Hollywood Reporter bemoans that #MeToo could “kill sexy Hollywood movies” while Cathy Young at the Los Angeles Times believes it will end office romance. Ross Douthat is even worried that the push to end sexual harassment could stunt population growth. Who knew that humankind’s very existence depended on women’s silence in the face of abuse? The truth, of course, is that there’s no war on romance: the majority of outed abusers are being accused of rape, serial harassment and exposing their genitals to unwilling women. Not exactly the stuff of office flirtation. Still, somehow we’ve reached a point where any behavior short of violent predation – let’s call it the “not as bad as Weinstein” standard – is characterized as misunderstood seduction. Merkin says, “stripping sex of eros isn’t the solution”. But whose “eros” are we really worried about? As Vox journalist Laura McGann put it this week at a media event, “I don’t see this uprising of 22-year-old women saying, ‘I want the right to sleep with my boss.’” As has been the case for so long, the backlash to #MeToo is about what men want and protecting their right to have it. If it wasn’t, we’d see a spate of panicked articles about teenage girls being arrested and charged with distributing child abuse images after sending nude photos to their boyfriends. Unlike the men outed by #MeToo, none of whom have been held to real account, these young people are actually being criminalized for consensual romantic behavior. Where is the open letter on their behalf? There’s a reason so many people are conflating bad and sometimes criminal behavior with romance: traditional ideas about seduction rely on tropes of women witholding sex and men working hard to get it. It’s a narrow notion of heterosexuality – one that does a good job excusing abusive behavior. “Trying to seduce someone, even persistently or cack-handedly, is not [a crime],” Deneuve’s letter read. Not always, that’s true. But when it’s considered “natural” for men to doggedly pursue women – even those who have made it clear they’re not interested – we make it easier for a predator to claim he was just following a normal romantic script. Perhaps instead of mourning the loss of office “flirtations”, we should consider the idea that some women never liked them much to begin with. When will we have more concern for the women hurt by abuse than the men accused of it? One of Roy Moore’s accusers had her house burnt to the ground – arson is suspected. Harper’s magazine was on the brink of publishing the name of a woman who created the Shitty Media Men list before a feminist Twitter campaign stopped it. Some women won’t see justice for years, some ever. This moment isn’t about romance, it’s about abuse. Perhaps the fact that so many people can’t tell the difference is part of the problem.

Poland already has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe, with terminations permitted only when the life of the foetus is under threat, when there is a grave threat to the health of the mother, or if the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. If enacted, the “stop abortion” bill – a so-called citizens’ initiative proposed by hardline conservative groups – would outlaw abortions carried out because of a congenital disorder of the foetus. Such cases account for about 95% of legal abortions in Poland. It is estimated that tens of thousands of illegal terminations occur in Poland each year, and many Polish women seeking abortions also go abroad, or order abortion pills online. “This is a black day for Polish women,” said Krystyna Kacpura, an executive director of the Federation for Women and Family Planning. “If the bill is passed, Polish women will die. We are treated as unneeded – we are just there to give birth, and if we give birth to a very sick child, we are left to bring the child up by ourselves without any help.” In 2016, Poland’s ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) was forced to back away from a blanket ban on abortion when the proposal’s passage to the committee stage provoked mass street demonstrations that came to be known as the “black protests”. But the rightwing party’s leader, Jarosław Kaczyński, indicated that the government would continue to seek to tighten the law. He said: “We will strive to ensure that even in pregnancies which are very difficult, when a child is sure to die, strongly deformed, women end up giving birth so that the child can be baptised, buried, and have a name.” Introducing the proposed restrictions on Wednesday, Kaja Godek of the anti-abortion Life and Family Foundation told MPs that “we have come to parliament today because we don’t want hospitals turning into abattoirs”. Since assuming office in 2015, PiS has ended state funding for IVF treatment and restricted access to emergency contraception, introducing a requirement for a prescription in order to obtain the morning-after pill. Łukasz Szumowski, appointed health minister during a government reshuffle this week, is one of almost 4,000 Polish doctors to have signed a “declaration of faith” committing not to participate in “abortion, euthanasia, contraception, artificial insemination, and/or in vitro fertilisation” on the grounds that such acts “not only violate the basic commandments of the Decalogue, but reject the creator as well”. MPs considered a proposal to liberalise abortion laws. The “save women” bill would allow abortion until the 12th week of pregnancy and provide for better access to emergency contraception, medical care and sex education. But its progress to the committee stage was rejected by eight votes, prompting recriminations as pro-choice activists accused opposition MPs of betraying Polish women by failing to show up. Dozens of opposition MPs who were present abstained. “Many politicians believe their careers depend on the Catholic church,” said Kacpura. “But we will continue to fight this, because we are fighting for our lives.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/14/week-in-tv-kiri-next-of-kin-spiral-sarah-lancashire-review","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T07:00:20Z","webTitle":"The week in TV: Kiri; Next of Kin; Spiral","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/14/week-in-tv-kiri-next-of-kin-spiral-sarah-lancashire-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/14/week-in-tv-kiri-next-of-kin-spiral-sarah-lancashire-review","fields":{"headline":"The week in TV: Kiri; Next of Kin; Spiral","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Kiri (C4) | All 4 Next of Kin (ITV) | ITV Player Spiral (BBC Four) | iPlayer We learned from 2016’s National Treasure a couple of things about writer Jack Thorne: that he doesn’t do cheap sententious moralising – that particular take on Operation Yewtree could have been woefully tawdry in lesser hands – and that he likes to keep us guessing to the end. The signs are all there that his new TV thriller, Kiri, will be even more nuanced and similarly gnarly right down to the wire. And, I think, even better. Where NT had the arguable “mereness” of the icky fat old man/babysitter factor, this first episode ended with the gut-punch that was the discovery of young Kiri’s body in a woodland ditch near Bristol. There are big themes here, of trans-race adoption, of race itself and class itself, of much pulling up of drawbridges inside a social work department: where NT was all about shame, Kiri is all about blame. It began, however, impossibly breezily, Bristol’s very flyovers made to look somehow leafy and dappled, and gutsy social worker Miriam, within about eight minutes, and with minimal props – a hip flask, a gouty, flatulent rescue dog – establishing this is a caring lass who knows how to cut meaningless corners, knows not to take pointless offence when none is meant, despairs of tinpot bureaucrats, will soldier on uphill past many strangers with a clap on the shoulder and a weary backward wave: crucially, this was a part that only really deserved to be owned by Sarah Lancashire. Happy Valley’s Sgt Catherine Cawood has migrated with ludicrous ease to the Bristolian accent, and for a while the sun still shines: even when Kiri, for whom Miriam’s organised a last-minute house visit to her black birth grandparents before nodding through her official adoption, from the care of a jailbird father to (apparently) nice, white, middle classers – even when Kiri suddenly disappears Miriam’s reaction is concern, yes, but mainly exasperation. Which is why it is such a shock, for us but mainly for her, when the body is found. The tabloid shitstorm begins, literally laps right up to her front door. (I’ll have to be careful what I say about tabloids from now on. From next week, we is one.) Had the department’s tick-box protocols prioritised Kiri’s “cultural” needs over her safety? Had Miriam cut one breezy corner too many? Expect echoes of the Sun’s hounding of former children’s services boss Sharon Shoesmith (backed, you’ll remember, by that sturdy gossamer of a man David Cameron), and much arse-covering, and perhaps some class issues as the foster family parade their undoubted pain. Expect, too, the retelling of that afternoon from various angles: we’ve yet even to see it from the point of view of Kiri’s grandad, Tobi, the phenomenal Lucian Msamati. And expect rightful dissection of Miriam’s possible errors: was she right to airily prioritise the care of farty dog Jessie above the inspection of Tobi’s flat; is the cheeky wee hipflask there as a fillip or a crutch? Utterly enthralling, and I’ll be waiting with chewed fingers to see how this pans out over four too-short episodes. Remarkably, last week saw not one but two sensitive portrayals of cross-cultural new Britain, without stereotyping nor a galumphing message-heavy rabbit punch to the back of the neck. Perhaps we are, after all, finally growing up a little. Next of Kin – a six-part thriller co-written by the delightful Natasha Narayan, once of this parish – is brutal, yes, as anything veering from Lahore to London, featuring beheadings and bombs and radicalisation was always going to be – but tender, too, in its vibrance of London life as lived by the Shirani clan. Correction: as once lived. Now they are down two, a beloved brother, taken by an Isis franchise on his way home from good medical works, and a son, possibly radicalised, fled from London to Spain or rather, of course, Lahore. The suspicions descend like a pall, on all the family, all the friends, and you yearn for the first minutes when the Shiranis were just getting on with their lives – joking, and wearing miniskirts, and tutting, and arguing over tidiness and food and phones – in Britain. My own suspicions too: I was wrong, as it turned out, but I inwardly winced at the simple sight of a tourist bus slowly ambling down a London kerb, convinced there was about to come a crack, and screams, and a bloom of blue smoke, and the sirens. The terrorists shall not cow us, they say, but increasingly politicians’ easy slogans just begin to look exactly that: if I am conditioned to react this way, never mind the appalling effect on the likes of the Shiranis, even or, especially, the good doctor Mona (the always standout Archie Panjabi), whose very neighbours now shun them… hasn’t someone won, or at least something large been lost? Hugely intelligent television, and I hope it will not stoop early to cliche. It is not too late (it turns out) to come to Spiral, which is now, if a little suddenly, my favourite TV viewing of the year, if not all time. Many have tried to put their fingers on why they should find it so absorbing, this subtitled buddy-buddy-buddy flic flick set, by and large, on the scuzzy side of the peripherique, a Paris far from champagne and waiters and tourist tat, a Paris perfumed in the main by burning tyres, cheap, stinking smuggled cigarettes and ribald bleak humour. The French title is Engrenages, which more literally translates as something approaching “wheels within cogs”, which is slightly more apposite: in each series, the stories whirl, collide, mesh or spatter, and you’re left with an admiring, head-shaking, revolted sense of “wha’ppen?” There is nothing but seamlessly good acting here, whether it’s the main triangle of cops – Laure, Gilou, Tintin – or legal stalwarts examining magistrate FranÇois Roban (Philippe Duclos) and flame-haired lawyer Joséphine Karlsson (Audrey Fleurot). Filmed last year during Paris’s many troubles, it can’t have been an easy series to get into the can (not least last night’s street riot) and the very unease of the police, if not the actual open terrorism, is perfectly evinced, with a plot that reeks of paranoia. Not that the main trio might notice: Gilou and Tintin continue to buffer and batter their way through each other and through the plot, big old buffoon teddy bears with guns: above all, Caroline Proust as Captain Laure Berthaud holds them all together. Determinedly unsmiling, spartanly as unsexy as ever a Frenchwoman can be, yet when she does smile tout le monde smiles with her. If you only watch one series of Spiral, watch this one."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/13/frankenstein-at-200-why-hasnt-mary-shelley-been-given-the-respect-she-deserves-","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-13T08:00:00Z","webTitle":"Frankenstein at 200 – why hasn't Mary Shelley been given the respect she deserves?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/13/frankenstein-at-200-why-hasnt-mary-shelley-been-given-the-respect-she-deserves-","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/13/frankenstein-at-200-why-hasnt-mary-shelley-been-given-the-respect-she-deserves-","fields":{"headline":"Frankenstein at 200 – why hasn't Mary Shelley been given the respect she deserves?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I became fascinated by Mary Shelley and her most famous novel because of her husband. Back in 2011, I found myself trying to make sense of Percy Bysshe Shelley’s poetry. It was a tricky assignment. Percy was above all a creature of his own cultural moment, and nothing dates like a zeitgeist. Yet Mary’s Frankenstein comes out of just the same heady cultural and political nexus as her husband’s verse, and her novel has continued to fascinate us. Two hundred years after its publication in January 1818, it still speaks to us directly as a myth about contemporary life. It has inspired film adaptations across genres, from the comedy caper Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein to the quasi-rock opera The Rocky Horror Picture Show and sci-fi classics such as Blade Runner. Then there’s the apparently endless schlock and kitsch in comics and cosplay (where fans dress up as their favourite fictional characters). It has become the go-to journalistic shorthand for technological interventions in human biology or medical science: Dr Frankenstein and his creature make their way in the mainstream of modern life. They reappear in our fantasies and nightmares more consistently than most fictional or historical characters. Now we can expect a slew of new Frankensteins, as everyone’s favourite scar-faced shuffling giant and his creator are remade for a new time. Mary has been much researched, all too often in terms of whether she was good or bad for Percy. But she hadn’t been placed at the centre of her own story since Miranda Seymour’s magisterial biography in 2000. I wanted to discover a Mary Shelley for our times: to find the girl behind the book, and to reconstruct what writing it must have been like. Her story is every bit as archetypal as that of Mary’s two most famous characters – her life and relationships with men couldn’t be more relevant for our #MeToo era. Mary was just 18 when she had the idea for Frankenstein; 19 when she finished writing the book. How could a teenager come up with not one but two enduring archetypes: the scientist obsessed by blue-sky research and unable to see it has ethical and social consequences, and the near human he creates? It’s an astonishing achievement, and even more so when we remember that, being a girl, Mary wasn’t educated in the same way as many of her Romantic writing peers. Unlike Percy, she had no Eton nor Oxford, but had lessons in the home schoolroom and a grim six months at Miss Pettman’s Ladies’ School in Ramsgate, and learned from browsing the books in her father’s library. Her parents were two of the most notorious radicals of her day: her mother, who died of complications 11 days after her birth, was Mary Wollstonecraft, author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman; her father was the political philosopher and novelist William Godwin. He may have been a proponent of anarchism but he upheld many contemporary conventions at home. Once Mary eloped with Percy at the age of 16, for example, the former apostle of free love cut off his daughter until she was respectably married. So how on earth did Mary create her precocious masterpiece? One answer given by readers and critics down the years is that she didn’t. On its first, anonymous appearance reviewers surmised that this novel of ideas was written by someone close to Godwin, but not that the author might be his daughter. Percy, as son-in-law, was credited instead. Even in recent years Percy’s corrections, visible in the Frankenstein notebooks held at the Bodleian Library in Oxford, have been seized on as evidence that he must have at least co-authored the novel. In fact, when I examined the notebooks myself, I realised that Percy did rather less than any line editor working in publishing today. A second sceptical response to Mary’s astonishing achievement disparages her more slyly, suggesting that the archetypes of Frankenstein and his creature aren’t in fact original. Such sceptics cite the classical myth of Pygmalion, a sculptor who creates a lover for himself, or the half-human figure of Caliban in The Tempest. Both were part of the early 19th-century cultural canon and, growing up in a literary household, Mary will have been aware of them. But her own creations differ from both, and it’s these different qualities that speak so vividly to us today. Pygmalion, at least in Ovid’s Metamorphoses, doesn’t set out to create a human, he simply falls in love with one of his own creations. The goddess Aphrodite is so touched by this that she brings the sculpture to life for him. George Bernard Shaw’s 1913 play Pygmalion retells this parable about artistic vanity. His story about Henry Higgins, the linguist who makes a young lady out of a street flower-seller but does so for his own benefit not hers, remains familiar today in Lerner and Loewe’s version, the musical My Fair Lady. A statue also turns into a woman in Shakespeare’s The Winter’s Tale, when the figure of King Leontes’ much-mourned wife comes to life. Every 16th-century grammar school boy got a smattering of classical education; the young Shakespeare is likely to have encountered the Pygmalion myth in his Stratford-upon-Avon classroom. Thus The Tempest echoes another classical myth in which the Minotaur, like fellow island-dweller Caliban, is the hideous offspring of a human mother and a supernatural father and lords it over his island until subdued by an arriving hero. Clearly, neither is a precursor for Mary’s ambitious young doctor who wants to create the perfect human, but fails to do so. In fact, Frankenstein is one of the great novels of failure, taking its place somewhere between Cervantes’s rambling 17th-century masterpiece, Don Quixote (which Mary read while she was working on her novel) and Hemingway’s 1952 novella, The Old Man and the Sea. In both these books, though, failure is viewed with compassion, in the context of human dignity and ideals. Frankenstein, on the other hand, portrays it as the destructive result of overreaching. Mary’s portrait of failure as the dark heart of hubris is couched in terms so strong they seem almost religious. Sure enough, this idealistic young daughter of a former dissenting minister believed that right and wrong were a matter of fact, not just opinion. Yet Frankenstein’s passionate appeal for justice is moving, not sermonising. Mary never had the chance to be a prig. Even as she was writing what became her first novel, years of the harsh censure of a woman’s private life that today would be referred to as “slut-shaming” had begun. She had been ostracised by family and friends for running off with Percy, a married man, and was subjected to sniggering speculation by male acquaintances. The couple married after Percy’s first wife, Harriet, took her own life, but were regarded as so disreputable that, in an unprecedented decision, they were refused custody of Percy’s children from his first marriage. In future years, Mary would sit through a sermon preached against her, find her husband viewed as fair game by other women, and her in-laws would campaign to take away her surviving child. Even so, sincere and engaging as it may be, her moral stance is not what makes Frankenstein feel so contemporary. Nor does its early 19th-century technology. Mary imagined first a combination of maths and alchemy – and then electricity in her revised 1832 edition – animating her patchwork corpse. Neither really resonates in today’s age of biochemical breakthroughs and genetic engineering. The laboratory electrocution scene first imagined in James Whale’s classic 1931 film of Frankenstein now seems fabulously kitsch. But in the novel, myth powers technology and not the other way around. Frankenstein shows us that aspiration and progress are indistinguishable from hubris – until something goes wrong, when suddenly we see all too clearly what was reasonable endeavour and what overreaching. By the time she wrote her classic, Mary was aware that the man she had married was an emotional and philosophical overreacher. For all his family wealth, Percy was often in debt. And his timing was staggeringly poor: even during her first pregnancy he had pressured 17-year-old Mary to sleep with his best friend in pursuit of free love, while his own long-running romantic involvement with Mary’s stepsister had started at the time of the couple’s elopement. Moreover, for a soi-disant writer, remarkably little of his work had been published; Mary spent a lot of time fair copying it to send to publishers. But Frankenstein is no memoir. The question it asks, “How far is too far?”, is at the very heart of modernity. The Romantics, Mary among them, “leaned in” to progress. The great historian Eric Hobsbawm called the period from the beginning of the French Revolution in 1789 to the outbreak of the first world war “the long 19th century”. Published early in this classical era of modernity, Mary’s novel still helps us define its terms today. Shorthand for the way we experience ourselves within a world of increasing man-made complexity, “modernity” is both positive and negative, signalling hope for progress as well as our fear of change. Frankenstein identifies the mismatch between human experience and what we are expected to become as technology and science advance. As well as being emotionally expressive, Frankenstein was informed by contemporary intellectual debate. In 1816, when Mary started writing it, the study of natural phenomena wasn’t yet a proper profession; the term “scientist” had yet to be invented. Amateur speculation could be cutting-edge. Those who were professional gave fashionable public lectures, which encouraged more amateur participation. When Mary was in her teens, these lecturers included her father’s friend, the chemist and inventor Sir Humphry Davy; the Italian physicist and philosopher Dr Luigi Galvani and his nephew Giovanni Aldini, each of whom gave demonstrations of how to pass an electric current through the nerves of a dead body. Her times seem so right for Mary’s novel that I was briefly tempted by a third response to the puzzle of how Frankenstein came into being: a very young woman simply, rather artlessly, channelled whatever was going on in her social and cultural milieu into her book. Of course this reduces cultural history to the folk wisdom that “everyone’s got a book in them”, and ignores the labour and technique entailed in producing a work that is publishable – not to mention a great one. Yet it’s fascinating how frequently female writers do incur this reaction. Think of the widespread reception of that towering 20th-century writer Sylvia Plath – no less a transformative poet than her husband Ted Hughes – as simply expressing her feelings. Indeed, think today of the US poet Sharon Olds, forced for years to equivocate over whether material in her Pulitzer prize-winning work is autobiographical lest she be similarly dismissed. The question is not how did Mary write Frankenstein, but why is it so hard to believe that she did? After all, she herself left a portrait of the kind of thinking she enjoyed: the leaping, near-intuitive intellect she gives her Dr Frankenstein. Just the sort of “aha!” that can suddenly, and brilliantly, synthesise a number of apparently unrelated ideas, exactly as Mary’s story does. Everything we know about her writing process – and we know a lot, thanks to her journal and letters – tells us it was consciously literary, painstakingly crafted. Even its famous trigger was literary. After they had spent an evening in June 1816 reading ghost stories together, Lord Byron set a group of his guests at Villa Diodati, on the banks of Lake Geneva, a writing competition. As Mary recalled: “‘We will each write a ghost story,’ said Lord Byron … I busied myself to think of a story, a story to rival those which had excited us to this task.” Meanwhile the men in the room – Percy, and either Byron or Byron’s doctor John William Polidori – were having a serious talk about “the principles of life”. It seems to have occurred to no one that Mary, having already given birth twice and lost her first child at 12 days old, probably knew more about such “principles” than anyone else present. But everything the teenage mother didn’t feel entitled to mention in Byron’s salon fuels her novel. Mary completed much of Frankenstein while living in Bath, at a time when Percy was often absent. It was a tempestuous year in which both her half-sister Fanny and Harriet Shelley killed themselves, her stepsister’s daughter with Byron was born, Mary got married and was pregnant for the third time. It’s no surprise the novel is so full of human insight and understanding: maternal anxieties about creating a perfect human; fears of ugliness, lovelessness and rejection; an analysis of what it is to be unmothered and alone in the world. These are universal themes and, by August 1818, the book “seems to be universally read”, as their writer friend Thomas Love Peacock reported to Mary and Percy. But Mary wasn’t basking in this success. She had already followed Percy into political exile in Europe, and within a year she would suffer the deaths of both her children. Dragged from pillar to post by the charismatic, unreliable man to whom she was committed, even while he became increasingly unfaithful to her, she would, until Percy’s death in 1822, resemble nothing so much as a “surrendered wife”. It’s impossible to tell the story of her life without at every turn being aware of the fact that Mary was a female writer. Widowed just before turning 25, she discovered that most friends would have nothing to do with someone they saw as a cross between a mere poet’s mistress and the killjoy who cramped his style. She returned to London and spent the next two decades eking out an allowance for her surviving child that her father-in-law loaned her. Sir Timothy Shelley’s own eldest child was illegitimate, but he never accepted Mary – who had lived and had two children with Percy before she married him – into the Shelley family. Still, a dogged survivor and a consummate professional, Mary supported herself, and saw her son through Harrow and Oxford, by her writing, the great bulk of which had to be done anonymously. The archives are full of her unsuccessful attempts to pitch to publishers. It’s hard to imagine a male author who had experienced similar popular and critical success being so consistently knocked back. But Mary had the bad luck not to have started her writing life under a masculine pseudonym. Notorious in literary circles because of her relationship with Percy, she never enjoyed the freedoms of her slightly younger contemporaries, the Brontës and George Eliot. After Frankenstein, she was not read purely as a writer, but always judged as a woman. In a revealing journal entry from 21 October 1838, when she was 41, Mary tried to reconcile the feeling that “To be something great and good was the precept given me” with her failure to write radical philosophy in “the good cause”. “My total friendlessness, my horror of pushing, and inability to put myself forward unless led, cherished and supported, all this has sunk me.” Forced to feel inferior by the double standards stacked against her, yet ashamed of her failure to achieve all a man could without those handicaps: Mary feels absolutely contemporary. We find her today in debates about the Women’s prize for fiction, in magazine articles comparing the fortunes of male and female writers, in the horrors of the casting couch. Frankenstein shows us how failure and hubris are two sides of the same coin. Mary’s life reveals the tremendous hubris it took for this teenaged girl to give birth to two of the most enduring and influential myths of our time.

The government must tell us the truth about Brexit","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Time is fast running out for the UK government to secure a good deal from the Brexit negotiations that protects jobs, growth and living standards for future generations. A final deal has to be agreed by October this year at the very latest, so that it can be ratified by all 27 EU member states before the March 2019 deadline for article 50 – the point at which Britain leaves the EU. That leaves less than 10 months to finalise the vast outstanding exit-related issues that were simply fudged at the end of last year. The most challenging of these are: a viable solution for the Irish border; agreeing the full details of a comprehensive transitional deal; establishing the detailed principles of our future trading relationship, which the EU has consistently said must be agreed before a final deal is signed; and for the British parliament to vote to approve the deal. This could – just – be achievable by a strong and stable government that was united behind a clear strategy and negotiating position, and determined to reach a deal that works in the best interest of both Britain and the rest of the EU. Depressingly, our current government is anything but that. Ministers simply cannot agree on their desired outcome – weakened by last summer’s general election result, torn between the extreme views of the Tory right and economic reality. Ministers still contradict each other on consecutive days, infuriating the EU and making the complicated negotiations even harder. And it looks increasingly like they are willing to put the interests of the Tory party ahead of the national interest. The stakes couldn’t be higher. On Thursday I released independent economic analysis of the potential impact of different Brexit outcomes on both London and the UK’s economy. I commissioned and published this analysis because the government has either refused to do it, or worse, is keeping it secret. Either is a terrible way to govern. The British public deserves to know the potential impacts of all the possible options. While there are other factors we cannot accurately forecast, this analysis clearly demonstrates that the harder the Brexit outcome we end up with, the worse the potential impact on jobs, growth and living standards could be. A “no-deal” hard Brexit could lead to a lost decade with significantly lower growth, the job market being cut by 500,000 posts and nearly £50bn less investment by 2030 than would be the case if we remained in the single market and customs union. In London, there could be 87,000 fewer jobs and the capital’s economic output could be 2% lower by 2030 than predicted under the status quo. That would mean fewer opportunities for the next generation and poorer living standards than would otherwise be the case – a huge human cost to pay. Perhaps most worryingly for Britain’s future, it also shows that the rest of the UK is set to suffer significantly more than London. The independent study concluded that by 2030 economic output across the rest of the UK would be on average between 3% and 3.3% lower compared with between 1.9% and 2.1% down in London. That means that geographic inequalities across the UK would widen even further, rather than narrowing. These inequalities – and the feeling that “only wealthy bankers in London” benefit from the EU – was one of the contributory factors behind the EU referendum result. People in Birmingham, Cornwall, Norwich, Leeds and elsewhere deserve to know that, rather than narrowing the gap, opportunities in their communities are set to fall even further behind London as a direct result of a hard Brexit. The impact of a “no-deal” or “cliff-edge” Brexit is so much more severe than any other potential outcome that it must be avoided at all costs. However, the government’s chaotic approach to the negotiations and unhelpful posturing about “being willing to walk away” means it is still a very real threat. So I am calling on the government to commission and then publish – in full – their analysis of every single option available for Britain to avoid a “cliff-edge” scenario. That means their analysis should look at what we should do if we are unable to secure a good deal from the negotiations, if the negotiations collapse, or if the final deal fails to be ratified by either the British parliament, European parliament, or a number of EU member states. This must include all options for extending the article 50 timeline. It must include all options for an extended interim deal – beyond the two-year period currently on the table. And it must include legal analysis of the options available for withdrawing article 50 altogether in the worst-case scenario of the UK crashing out of the EU with no deal. There are differing opinions on whether this is possible – Lord Kerr, the author of article 50, says it is. The government must tell us what they think and what our options truly are. Despite the doom and gloom, there still remains a clear path for the government to protect jobs and growth for future generations: prioritising a deal that keeps Britain in the single market and customs union in the long term. They must change paths before it’s too late. • Sadiq Khan is mayor of London"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/12/cameroon-independence-colonialism-britain-nigeria","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T10:25:22Z","webTitle":"Cameroon’s heartbreaking struggles are a relic of British colonialism | Eliza Anyangwe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/12/cameroon-independence-colonialism-britain-nigeria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/12/cameroon-independence-colonialism-britain-nigeria","fields":{"headline":"Cameroon’s heartbreaking struggles are a relic of British colonialism ","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Last Friday, a man named Julius Ayuk Tabe was arrested along with nine others in a hotel in Nigeria’s capital, Abuja. Tabe and his companions were reportedly committing no crime, at least not one that has yet been disclosed. There are inconsistencies in the reporting. Some accounts say 10 people were arrested, while others speak of seven. The BBC’s coverage eschews these details altogether. What remains consistent is that it is alleged that those detained were taken by Nigeria’s intelligence agency, though the Department of State Services denies having them in custody. And so there the story ends. No public outrage – in Nigeria or anywhere else. No international condemnation. This incident should matter because the violation of anyone’s freedom of association anywhere in the world should be troubling. As has been said many times: “None of us is free until all of us are free.” But in a world where mankind does unspeakable things every day, knowing and caring intimately about each one becomes impossible, so let’s bring this closer to home. Tabe and his associates are part of a movement seeking independence from the Republic of Cameroon, a fight that would not be necessary if Britain had granted its former colony independence in 1961. What is now referred to as the “anglophone crisis” is in fact yet another hangover of British colonial rule. After the first world war, Germany’s colonies were redivided among the spoils of the war, with Britain controlling one part of the former German territory of Cameroon and France controlling another. In 1960 France granted its colony independence. Britain, however, had a different proposition, put to the people in a referendum in February 1961: join Nigeria or the newly formed Republic of Cameroon. The anglophone Cameroonians who opted in that referendum to form a federation with French Cameroon, soon found the terms of that union were void. The promise of equality was never kept, with the English-speaking minority facing widespread discrimination and repression. The ongoing crisis is about decolonisation, not secession. Of course, it’s not just Cameroon’s anglophone minority that has suffered at the hands of its despotic leader, Paul Biya. Biya’s 35-year rule (preceded by nearly 20 years working in the office of the president) has been marked by allegations of corruption, cronyism and restrictions of civil liberties and human rights. Since the conflict with Boko Haram escalated in the far north of the country, the use of torture against detainees (many arrested simply for failing to show ID) has been happening “right under the noses of high-ranking Cameroonian military officials”, and perhaps also in the presence of US military personnel. The ever-present risk of detention is a story I am intimately familiar with. I was born in Cameroon and return often. Going home over the Christmas holidays three years ago, we were constantly reminded to carry our ID cards. Taxi drivers would check as you got into their yellow cabs. “Madame, I don’t want trouble with the gendarme,” one driver told me, after I had got in but could not find my card. Everyone seemed to know someone arrested, or threatened with arrest. These stories, like those that followed the campaign to revive an article in the penal code banning women from wearing short skirts the year before, all end with someone paying a bribe for their freedom. I am equally familiar with the fight for self-determination in Southern Cameroons. My father is part of the Ambazonia Governing Council, the leadership of the movement seeking independence for the anglophone region they call Ambazonia. I woke up at 3am on Sunday to find him huddled over his phone, talking frantically as he learned of the news of the arrests in Abuja. The question then and now: if we can be arrested in Nigeria, presumably at the behest of the Cameroonian government, are we safe anywhere? As someone who has benefited from growing up bilingual and who, as many others do, feels “secession fatigue” after the implosion of South Sudan, and the failed attempts at independence in Scotland and Catalonia, I have doubts about what course of action is best, but never about southern Cameroonians’ right to self-determination. The British empire, in its arrogance, did not think this small group of people could effectively self-govern. It was an imperialistic decision that has so far cost hundreds of lives, and seen many others detained in squalid conditions. Rory Stewart, then the UK minister for Africa, in a statement on 4 October 2017 called for all parties to “urgently take action to implement solutions that address the root causes and grievances being raised”. Britain, though it would rather forget it, is one of those parties, and it’s time the government used its influence to get Biya to the discussion table. This article was corrected on 31 January 2018.

Some, like Moen, even believe the decision could be the best thing for the growing marijuana movement, hastening the formal end of weed prohibition in the US. “There will probably a short term chilling effect, but this could ultimately be the best thing that’s ever happened to accelerate the pace of change,” Moen said. The markets have reflected this somewhat counterintuitive sentiment. The United States Marijuana Index, which tracks 15 leading publicly traded legal marijuana-related companies, initially dropped 21% on the heels of the Department of Justice (DoJ) announcement, but it turned out to be a blip. By early this week the index had rebounded to within a few points of its one-year high. Sessions’ announcement formally rescinded guidance, known as the Cole Memo, issued by the Obama-era DoJ that essentially told federal prosecutors to respect state laws with regards to marijuana. Importantly, though, Sessions’ decision did not direct or incentivize US attorneys to pursue marijuana cases, it just allowed them to if they so choose. “The Cole Memo guidance was eminently reasonable and was a common sense good policy,” Moen said. “I think that despite the fact that it’s been formally rescinded, federal prosecutors will effectively continue to abide by it.” One of the primary reasons concern has been tempered is that Sessions’ announcement is not actually likely to ensnare individual marijuana users into the criminal justice system. Federal prosecutors almost never pursue simple possession charges against recreational users, whether in states where it is legal or not. According to the Bureau of Justice statistics, 99% of those serving federal sentences for marijuana-related crimes were convicted of trafficking offenses, which typically relate to quantities far in excess of what individual recreational users would have. “It is unlikely that this will affect them in any tangible negative way, other than depriving of the ability to buy marijuana legally,” said Justin Strekal, Political Director for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (Norml). The Sessions memo is unlikely to trigger a nationwide dragnet of marijuana users, and is also unlikely to cause wide-scale disruptions to legal cultivators, Moen notes. “If federal prosecutors decide to ‘go rogue’ and start charging otherwise compliant state businesses, there’s going to be repercussions with regard to their relationships with the local [law enforcement],” Moen said. Strekal notes, however, that because of civil-forfeiture laws, local law enforcement would have one very good reason to work with federal agents seeking to enforce marijuana laws on legal weed businesses. Although local law enforcement can’t bust those businesses on their own – they aren’t breaking any state or local laws – by joining with feds to enforce federal law, they get to claim a portion of any assets seized in a potential drug raid. “In an area where you have a prohibitionist minded sheriff or a law enforcement agency, they will look at state-lawful marijuana facilities and see a big pile of money,” Strekal said. The 4 January move by Sessions was sandwiched by two major wins for legalization advocates. On the first of the month, recreational weed became legal in California, after more than a decade of a quite lax medical marijuana program. Then on 10 January, Vermont became the first US state to legalize the substance with an act of legislation, rather than a popular referendum, as has been the case in states like California, Colorado and Oregon. The decision may ultimately precipitate another win, as Moen observed. Within hours of Sessions’ announcement, a bipartisan group of legislators had come out against the decision and some, including Hawaii senator Brian Schatz, announced that legislation was already being crafted that could overrule Sessions, by changing the extent to which Marijuana is classified as illegal at the federal level. “It’s great that we’ve had a number of members of Congress over the course of the last six days last week step up and say what the attorney general did is wrong. Now time for every single one of those members of Congress to put their names on the pending legislation,” Strekal said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/jan/11/the-shape-of-things-to-come-at-the-guardian","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T19:13:54Z","webTitle":"The shape of things to come at the Guardian | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/11/the-shape-of-things-to-come-at-the-guardian","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jan/11/the-shape-of-things-to-come-at-the-guardian","fields":{"headline":"The shape of things to come at the Guardian","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On Wednesday evening, I travelled from Derby to London to hear Katharine Viner and her colleagues talk with passion and excitement about the tabloid format of the newspaper that will be launched on Monday.

But it was even worse for the health service’s political masters. An unprecedented letter was sent to the prime minister by 68 of the most senior emergency medicine specialists from across England and Wales. It warned in the starkest terms of the extent of the crisis in A&amp;E caused by “severe and chronic” underfunding: some care was not safe. Treatment was taking 10-12 hours from the decision to admit to finding a bed. For want of that bed, people were dying on trolleys. Patients were sleeping in clinics. Sometimes 50 patients at a time were waiting in emergency departments. They need more staff, more beds and more cash for social care. Earlier, the body representing all NHS providers warned that the funding crisis had driven hospitals to a watershed where hard choices were becoming unavoidable. As they have for more than a year, most hospitals are breaching their constitutional obligations. The warning accompanied statistics showing that only 77.3% of A&amp;E patients met the four hours target in December. Performance is already worse than in its worst month, January 2017. It the worst since records began, and it is very likely to get worse still. Theresa May suggested to reporters that it was because of the flu epidemic. This is not the flu: it is a system-wide crisis brought about by seven years of mounting austerity. Oh, and that is getting worse, too. The official defence is that this is not a crisis, because there is a plan. Certainly the consultants acknowledge in their letter to Downing Street that huge effort went into trying to avert a crisis. But planning can’t magic up highly trained doctors and nurses. Plans do not make hospital beds. And while vaccination helps, you can’t entirely plan your way out of the impact of flu. Amid the mounting alarm, some influential voices are calling not just for an urgent dose of cash but for a different funding model altogether, one that would avoid the financial rollercoaster in which the NHS and the patients who rely on it are trapped. There are proposals – the latest came from the Conservative MP Nick Boles, who has cancer – for a hypothecated NHS tax. The Health Foundation thinktank has just launched a programme with the Institute for Fiscal Studies to try to reach an independent assessment of what a sustainable 15-year plan for the health service would look like. The Tory chair of the Commons health committee is among 90 MPs calling for a non-partisan conversation on the shape of a sustainable settlement. In a Commons debate on Wednesday, even the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, accepted the need for more money and a 10-year settlement. The thought behind these increasingly urgent demands is that there is some way of reaching agreement on what the NHS needs. That is not as easy as it looks. The percentage of GDP spent on healthcare is a useful comparator with other similar countries but it doesn’t describe what an individual health service looks like. The US spends most in the world, more than 17% of its national income, on health while denying access to it to 44m uninsured Americans. The Commonwealth Fund, where across the board the NHS repeatedly performs better than any of the other 11 richest countries, uses technical measures like access and efficiency. It may be more useful to ask – as the limited obligations set out in the NHS constitution try to do – what the NHS should provide. Knee replacements for 90-year-olds? IVF for 50-year-olds? Mixed-sex wards for our elderly mother? A local A&amp;E or a more distant centre of excellence? On Wednesday, Chris Williamson, a junior Labour spokesman, “resigned” after suggesting doubling the top two bands of council tax, to meet the bill for social care. But he is right to highlight the political debate we need to have.

Each of his desperately politically incorrect tweets was an attempt to cuckold and castrate his progenitor. Toby Young has wasted his life spitting cold mucus at a ghost and throwing clumps of his own hot excrement at a shade, a raging zoo monkey. Toby Young was at war with a phantom cloud of semen, long since turned to dust motes, bobbing on the west London thermals. But, because I am kind and good, I take no pleasure in the slow-motion farce of his downfall. On Wednesday night, the probable reason for the sudden twin resignations of the self-styled “right-of-centre maverick” from both the spurious universities regulator and the Fulbright Commission became clear. Despite having survived last week’s cataloguing of his hastily concealed career of context-free non-character-driven monetisable offence, on Monday evening Toby Young finally ran out of options and fell on his own cucumber spiraliser. Even though he was defended by his chum, Boris “Picaninny” Johnson, as being a “caustic wit”, the maverick self-styled “Toadmeister” had to go. Because, while national media slept, or commissioned supportive thinkpieces from his wealthy and powerful celebrity friends, the London Student newspaper was about to reveal that the Maverick Toadmeister had attended a secret conference on “intelligence”, featuring notorious speakers including in previous years white supremacists and a weird far-right paedophilia apologist called Emil. Of course, attending a secret conference alongside white supremacists does not amount to endorsing their ideals. I once attended a performance of We Will Rock You, the Queen musical by Ben Elton and Queen, and, if anything, it made me despise the dreadful group even more than I did before, from a position of greater understanding. The Maverick Toadmeister, by his own admission, only attended the secret event for a few hours, only sat at the back, didn’t inhale any of the nazism that was being handed round, and nor did he supply any to anyone else. But on Monday night, the Maverick Toadmeister realised that even declarations of love from his greatest champions, the environmental opportunist Michael Gove, the Daily Mail hate-funnel Sarah Vine, and the napkin’n’knick-knack guru Kirstie Allsopp, would not overwhelm the taint of his incidental association with genuine white supremacists. For God’s sake, that’s what paranoid community activists in 70s blaxploitation movies thought white folk were doing – having secret meetings about how to stop them breeding – and it turns out we are! In fact, that’s the plot of the martial arts and black power musical Three the Hard Way (Gordon Parks Jr, 1974), but now with Toby Young as a curious bystander watching the evil Dr Fortrero plot to wipe out the black population, and claiming it’s research for a forthcoming speech. If Boris Watermelon Smile Johnson’s brother, Boris Johnson Junior, intended the appointment of the Maverick Toadmeister to the universities regulator to counteract the influence of the Political Correctness Gone Mad Brigade, it’s fair to say he may have overplayed his hand somewhat. The Maverick Toadmeister’s fellow secret conference attendee Richard Lynn, for example, advocates that predominantly white American states secede from the Union, making them dangerously likely to sink into the sea under the excess weight of the massive arses, and brains, of their remaining inhabitants. The question presupposed by the title of the Maverick Toadmeister’s bestselling book How to Lose Friends and Alienate People had been fairly comprehensively answered. Asked last week to comment on his attendance at a second intelligence jamboree, this time in Canada, a clearly discombobulated Maverick Toadmeister said he had been giving the “Amanda Holden Memorial Lecture”. Amanda Holden? Les Dennis’s ex-wife? Was the Battersea Dogs &amp; Cats Home’s celebrity ambassador now a eugenicist? And also dead? Thank God Dustin Gee didn’t live to see the memory of The Laughter Show tarnished so. I knew that there had been a famous science writer called Constance Holden. Had the Maverick Toadmeister, as no one is calling him ever, suffered a slip of his toad tongue? There wasn’t time to check the facts, sadly, as the witch hunt countdown clock was ticking. Needless to say, I immediately mobilised my massive bullying Twitter following of furious politically correct snowflake hypocrites to have Amanda Holden, eugenics apologist, erased from history. By Wednesday public pressure had seen Holden lose her role as the face of Alpen, the colonic cleansing breakfast dust. And on Thursday Holden was digitally erased from every episode of Britain’s Got Talent and replaced by a surgically enhanced Christopher Plummer, verdicts on ventriloquists dripping like honey from glossed lips down a low-cut satin dress shimmering seductively in the light. Then I realised the Maverick Toadmeister had made a mis-speak. He had meant Constance Holden. Amanda Holden was not a Nazi (nor, it turned out, was Constance Holden), and she was not dead. A newly confident and self-assured Christopher Plummer reluctantly submitted herself to the painful reverse-Holden procedure as long as she was allowed to keep the dress. (Luckily, Plummer’s most crucial organ had not yet been incinerated and was found still salvageable in an ashtray at a Soho cigar bar frequented by his surgeon.) I don’t know the Maverick Toadmeister and I have never met him, though he did once make a winsome face at me across a corridor at Heston services, Britain’s worst services, on the M4. I recognised him from somewhere, but something about his curious smirk and his strange gait made me assume he was a lesbian, dressed as a homosexual, who had assumed I was a lesbian dressed as a heterosexual man and was trying to pick me up. What a tangled web we weave. But where now for the Maverick Toadmeister? Can even vile jam-rags like the Telegraph and the Daily Mail employ him now? Who calls themselves, as an adult, the “Toadmeister” anyway? And “maverick” is what the commissioner shouts at Dirty Harry. It’s not what Dirty Harry tells the commissioner he is himself. That would be very uncool. Who does these strange and desperate things? Someone in search of an identity that has eluded them. Sometime around 20 years ago Toby Young started being nasty about people less fortunate and privileged than him, and, like a shit Clarkson, he found it was easy to do and paid good money; and then the wind changed, and Toby Young was stuck with the horrible face he had made. And now people all over the internet will be drawing foreskins on his bald head. For ever. And Captain Von Trapp will never urinate standing up again.

The Manchester-based company, which also owns the PrettyLittleThing [PLT] and Nasty Gal online brands, is winning sales from traditional high street retailers as it cashes in on a generation that shops via their mobile phones and takes style cues from social media. Boohoo said group sales surged 100% year-on-year to £228.2m in the four months to 31 December, thanks to stellar sales during the Black Friday promotional bonanza in November. Sales at PLT, where hundreds of new products are added to the website every day to satisfy its fashion hungry shoppers, were up 191% on the previous year. Boohoo’s USP is inexpensive clothing aimed at fashion-conscious women, with its figure-hugging Lycra dresses starting at £10 while thigh-high boots cost £30. Its sharp pricing is giving high street rivals such as Primark a run for their money as it targets young shoppers with limited finances. The standout performance by Boohoo comes as Britons’ finances are squeezed by slow wage growth and higher inflation, a predicament that forced them to cut back on buying almost everything other than food in the run-up to Christmas. Retailers with strong digital operations are proving to be more insulated from the downturn in consumer demand than those with large store networks to run. Earlier this week, fashion company Ted Baker also reported higher sales over Christmas thanks to a surge in online purchases. Boohoo was set up in 2006 by Mahmud Kamani and his business partner, Carol Kane, who previously supplied high street rivals such as Primark and New Look. The duo share the role of chief executive. Its shares have soared in value since listing on the stock exchange in 2014. When it joined the stock exchange, the company’s shares were worth 50p but are now worth nearly four times that. Charlotte Pearce, a retail analyst at GlobalData, said Boohoo’s brands were luring dissatisfied shoppers away from the likes of New Look, Miss Selfridge and H&amp;M. “The group stands out compared to online rivals such as Missguided and Quiz thanks to its innate understanding of its core shopper base, its low-priced on-trend product and its well-targeted marketing and social media.” Pearce said Boohoo had relied on a campaign of heavy discounting to win customers by offering Black Friday discounts of between 30% and 60%. “While its relentless discounting activity needs attention, boohoo.com’s product and brand presence is clearly winning over 16-24 year old shoppers.” In a joint statement, Kamani and Kane said: “We are delighted to report another set of strong financial and operational results, with record sales in the four months to December across all our brands. “The Black Friday period was our most successful ever. PrettyLittleThing has continued to deliver exceptional results and Nasty Gal is making excellent progress in its first year. “Our focus remains on the customer proposition: offering the best range of the latest fashion at affordable prices, coupled with great customer service.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/jan/11/football-academy-youth-yts-life-lessons-leroy-rosenior","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T18:59:08Z","webTitle":"My YTS days taught me life lessons today’s young footballers still need | Liam Rosenior","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/jan/11/football-academy-youth-yts-life-lessons-leroy-rosenior","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/jan/11/football-academy-youth-yts-life-lessons-leroy-rosenior","fields":{"headline":"My YTS days taught me life lessons today’s young footballers still need","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s 10.15pm and I’m standing outside the away dressing room at Bristol City’s Ashton Gate stadium with 10 other 17-year-old YTS players. We are politely but impatiently waiting after a first-team match for the last players to leave so that we can begin sweeping and mopping the dressing-room floors and cleaning the toilets as part of our duties as apprentices. The impatience is justified as we know that if we don’t get our jobs done quickly enough we will miss the last bus back to our digs and will have to club together for taxis, which would be a financial disaster as it would eat a huge chunk out of our £45 weekly salary. At the time we all hated these tasks, which we thought were a waste of time. “What has this got to do with football?” and “What’s the point of this?” were questions that, at that moment in our lives, it felt extremely pertinent to ask. As young players we all dreamed and believed we would be embarking on a journey that would end up with us finding fame and fortune as top Premier League players and there wasn’t one of us who didn’t believe we would make the cut. Sadly, the reality of the situation 15 years on is that I’m the only one out of that group still involved in professional football. Every year at every club there is an intake of young academy players on professional contracts, all of them believing they will break into the first team and go on to live the glamorous life of a top professional footballer. But with the huge amount of money in our game I’m worried that reality and normality are becoming harder for young players coming through our academies to relate to, with many being paid so much they have little chance to plan or live a normal life when earning such amounts before they’ve even made the first team. Trust me, being an impressionable young, rich footballer is a dangerous place to be and I’ve been offered numerous vices – drink, gambling, drugs, women, dodgy financial ventures. It is easy to fall on the wrong side of the tracks. The book and TV documentary No Hunger In Paradise by Michael Calvin illustrates this growing problem within our game. I would never begrudge any individual in any industry the money they earn in their respective roles but we have a duty in our game to protect and educate young players coming through about the perils and dangers of having too much, too soon. I speak with a lot of senior professional players who are the same age as me and had the same YTS upbringing – training, cleaning the professional players’ boots or sweeping out the dressing room while earning next to nothing. This not only grounded us and made us appreciate how difficult it was to make a living but instilled in us a hunger and desire to keep working hard on our technique and fitness in order to become the very professionals we were scared of upsetting if their boots weren’t up to scratch. My generation is the last to have come through this culture. Now our top academies’ facilities are absolutely perfect, with bowling greens for pitches, pristine kit washed by the laundry staff and restaurant-quality food every day for our youngest of age groups, where the culture of “doing your jobs” has been consigned to the scrapheap. Coupled with the fact that some of these young professionals are earning a small fortune, it’s human nature that the real passion and need to improve and push themselves to the limit is becoming harder and harder to find. Not only that, but these young players, most of whom won’t make the first team at the likes of Chelsea, Manchester City or Arsenal, will face a shock when having to work their way back up the footballing ladder from Leagues One, Two or the National League, no longer with the luxury of a fantastic training facility or a healthy pay packet coming in every month. And I guarantee that most of them haven’t had the benefit of sound financial advice, something that most people don’t have to think about at the ages of 17 or 18. It’s normal for young players to make mistakes. It’s how you learn and is the case of Alex Iwobi allegedly being out when he shouldn’t be the first of its kind? Of course not. It won’t be the last. I understand the argument that we need to give young players the best footballing education possible for them to be top players in the future but I feel we also have a responsibility to ensure we are doing enough to give them lessons in life so they can also be the best people they can be too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/11/trusts-critics-cant-see-the-wood-for-the-trees","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T19:14:18Z","webTitle":"Trust’s critics can’t see the wood for the trees | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/11/trusts-critics-cant-see-the-wood-for-the-trees","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/11/trusts-critics-cant-see-the-wood-for-the-trees","fields":{"headline":"Trust’s critics can’t see the wood for the trees","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The response in your letters section to the northern forest raised some useful points (Development for the north?

Britain’s native woodlands are so diverse because of the association and dependency of species that have co-evolved over several thousand years. The accusation that we create “plantations of birch and rowan and field maple, producing scrub rather than woodland” couldn’t be further from the truth (and, by the way, scrub habitat has huge conservation value). We use local tree and shrub species to create diverse, functioning and resilient habitats for biodiversity and local communities.

Joy for the Sky Blues, but Hughes clinging to his job by his fingernails beforehand and the result broke his grip conclusively. Having long since run out of excuses for his team’s poor league form he sent out a highly disjointed side. Finishing the match with six forwards Stoke had their chances but too often wilted at crucial moments. The hosts, on the other hand, were clinical in theirs. Coventry opened the scoring in the 23rd minute when the defender Jordan Willis turned in a knockdown from a corner. Willis then gave away a penalty in the opening minutes of the second half, which was converted by Charlie Adam, as Stoke threw the kitchen sink at getting a result. But the 23-year-old full‑back Jack Grimmer decided the match with a fine solo strike in the 68th minute. “It was a hard-fought win but it was deserved,” said the Coventry manager, Mark Robins. “There’s been some unbelievably mature performances from young players and they couldn’t have complained if we were 3-0 up at half-time. We’ve played against Premier League-quality athletes and had to cope with it. We were magnificent.” Relegated to League Two last summer, the club’s lowest position in half a century, the one-time Premier League mainstays have been enjoying a strong season under Robins and sit third in the table. Robins opted to select his first team, with the addition of a debut for the loanee winger Jordan Maguire-Drew. Hughes had promised to pick a strong side and his team was packed with experience. Stoke started on top. Mame Biram Diouf and Stephen Ireland – the midfielder making his first start in almost two years after an injury layoff – should have scored before Coventry started to find their feet. But once the initial spark fizzled out the hosts began to assert themselves. On the right flank Grimmer and Maguire-Drew were making hay against Stoke’s makeshift wingback, Ramadan Sobhi. Grimmer got beyond the Egyptian in the 23rd minute and crossed to the striker Marc McNulty whose deflected effort earned a corner. Maguire-Drew took the resultant set piece and lofted it to the back post, where the centre-half Tom Davies knocked it down for Willis to turn the ball home from six yards. An already lively Ricoh erupted and the tension among Stoke fans was palpable. The groans only got louder when, in the 29th minute, Diouf missed a clear chance to equalise by bouncing a free header from a Sobhi cross off the floor and over the bar. As the first half drew to a close Coventry began to smell blood and twice nearly doubled their lead. First, the teenager Tom Bayliss played in McNulty one on one. The striker rounded Jack Butland but hit his shot wide of the far post. Seconds later, McNulty was in again and shot on target through Butland only for Cameron to hoof it clear. It took seven minutes of the second half for Hughes to hit the big red button marked “Peter Crouch”. The change gave Stoke an immediate boost of energy and almost straight away Sobhi won them a penalty, driving into the box and drawing a foul from Willis. Adams calmly sent the spot kick low into the centre of the goal for the equaliser. Crouch saw a crafty flick at a Sobhi shot fly just wide of the post in the 61st minute, but the visiting side’s flash of energy had burned out and back came Coventry with a goal of real quality. Grimmer, in an apparently innocuous position, put his foot on the gas to cut inside Sobhi, evaded Alllen and from the edge of the penalty area cracked a shot that whipped past Butland and inside his left post. “Once we equalised we were clearly in the ascendancy‚” said Hughes, “but we have got to keep the back door shut. It’s tough to take.” Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting and Xherdan Shaqiri joined the fray to make it six up front for Stoke and things started to get hectic. Crouch had a 25-yard volley punched clear by Liam O’Brien. Berahino, soon approaching the two-year anniversary of his last goal, had all the time in the world to place his shot from inside the box in the 78th minute, but saw it blocked by a sliding challenge. With the clock ticking down Shaqiri had a volley blocked, Crouch another volleyed effort saved and Diouf contrived to miss a header even easier than his first. “We had five or six chances to score‚“, said Hughes. “If just one goes in, it’s a different story.” It proved to be the end of the final chapter for the Welshman after just over four and a half years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/jan/05/australia-usman-khawaja-cagey-battle-ashes-test-place","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T18:07:00Z","webTitle":"Australia’s Usman Khawaja plays it cagey in battle to preserve Test place | Adam Collins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/05/australia-usman-khawaja-cagey-battle-ashes-test-place","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/05/australia-usman-khawaja-cagey-battle-ashes-test-place","fields":{"headline":"Australia’s Usman Khawaja plays it cagey in battle to preserve Test place","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Usman Khawaja learned to bat within a cover drive of the SCG. There was a natural romance to his Test debut at the ground against England seven years ago. It inspired a bout of full-blown Usmania. The local newspaper devoted more pages than have ever been written about a knock of 37. His mum sat in the Members Stand praying for her boy’s success. The nation watched on in the belief that the stylish left-hander was a worthy find from Ashes rubble. It took five years for Usmania to come again. Between times he conceded there were moments when he thought he would not make it. Chances came and went, as did injuries and a move interstate. He was nearly 30 and it still had not clicked. Then, for one long and golden summer, the reality matched the visage that had lived in the memory from January 2011. But this week, there is none of that. Gushing about Khawaja’s cover drive has long since stopped, replaced by nagging questions about his game that felt answered long ago. His career is not at the crossroads but his immediate future as Australia’s No3 is less clear at the conclusion of a series he has not been able to influence in a meaningful way. Khawaja is smart enough to know all that. He gets that his 2017 saw him twice punted from the side in the subcontinent. He understands spreadsheet columns influence selection as much as capacity and that his added up to an average of 29 last year. In turn, when Khawaja replaced the scoreless Cameron Bancroft on the second day of the fifth Test, he would have been well aware of what was riding on what happened next. This business, as his Queensland team-mate Matt Renshaw can attest, can move fast. Just one problem: Khawaja is palpably out of form. So what to do? The only thing he could. Go slow. Limit the risks. Do it ugly. Not a word you associate with the classicist but this was an innings for replacing the natural with the essential. When driving at Jimmy Anderson early a hand came off the bat in a telltale sign all was not well. The champion seamer then beat the left-hander, so he simply shelved the shot. Tom Curran’s loosener was the type Khawaja has annihilated from the moment he could pick up a bat. On Friday, he chopped just a couple instead. The new ball dealt with, the real quiz for Khawaja was against England’s new spin twins. One has been putrid and the other was on debut but this was not the day for the Australian to get ahead of himself. Khawaja watched a Moeen Ali maiden as the battling pair had their first exchange. When settled, he danced with purpose. Then he missed a ball that was better left. It was a timely reminder of what he could not and should not be doing. Mason Crane’s turn. First up was the archetypal offering of a wrist spinner on debut, pitching halfway down. Khawaja had enough time to pinpoint exactly which grandstand he would plonk it into but patted it to the sweeper for one. The mandatory full toss shortly after got the same. Only when set, in his own time, was the cover drive allowed to boom. Now he was getting somewhere. With both spinners operating together, Khawaja was beaten again by Moeen from his first ball back. A compelling leg-before shout was denied only by an inside edge. The same over, he hacked across the line off the inside-half of the bat. Back to Ugly Usman. But when Moeen dropped short, his adversary finally had the chance to cut. When overpitched, he clipped. Emboldened, he danced to strike over the spinner’s head. It had been 107 balls of ups and downs but the first act was complete with a half-century to Khawaja’s name. The day did not get any easier when Crane returned for a much better spell in the final session, nearly drawing a return catch before twice hitting the inside edge. Either could have found a forward short leg. Khawaja responded by dancing once more to launch straight, then was nearly in strife again as Crane clipped his outside edge, the ball bisecting wicketkeeper and slip. But by now, he was confident enough to be resourceful to get out of Dodge. So out came the reverse sweep. Believers in the unorthodox shot argue that part of its charm is it requires a full-body commitment. Khawaja had that, scoring from each of the three he played as stumps neared. Moeen found his edge one more time but it was played softly enough to neutralise the risk. A moment analogous with Khawaja’s topsy-turvy day. On the stroke of stumps, Joe Root decided to roll down his own off-breaks. It was a decent enough idea but the long-hop to begin allowed Khawaja into the 90s overnight. There would be no final-over heroics. What he has the chance to do on day three outweighs that. From the scrappiest of starts, a maiden Ashes ton at the place where it all began now awaits. Usmania won’t be the automatic response. Not this time. But some things are more important."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/05/uk-coal-fired-power-plants-close-2025","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T14:34:24Z","webTitle":"UK government spells out plan to shut down coal plants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/05/uk-coal-fired-power-plants-close-2025","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/05/uk-coal-fired-power-plants-close-2025","fields":{"headline":"UK government spells out plan to shut down coal plants","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"One of the UK’s eight remaining coal power stations is expected to cease generating electricity this year, the government has said as it laid out new rules that will force all the plants to close by 2025. The coal phase-out is one of the Conservative party’s flagship green policies, and the long-awaited implementation plan comes ahead of a speech by Theresa May on the environment next week. While three plants shut in 2016, and most are expected to halt operations by 2022, the last ones standing will be forced to close in October 2025 because of new pollution standards. However, the plan reveals the sector will continue to be propped up by hundreds of millions of pounds in backup power subsidies for several years, paid through consumer energy bills. Experts said allowing coal operators to continue receiving capacity market subsidies had thrown the sector an unnecessary lifeline. Dr Jonathan Marshall, energy analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a UK-based thinktank, said: “While delivering on the top line of a 2025 closure, the government’s decision to allow coal plants to compete in the capacity market on equal footing until then looks like something of a missed opportunity.” Ministers will also retain emergency powers to suspend the phase-out in the case of an emergency shortfall in electricity supplies. “We consider it prudent for the secretary of state to retain provisions to act in emergency situations, as a last resort, where there might be a shortfall in electricity generation, or risk of one, and that suspension would wholly or partially mitigate that risk,” the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said. But officials said it was unlikely those powers would be called on, because the gap created by the coal plants’ closure would probably be filled by old gas power stations staying open longer. While no coal power stations closed in 2017, the government’s official assessment points out that a carbon tax and relatively low gas prices have hurt the profitability of coal plants. As a result, it foresees one major plant will close this year, with the loss of up to 250 jobs, followed by a further closure next year. The government predicts coal’s capacity of 13.8GW last year will have plummeted to 1.5GW by 2025 because of unfavourable economics. The government rejected calls by campaigners and industry groups for the deadline of 2025 to be brought forward, citing cost and energy security grounds. It also rebuffed suggestions of a gradual phase-out before 2025, arguing coal use was low enough to make that unnecessary. Coal’s fall has been swift and dramatic, with power generation from the polluting fuel plunging by more than 80% since 2012. Plants have closed in recent years as EU pollution standards started to bite, but it was increases in the UK’s carbon tax that sealed their fate. In the budget, the Treasury confirmed the levy would continue at the same level until 2025. The closure of the last coal plant in seven years’ time will be mandated through the use of a new emissions performance standard, which ministers will need to legislate for. The standard sets a limit on the amount of carbon the plants can emit – 450g CO2 per kW hour – which coal operators could meet only by retrofitting costly carbon capture equipment. Officials said the coal phase-out policy would cost less than 1% of an average household energy bill. Green groups welcomed the confirmation of the plan. Greenpeace hailed “significant progress on making coal history in the birthplace of the industrial revolution”, while WWF praised government for “hitting this dirty industry where it hurts.” However, ClientEarth cautioned against replacing coal with another fossil fuel. “We are concerned that the door is left wide open for investments in new, long-term gas capacity, locking us into another generation of fossil fuel power,” said Sam Bright, energy lawyer at the campaigning law firm. Labour said while it backed the coal phase-out, more support was needed for clean power. Alan Whitehead, shadow energy minister, said: “The government’s lacklustre support for renewables and scrappage of a number of green schemes has left it on course to miss its own climate targets.” • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/05/wunmi-mosaku-kiri-brexit-racism-british-nigerian-identity-channel-4-drama","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T18:00:19Z","webTitle":"Bafta-winner Wunmi Mosaku: ‘I’m glad my eyes were opened after Brexit.

It was an outburst of ugliness’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There must be something about Wunmi Mosaku that casting directors see and think: police officer. She is about to play her fourth in Kiri, Channel 4’s blockbuster new drama. “I feel really embarrassed about it,” she says with a laugh. “What is it about me and police officers? It’s funny because I’m not that serious in real life.” She blames audition-room nerves. “When I get nervous my energy gets really still, and I think people think that’s me,” she says. “Everything gets really still, and my voice gets a little bit lower and there is a little croak in there – sometimes you can hear it when I’m really nervous on camera.” Her family always notices, she says. The rest of us get Mosaku’s beautifully understated performances – the best of which are not police officers. Mosaku’s first big TV role was as Malia, a young Sudanese woman, in I Am Slave in 2010. Last year, she won a Bafta for her dignified and devastating portrayal of Gloria Taylor, the mother of Damilola, the 10-year-old boy stabbed in 2000. In person, Mosaku is animated and sparky – she is tall, with a beautiful face and given to making big hand gestures and laughing a lot. On screen, her presence is just as powerful but quieter, more contained. At 31, there’s something childlike about her chattiness and the curves of her cheeks, but you believe she could convincingly play just about any age, as she proved with her portrayal of Taylor, nearly two decades her senior. In last year’s drama Fearless, her counter-terrorism officer character must have been pushing 50. In Kiri, a four-part drama, Mosaku plays a DI who investigates the killing of a fostered child, while Sarah Lancashire plays the social worker vilified in the press for an unwittingly catastrophic decision. Mosaku did hesitate about taking on another police role – she has played detectives in the crime series Vera, in Fearless and the comedy drama The End of the ****ing World – but “then I’m like, as long as the story’s good, I don’t care what I’m playing”. Kiri is a timely story taking in identity, culture, class, race – plain racism, of course, but also, with echoes of the Rochdale and Rotherham scandals, about whether a fear of being seen as racist can have terrible consequences. It’s about families, and in what sort of family a looked-after child would best thrive (real-life echoes again, of the row whipped-up late last year about a child being fostered by a Muslim family). Kiri, the nine-year-old girl is black, and the family who had fostered her for the past five years, and are about to adopt her, is white. It’s about stretched social services and social workers doing a hellishly difficult job. “I think social workers get such a hard time,” says Mosaku. “They’re only in the spotlight when something bad happens, but they’re doing their best. I have a friend who’s a social worker and she’s doing her best every single day and she’s always thinking about her kids. It’s a stressful job and all they’re doing is trying to support where there isn’t support. They go into it because they want to help, and if things go wrong it’s so hard, because how can you tell if someone is going to do what you say, or they’re lying? You can be cynical or you can trust them, and that can have equally a positive or negative effect on a situation or a child’s life.” At least twice, Tobi, Kiri’s birth grandfather who is Nigerian, asks Mosaku’s character where she’s from. “Here,” she says, irritated. Mosaku, who was born in Nigeria and moved to the UK with her parents and two older sisters when she was a baby, gets this all the time – it tends to be from taxi drivers, or people in shops. “I say I’m from Manchester and I say I’m from Nigeria. I say both. I feel so British, but people would look at me and see a very African woman – the way I cook is very Nigerian, the way I dress I guess is quite Nigerian. The things I feel most comfortable in are my Nigerian clothes, but I do feel like a Mancunian through and through.” She hasn’t been to Nigeria, where her father, a professor of architecture, lives, for a while, although she says it “feels familiar”. “There’s nothing like being in my grandma’s house. But I definitely feel like a Mancunian in Nigeria. The smells, tastes, everything is familiar, it feels like a home I once knew. The taste of guava is my first memory. I remember somebody picking it from the tree and throwing it down to me. But the rain, the overcastness, of Manchester feels like home.” The day after the Brexit vote, someone asked her if she might want to go back to her “own country”. “It was really heartbreaking,” she says. “This is my country, this is my home. It reminded me that I wasn’t born here, and I hadn’t really thought about that.” Until the debate around Brexit turned nasty, she says she thought it was about Europe. “I didn’t think it was about me. [It was] quite shocking to see people pointing out people’s differences, skin tones, stuff like that. I was quite naive before because it never felt like …” A bit later, she says: “Racism hasn’t been an everyday thing in my life, overt racism. There is obviously structural differences, but hate? I’ve not really had that.” Still, she says: “I’m glad my eyes were opened. It wasn’t just me, a few people experienced it. It wasn’t pleasant, but I do feel as if people have stood together against racism, Islamophobia, the patriarchy. I feel, in a way, there was an outburst of ugliness, but it was good that it came to the surface so you can see it and address it. After that hate that came out after Brexit, it felt as if there were more people, it doesn’t matter how they voted, who were willing to stick together and protect people. There’s nothing like the British camaraderie. That was the good thing that came out of it, that people had to be more active.” Mosaku was going to study maths and economics, but – having sung in Manchester Girls’ Choir since she was seven – she really wanted to be an opera singer. She applied to Rada, thinking she would get her acting training before applying to the Royal College of Music (rules that made second degrees more expensive put a stop to that). She does not come from a family with a background in the arts – both her parents were academics (her mother was a chemistry professor, who raised her daughters largely alone on their council estate) – and film and TV were not big parts of her childhood. But she discovered theatre as a teenager and would visit Manchester’s Royal Exchange most weeks. After she graduated in 2007, she took three or four theatre roles, before landing her first proper TV job in the BBC crime drama Moses Jones. She was cast in Ruined, the British adaptation of Lynn Nottage’s Pulitzer prize-winning play about rape as a weapon of war in Congo, but had to pull out due to an injury she received while filming I Am Slave in Kenya – she put her hand through a window and severed the tendons, and still has limited movement in her hand. Two weeks into rehearsals, a specialist told her the hand needed to be operated on and her role in the production had to be recast. She struggled with the idea she had potentially missed her big break. “When I watched it, I was like: ‘This play is amazing, you guys are going to fly.’ But your career can take off at 70, and it can end at 22, as an actor.” She seems incredibly grounded, deliberately so it turns out. She says she doesn’t go to “industry parties. I don’t know if there are industry parties”. She laughs. “Hardly any of the people I hang out with are actors or from the industry.” However, this may be changing. “I was quite negative about hanging out with other actors. I thought it meant you would believe in the hype, not really be of this world, but recently I have been better at thinking: ‘I’ve known this person for 12 years, you are my friend, what am I talking about?’ Actors can be normal too.” Days off are spent, she says, “[nurturing] my relationships because when I am working, I’m not normally at home”. She goes to the theatre as much as she can, and she likes to sew, mainly for her niece and nephew, but she says that she dreams of making the perfect dress to wear on the red carpet and saying “It’s a Wunmi Mosaku” when someone asks. A friend even gave her a sewing machine to have in LA, where Mosaku has been spending time (she had a small part in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, and did a pilot for CBS, although it wasn’t picked up). But it is not her ambition to make it in the US, she says. “My goal is to be present and respected and trusted in the industry.” It isn’t an unreasonable expectation. The work has been high quality (recently, a part in Sky Atlantic’s Guerilla, and an episode of Black Mirror) and steady – she starts filming another British show in a couple of weeks. There have been awards, notably the Bafta, early in her career. Mostly, though, she says, wide-eyed and looking suddenly much younger than she is: “I still have so much work to do and so much to learn, and I just really hope I push myself every day.” Kiri starts on Channel 4 on Wednesday 10 January at 9pm"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/07/network-national-theatre-on-stage-restaurant-food-critics-verdict","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T16:00:14Z","webTitle":"Network at the National Theatre’s on-stage restaurant – a food critic’s verdict","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/07/network-national-theatre-on-stage-restaurant-food-critics-verdict","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/07/network-national-theatre-on-stage-restaurant-food-critics-verdict","fields":{"headline":"Network at the National Theatre’s on-stage restaurant – a food critic’s verdict","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s common to describe the modern restaurant in the language of theatre: behold the deft performance of the chefs in their open kitchen; witness the exquisite set-dressing. All of this works, unless the restaurant is part of the performance. In the National Theatre’s stage version of Paddy Chayefsky’s 1976 film Network, a select few of us have tables right on the stage. It’s no contest; theatre wins every time. Early on, Howard Beale, the spittle-flecked messianic news anchor on the edge of a nervous breakdown played by Bryan Cranston, calls out the world’s “bullshit”. As he does so, a plate lands in front of me on the rubberised table, the better to deaden the sound. It barely registers. It’s something dark on a plate. Food? Who cares about that? I’m too busy gawping at the kinetic fury of one of the US’s greatest actors playing not just to the hundreds in the Lyttleton theatre, but to us up here in the midst of the ultimate TV dinner. When we were first shown to our table, placed in a strip stage right, it seemed to be all gravy. We were invited to wander the video screen-encrusted set. Here’s a complimentary glass of Nyetimber English sparkling. Yes, of course we could order more wine mid-performance. Absolutely, you could get out to go to the loo and come back in again. The production includes scenes at a bar and a restaurant table, so why not have a real one, operated by the National’s caterers? Call it Foodwork. But as Beale raged, and us diners hung on his every word, slack-jawed, it became clear: we weren’t just occupying part of the set; we were the set. Network is about the TV audience’s appetite for the prurient, for the three-ring circus of manufactured news. And we on stage here at our tables are there to be that circus audience. We are meant to be easily distracted by the arrival of each new course. Just as Michelle Dockery’s flinty TV exec Diana is describing how she shagged herself stupid through a commune in the 60s, a waiter whispered in my ear: “And would sir like a spritz of gin on his sorbet?” Well, of course I would! How kind. So how was dinner? As clever as Lee Hall’s deft updating of Chayefsky’s original script. At first glance it’s all terribly 2018: that glass of Nyetimber, the anchovy butter with the sourdough, and here’s a plate of butternut squash and crispy kale. But then it takes a turn: picked Portland crab with shredded lettuce and a marie rose sauce; glazed short rib; a chocolate sponge with a cherry sorbet. So that’s a take on a prawn cocktail, steak and a black forest gateau, the three stations of the cross for 1970s diners. For us up here, it’s a terrific piece of scene-setting, both very much then and completely now. And it’s all lovely, or at least I think it is. Look, there’s a staggering live/audio-visual performance happening in front of me. Bits of the production directed out to the auditorium are flashed on to huge screens on stage. Cranston’s blistering performance is both live and televised. At one point, two characters are captured live on camera taking a stroll outside along the South Bank, a single tracking shot that follows them all the way back on to the stage of the Lyttleton. How can any short rib, however beautifully sticky and slow-roasted, compete with that? At the end, as the cast take their bows, I turn my applause to the transparent box of a restaurant kitchen behind us. But it’s empty and the lights are off. The chefs are long gone. Their job is done.

Sketches bleed. Sculptures spring to life. On the gallery walls, madonnas routinely disappear, replaced by self-portraits of men. Art has a life of its own. This is the world of Mother, created by Peeping Tom, a company capable of crawling right under your skin. The Belgium-based dance-theatre group, led by real-life partners Gabriela Carrizo and Franck Chartier, create work that defies logic. Their productions swirl with strange, surreal images. They swing from silly to unsettling in a few steps, until audiences are bamboozled. These are shows that refuse to be shaken off. Last time they came to London, with 32 Rue Vandenbranden, Carrizo and Chartier won the Olivier award for best new dance production. Mother brings them back to the Barbican for the London international mime festival. Set in a shifting, amorphous art gallery with white walls and windowed rooms, it shows us a strange spectrum of motherhood. Pregnant women flail around in high heels. Cleaners splosh in flooded rooms. A coffee machine becomes a lover and a child lives her whole life in an incubator. All the way through, birth jostles with death; illness with care; machines with human creation. Its overload of imagery means it swims with ideas and, when I saw it in Helsinki last September, it left me rattled. Mother is the second part of a trilogy. After 15 years collaborating, Chartier and Carrizo agreed to work alone for the first time. He would create a piece around fatherhood and she would make one about motherhood, before reuniting, in 2019, for a piece called Child. Chartier’s show Father, set in a nursing home, is just as jangling a watch. Janitors sweep the stage like zombies and pensioners are wheeled around like prisoners. Both shows stemmed from the same thing: that moment in middle-age when one sees the full spectrum of life. Carrizo had recently lost her mother, and Chartier’s father is in care. Both felt the dynamic of parenthood flip on its axis. “When I was taking care of my mother, I felt time passing through me,” Carrizo recalls. “In seconds, you become the care-giver. Your parents are like children and suddenly you’re in the other role. This cycle of life exerts itself.” You see that in the shows themselves: death rattles roll into birth pangs, and middle-aged men and women are repeatedly infantilised. This isn’t their first family trilogy. Peeping Tom began with three shows set across the rooms of a family home: garden, sitting room and finally, a crypt-like cellar as a proxy for death. Their daughter, then still an infant, appeared in one show. “The notion of family has always been there – right from the start,” says Carrizo. Chartier mulls over a reason: “Maybe because we don’t have a family close.” Both left theirs – in Argentina and France respectively – to make one of their own in Belgium. “We’re a bit alone in Brussels. Maybe we miss something.” The two met as dancers in Alain Platel’s company Les Ballets C de la B, only to find themselves drawn together by what Chartier calls “the need to go deeply into character and story”. From the start, they sought something more theatrical, and in their very first show, Caravana, a travelling piece made for a real mobile home, everyday chores fizzed into explosive movement sequences. It imagined David Bowie’s estranged children holidaying together after meeting online and, in its blend of the banal and the fantastical, it keyed into the same twisted, Lynchian aesthetic as Shunt’s site-specific shows in London. From its success, the couple founded Peeping Tom in 2000. Dance-theatre, for them, is deliberately free-form. Sometimes scenes burst into full-blown dance routines. “It’s not dance or theatre,” Carrizo explains. “I don’t believe in this border. It’s just a thing: physicality, image, content.” The aim, always, is feeling and the point is that it goes beyond language. “I believe in telepathy,” says Chartier. “There’s something contagious about movement and dance.” Peeping Tom’s choreographic style stems from that. It disavows beauty and elegance for something stranger; be it silly, entrancing or unsettling. “We try to destroy the classical ways of being virtuosic,” says Chartier, “but we’re still always looking for a ‘wow’ moment.” 32 Rue Vandenbranden, for instance, is full of contortions and over-extensions; bodies behaving in ways that beggar belief. At times, you’d swear someone was about to snap. The show just happened to have a super supple cast – including an ex-Olympic gymnast. “You’re always looking for extremities. You have to push the body to its limits – but bodies can go much further than you think.” It’s why Peeping Tom’s performers so rarely conform to dancerly norms and physical ideals. “It’s more touching if it’s a normal, non-dancer’s body,” explains Chartier. “There’s an identification with that.” Each of their shows starts with its setting. “It’s essential,” says Chartier, “We need to know where we are, then we look for who we are. If we have the situation, we can start to look for a quality of movement.” The aim, though, is always to make that space strange. Exploring community dynamics in 32 Rue Vandenbranden, they set their mobile-home village on a snowy mountain. Father’s nursing home is high-walled, like a subterranean prison. Mother’s museum is a shifting space – here a maternity ward, there a funeral parlour. Devising shows over a period of months, the emphasis is on discovery and surprise. For Carrizo, it’s critical to “follow the process” wherever it leads. “You take a boat, knowing there’s a continent out there, but not knowing exactly where you’ll land. That feeling of not knowing is interesting.” It’s why the pair split up professionally to make Mother and Father. It meant relearning their process; a fresh challenge for successful mid-career artists. “We always try to destabilise ourselves as artists and make something we don’t know how to make,” says Chartier. The art, you might say, has a life of its own. Mother is at the Barbican, London, 24–27 January.

She brought to the ITV soap opera, which was broadcast live or recorded “as live” in its early days, a wealth of experience in theatre. Once, while speaking outside the pub to its landlord, Jack Walker (played by Arthur Leslie), she went to open the doors, only to find them locked. “You’re as bad as Harry – he’s always locking himself out,” she improvised. “I’ll go round the back.” This quick thinking earned a grateful embrace from the director at the end of the transmission. Although she was an original cast member, Keogh was not seen on the soap’s launch night, 9 December 1960, but made her first appearance in the fifth episode, two weeks later. Concepta was seen returning from a festive visit to her family in Ireland and was conceived by the serial’s creator, Tony Warren, as a character providing some variation to the north of England accents, like the Polish refugee Ivan Cheveski played by the Austrian actor Ernst Walder. Concepta became a confidante of the Rovers’ landlady, Annie Walker (Doris Speed), and married Harry Hewitt (Ivan Beavis), a widowed bus inspector, in 1961, becoming stepmother to his wayward daughter, Lucille (Jennifer Moss). Together, Concepta and Harry had a son, Christopher, who provided drama when he was abducted – but eventually found with a disturbed friend of Elsie Tanner’s daughter. Away from the cameras, Keogh and Beavis had an off-screen relationship. In 1964, the Hewitts – minus Lucille, who was taken in by Jack and Annie – moved to Ireland to run the Riley family garage and shop. Their departure was part of a cull of more than half a dozen characters by Coronation Street’s new producer, Tim Aspinall, that included the controversial death of Martha Longhurst (Lynne Carol). Some of the axed actors, including Keogh, finished the year by touring in Vince Powell and John Finch’s stage comedy Firm Foundations. However, Keogh did make several brief returns to Coronation Street. In 1967, Concepta and Harry travelled to the fictional Weatherfield for Elsie’s wedding to Steve Tanner – during their visit, Harry was crushed to death by Len Fairclough’s van after a jack collapsed. Five years later, Concepta was back to announce that she was marrying Sean Regan – who made a pass at Bet Lynch – and, in 1975, on another short visit, Concepta admitted to Annie that she knew Sean was unfaithful but she loved him. In all, Keogh appeared in 320 episodes of Coronation Street. She was born in Dublin, to John Keogh, a librarian, and his wife, Alice (nee Mullany), and acted in school festivals while attending Holy Faith Convent, in the city’s Clontarf suburb, as well as joining a local amateur dramatics society. After training at the Abbey theatre school, Dublin, Keogh performed with the sixth Earl of Longford’s company at the Gate theatre in productions such as Sophocles’ Oedipus, the Tyrant (1942) and acted and sang on Irish radio. She then moved to London and played Christine Horan in a 1945 adaptation of AE Coppard’s short story The Man from Kilsheelan, the first of dozens of BBC radio plays in which she acted over more than 60 years. Her prolific theatre appearances included playing Cloyne in a 1953 British tour of Sean O’Casey’s play Purple Dust, directed by Sam Wanamaker, and roles in the West End productions Say Goodnight to Grandma (St Martin’s theatre, 1973), Once a Catholic (Wyndham’s, 1978) and Ducking Out (Duke of York’s, 1982). With the Royal Shakespeare Company, she played Mrs O’Toole in Look Out ... Here Comes Trouble! (Donmar Warehouse, 1978) and Mrs Madigan in Juno and the Paycock (Aldwych, 1980). Keogh made her TV debut as Miss Fulton in Denis Johnston’s crime drama Death at Newtownstewart (1948) and followed it with other BBC plays that fitted in around her stage commitments. Her later television roles included Mary in Inside Out (1985), a comedy-drama about an agency helping ex-cons to find employment, Imelda Egan (1997-99) in Ballykissangel, Audrey Gifford – mother of Pete – in Cold Feet (1998-2003) and the quirky neighbour Mary Carroll in The Royle Family, between 1998 and 2006. Keogh also made a one-off appearance as Mrs Candour in Crossroads in 1969 and played Mrs Dineen, physically fighting over a tea-shop bill with Mrs Doyle, in Father Ted in 1998. By then, she had returned to Ireland and took the role of Mary O’Hanlon in the Irish soap Fair City from 1989 to 1995. Keogh had many supporting roles in films, including playing a mother superior in the IRA hunger strike drama Some Mother’s Son (1996), and appeared alongside Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson in the musical Darling Lili (1970), directed by Blake Edwards. A lover of dogs, donkeys and ducks, she supported animal welfare charities and was an avid Liverpool football club fan. In 2007, she appeared in a spoof Irish election commercial for Alone, a charity for the elderly. As “Betty from the Grey Tigers party”, she urged the electorate to vote so that “your granny would be proud of you”. Keogh’s 1954 marriage to the actor Frank Singuineau ended in divorce nine years later. She is survived by her second husband, Jack Jenner, whom she married in 1976. • Doreen Sheila Elsie Keogh, actor, born 10 April 1924; died 31 December 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/05/revenge-law-john-worboys-victims-crimes-justice","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T13:44:11Z","webTitle":"Revenge has no place in the law – even for John Worboys | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/05/revenge-law-john-worboys-victims-crimes-justice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/05/revenge-law-john-worboys-victims-crimes-justice","fields":{"headline":"Revenge has no place in the law – even for John Worboys","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Retribution is poor justice. It is the short cut to lynch law and mob rule. Lock-‘em-up-and-throw-away-the key has long been the default mode of British attitudes to crime, spectacularly on display today in the worrying case of the serial sex attacker John Worboys. No one has any idea on what basis he has been released from an indeterminate sentence after serving longer than his allotted eight-year minimum. Police and victims claim he may have carried out 100 other attacks. But despite what appears to have been shambolic police handling, all this was known at the time. The judge made a public decision. At law, the convicted man was clearly eligible for parole, and his custody has been judged “no longer necessary for the protection of the public”. As in most cases of violent crime, media coverage concentrates on the horrific experience of victims, as if justice were delegated to them. This is understandable, and great and justified strides have been made towards sympathy and compensation for victims, including victim statements in court. But the natural inclination of victims to severity of punishment, especially in Britain’s high-profile adversarial court system, risks injustice. In the Worboys case, the parole board must have known it was on a hiding to nothing, and should surely have prepared the ground for its decision. Personal privacy is not good enough. We do not know what treatment Worboys has received – sex attackers are notoriously hard to “cure” – or on what basis experts think his risk has been eliminated. We know he will be closely monitored, but recent news of inadequacies in privatised parole do not inspire confidence. The reason the prison population is again surging appears to be a loss of faith by judges in community service orders and related supervision. None of this answers the vexed question of what prison is for or its relation to “punishment in the community”. There is a total confusion of motives: of revenge, retaliation, prevention, rehabilitation, cure and overall benefit to society. The grim truth is that Britons love prisons more than any developed country other than America. Politicians cannot build enough of them. The prison population, including of pensioners, is rising inexorably and “cures” are ever more elusive. Prison should not be the answer to all but the most violent of crimes. Reason, not retribution, should be the guide to punishment. No one knows why Worboys is going free, but the attendant agitation will do nothing to boost faith in the system, or the image of British justice. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/07/letters-impossible-things-before-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T00:05:07Z","webTitle":"Letters: so many impossible things to believe before Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/07/letters-impossible-things-before-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/07/letters-impossible-things-before-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Letters: so many impossible things to believe before Brexit","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"People who are willing to defend Brexit in print must be getting more and more thin on the ground and Jonathan Rutherford’s piece (“Should the left be optimistic about our future outside the EU?”, last week) is a prime example of why. He joins a small, stubborn band of people who still think that it is possible to “get Brexit right”. This invariably boils down to “the cake illusion”. Rutherford correctly points out that “Brexit happened because Britain failed to put right our deficiencies”. You would think he would conclude from that that leaving the EU is at best an irrelevance: we in Britain have proved quite capable of ruining our economy and gelding parliamentary sovereignty all by ourselves – we certainly didn’t need any help from across the Channel. But no: he then points to two requirements for a “successful” Brexit: that we conclude an agreement that allows a significant degree of economic integration, and that we “embark on a new economic and political settlement to heal our divisions”. The EU has made it abundantly clear, again and again, that the first will be available only if we accept its conditions: freedom of movement, regulatory and customs rules, and the jurisdiction of the European court of justice, in which case where is the point of Brexit? The second is what we failed to do in the first place, so why would leaving the EU make it more likely to happen? The Tories have made it obvious that they would rather continue with austerity and eventually achieve a Singapore-style, low-wage, low-regulation, sweatshop Britain (inevitably with an authoritarian government, to contain the political backlash) than stay in the EU. Our only hope is that the Remainers eventually prevail: the only “right” Brexit is no Brexit. Jeremy Cushing Taddyforde Exeter Miliband and the youth vote It was good to see Ed Miliband identifying the importance of the youth vote to politics in 2018 (“Big ideas for 2018”, In Focus, last week). Disappointingly, he failed to identify any issues for change that young voters could throw their energy into helping to deliver. So here’s three. First and foremost is stopping the disaster that Brexit will be for their job, educational and cultural opportunities. In all likelihood the 2016 referendum would have produced an entirely different result if 16 and 17-year-olds had been able to vote. Many young people I speak to are expecting Labour to lead the country in 2018 in the justifiable argument for a second referendum on the final deal. Second, a root and branch reform of the way this country votes. That means a vigorous campaign for a democratically enabling system of proportional representation that gives voters real choice wherever they live, not the democratic deficit that exists with “safe seats”. Again, the Labour party should be in the vanguard of this push for democratic reform, confident in the support of younger voters. Third, a much harder push to meet climate change targets, especially in the context of the alarming rate at which the polar ice caps are melting, and an active challenge to the governments that are failing – especially Trump-led America. These are all issues deserving of the harnessing of young people’s idealism and energy. It’s time for the political parties, especially Labour, to provide the leadership and impetus to engage young voters in moving forward such campaigns. Richard Denton-White Portland Dorset Sensible about Sundays The lengthy article on Sunday trading laws (“Sunday shops, sport and bars... inside the hard battle to create our modern weekend”, last week) concludes by recording that a change to such laws in England and Wales was effected in 1994. Lest it left some of your readers wondering when or if a similar change to Scottish legislation was ever made, your correspondent could usefully have explained that, in the main, Scotland’s trading laws are determined at local authority level. That sensible approach has long ensured that Sunday trading here is less bafflingly pernickety than is the case south of the border. Moreover, the wailing and hand-wringing that in England and Wales accompanies any proposal for change is blessedly absent.

Nevertheless, the tail wagged for the second Test in a row and 346 all out gave England a total from which they have never lost before at the SCG, even if we have learned over the last two winters that the current generation possess an ability to torch such statistical comforts in rather inglorious fashion. These thoughts were on the rise at the end of three sun-drenched sessions in front of a burbling 43,846-strong crowd, as Australia closed on 193 for two with Steve Smith ominously poised on 44. But there was distraction at least, with this also the latest new dawn in English leg-spin as Mason Crane got his first taste of the Test arena. Crane had spent the first day with his feet up watching the batsmen largely live up to various expectations. Though there was a brief stint with the pads on late in the evening session – “I was asked to volunteer,” he said, jokingly – Jonny Bairstow instead decided to regretfully eschew such tail-end protection. Thus it was on the second morning that Crane entered the fray with bat in hand, amid the frenzied session of lower-order swish from Tom Curran and Stuart Broad. Four runs were added to the greater cause from his new home at No10, before sacrificing himself when Jimmy Anderson set off for a run that was not to see England’s innings end in slightly slapstick fashion. “I enjoyed all seven balls,” Crane said. “I love batting. I just wish I was better at it.” But it is with the ball where the 20-year-old was striving to make an impact on the ground he briefly called home last year during a surprise appearance for New South Wales. That spell came at the end of a bumper winter playing grade cricket for Gordon CC under the stewardship of Stuart MacGill, with the aggressive former Australia leg-spinner, whose first three initials are SCG, spending the buildup this week once again relaxing his apprentice in training. Crane had described himself as “bricking it” when first called on by his captain during the Sheffield Shield debut in March that returned five wickets. And so for all the confidence this bubbly character exudes, there was always going to be a twang or two of nerves when, in front of a full house, Joe Root turned to his shiny new toy 14 overs in, with Australia 44 for one and two left-handers at the crease in David Warner and Usman Khawaja. What followed were three perfectly capable spells that returned figures of 17 overs, none for 58 and demonstrated that England’s youngest specialist spinner since Ian Peebles 90 years ago was not to be overawed. Sure, there was the odd aberration – such is the wrist-spinner’s lot in life – and a number of aborted run-ups that grew thin with the crowd. These prompted a wry smile or two from the youngster, who explained perfectionism as the reason why he stops himself. But there were also oohs and aahs generated from deliveries that had batsmen in trouble, with Crane bounding in, getting good energy on the ball and always striving for as many revs as possible. On another day a fizzer that took the inside of Khawaja’s bat may have carried to Mark Stoneman at short leg, while twice Root at first slip was just out of reach when the left-hander and Smith both edged deliveries. In the commentary box Shane Warne was also impressed with what he saw. “His action is balanced nicely, he has momentum exploding through the crease which is good,” said the greatest protagonist of cricket’s toughest discipline on Channel 9. “Normally younger spinners these days bowl flatter and faster because of white-ball cricket. But the nice thing about him is he bowls a nice line and spins the ball hard at 83kph [51mph], which is not too fast.” Drawing huge conclusions from such a first outing would be premature. Warne, after all, took one for 150 in his maiden Test at the SCG 26 years ago, while England’s last leg-spinner, Adil Rashid, opened up with record worst figures for a debutant of none for 163 against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi three years ago before claiming five wickets in the second innings. But on a day in which Australia started to take a grip, Khawaja grew in confidence and Smith continued his vice-like control over England’s bowlers to give rise to the spectre of a 4-0 Ashes defeat, Crane’s first taste of Test cricket – and vice versa – was nevertheless encouraging."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"inequality/2018/jan/12/money-for-nothing-is-finlands-universal-basic-income-trial-too-good-to-be-true","type":"article","sectionId":"inequality","sectionName":"Inequality","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T10:00:26Z","webTitle":"Money for nothing: is Finland's universal basic income trial too good to be true?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2018/jan/12/money-for-nothing-is-finlands-universal-basic-income-trial-too-good-to-be-true","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/inequality/2018/jan/12/money-for-nothing-is-finlands-universal-basic-income-trial-too-good-to-be-true","fields":{"headline":"Money for nothing: is Finland's universal basic income trial too good to be true?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"One year on from its launch, the world remains fascinated by Finland’s groundbreaking universal basic income trial: Europe’s first national, government-backed experiment in giving citizens free cash. In January 2017, the Nordic nation began paying a random but mandatory sample of 2,000 unemployed people aged 25 to 58 a monthly €560 (£475). There is no obligation either to seek or accept employment during the two years the trial lasts, and any who do take a job will continue to receive the same amount. With the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk and Bernie Sanders all proponents of a universal basic income (UBI) model, Finnish officials and participants have been inundated with media requests from around the globe. One participant who hoped to start his own business with the help of the unconditional monthly payment complained that, after speaking to 140 TV crews and reporters from as far afield as Japan and Korea, he has simply not been able to find the time. But amid this unprecedented media attention, the experts who devised the scheme are concerned it is being misrepresented. “It’s not really what people are portraying it as,” said Markus Kanerva, an applied social and behavioural sciences specialist working in the prime minister’s office in Helsinki. “A full-scale universal income trial would need to study different target groups, not just the unemployed. It would have to test different basic income levels, look at local factors. This is really about seeing how a basic unconditional income affects the employment of unemployed people.” While UBI tends often to be associated with progressive politics, Finland’s trial was launched – at a cost of around €20m (£17.7m) – by a centre-right, austerity-focused government interested primarily in spending less on social security and bringing down Finland’s stubborn 8%-plus unemployment rate. It has a very clear purpose: to see whether an unconditional income might incentivise people to take up paid work. Authorities believe it will shed light on whether unemployed Finns, as experts believe, are put off taking up a job by the fear that a higher marginal tax rate may leave them worse off. Many are also deterred by having to reapply for benefits after every casual or short-term contract. “It’s partly about removing disincentives,” explained Marjukka Turunen, who heads the legal unit at Finland’s social security agency, Kela, which is running the experiment. Kanerva describes the trial as “an experiment in smoothing out the system”. To maintain privacy and avoid bias, Kela is not contacting any of the 2,000 participants for the duration of the two-year trial. A handful have given interviews to journalists (several have said they feel less stressed thanks to the scheme), but no official conclusions are yet being drawn from these anecdotal experiences. According to Kanerva, however, the core data the government is seeking – on whether, and how, the job take-up of the 2,000 unemployed people in the trial differs from a 175,000-strong control group – will be “robust, and usable in future economic modelling” when it is published in 2019. Unintended benefits The idea of UBI had been circulating in left-of-centre political circles in Finland since the 1980s, mainly as a way to combat the economic and social consequences of falling industrial employment by freeing all – from students to the elderly; stay-at-home parents to the unemployed – to make meaningful contributions to society by, for example, volunteering. Appealing both to the left (who believe it can cut poverty and inequality) and, more recently, to the right (as a possible way to a leaner, less bureaucratic welfare system), UBI looks all the more attractive amid warnings that automation could threaten up to a third of current jobs in the west within 20 years. Other basic income schemes are now being tested from Ontario to rural Kenya, and Glasgow to Barcelona. But there is little consensus so far on what UBI should look like in practice, or even on the questions that need to be answered first: which model to adopt, what level of payment, how to combine UBI fairly with other social security benefits, and how the tax and pension system should treat it. For UBI purists, the fact that the monthly Finnish payment – roughly equivalent to basic unemployment benefit – is going to a strictly limited group, and is not enough to live on, disqualifies the Finnish scheme. But while it may not reveal as much as a broader trial would have, the scheme’s designers are confident it will shed new light on several key social policy issues. For example, Kela hopes additional data that is being collected as part of the trial from healthcare records will provide useful information on whether the security of a guaranteed unconditional income, paid in advance so beneficiaries can budget for it, might have a positive impact on anxiety, prescription drug consumption or doctor’s visits. “One participant has said she is less anxious because she no longer has to worry over calls from the job centre offering a job she can’t accept because she is caring for her elderly parents,” Turunen said. “We may be able to see from the trial data whether it has had unintended benefits – such as reduced medical costs.” The trial data may also allow the government to spend less on bureaucracy by simplifying Finland’s complex social security system – currently, it offers more than 40 different means-tested benefits – which is struggling to cope with a 21st-century labour market of part timers, short-term contracts and start-ups. The benefit system is simply “not suited to modern working patterns”, Turunen said. “We have too many benefits. People don’t understand what they’re entitled to or how they can get it. Even experts don’t understand. For example, it’s very hard to be in the benefit system in Finland if you are self-employed – you have to prove your income time and time and time again.” Perhaps most significantly, the trial marks “a real breakthrough for field experiments”, according to Kanerva. Rolled out in record time and after a brief, one-line pledge in the government’s platform, it had to function alongside all existing social security laws and clear numerous legal obstacles – including Finland’s constitution, which requires all citizens to be treated equally. “It was a huge effort to get it over the line,” Turunen said. “The government was determined it must be based on specific legislation – most experiments are not – and that it had to launch in January last year ... It was quite a task.” The Finnish experiment’s design and objectives mean it should perhaps not really be seen as a full-blown UBI trial at all, cautioned Kanerva: “People think we’re launching universal basic income. We’re not. We’re just trialling one kind of model, with one income level and one target group.” But as experts around the world increasingly debate how a bold but ill-defined concept might actually work in practice, the Finnish experiment will at least “produce meaningful results – albeit in a limited field,” according to Kanerva. In an area where convictions are often more abundant than facts, “It has forced people to talk specifics.” If you have experiences relating to this article that you’d like to share, please email us at inequality.project@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/jan/05/why-impulsive-vain-toby-young-wants-us-to-take-him-seriously","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T13:29:18Z","webTitle":"Toby Young: social media self-obsessive still battling with father's shadow","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/05/why-impulsive-vain-toby-young-wants-us-to-take-him-seriously","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jan/05/why-impulsive-vain-toby-young-wants-us-to-take-him-seriously","fields":{"headline":"Toby Young: social media self-obsessive still battling with father's shadow","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When the war reporter Sean Langan was leaving for Afghanistan in 2008, he left his bosses with a strange request: “If I get kidnapped, don’t let my friend Toby Young try to help me. If he can alienate liberal people in London, God forbid if he starts talking about towelheads and Islamic nutcases. I’ll get beheaded.” It was prescient. Langan was kidnapped by the Taliban and when Channel 4 convened to discuss a rescue plan, Young showed up proposing he fly immediately to Kabul and spearhead negotiations. Impulsive, ambitious, vain and generous, the gesture, which was firmly rebuffed, was Young to a T. Langan was eventually freed after three months with the help of professional negotiators. Young, 54, was unveiled on Monday as a board member of the government’s new higher education regulator to a chorus of boos. It is his first public office appointment after a prolific writing career in which he has trawled his life for material, from taking so much cocaine in the Groucho Club that half his face froze, to taking his four young children grouse shooting. The outrage this week was sparked by a series of comments, mostly on Twitter around seven years ago, about women’s breasts, a subject which appears to obsess him. His observations that his wife has “Baywatch tits”, Padma Lakshmi had “massive boobs” when pregnant and “Danny Boyle’s wife’s got huge knockers”, had Labour and teachers’ unions calling for his appointment, to the board of the new Office for Students, to be rescinded. Juvenile and politically incorrect as he admits his comments were, they were part of a career-long tendency to seek attention and to bait liberals. In a 2012 attack on the “ghastly” term inclusive, he questioned why schools needed wheelchair ramps. He has written about the difficulty of finding reliable domestic servants and why he thinks embryos could be screened to weed out those with lower intelligence potential. Then, as if that wasn’t enough to irritate the left, in 2011 he launched the West London Free School (WLFS), a “comprehensive grammar” teaching classics and insisting on tough competition between pupils. Its logo is a bust of Cicero and it has a Latin motto, sapere aude, “dare to know”. It was the first free school under Michael Gove’s reforms, which have been attacked for destabilising the education system and diverting resources to pushy middle-class parents who want to set up independent-style schools in the state sector. Young became the face of the policy. WLFS has already gone through four headteachers and is only ranked as “good” by Ofsted. It has however achieved better than average results, albeit with an intake with higher than average attainment. “One of Toby’s successes was to represent it as something idealistic,” said Melissa Benn, the educationalist and daughter of Tony Benn who has repeatedly clashed with Young over free schools. “I think it has turned out to be completely ordinary, but part of a bigger picture that has led us to a semi-crisis.” Even for a professional troublemaker (in the 1980s he was sacked from a plum job at the Times for hacking the editor’s computer and circulating the senior executives’ salaries), the response to his appointment has shocked him. Young cares intensely about his own profile, to the extent he is said to have edited his own Wikipedia profile 282 times in the last decade, but this week he switched off the Google alert which lets him know when his name pops up online. He has told friends the trawling of his Twitter accounts for remarks he now admits are puerile and stupid feels unfair, because he is determined to develop a more serious side to his life. That wish is rooted in his relationship with his father, Michael Young, a Labour peer who wrote the 1945 Labour manifesto, coined the term meritocracy, established the Consumers’ Association and the forerunner of the Open University. When he died in 2002, he was described by the Guardian as a “towering figure in postwar social policymaking”. At Christmas, there were cards from people like Nelson Mandela. The founder of the SDP, Shirley Williams, and James Callaghan’s foreign secretary, Tony Crosland, passed through. Young was in his father’s shadow and was drawn towards Thatcherism, celebrity culture and hedonism to escape, said his friends. Having failed all but one of his O-levels at King Edward VI comprehensive school in Devon, he went to sixth form at William Ellis grammar school in Kentish Town, north London. “In came this posh bloke,” recalled Langan. “He had negative charisma. Everyone immediately hated him. Toby could alienate a room before he got to the end of it. But I thought he was really interesting and fun.” Young sneaked into Brasenose College at Oxford University, which was seeking more state school pupils. He just missed the grades he needed (he got B,B,C) but after a call from his father he was allowed in and flourished, securing a first in Politics, Philosophy and Economics, and winning a Fulbright scholarship to Harvard. He started but did not finish a PhD at Cambridge on the theory of democracy. Back in London in 1990, he started the Modern Review with Cosmo Landesman and Julie Burchill. It was a magazine that aimed to take popular culture seriously. Asked what drove Young, Burchill said it was “living up to his father”. “Toby, quite understandably, compared this with his own life of coke-snorting, status-chasing and model-making and found himself wanting,” she said. “The Modern Review was a fun way to do something moral. The whole point was to go after hypocrisy and snobbishness.” After the magazine’s collapse, he became a contributing editor at Vanity Fair in New York. So little of what he wrote was published in his two and a half years that he estimated he was effectively paid $100 per word. Back in London a decade later, now a parent to four young children with his wife Caroline, he became interested in how Gove, the shadow education secretary, was talking about replicating Swedish-style free schools. Young wrote a column in the Observer setting out his plan to open a “comprehensive grammar ... traditional curriculum, competitive atmosphere, zero tolerance of disruptive behaviour, but with a non-selective intake”. “He spent 20 years rebelling against his father’s core principles, but I believe he actually shares the values of his father,” said Langan. “The school was a way of him moving towards what his father was doing.” Stefan Bojanowski, an economist living in Acton, was among about 40 local people, many parents, who squeezed into Young’s living room soon afterwards to plan the West London Free School. “My impression of him was of a deep and considered thinker and someone who believed in the goal,” said Bojanowski. “Quite a few people needed convincing. Without question, without him the school would never have gone anywhere.” This week’s row has been a collision of two competing sides to Young as his deletion of thousands of tweets showed. If his appointment to the Office for Students survives the public anger at his previous comments, his desire to be finally seen as a serious man may move a step closer to being achieved."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2018/jan/09/university-awards-2018-thanks-for-entering","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T10:29:00Z","webTitle":"University Awards 2018: thanks for entering","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/jan/09/university-awards-2018-thanks-for-entering","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2018/jan/09/university-awards-2018-thanks-for-entering","fields":{"headline":"University Awards 2018: thanks for entering","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Thank you for completing your application for the Guardian University Awards.

The great artist who is otherwise just a prick is Danny’s father, Harold, played by Dustin Hoffman with considerable insight into just what a prick an artist can be. A prick not only unto others, but unto himself: every appraisal of his work either the promise of recognition or an insult; every encounter an occasion for a tiny triumph or an unbearable repudiation; every mention of his work an impossible excitation or an injury to skin so thin, you could blow bruises on it. The Meyerowitz Stories is an excruciating watch for anyone who aspires to make great art, whether they succeed or not. There is a little or a lot of him in every artist. Don’t ask me why; it must have something to do with the will to creative exposure: the strange, contradictory impulse of the over-sensitive to offer themselves up on the altar of judgment to people for whom they have no regard. Compare and contrast the film Maudie, which is also about an artist. Maudie recounts the real-life romance between an awkward and arthritic painter and an ill-tempered recluse who has never knowingly looked at a painting in his life. This film also has its excruciations, but they relate more to the gaucheries of love than to aesthetic ambition. In fact, no two artists could be more different. Harold fabricates sterile, abstract sculptures that reek of secondhand modernist self-consciousness. It might be a tragedy for him that he can’t get a major exhibition, but he doesn’t deserve one, the prick. Maudie (Sally Hawkins, wonderfully beguiling as the Canadian folk-artist Maud Lewis) is as far removed from high-art pretensions as it is possible for an artist to be. “The whole of life, already framed, right there,” she says, looking out of a window at her inspiration: pussy cats, leaping Bambis, red cottages in green fields. Given the choice, I’d rather have a Maudie on my wall than a Harold on my desk. Her work might be simplistic – barely art at all, if you’re a curator at Tate Modern – but at least it is not the airless, self-important thing of blighted dreams that Harold’s is. If that’s an abrogation of critical seriousness, receive it as my parting gift on this final page of my stint as stand-in diarist. I don’t think Clive James, in whose immense shadow I have written these last six months, would take my preference amiss."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global-development/2018/feb/22/sex-selection-armenia-quandary","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T07:00:29Z","webTitle":"‘We lose 1,400 girls a year.

Who will our boys marry?’: Armenia's quandary","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Sometimes it seems there are so many ways to destroy women that the methods become invisible to us. There are some women you will never see because they will never be born. Amartya Sen talked of “missing women” in his famous 1990 essay because of technologies that enable prenatal sex selection. Most people are aware this happens in China and India, but I am in Armenia, talking to a nervy woman in her early 30s. We are in the eastern region of Gavar, which is second only to China in the number of female foetuses that are aborted. Here, 120 boys are born for every 100 girls. The woman, who has two young daughters, tells me her girls say: “Let’s go to church to light a candle to get a little brother.” They want a boy, she wants a boy, her husband wants a boy. This is why she has had nine or 10 abortions – she is not sure exactly, and is vague about a “vascular condition”, given as a reason to terminate the pregnancies. She droops slightly when asked for more detail. “If I get pregnant again and it’s a girl …” She trails off. She is not sure what she will do. She has heard of doctors in the capital, Yerevan, who could help her. Sex selection, for that is what we are talking about, became illegal in Armenia in 2016. The woman says that if she gets rid of the next baby, she will not be sad. “My husband will be sad. He accuses me of eliminating all these children.” He is away for more than half the year working in Russia, as many Armenians are. “But,” she says defiantly, “in some years my girls will leave. I will be all by myself.” This is one part of what propels prenatal sex selection – a need to ensure the family lineage, and the belief that boys will provide in old age. Girls grow up, marry and leave. They move in with the husband’s family. Boys are an investment. Girls are a loss. This I hear repeated over and over again. It is hard to reconcile with the modern women – doctors, journalists and politicians – who are everywhere in Yerevan. Some of the biggest pressures on women to have sons come from other women: mothers–in–law. Dr Hrachya Khalafyan, who runs the Sevan medical centre in Yerevan, was shocked when he first heard about Armenia’s sex imbalance. “We all were,” says Sevan, who instructs his staff that there can be no terminations on these grounds. Where once they used to have seven or eight children, women in Armenia today give birth just once, on average. In the past, if the last child was a girl, she might be called the Armenian word for “Enough”, as if no one could be bothered to name her. Doctors now encourage women to celebrate carrying a girl, yet I hear the stories of what happens in “other places” where women are not allowed to be told the sex of their child at the 12-week scan. There are ways to find out, apparently, such as the pocket in which the doctor puts their pen – left for a girl, right for a boy. Armenia really needs its missing women. “We lose 1,400 girls a year. In the long term who will our boys marry? How will we consolidate the Armenian nation? We are only 3 million people. We have no right to such losses. There will be no mothers to give birth to girls,” says Khalafyan. The sex imbalance “Son preference” is a euphemism, maybe, but a necessary one. Sex selective abortion has been steadily growing across the Caucuses and Asia (Armenia has the third highest rate in the world, behind China and Azerbaijan) and it will continue to happen as fertility levels drop. When green campaigners talk of population growth being the world’s biggest problem, they need also to factor in gender. When people have fewer children, they want boys. Data collected in Armenia in 2010 started to bring home the sex imbalance: there were 115-120 boys being born for every 100 girls. Anecdotally, people talked of school dances in which boys were forced to dance with one another as there were so few girls. In 2011, the UN population fund began its advocacy work around sex selection, and in 2017 it launched a global programme to prevent gender-biased sex selection. After initial resistance, the Armenian government backs the UNFPA campaign. The country is already seeing results. In 2014, the ratio was 114 boys for 100 girls; last year, the figure stood at 110 boys for every 100 girls. Efforts by the UNFPA and humanitarian agencies such as Save the Children are proving successful because they look at the specific conditions that lead to pre-natal sex selection: contraception, emigration, men as the key breadwinners, inheritance, family lineage and conflict. Conflict was an issue raised by the headteacher of a school in Gavar, where the classes have more boys than girls. Araxia Verdanyan says the impact of the war hangs over its people. Armenia is at war with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh. “Our soldiers are killed on a daily basis. We need girls to reproduce. We need boys to defend the border,” she says. Here a boy child is always another soldier. Ministers explain the political strategy to raise the profile of girls. Contraception and health are promoted as priorities. All key professionals are trained in giving a positive message about girls. And a woman has three days to change her mind after she has requested an abortion at 12 weeks. I go to a puppet show, Ne’s Journey, performed by the Armenian Center of International Union of Puppeteers, in a high school where national folk tales are given a twist. It is the girl’s wisdom that saves the day. Girls defeat the demons and save themselves, too. The charismatic puppet master, Armen Safaryan, tells his young audience: “God decides whether we are girls or boys. Respect and love are contagious. I speak from travel and experience, and I treat men and women as the same. We are just beginning and we need our girls. We must end this murder.” ‘The word is your weapon’ Some of the most impressive work I see being done is in a seminary, by an amazing psychologist called Inga Harutyunyan. In a classroom in the Gevorkian seminary in Vagharshapat, in the complex of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, eager young priests are trained. These are highly educated young men. Harutyunyan has established a relationship with the church. Privately, she tells me about ancient Armenian matriarchies and goddesses. But the key is in the way she talks to the priests. “You are clergymen,” she tells them. “The word is your weapon,” and then she gives them texts from the Bible that emphasise respect for women. Getting the church on side, along with the government and civil society is quite something. This is the strategy in Armenia: to work with everyone; not to alienate any group, but to promote the value of girls and women right across the culture. And it’s working. “We are not ‘girl averse’, as they are in India,” says Vahan Asatryan, a researcher at the International Centre for Human Development. He suggests the answer to ending sex selection lies in looking at the issue in specific contexts. How it works in Nepal, for instance, is different from what’s happening in Vietnam. He talks about fertility rates as the big issue. Everyone stresses this is about not being for or against abortion. Abortion, he repeats, is simply the mechanism by which sex selection happens. The right to abortion is an achievement of civilisation. Armenia allows termination up to 12 weeks without restrictions. The introduction of ultrasound in the mid-90s has exacerbated sex selection across all the former Soviet republics, however. The key to change is situating this debate at the very heart of Armenian society, to ensure the survival of the nation. If the trends are not reversed, Armenia will have lost almost 93,000 women by 2060. That’s an awful lot of potential mothers. Everyone talks of extending choice and opportunity for women. Interestingly, “no one is blamed for what is happening … Everyone is part of the solution,” says Asatryan. “We can’t change gender stereotypes in two years, but we can look at the data. We can talk about human rights.” At a conference to advance gender equality and combat prenatal sex selection in Tsaghkadzor, a ski resort, community workers, activists and doctors from across the country share their experiences. Many men blame women for the sex of their own children, not realising that the Y chromosome responsible for the male sex is transferred from the man’s genome. I have coffee with Margaret, a young women who works with children with disabilities. She believes everyone has a right to life. She loves all children, she explains. She tells the women she works with: “You know when you want your husband to buy you an expensive handbag and you persuade him to? Well surely you can do that with a baby? Talk to him, tell him you want to have a girl. Persuade him. Tell him you want her to live.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/jan/05/bananaman-review-southwark-playhouse-spoof-superhero-musical","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T14:29:57Z","webTitle":"Bananaman review – can Eric Wimp turn into a musical superhero?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/05/bananaman-review-southwark-playhouse-spoof-superhero-musical","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jan/05/bananaman-review-southwark-playhouse-spoof-superhero-musical","fields":{"headline":"Bananaman review – can Eric Wimp turn into a musical superhero?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Bananaman, the blundering superhero with a cape of yellow peel, previously seen in the Beano and his own BBC cartoon series in the 80s, flies clumsily into this new musical by Leon Parris. After being knocked out by a falling shard of meteorite, spotty teenager Eric Wimp (played with gawky charm by Mark Newnham) finds himself split in two. His clothes and self-confidence still sag, but whenever Eric eats a banana, his muscles rip and his IQ shrinks as he transforms into Bananaman (played by Matthew McKenna, complete with banana-tipped horns). As floppy villains chase the powerful meteor shard, Eric hopes to impress wannabe reporter Fiona (Emma Ralston), and so reluctantly gets his five-a-day and bounds into adventure. In its original form, Bananaman lovingly parodied the silver age of comic books, but this musical’s sloppy slapstick and over-egged puns lack much of the slick wit and wordplay of the TV cartoon and the vivid design of the comic strip. Dipping into parody but still clinging to standard superhero cliche, it’s not until after the interval that this silly show finds any not-so-secret powers. With half-hearted panto charm, the musical fits together about as well as Eric’s clothes. The script misses the opportunity for anything below surface level and, although there is a stellar live band, the repetitive songs rely too heavily on the cartoon’s theme tune and overlaid melodies turn into a splurge of sound rather than giving a sense of different character narratives. The real hero is the marvellous Marc Pickering as Dr Gloom, the deliciously mischievous villain who trips over his own words and feet while concocting his evil plans, but still has enough heart to bring biscuits to meetings. Dr Gloom’s dynamism leaves little space for fellow villain General Blight (Carl Mullaney), who flails desperately for power, and only comes into his own in a hilarious but incomprehensible dance scene towards the end. The supporting cast do well with muddled direction. In a rare instance of puppetry detracting from a show, Bananaman’s sidekick Crow is a messy addition and a waste of Jodie Jacobs, who is otherwise one of the strongest performers. TJ Lloyd as the bumbling Chief O’Reilly and Ralston as the courageous Jodie also stand out. It’s the final standoff in Mark Perry’s uneven production that receives the longest laughs, with juvenile jokes entirely unrelated to the plot causing fits of hysterics. Bananaman may seem trite to younger viewers who can’t lean back on nostalgia, but stick with it and the second bite offered by this new musical is a real treat.

Not even a place on the board of the Office for Students for my troubles. It’s all very dispiriting. While most people were fixated on whether Nick Clegg did or did not deserve a knighthood and why Ringo Starr only got his two decades after Paul McCartney, my attention was drawn to the honours given to three of the six board members of the influential Conservative 1922 committee of backbench MPs. Graham Brady and Geoffrey Clifton-Brown were both knighted, while Cheryl Gillan was made a dame. When she first became the prime minister, Theresa May was clear that she wanted to put an end to David Cameron’s croneyism. By choosing to reward three of the people who are likely to play a key role in determining whether she remains leader of the Tory party in the coming year, she has not only demonstrated that her principles come second to self-interest but also just how weak she perceives herself to be. Tuesday At first glance, nothing really appears to make sense. Most people wouldn’t trust the 50-something-going-on-12-year-old Toby Young to feed their pets, let alone appoint him to a quango. Likewise, the prime minister trying to explain to the country that there isn’t an ongoing crisis in the NHS because the NHS has implemented a crisis plan is the sort of excuse not even the dimmest child would bother with, especially when the health secretary inadvertently admitted the following day that there was a crisis after all. Then we had the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, making himself scarce in Qatar, on the day he was bound to be questioned about the increase in rail fares. Not to mention, international the trade secretary Liam Fox’s enthusiasm for leaving the EU only to join another trading bloc on the other side of the world. But if you think laterally, everything begins to fall into place. The government has decided to give up running the country for the first week of the new year and has chosen to troll it instead. Wednesday There are good times and bad times to have a row. And 36,000 feet above ground on the flight deck of a passenger jet is probably a bad one. The Times of India reported that the pilot and co-pilot of a recent Jet Airways flight from London to Mumbai had such a bad row that they both stormed out the cockpit, leaving the plane to fly itself for a while. Not quite the level of service most of the 324 passengers on board would have been expecting. It makes some of my rows look tame in comparison. One of the worst my wife and I had took place about 20 years ago. It was in one of the many periods when my mental health was fragile and I woke my wife at 6am on Xmas morning to tell her that I thought I had mad cow disease. My wife took a while to get fully conscious before screaming: “Is there nothing you can’t fucking ruin?” For some reason, my reply: “That’s no way to talk to someone with a fatal illness”, only seemed to make things worse. Our Christmas never really recovered after that. Thursday One of the most telling revelations from Michael Wolff’s new book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, was that Donald Trump had never intended or expected to win the presidency. When he was told by his son on election night that he was on course to win, Wolff writes, Trump looked as if he had seen a ghost while Melania was in tears – not of joy. I was left with a similar impression on the morning after the EU referendum in June 2016, when I went to the Vote Leave headquarters to hear Boris Johnson and Michael Gove give their victory speeches. Boris appeared shell-shocked – even paler than usual – and for the first time in his political career was barely able to string a sentence together. It was as if the whole thing had been a game for him and he had never expected to be left in charge of dealing with the consequences. If anything, Gove was in an even worse state. Far from being a scene of celebration, the Vote Leave HQ felt like a morgue. Friday Nigel Farage, who recently declared himself to be skint despite earning £103K as an MEP, living in a £4m house and standing to collect a £73K EU pension, is concerned that Michel Barnier is spending far too much of his time hanging out with British remoaners. Presumably, he doesn’t count the weeks, going on months, that the EU’s chief negotiator has had to sit face to face with David Davis. So the former Ukip leader has arranged his own meeting with Barnier for next Monday and has sent out an appeal for members of the public to submit three questions they would like asked. Pleasingly, this has all rather backfired, with dozens of people writing in with questions ranging from “Has Barnier been surprised at how poor the UK negotiators have been?” to Farage’s poor attendance rate in Brussels. My own question would be rather more existential. Why is Barnier wasting an hour of his time on someone who is now best known as a pub bore and part-time radio presenter?

Fry said it was time to call it a day after two stints in which he hosted the annual ceremony a total 12 times. “What fun it will be to watch Bafta 2018 without my heart hammering, mouth drying and knees trembling,” he said. His replacement will be announced next Tuesday, on the same day that this year’s category nominees are revealed. Possible names include Jonathan Ross, who presented between 2007-11, and Graham Norton, who presents the Bafta TV awards. Ladbrokes has made Norton 5-4 favourite, although there may be raised eyebrows if the ceremony is hosted, yet again, by a white man. Others possibilities include Strictly Come Dancing presenter Claudia Winkleman (2-1), Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc (8-1), and Emma Thompson (14-1). In a statement, Fry said: “Every one of the 12 Bafta film award ceremonies that I had the privilege of hosting has a place in my memory. The mixture of glamour, glory, drama and – occasionally – embarrassment and hiccup holds a unique place in the British film calendar. “Over the last two decades I have especially loved watching the emergence of new young film talent behind and in front of the camera. But after so long a time I felt it only right to stand down and let others take the Baftas on to new heights and greater glories.” Amanda Berry, Bafta’s chief executive, thanked Fry for making each ceremony he had presented “such memorable and joyous occasions”. She added: “We will miss him tremendously.” The job of hosting high-profile award ceremonies is not for the faint-hearted. One mistake or ill-judged comment can be amplified to ridiculous heights as Fry found to his cost when, in 2016, he made a quip about costume designer Jenny Beavan after she had picked up her award for her costumes in Mad Max: Fury Road. “Only one of the great cinematic costume designers would come to an awards ceremony dressed as a bag lady,” he said. After a backlash on Twitter, Fry responded: “Will all you sanctimonious fuckers fuck the fuck off Jenny Beavan is a friend and joshing is legitimate. Christ I want to leave the planet.” He then quit Twitter but returned about five months later. Bafta also announced that this year’s ceremony, taking place on 18 February, will be held for a second year at the Royal Albert Hall in London and will feature a performance by Cirque du Soleil."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"membership/live/2018/jan/06/weekend-reading-pizza-burgers-and-booze","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"membership","sectionName":"Membership","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T08:00:07Z","webTitle":"Weekend reading: Pizza, burgers and booze","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/live/2018/jan/06/weekend-reading-pizza-burgers-and-booze","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/membership/live/2018/jan/06/weekend-reading-pizza-burgers-and-booze","fields":{"headline":"Weekend reading: Pizza, burgers and booze","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The truth about domestic violence This week, Theodore Johnson pleaded guilty to murdering his ex-partner – the third woman he has killed.

Since the first time, I struggle to maintain my erection and lose focus due to performance anxiety, and panic even though my partner reassures me that everything is fine. Is there anything I can do to break this cycle? Listen to your partner and don’t create problems where there are none. You are far from the only person in the world to have these particular concerns, but if you cannot relinquish them they will interrupt your ability to enjoy sex altogether. Managing sexual anxiety is often a man’s primary lovemaking task – no matter how experienced he is. Try to remember that sex is supposed to be fun. If you even think of sex as a performance, it will make it more likely that erectile instability may occur. You are not on stage. Just focus on the moment of loving connection, laugh and develop the ability to please your partner in many different sensual ways – ask her to show you exactly how and let her know what feels best for you, too. Many men worry excessively about losing their erection, but unless there is some diagnosable erectile problem it is quite normal to lose and regain it during sex. What is important is knowing how to be relaxed if it happens, to ask for what you need to get back on track – and to be prepared to pleasure her in non-penetrative ways if it seems expedient to do so. • Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders • If you would like advice from Pamela Stephenson Connolly on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don’t send attachments).

The chancellor, who is on the side of maintaining a close relationship with the the bloc, said the government would be guided by what deliverd the greatest economic advantage to the UK. The final arrangement would also look at “three strategic objectives”, said Hammond. They are “ensuring UK-EU trade is as frictionless as possible; avoiding a ‘hard border’ between Ireland and Northern Ireland; and establishing an independent international trade policy”. The chancellor gave the answer in reply to a letter from the Treasury committee, chaired by the Conservative MP Nicky Morgan, which asked him whether he would like to “explicitly rule out the UK participating in a customs union with the EU as part of its end-state relationship”. Morgan, a former cabinet minister, said: “It was widely thought that being in a long-term customs union with the EU had been ruled out by the government. But the chancellor’s letter confirms that this is not the case. It is vital that the cabinet reach agreement on these central questions about the UK’s future relationship with the EU as a matter of urgency.” The government has for the last year maintained that the UK would leave the existing customs union, but has not ruled out negotiating membership of some kind of separate customs union arrangement. A customs union with the EU would avoid the need for border checks and help solve the problem of trade on the island of Ireland. Brexit supporters in the cabinet are adamant that Britain must be able to strike trade deals with third parties, such as the US, Canada and others, which is not possible in a conventional customs union relationship in which members share a common external tariff. Theresa May is facing a big cabinet battle with her colleagues in the coming months over how the UK would like its future relationship with Brussels to work, including issues such as a customs union and the extent of regulatory alignment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
