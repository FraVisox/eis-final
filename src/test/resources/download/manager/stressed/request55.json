Perhaps that seems obvious for the decorated Kenyan novelist, scholar and playwright, who’s been publishing for over 50 years. But imagination, and all art, for him, is not just a form of creativity; it’s a form of resistance. In his case, once imprisoned for his political beliefs, it was his most important possession in a brutal environment meant to break him. His memoir, Wrestling with the Devil looks back at his year-long imprisonment in 1978, when, after being arrested in the middle of the night, he was held without trial, in a maximum-security prison. The memoir is a trimmer version of the original work, Detained: A Writer’s Prison Diary, published in 1982. Asked why he chose to publish this updated version now, he replied, “The theme of resistance, and writing in prison, is eternal.” He committed many acts of resistance while he was jailed, but the memoir deals with the most significant one: the writing of his novel Devil on the Cross on thick, scratchy, prison-issued toilet paper. The legend of the book has become as much a part of its story as the plot itself, about a young woman dealing with racial and gender oppression in neocolonial Kenya. Because Ngũgĩ was never charged, tried or sentenced, he had no way of knowing how long he would be held. The novel was “a form of spiritual survival”, he says. “It’s hard to say how I would have reacted after 10 years. But I was scheming as to how I’d survive. I was thinking I’d write the novel in Gikuyu. I didn’t know how long that would take. If it took a year, I thought I’d take another year translating it into Kiswahili or English. I was planning ahead, even then.” The state’s goal in jailing him, he surmises, was to make an example of an outspoken intellectual. He was arrested for his role in the writing and staging of a play, Ngaahika Ndeenda (“I Will Marry When I Want”), produced by and starring local peasants, who had no previous theatre experience, and limited economic means. For Ngũgĩ, who was openly opposed to the government, it was clear what his jailing meant. In the memoir, he writes, “If the state can break such progressive nationalists, if they can make them come out of prison crying, ‘I am sorry for all my sins,’ such an unprincipled about-face would confirm the wisdom of the ruling clique in its division of the populace into the passive innocent millions and the disgruntled subversive few.” “They would come and ask me why I was detained. It was very annoying,” he says with a laugh. “They were seeking some kind of confession. They wanted me to confess my sins, and I had no sins to confess, in a political sense.” He was advised early on in his stay by another prisoner, “Don’t let them break you.” Understanding how dire the situation was – he and others weren’t allowed books, radios, pen, paper; food was often bug-infested; they were kept in their cells 23 hours a day – it’s clear the particular importance for him of maintaining his psychic integrity and beliefs. For him, those beliefs were rooted in Kenyan independence from the British, the right of the people to live on their own terms, instead of what had come to pass in the late 19th century: British settlers taking over the land and resources, hauling native Kenyans into detention camps, forcing Kenyans to give up their culture and replace it with theirs. Over time, Ngũgĩ worked to decolonize his own mind – renouncing his baptismal James, and Christianity; ceasing to write in English. It’s that last decision that many people still question. “If I meet an English person, and he says, ‘I write in English,’ I don’t ask him ‘Why are you writing in English?’ If I meet a French writer, I don’t ask him, ‘Why don’t you write in Vietnamese?’ But I am asked over and over again, ‘Why do you write in Gikuyu?’ For Africans, the view is there is something wrong about writing in an African language.” For years, he’s advocated for African writers to write in their mother tongues, including in his seminal work Decolonising the Mind: the Politics of Language in African Literature, because he understands how integral language is to culture and identity. “Remember that the first thing that happened to African people [in the Americas] was forced loss of language and names,” he says, speaking of the transatlantic slave trade. He says he’s gained great inspiration over the years from African Americans, in culture and politics. “The resistance of African American people is one of the greatest stories of resistance in history. Because against all those arduous conditions they were able to create … a new linguistic system out of which emerges spirituals, jazz, hip-hop, and many other things.” It’s hard to hear the word “resistance” and not think of the current US presidential administration, the straining away from it that so many feel. But for Ngũgĩ, though he notes the “rightwing wind blowing over the world”, it goes beyond a single country or a single moment in time. Returning to language, he notes how ideas of Africa, “the so-called developing world” are shaped by western thought. “Ninety percent of Africa’s resources are consumed in the west. But somehow the vocabulary has turned it the other way around – it’s the west that ‘helps’ Africa. A few things are returned and they call it ‘aid’,” he says. “Africa has been the eternal donor to the west.” He calls it “the way the world normalizes abnormality”. In Wrestling with the Devil, he laments the Kenyans who sold out their own people to join the ranks of golfing, hunting, country-clubbing British settlers (he literally calls them “Draculan”), who came to Kenya to take over, and give back a pittance to the indigenous peoples. For some, that new, shiny pittance felt like a fortune. “If you can control the psyche of a people, then in a sense, you don’t even have to have a police force,” he says. It goes back to speaking one’s own language, practicing one’s own culture, investing in what is inherently yours, not what has been falsely given back to you. Or, what oppressed peoples around the world have learned: that colonial forces want what you produce, not who you are. “I think African people, Latin American people, Asian people, must find a way of relating to each other a bit more and being able to say one thing: let us make things with our resources. And then exchange with others on the basis of equal give and equal take.” This investment in one’s own culture and resources is what he calls “securing the base” (He published a book titled Securing the Base: Making Africa Visible in the Globe in 2016). He makes it clear that he still believes in cultural exchange, including literature in translation, but that you have to ensure a stable foundation in your own culture first. “We should be able to connect to our base … and then connect to the world from our base. Our own bodies, our own languages, our own hair. When you want to launch a rocket into outer space, you make sure the base is very strong and solid. As African people, we [must] make sure our languages, our resources – the totality of our being is the base from which we launch ourselves into the world.” Wrestling with the Devil shows, in part, Ngũgĩ’s further awakening to this essential need for African peoples. He offers his literal imprisonment as a metaphor for the confining of the human spirit; art and imagination, he says, are a means of breaking free. Though his imprisonment was one of his most challenging experiences, he shares some of the good he takes from it – that it’s the reason he committed to writing in Gikuyu; that the novel he produced, Devil on the Cross, was the first to be written in his language. Pressure makes diamonds, so goes the saying; and resisting tyranny creates something else: if you’re lucky, as Ngũgĩ describes himself, a chance at liberation. “Resistance is the best way of keeping alive. It can take even the smallest form of saying no to injustice. If you really think you’re right, you stick to your beliefs, and they help you to survive.” • Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o is appearing at Sydney Writers festival 2018, held between 30 April - 6 May at Carriageworks • Wrestling with the Devil is out now in the US and on 5 April in the UK"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/08/uk-knife-crime-offenders-longer-jail-sentences","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T15:50:25Z","webTitle":"UK knife crime offenders getting longer jail sentences","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/08/uk-knife-crime-offenders-longer-jail-sentences","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/08/uk-knife-crime-offenders-longer-jail-sentences","fields":{"headline":"UK knife crime offenders getting longer jail sentences","bodyText":"Nearly two-thirds of people convicted of crimes involving knives or other weapons were given custodial sentences last year, according to statistics showing more offenders are being jailed, and for longer periods, than ever before. Official figures show 7,628 of 2017’s 20,982 knife and weapon offences – which include possession and making threats but stop short of assault – led to immediate custody, with a further 4,067 leading to suspended sentences. That compares with 5,734 jail sentences and 2,649 suspended sentences handed down in 2008, amounting to about 42% of the 28,398 offences dealt with that year. The Ministry of Justice figures, which come amid concern about a surge in knife violence, particularly in London, show that the average custodial sentence handed down has risen by 2.2 months over the past decade to 7.5 months in 2017, with conviction for a knife or weapon offence now more likely to result in some form of custodial sentence. More than four-fifths of adult repeat offenders received a custodial sentence last year, the statistics also showed. The combined total of 20,982 offences dealt with by the criminal justice system was the highest number for a calendar year since 2010, when there were 21,328. But it is still well below the 28,398 offences dealt with in 2008. Last year’s tally was up by 9% on 2016, with the MoJ saying the increase in part reflects a 30% rise in police-recorded knife and offensive weapon possession offences in the year to September. The data also showed offenders were aged under 18 in 4,490 cases – a fifth of the total number handled. Whitney Iles, the chief executive of Project 507, works with young people at risk of violence in prisons and in the community. She said the rise in knife crime showed that a punitive approach was not working. “This is not something that we are going to arrest ourselves out of,” she said. “We need to start dealing with the root causes as much as locking people up for knife crime. We need to push our response back into the community and part of that is looking at a public health model for dealing with violence in England.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"housing-network/2018/mar/09/houses-theresa-may-council-planning-local-government","type":"article","sectionId":"housing-network","sectionName":"Housing Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T07:33:29Z","webTitle":"Want more houses, Mrs May?

Then fund council planning properly","bodyText":"According to the prime minister this week, her number one priority after Brexit is the UK’s desperate shortage of housing. Announcing new draft planning policies, much of Theresa May’s criticism, and that of her housing minister, Sajid Javid, was aimed at local authorities, too many of which, they argue, are instinctively anti-development. But can the UK’s housing shortage be blamed on nimbyist local authorities? The Local Government Association is having none of it, countering that local councils grant planning permission to more than 90% of applications. But this overlooks another truth: developers know perfectly well when a local authority is anti-development, and don’t bother working in these places. As one London borough leader told Centre for London researchers in 2016: “If you talk to developers, there are places where they go and work, there are places where they don’t go and work. It depends on the hassle factor.” There is no simple policy capable of addressing local concerns. Local consultation, engagement and participation have a vital role in creating high-quality developments, but this depends on councils having well-resourced planning departments. And here there is real cause for concern. Local authorities do not have the resources to really consider the nuanced implications of possible developments in specific areas or on specific sites. Our research has found that between 2010 and 2015 net local authority budgets on planning and development in London fell from £259m to £148m, a reduction of nearly 43% – more than in any other council service. The impact has been felt deeply by planning departments. A 2016 survey by the GLA showed that 96% of London boroughs say they require more delivery skills in their planning departments. Though it is easy to blame the deep and widening skills gap in planning as a result of austerity, the trend can be traced back further. There have been two notable trends in the past 40 years, as Finn William, the chief executive at the GLA’s new Public Practice agency, has pointed out. In 1976, 49% of UK architects worked for the public sector. Today it is 0.9%, and only 0.2% in London. Over the same period, important roles in planning departments, including those of architect-planner, borough architect and chief planner, have simply disappeared. Roles that were previously integrated, such as planning, surveying, architecture, landscape and urban design, have not merely drifted apart but into conflict with each other. All this marks a loss of public sector capacity to engage with local residents, to plan and design new schemes, or to effectively engage with private developers. Master plans can be commissioned from world-leading architects, and housing can be built by joint ventures, housing associations or private developers, but if borough planners are struggling to keep up with their day-to-day workload of applications, councils lose the ability to carry out strategic planning or to ensure that developers deliver on their commitments. It would be easy to feel disheartened. But even faced with budget cuts and skills gaps, there are examples of councils innovating with the resources they have. As well as the GLA’s Public Practice, Croydon council, for instance, has created the first new in-house architect department in decades to support its wholly owned development company, Brick by Brick. Many councils could be better at using existing resources and doing things differently. But we won’t get the new housing we need without well-resourced, highly skilled and locally engaged planning departments. And that requires the government to acknowledge a deeper problem at the heart of our planning system. This article was amended on 9 March to clarify the fall in planning budgets.

So can the president block you?","bodyText":"The central institution of the first democracy was the Athenian assembly, where all important civic decisions were put to a vote. And the central tradition of the assembly was that every citizen could speak freely on all such matters. The ancient Greeks even had a word for one who did not participate – an “idiot” – the root of our modern insult. Modern America is only loosely based on Athenian democracy. We can no longer gather at short notice to vote on a hill in the middle of town. But a belief that every citizen should have an opportunity to speak and be heard remains at the heart of our political tradition. It plays out even today in New England town meetings, Los Angeles zoning board hearings, and the hundreds of often rowdy town hall events held in home districts when Congress is out of session. And it is reflected in the first amendment principle that the worst kind of censorship is censorship of those who criticize government, because their speech is both essential and vulnerable in a democracy. On Thursday, a federal court in New York will face a distinctly modern version of this ancient issue. It will consider whether President Trump has the right to block certain individuals from interacting with him on his Twitter account simply because they have said things about him he does not like. Consider a typical day in political life circa 2018. The president tweets something significant, such as the transgender military ban, the appointment of a new FBI director, or his view on something Congress has done or will do. This information appears instantaneously to his roughly 40 million Twitter followers. Millions of these followers – supporters and opponents – begin to write 280-character reactions at internet speed. His 40 million followers can see these reactions and in turn react to them. Other Twitter users can react to the reactions to the reactions. The news media reports the original news and often attempts to summarize the public’s online reaction to it. Twitter users react to the news media’s reaction. And on and on it goes. The specific act being challenged is the president’s right to “block” a Twitter user from following his account – something he does to certain users who have criticized him. One consequence of being “blocked” is that these users are no longer automatically notified when the president tweets. Another is that other Twitter users – and reporters who follow the president, as virtually all political reporters do – no longer see the blocked users’ tweets in the stream of reactions to the president’s original tweet. While it is true that blocked users can still speak to their own followers, their voices are being excluded from the main current of the political dialogue surrounding the president’s original tweet. In effect, their opinions are relegated to a smaller, slower side channel. Though our current president is a uniquely polarizing figure, the principle at stake has nothing to do with political ideology. The impact of this ruling will apply to all government officials – Democratic, Republican and otherwise – who have chosen to use social media as an instrument of governing. The issue is enormously important precisely because so many officials are choosing social media to talk to and hear from their constituents. As the US supreme court recognized last summer, social media have become “the modern public square”, and a vast majority of public officials maintain accounts that serve as a forum for speech and debate. Other politicians also understand that, absent a legal prohibition, they can manipulate social media to make themselves seem more popular by quietly suppressing the speech of their critics. Two years ago, a Democratic county commissioner in Virginia maintained an official Facebook page in which she encouraged county residents to give her feedback. This feedback was visible to her as well as to other Facebook users. But when one constituent posted a negative comment, she deleted it. And by doing so she ensured that other Facebook users would not know the nature of his gripe. Thankfully a federal judge ruled last year that her action violated the first amendment. But there is no doubt that politicians across the political spectrum will be watching Thursday’s case to see whether they too should emulate the president’s under-the-radar efforts to suppress critical speech. Nearly 2,500 years ago, Socrates had this to say about the Athenian assembly: “When the question is an affair of state, then everybody is free to have a say –carpenter, tinker, cobbler, sailor, passenger; rich and poor, high and low – anyone who likes gets up, and no one reproaches him.” These words resonate even today. He of course knew a world of men orating to a few thousand fellow Greeks. He could never have imagined that same person in front of a screen, logged in to social media, but wrestling with the very same ideas of justice and fairness, war and peace, right and wrong with more than 200 million fellow citizens in a country nearly 3,000 miles wide. But suppose he were asked to decide tomorrow’s case – is there any doubt whether he would grant them the very same right to speak and be heard on the most important issues of the day?

We were jubilant in the dressing room after our 2-1 win against Arsène Wenger’s side on Sunday but, rather than champagne and plaudits, all the lads wanted was a couple of days off. The manager had given us just that after our crucial victory over Swansea last month and so the chant went up in the hope of a repeat. The gaffer came in and asked for a bit of calm before telling us we were all expected in the next morning. There was no moaning or argument and it didn’t even dampen our spirits. We all know and believe that it’s the boss’s job to make those decisions based on what’s best for the team and, if you don’t trust in that authority, then usually it will end in tears. Chris Hughton is a man with a plan and, for those who may have doubted his ability to get us to perform in our first season in the Premier League, I’d ask you to have a look at the table. My guess is there weren’t many who’d have predicted we’d be in 10th place with nine games remaining but our manager is someone who has a very strong sense of how he wants us to play, as well as a talent for organisation and process which we have built our success on during the two and a half years he’s been in charge. It would have been the easy (and popular) choice to give us time off after Sunday but his decision was a way of keeping us all grounded. We’re not safe yet but what we have done in the last few weeks and months is give ourselves a great chance of playing at the top level next season. Most of the reports and coverage after last weekend predictably focused on Arsenal’s poor run of results and the pressure it’s putting on their manager. I understand that a big club in a bad way will always be the story rather than a smaller one achieving a remarkable result and that’s what it was if you take into account that only three of our squad – me, Glenn Murray and Steve Sidwell – had any experience of playing in the Premier League before the season started but victories such as that don’t happen by chance. The worst thing we could have done was assume Arsenal were underperforming and so were there for the taking, and what our manager did leading up to the game was capitalise on the surge in confidence in our group and supplement it with a forensic gameplan aimed at exploiting their weaknesses and stumbling self-belief. We knew they were vulnerable from set pieces and so we practised our plays over and over, including a couple of new routines, and the result was that we had five great chances from dead-ball situations in the first half-hour of the game. That further rattles your opponent, so when we scored twice in the opening half there wasn’t any great surprise among our players and staff. In fact, before the game I’ve rarely seen the dressing room so calm. Usually there’s quite a lot of noise – music and shouting and adrenaline pumping – but on Sunday I felt a quiet and steely confidence throughout our team. We knew we had the gameplan and players to cause Arsenal problems and that’s exactly what we did. Training this week has been great and it’s obvious the momentum of the last few games has made a positive impact on our group and our expectation at what lies ahead. There are not many of us who have experienced a win against a team such as Arsenal and the psychological boost that gives to individual players cannot be underestimated. On Saturday we face an Everton side who will be desperate to beat us but another big game is probably the perfect opportunity for us given how everyone is feeling and the confidence we have. In the reverse fixture at the Amex in October we conceded a late penalty in a game which we felt we should have seen out and won. Since then, Sam Allardyce has taken over at Goodison Park and they have augmented their squad in the last transfer window. Once again we know we’re in for a very difficult match and it will be intriguing to see two managers from Britain and Ireland go head-to-head as both clubs fight to be safe from relegation. The stability and vision which have been key to Brighton’s promotion and development are engendered in our manager’s application and football philosophy, and it’s my belief the club will continue to thrive rather than just survive as a result. In the meantime hopefully we can get a positive result against Everton and then see what the gaffer has planned in terms of a bit of time off."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/feb/22/brandon-lewis-tories-conservatives-social-media","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T20:00:01Z","webTitle":"Tories can't win on social media due to 'vitriolic' abuse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/22/brandon-lewis-tories-conservatives-social-media","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/feb/22/brandon-lewis-tories-conservatives-social-media","fields":{"headline":"Tories can't win on social media due to 'vitriolic' abuse","bodyText":"Conservatives are losing out on social media because supporters feel unable to share their views without attracting abuse, the Conservatives’ new party chairman has said. Brandon Lewis said his party’s supporters found it difficult to conduct debates online but said his focus over the past few months had been how to gain ground on social media, where he admitted Labour had the upper hand at the last election. “If you look at what happens on social media, if somebody on the right or the centre puts out a message, the attack from the hard left is sometimes unbelievably abusive and vitriolic,” the MP told the House magazine. “For some people, if they suddenly get attacked by a huge number of hard-left people they’ve never met, that can put them off.” Lewis said: “Personal abuse and calling for physical abuse is completely unacceptable and we need to be able to differentiate between the two. What will happen otherwise is people from all political angles and views will start being put off from being involved.” Lewis, who took over as party chairman in January, has put an emphasis on MPs and activists fighting back against Labour attack lines, including on the environment and the NHS. Animal welfare has been a key issue, with Conservative MPs simultaneously tweeting during programmes such as Blue Planet, to highlight the government’s policies on plastics and water pollution. Lewis has previously said he wanted to make it easier for Conservative-supporting teens and young adults to get involved in the party, including launching a “toolkit” for sharing content online including videos and gifs. Conservatives have raised concerns in recent months about the dwindling number of activists in the party prepared to get involved in ground campaigns. The number of party members is not public but believed to be about 100,000, though some Tory activists pushing for party reform say it is as low as 70,000. Among first-time voters in 2017, Labour was 47 points ahead. Lewis said the party hoped there would be a backlash over young people being stereotyped as Labour supporters. “They’re getting fed up with being told, because they’re under 30, they must be Corbynistas,” he said. “They want to have their say because they do believe in having a free market. That’s really good and we want to make sure they have the support they need.” Lewis said the party’s next challenge was the May 2018 elections, which he said would be difficult, especially in the London seats that were “a very challenging dynamic for us”. “We’ve got work to do in London and elsewhere,” Lewis said. “These are difficult elections and I can’t shy away from that. But at the same time, we’ve got to take our case forward and put a strong campaign out there to make sure we do everything we can to give people good local governance with Conservatives and support for candidates around the country to win as many seats as we can.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/feb/22/half-of-worlds-oceans-now-fished-industrially-maps-reveal","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T19:00:00Z","webTitle":"Half of world's oceans now fished industrially, maps reveal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/22/half-of-worlds-oceans-now-fished-industrially-maps-reveal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/feb/22/half-of-worlds-oceans-now-fished-industrially-maps-reveal","fields":{"headline":"Half of world's oceans now fished industrially, maps reveal","bodyText":"More than half the world’s oceans are being fished by industrial vessels, new research reveals. The maps based on feedback from more than 70,000 vessels show commercial fishing covers a greater surface area than agriculture, and will raise fresh questions about the health of oceans and sustainability of trawler fishing. The data, published in the journal Science, also shows how fishing declines sharply at weekends, and celebrations like Christmas and Chinese new year. The data also helps to explain the extreme decline in some fish stocks: the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) says one-third of commercial fish stocks are being caught at unsustainable levels. But the clear impact of cultural and political events on fishing also offers hope that humans can restrain overfishing, said the report’s author, David Kroodsma. “What that means is we have control as humans to decide how we’re fishing the oceans: we’re not destined to overfish, we can control it,” said Kroodsma. Kroodsma and colleagues gathered 22bn pieces of information from satellite systems installed in the biggest fishing vessels, and some smaller ones, usually operating closer to shore. From this work from 2014 to 2016 they produced maps of where fishing activity was happening, and where it was the most intense. The blue to yellow colouring showing fishing activity covers most of the world’s oceans. Exceptions are the vast Southern Ocean, far from home and suffering extreme cold and dramatic storms; and striking black “holes” in more heavily used seas, which are either lesser-used exclusive economic zones, and “deserts” in the seas where there are too few fish and crustaceans to catch. Latest estimates have suggested the extent of fishing was even greater, but faced with such intense data and dramatic maps, the team were still stunned by how far the biggest ships roamed. “It is really surprising to look at the map and see how much fishing there is,” said Kroodsma. The research was led by Kroodsma, research and development director for US-based charity Global Fishing Watch, and supported by actor Leonardo DiCaprio. The paper is written with academics from the universities of California, Stanford and Dalhousie in Canada, plus National Geographic, SkyTruth and Google. Among other findings is that five countries account for 85% of commercial fishing measured by hours at sea. Half of that is China; other large-scale operators include Spain, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan - which is smaller than Switzerland, and with a population of just 23 million. On average, every person on the planet eats 20kg of fish each year, with the FAO’s own estimates suggesting this makes up 6.7% to 17% of protein eaten. The figure is much higher in some developing countries, however, where people on islands and in coastal areas rely heavily on fish for their energy, up to 70% of protein in some cases. The fish protein being measured is also caught in inland waters, and aquaculture, the controversial practice of large-scale fish farming, has expanded rapidly in recent years. The data - which without the satellite systems fitted on fishing vessels would have taken a fisheries’ expert 200 years working full-time to achieve - showed the “human face” of fishing, said Elvira Poloczanska of the research group, the Alfred Wegener Institute of Ecophysiology in Germany. “High-seas fisheries governance has the potential to reduce the risks from climate change - for example through international co-operation and the closure of high-seas areas to fishing,” she added. • This article was amended on 18 April 2018 to include SkyTruth in the list of companies that were involved in the research led by Kroodsma.

Familiarity can get a bit too comfortable, or a new baby, bereavement, job worries or significant birthday can add a dash of cold reality and leave some people susceptible to the idea of an exciting fling. Take the long-term view and consider the worst possible outcome if you have an affair. End of marriage, devastated children, financial insecurity, house move – none of it good. Don’t imagine for a moment that you’ll get away with being unfaithful. Guilt, stupidity or good old-fashioned gossip will get you in the end. Now temptation has come your way, make the most of it. Behave as if you’re having an affair – but with your partner. Flirt, text, touch, kiss. Make the most of yourself, don’t constantly loaf about in trackies. And get your sex life back on track. Start talking. If you and your partner are stuck in a rut, chances are they’re as bored as you are. You don’t have to make a huge drama and arouse suspicion, but spending time together away from the children or domestic chores can remind both of you why you got together in the first place. Avoid trouble. Never let yourself be in any situation where temptation could move instantly from imaginary to real – and that includes texting, emailing or messaging your possible lover. Get a grip on yourself, not them. The heart wants what it wants, but you’ll get over it, with no one hurt. With insight from Holly, 43, who took her own advice just in time.

Museum stars Gael Garcia Bernal as a feckless but mercurial student of veterinary medicine; Alfredo Castro is his disapproving father and Simon Russell Beale plays a cynical dealer in ancient artefacts. In 1985, all of Mexico was horrified when thieves were reported to have broken into the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City and stolen 140 priceless Mayan and Aztec objects; the news media solemnly reported that the heist was surely the work of a sophisticated international gang. Their patriotic outrage turned to embarrassment when the crime was found to be the work of two students, smart or reckless enough to have carried out the robbery but too stupid to have grasped that no one would wish to buy the goods. These objects were simultaneously priceless and worthless. The students are re-imagined as two criminal non-masterminds who are out of their depth as soon as they hit the water. It is no accident that one is obsessed with the cliff divers of Acapulco. Bernal plays Juan, and Leonardo Ortizgris is his hangdog college mate Wilson. At a Peter-Pan-ishly youthful 39 years old, Bernal carries off the role of the indolent student rather well: his face has something venal and self-pitying about it. He is very good at conveying a winsome, wounded sensitivity and self-pity. Juan slopes around the house, annoying his extended family and querulous parents who still want great or any rate respectable things from him: as Christmas approaches he is expected to dress as Santa to hand out presents at a family party – a responsibility first undertaken by his late grandfather. He has even had to get his Santa costume especially refitted by a tailor. This indignity is the last straw: Juan is determined to hit the big time. Ruizpalacios suggests that Juan first conceives his masterplan by working a summer job at the museum where he is yelled at for touching the artefacts with his ungloved hands – but he secretly keeps doing it, for the sacrilegious thrill. He has also has student friends who pick up cash as tourist guides, and from them he hears dizzying rumours about certain vastly rich foreigners ready to pay big money for pilfered artefacts. Ruizpalacios unveils a terrifically good heist sequence: all but silent, in the manner of Jules Dassin’s 1955 classic Rififi. It is edge-of-the-seat stuff when Juan and Wilson have to break into the glass case that holds an unimaginably precious Mayan mask; I wasn’t sure that the film quite showed us how they had that level of specialist expertise. But it’s a grippingly tense scene: like ripping off the mask of Tutankhamen. And then Juan and Wilson set off on their chaotic and incompetent journey to sell their knapsack full of treasure. Before setting off, Juan tries “cleaning” the mask in the sink with a toothbrush - an unthinkably crass and damaging way of treating the stolen artwork, the kind of crazy negligence Donna Tartt describes in her art theft novel The Goldfinch. And here incidentally is where the film weirdly echoes other Bernal two-person road movies: Y Tu Mamá También and The Motorcycle Diaries. Finally, our two hapless heroes encounter the unsettling British dealer Graves (Simon Russell Beale) who might be induced to get his chequebook out. Ruizpalacios doesn’t neglect the central irony at the heart of his story, a political irony which is far more current now than it was in 1985: museums are full of stuff that has already been stolen. These objects are not like paintings: their value resides in a real-world authenticity which is linked to the fact that they were never supposed to be viewed under glass in a museum. Somewhere along the line, they’ve been stolen or bought from someone whose right to sell is, to say the least, questionable. So Juan and Wilson are arguably doing the same thing, and Ruizpalacios has his robbers angrily remind the hatchet-faced Graves of this view. Juan also objects to his high-handed and culturally insensitive term “pre-Hispanic”, preferring “Mesoamerican”. But Juan and Wilson really aren’t social justice warriors, all they want is the money; and when their plan starts to unravel, the audience must ask themselves if these people have the ruthlessness simply to dump their unsellable haul and move on with their lives. Museum is an oddly genial, garrulous film in many ways – rather like Güeros – and it doesn’t behave quite like a heist thriller, nor exactly like a coming-of-age comedy, despite Juan’s later and very implausible encounter with a soft-porn star of a certain age. The film just barrels along and it’s at its most engaging when Juan has to deal (especially at the beginning) random details and absurdities that will keep cropping up in real life. It’s a very entertaining night in the museum."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/feb/22/women-lead-characters-2017-biggest-films-stats-hollywood","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T15:25:06Z","webTitle":"Number of female Hollywood leads fell in 2017, study shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/22/women-lead-characters-2017-biggest-films-stats-hollywood","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/feb/22/women-lead-characters-2017-biggest-films-stats-hollywood","fields":{"headline":"Number of female Hollywood leads fell in 2017, study shows","bodyText":"The number of female protagonists on the big screen was down five percentage points in 2017, according to a new study. The annual report on gender representation in film, from the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University, showed that out of the 100 highest-grossing films of the year, just 24% were led by women, down from 29% in 2016. The year saw the three biggest films in the US all led by female characters: Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Beauty and the Beast and Wonder Woman. But the study showed independent films were still more likely to provide women with bigger parts. They account for 65% of films with female leads. The study shows that women accounted for 37% of major characters, unchanged from the year before. Women also represented 34% of all speaking characters, up from 32% in 2016. There was minor improvement in the representation of women of color. The share of black female characters rose two percentage points to 16% thanks to hits like Girls Trip, and Latinas increased from 3% to 7%. The share of Asian women rose from 6% to 7%. But there remains an age disparity. Men over 40 accounted for 46% of all male characters compared to just 29% for women. While the majority of 2018’s big budget bets are centered around men, there are some films hoping to turn the tide. The year has already seen the final Fifty Shades film make $274m worldwide while next month sees the release of Ava DuVernay’s Disney adaptation A Wrinkle in Time, starring newcomer Storm Reid.

A judge at Bristol crown court ordered that the 29-year-old father be found not guilty of child cruelty and criticised aspects of the case against the man. Outside court, police, who investigated the case for two years, said they fully accepted the decision but remained certain FGM was taking place in the UK and would continue to work to tackle the problem. There was anger from friends and family of the father, who believed it was wrong to prosecute him, and outside court there was a minor scuffle between some of his supporters and anti-FGM campaigners. The investigation was launched after a worker for the Bristol-based charity Integrate UK claimed the man, a private hire driver from the city, had told him during a short taxi ride that his daughter had undergone a “small” procedure. Police were called and – more than two months later – the girl was examined by the designated doctor for safeguarding in Bristol. The girl’s family insisted she had not undergone FGM but the doctor, Lindsey Mackintosh, reported a small lesion. Mackintosh told the jury: “I was concerned that this may represent a form of FGM.” When the girl was examined nine weeks later by a consultant gynaecologist, nothing could be seen. At the end of the prosecution case, Judge Julian Lambert agreed with the defence team that the man had no case to answer. He described elements of the case against the father, who is of Somali origin, as “deeply troubling” and called the account of the key witness “inconsistent”. The jury was ordered to return a not guilty verdict. There have been no successful FGM convictions in the UK. Afterwards, DCI Leanne Pook, Avon and Somerset police’s force lead for FGM, said she fully accepted the court’s findings. Addressing the judge’s concerns, she said the time lapses were unavoidable. “We weren’t dawdling. There’s a whole host of complexities connected with this issue,” she said. “That’s not to say we shouldn’t keep trying. We’ll take some lessons from this and we’ll apply them next time. “FGM remains a deeply entrenched practice and we know these harmful procedures are happening in this country right now. I will do my utmost not only to bring perpetrators to justice but to stop this from happening in the first place and give a safer future for younger girls affected by this issue.” The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) described the prosecution as “unusual and unprecedented”. A spokesperson said: “Where we feel there is sufficient evidence, and it is in the public interest to pursue, it is right that we put cases before the court so that a decision can be made by judge or jury.” Lisa Zimmermann, the director of Integrate UK, said it was shameful that there had not been a successful FGM prosecution in the UK. She said the case had been brought under child cruelty rather than specific FGM legislation, adding: “The CPS and safeguarding services must protect young girls by taking urgent and serious action to ensure that perpetrators feel the full force of the law. Where there is evidence of genital mutilation, the case must be prosecuted under the FGM act.” The father left court without comment. The website Bristol Somali Media, a bilingual community site, tweeted that FGM was wrong:"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/feb/22/uk-to-lose-eu-rebate-in-2021-even-in-extended-brexit-transition","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T17:26:23Z","webTitle":"UK to lose EU rebate in 2021 'in extended Brexit transition'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/22/uk-to-lose-eu-rebate-in-2021-even-in-extended-brexit-transition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/feb/22/uk-to-lose-eu-rebate-in-2021-even-in-extended-brexit-transition","fields":{"headline":"UK to lose EU rebate in 2021 'in extended Brexit transition'","bodyText":"The UK will lose its rebate from the EU at end of 2020 if it seeks to extend the Brexit transition beyond then, the Guardian has learned. The loss of the rebate, which to some has been a symbol of British influence in Europe since Margaret Thatcher demanded “our money back”, is expected to fuel Tory Brexiters’ demands to keep the transition period as short as possible. The rebate on the UK payments to the EU budget is worth £4.5bn a year on average. The money is never sent to Brussels, one aspect of the misleading claim on the leave campaign bus. A senior EU source said the rebate would go if the UK sought to extend the transition beyond 2020. That is because the UK is required to contribute to EU coffers during the transition period, but by 2021 Brussels is expected to have revised its budget without the UK. The EU27 aim to agree a new budget for 2021-7, a decision that will be taken without the UK. This requires a revision of the EU’s “own resources decision”, the law that enshrines the British rebate. Theresa May has said she wants a transition period of around two years, but in a paper released on Wednesday the government said it should be “determined simply by how long it will take to prepare and implement the new processes and new systems that will underpin the future relationship”. The senior EU official said this was a sign the British were not ready and were not capable of wrapping things up in 2020. The 21-month Brexit transition period is said to be the brainchild of Martin Selmayr, the chief of staff to Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president. Selmayr, who is already seen as a powerful figure in Brussels, was promoted on Wednesday to become the commission’s top senior civil servant from 1 March. The 2020 end date, which overlaps with the end of the current seven-year budget, was backed strongly by France and Germany, but some member states wanted more flexibility. EU insiders said before the June 2016 referendum that it would take about five years to negotiate a trade deal with the UK. Some diplomats think the 21-month transition is not long enough. The EU is expected to include an option to extend the transition in the Brexit withdrawal text. The first complete draft of the Brexit treaty is likely to be discussed by EU ambassadors next Wednesday. The end date is only one area the UK disagrees with the EU on the transition. Other disputes include the cut-off date for allowing EU citizens to retain full rights in the UK, and the role of the European court of justice. In 2015 the UK paid £10.8bn to the EU budget, but this would have been £15.7bn without the rebate. Thatcher was lionised by Tory Eurosceptics after she secured the discount in 1984, although France remembers the decision as a defeat for the British because the Tory leader had wanted an even bigger chèque britannique. The European budget at that time was spent on farmers, a tiny part of the UK economy. As the UK became richer relative to other member states, the rebate led to resentment. Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden were given a rebate on their contributions to the British rebate in 2014. The European commission wants to sweep away all rebates that have made the EU budget eyewateringly complicated to administer and difficult to explain to the public. A UK government spokesperson said: “Negotiations on the terms of the implementation are ongoing. “We have been clear about the need for this period to have a strict time limit, guided by how long it will take us all to prepare and implement the new processes. We believe that this should be in the region of two years.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/feb/25/berlin-film-festival-2018-roundup-utoya-wes-anderson","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T07:00:15Z","webTitle":"Berlin film festival 2018 roundup | Jonathan Romney","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/25/berlin-film-festival-2018-roundup-utoya-wes-anderson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/feb/25/berlin-film-festival-2018-roundup-utoya-wes-anderson","fields":{"headline":"Berlin film festival 2018 roundup","bodyText":"Attending an international film festival, you can sometimes feel you’re on a distant planet, adrift from the universe of cinema as we usually know it. This year’s Berlinale has been like that. Over the past year, discussion in the film world has been dominated by particular issues – gender politics, representation of race – and has tended to be led by the way those issues have emerged in the US mainstream. In the year of Wonder Woman, Get Out and Black Panther, festivals highlighting the non-anglophone world can look less exciting – as if it was all a matter of earnest artisan directors quietly tending their own small, uncontroversial patches of ground. Berlin often feels like that anyway – the festival tends to specialise in the kind of work that won’t get the world’s champagne flowing. But there are films here that matter; the question is whether there are enough of them. Berlin 2018 has been a tricky one. It’s the penultimate year for Dieter Kosslick, festival director since 2001, and questions are hanging in the air following last November’s letter in which 79 German film-makers called for a post-Kosslick overhaul of the fest, so that it can compete seriously with Cannes and Venice. This year certainly proved that Berlin needs to raise its game: the competition offered some gems, and a respectable amount of red-carpet glamour, but the overall sparkle was thinly spread. The opener, though, was a joy: Wes Anderson’s aesthetically brilliant animation Isle of Dogs, about a group of talking dogs fighting anti-canine oppression in a future Japan: the voices include Bryan Cranston, Greta Gerwig and the perennial Bill Murray. In a goofy, melancholic mode, there was sweet bagatelle Damsel by US cult duo the Zellner brothers, with Robert Pattinson courting Mia Wasikowska in a grotesque Old West. Gus Van Sant made a moderate return to mainstream form in upmarket tearjerker Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot, starring a charismatically abrasive Joaquin Phoenix in the true story of a quadriplegic cartoonist. And there was Steven Soderbergh’s Kafkaesque psychological thriller Unsane. It stars Claire Foy, a universe away from The Crown, as a woman committed to a mental hospital against her will; it’s over-ingenious and barely believable, but Foy’s conviction and tough-cookie spikiness carry it through. Berlin never likes to make the going too easy for audiences, and this year offered two challenges in particular. One was Season of the Devil by Lav Diaz, the Filipino specialist in testingly long films. This one, at only four hours, felt more arduous than some of his works of twice that length, mainly because its story of paramilitary brutality in the Marcos years is almost entirely sung, in lugubrious a cappella style. Even harder going was the three-hour My Brother’s Name Is Robert and He Is an Idiot, by Philip Gröning. It starts as a German answer to Terrence Malick, as two teenage siblings mooch around in fields musing on philosophy and time, then takes a brutal turn, like Michael Haneke’s Funny Games slowed to a crawl and laced with quotes from Heidegger. It’s beautifully, brilliantly executed, and largely mystifying. Among the best competition films was Aleksey German’s Dovlatov, about a Russian poet’s struggles in the bohemian scene of early 70s Leningrad – a rambling, jazzy, involving recreation of a lost world in which literary passions mattered as a lifeline to sanity. Then there was Transit, German director Christian Petzold’s film about refugees in occupied France – but with the drama transplanted to present-day Marseilles, to subtly disorienting effect. And there was a blast of exuberance and originality in Mexican competition entry Museum, by Alonso Ruizpalacios, the up-and-coming director who made a mark with his debut, Güeros. The follow-up stars Gael García Bernal as one of the perpetrators of a theft of several priceless Mayan artefacts. Ruizpalacios shows equal audacity and invention in his directing, and beyond the heist sequence the film has plenty to say about Mexican society, the contradictions of the archaeology trade, and the pressures of family life. Simon Russell Beale has a piquant cameo, and the film’s a gem. Out of competition, The Happy Prince proved a surprising pleasure, with Rupert Everett directing himself as post-prison Oscar Wilde, on the loose in Europe and enjoying a rebellious decline. Unashamedly a paean to Everett’s own faded beauty – he looks defiantly raddled – it’s shamelessly show-offy, but has genuine brio and imagination. An absolute delight was The Green Fog, made by Canadian eccentric Guy Maddin and the Johnson brothers, Evan and Galen. Essentially a conceptual art piece, it’s a “remake” of Hitchcock’s Vertigo assembled from a myriad of movies and TV shows shot in San Francisco. This means that the James Stewart character is variously played by Vincent Price, Rock Hudson, Dean Martin et al, while Kim Novak’s stand-ins include Joan Crawford and Sharon Stone. Liberally garnished with in-jokes – and a bizarre standalone section that fixates weirdly on Chuck Norris – it’s both the funniest and the most beautiful film here. Not enjoyable by any means, but certainly Berlin’s most confrontational and controversial offering, was Norwegian drama U – July 22, a reconstruction of the rightwing fanatic Anders Breivik’s massacre of 69 people on the island of Utøya in 2011. Filmed in a single continuous take, the narrative is filtered through the real-time experience of one young woman, played vividly by newcomer Andrea Berntzen. It follows her over two hours, as she tries to survive amid the chaos and terror. Directed by Erik Poppe, the film started arguments here about the purpose of such an evocation, and the ethical implications of treating the subject in such a virtuoso immersive style. But U – July 22 comes across as a genuine gesture of solidarity with Breivik’s victims, and made sobering viewing in the week of the Florida school shooting. Here was one film, at least, that reminded us that festivals aren’t just cinephile snowglobes, but places where the world comes to talk about itself, sometimes very urgently indeed. Best of Berlin Best films For youthful verve and style, Museum. For timeliness, intensity and cinematic audacity, U – July 22.

So let’s stop scaring kids off PE","bodyText":"When I was growing up I routinely bunked PE lessons. I saw PE as optional – it was on the timetable, but no one seemed to care if you didn’t attend. PE was for sporty kids anyway, and I wasn’t one of them. Times have changed. We now know so much more about the value of physical activity – for physical and mental wellbeing, to promote positive body image in women and girls, to help people with depression, to engender a healthy lifestyle from an early age, to sharpen concentration and academic performance, and even to tackle the gender pay gap (research shows that women who play sport are more likely to enjoy high-flying careers). So why is PE still treated as if it were optional? And that’s not just by tearaway teens, but by schools themselves. New research from the Youth Sport Trust has revealed that 38% of teachers have seen a drop in secondary school PE over the last five years as a direct result of exam pressures on 14- to 16-year-olds. The survey results didn’t surprise me. While schools are advised to provide two hours of PE a week (which includes time for students to get to the class and get changed either side), nothing is enforced. In recent years I’ve been told many woeful stories about PE in state schools. In one London borough, primary schools reeling from the effects of savage cuts and under pressure to achieve exam results cut PE lessons for two whole terms so that pupils could focus on preparing for their SATs. Predictably, this is a story of economics and privilege – those schools were primarily made up of pupils for whom English was a second language. Another teacher told me of their school “regularly pulling kids from PE to do further English lessons when PE was the only lesson they could really take full part in with limited language skills”. On a BBC 5Live phone-in on this subject on Wednesday, a head of PE from a school in the West Midlands said that underachieving year-11 students were being taken out of PE lessons for additional learning support ahead of their exams. That’s the maddening thing. The schools with kids facing the biggest academic hurdles are often those facing the biggest cuts to their PE programme. And those are often the kids for whom extracurricular sports clubs are not an option, so when it comes to physical education school is their lifeline. Little wonder, then, that privately educated athletes are overrepresented in the Team GB medal tally, with one third of British medallists at Rio 2016 having attended fee-paying schools – five times the national average. And yet the research tells us that cutting PE hinders academic and personal success. Lawrence Dallaglio’s RugbyWorks programme uses rugby to engage young people in pupil referral units and get them back into education. Their 2017 Impact report found that 68% of the young people on their schemes were in employment, education or training a year after leaving, compared with the national average of 50% six months after leaving. Just through playing rugby. The National Literacy Trust uses football to encourage reluctant readers, while Sport England’s football community cohesion programme, Premier League Kicks, has seen local authorities reporting reductions of up to 50% in antisocial behaviour. Even when children are getting access to PE, there are concerns about the quality of the lessons. Primary school teachers receive an average of just six hours’ training in delivering PE lessons – and many report feeling unassured and ill-prepared as a result, a situation exacerbated by the fact that many teachers themselves had negative experiences of PE at school. Unlike with maths or English, where there is a requirement for all pupils to achieve a level of literacy and numeracy, in PE there is not enough emphasis on physical literacy (as distinct from sporting excellence). So marginalised young people – in bigger bodies, with disabilities or with body confidence issues – are further alienated from physical activity. This category includes the likes of GB Goalball’s Georgie Bullen, a visually impaired athlete who was told by her PE teachers that she was no good at sport, only to go on to represent her country at London 2012. Or the woman who tweeted me this week to say that as an asthmatic with endometriosis she was “shouted at and treated as a waste of time by my PE teachers”, but has now found her sporting passion in roller derby. If only PE was like other subjects: widely taught, requiring expertise to lead classes, catering for all, and using teaching methods to convey technical information. Not merely a roar of “Unlucky, mate!” or “RUN!”. In what other subject would that be acceptable? “DO THE MATHS!” seems an unlikely classroom instruction. We are at risk of depriving a generation of young people of physical activity, at a time when so many other factors are combining to put their physical and mental wellbeing at risk. PE is the free-to-access physical activity that should never be cut. And yet here we are, 25 years on from when I left school, still making the same errors. We really should know better. • Anna Kessel is the author of Eat Sweat Play"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/live/2018/feb/22/arsenal-v-ostersund-europa-league-second-leg-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T22:03:28Z","webTitle":"Arsenal 1-2 Östersund (4-2 agg): Europa League second leg – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/feb/22/arsenal-v-ostersund-europa-league-second-leg-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/feb/22/arsenal-v-ostersund-europa-league-second-leg-live","fields":{"headline":"Arsenal 1-2 Östersund (4-2 agg): Europa League second leg – as it happened","bodyText":"Graham Potter shakes Arsene Wenger’s hand and the Ostersund players go to greet their adoring fans. It will be interesting to see if they can have a tilt at the Swedish title in 2018. A lot depends on whether they can hang onto their star players and their manager. Thanks for your emails and your tweets, it’s been fun. Bye! That’s it. Arsenal are through, Ostersund are out. But it is a magnificent performance from the Swedish side. The biggest credit I can give them is that I genuinely thought at half-time that they could pull off the upset, such was the quality of their play. A silly error at the beginning of the second half took away their momentum, but it’s still probably the best result in their history. 90+2 min: Most of the Arsenal fans have gone home. All of the Ostersund’s fans have their scarves above their heads, and are still in belting form. Bravo. 90+1 min: Chance for Welbeck, but still he can’t get his goal. He wins the ball back from a tired-looking Widgren, has one defender to beat in Papagiannopoulos, and can only drag a shot straight at Keita’s legs. 90 min: Referee Ivan Kruzliak falls over. Referees falling over will never not be funny. Three minutes added on here. 88 min: Mkhitaryan is booked for a late challenge on Chambers, to cap a miserable night for the Armenian. 87 min: Iwobi can’t shoot with his laces to save his life. There, I said it. 86 min: Ostersund are blowing, Edwards and Papagiannopoulos in particular, the former picking up a booking. Kolasinac is having more and more joy down Arsenal’s left, but some last ditch tackles and brave goalkeeping from Keita stop any danger. 85 min: Just goes to show how much quality Ghoddos does have. He reminds me a little bit of a right-footed Fekir. 84 min: Chance for Islamovic! Ooooo, that was close! Kolasinac gives Ghoddos far too much room, the Iranian crosses and Islamovic steals in ahead of Chambers, flicks the ball on and the ball squirts just wide of the far post. Ospina was nowhere, that was about a yard wide. 82 min: Another update from Mats Gustavsson. “Obviously the Östersund faithful are now chanting ‘4 - 1’. Ex-Southampton midfield wizard Anders Svensson acts impressed on TV.” 80 min: Ostersund make their final change: Arhin on for Hopcutt, who has been very impressive tonight, but has run out of puff. 78 min: It’s taken 77 minutes, but this is Arsenal’s first sustained possession of the match. A good three minutes pass without Ostersund having a kick. They are strangling the game, as Arsenal fans appear to start filtering out of the stadium. Ostersund’s fans, meanwhile, are in excellent voice. And why not, they are beating Arsenal. 75 min: Arsenal make a change, and it is Wilshere that comes off, Willock on. 74 min: Wilshere looks like he’s taken a knock, goes down holding his ankle. Wenger won’t like that, especially with Sunday in mind. Mkhitaryan also goes down grimacing, but he’s cup tied for Sunday’s final. He’s also been dreadful tonight. 72 min: Second change for Ostersund, and it’s an attacking one: Islamovic, a new signing, a forward and the club’s No99, comes on for Mukiibi, who made the mistake for Arsenal’s goal. Ostersund appear to be playing without a right back now. The game is opening up. 70 min: Back come Ostersund. Hopcutt swaps passes with Nouri and fires a low shot on goal, but Holding does well to block. 69 min: One more Arsenal goal and you’d say the tie is done. As it stands, if Ostersund score two goals without reply, they are through. 68 min: Chance for Welbeck! Wow, this is actually quite a bad miss. Welbeck is obviously lacking in confidence. Iwobi does well to work some space, he dinks a cross to the near post and Welbeck has a free header, in the centre of the goal, six yards out, but only directs it straight into Keita’s gut. 65 min: “As an Arsenal fan I’d love to see the Gunners lose, just to see exactly how much rope Wenger has at Arsenal,” emails Matthew Stephens. “If losing to a Swedish team in its off-season doesn’t get him fired, presumably nothing would, short of him committing some kind of capital offence?” 63 min: The pace of the game has dropped off a little. That might be down to fitness, remember Ostersund’s domestic league season ended in November and doesn’t start again until April. Elneny breaks from deep with the ball and fires a long-range shot at Keita, who palms it safely wide. Comfortable enough save, but well hit. 60 min: Ghoddos meanwhile, arguably Ostersund’s most dangerous player, has gone a little quiet after a brilliant first half. A few neat touches but he’s having to come deeper to get the ball now. Still remarkable to think he only cost Ostersund £65,000. Ostersund have just signed him to a new contract and have reportedly just turned down a £5.5m offer from Celta Vigo. 58 min: Very impressed with Nouri at the base of midfield. He was brought off at half-time in the first leg, but has bossed the midfield. I don’t think he’s lost the ball once, apart from that failed trap of the ball in the first half, a spurned opportunity for Ostersund. 55 min: This has been an encouraging response from Ostersund. They could have easily gone into themselves after conceding that goal, but look like they’ve still got the confidence to take the ball to Arsenal. Hopcutt skips past Kolasinac like he isn’t there. It’s been an excellent performance from the Englishman thus far. 53 min: Chance for Ostersund! A free-kick wide on the left is flicked on at the near post and Mukiibi steals in at the back post – can he poke it home? No! Ospina bravely gets down well to smother it. Good goalkeeping. 50 min: Graham Potter doesn’t hang about, he’s making a change: Tekie comes on for Aiesh, who got the first goal for Ostersund. That’s a shame, from a neutral’s point of view. But 90% of the Emirates breathes a huge sigh of relief. To be fair to Arsenal, they came out this second half like a train. Kolasinac beats his man and plays the ball inside, and suddenly Arsenal have four on four at the back. The ball goes wide on the right, Bellerin crosses to the back post and a horribly mis-kick from Mukiibi allows Kolasinac to volley the ball into the top corner from six yards out. Ooooo, that’s a terrible error. 46 min: Arsenal are looking to sure up the midfield, so naturally Wenger has brought on Granit Xhaka. He replaces Maitland-Niles, who was booked and had a torrid first half in central midfield. “It’s amazing to see the difference in results now that both teams have each had a chance to play on a surface more suited to their abilities,” quips Robbie Borowczyk from Gammelstad in northern Sweden. Peeeeeeeep! We’re off again. “Just to clarify: The Östersund supporters are chanting “4 - 0”, in case your Swedish is a bit rusty.” emails Mats Gustavsson, which sounds like a suspiciously Swedish name to me. It is, so thanks. Fair point. “Chambers can’t defend, Michael,” emails Ruth Purdue. “His decision making and positioning can no longer be ignored now.” I don’t disagree with that. Holding can defend, but simply isn’t good enough with the ball at his feet, if Arsenal want to be a Champions League club again. Bellerin is good enough, but has been woefully out of position tonight, tactically he seems all at sea. They probably don’t need reminding, but this competition is wide open for Arsenal to win. Earlier, Napoli went out on away goals to RB Leipzig, and Dortmund are 45 minutes away from going out to Atalanta on away goals. If Arsenal can get through this tie, they will probably be second favourites to win it (after Atlético, who cruised past Copenhagen). Check on all the latest scores here. Check on our match report of Celtic’s defeat at Zenit. Probably the worst half of football I have ever seen from Arsenal. Definitely the best half I have seen from Ostersund (I’ve seen two others). “Emiratestanbul anyone?” emails Jonny Mac. 45+1 min: Arsenal seem content to pass it square, square, backwards, square. Very strange why they don’t want to put pressure on Ostersund, who are down to 10 men. 45 min: Two minutes added on here at the end of the half. 43 min: Yellow card for Maitland-Niles, who quelled a dangerous Ostersund counter-attack by hauling Nouri to the turf. Maitland-Niles again got the wrong side, Elneny was again nowhere to be seen. These two are having an absolute stinker. And Ostersund still have 10 men! Pettersson is still receiving stitches on the Ostersund bench for his head injury! 41 min: Chance for Wilshere, who skies a golden chance after the ball bounced loose in Ostersund’s penalty box. 38 min: Pettersson has now had to go off with a blood injury, crashing his head into his team-mates’ elbow. Ostersund are down to 10 men for now, they need to hold out until the break! 37 min: Wilshere takes the resulting free-kick quickly, skips past Widgren and plays a delightful pass inside the full-back to Bellerin, who gets to the byline. It’s Pettersson who gets back though, a second wonderful sliding tackle inside 30 seconds. 36 min: Inch-perfect challenge from Pettersson on Mkhitaryan in midfield, but the referee rules it to be a free-kick. Not sure what he’s doing there, the referee Ivan Kruzliak has got two of three things wrong so far. 34 min: Chance for Arsenal. Mkhitaryan, who has been irrelevant in the opening half-an-hour, whips a ball in, Welbeck climbs and flicks the ball on from close range and the ball hits Keita, who is lucky to collect the ball afterwards. 31 min: Two emails, one from a Graham Potter fan, one from an Arsenal fan. “Hello,” writes Michael Cosgrove, “and as someone who admires Graham Potter for his courageous attempts to create a new and original managerial style, which the Guardian reported, I hope that even if Östersund lose tonight they at least get to penalties so that he can go home deservedly happy with his approach, and motivated to continue his work.” “Arsenal used to make low cost players into amazing talents, now we make low cost opponents look like Barca,” emails Steven Hallett. “Getting close to being bored with their consistent inconsistency.” 29 min: Edwards, born in Middlesbrough and who played for non-league clubs like Darlington and Thornaby before moving to Sweden, tries his luck from range as Ostersund try to tie the scores at 3-3 agg. It’s a yard wide. More boos from the home crowd. 28 min: Penalty shout for Arsenal! Turned away by the referee, who must have thought that Holding dived over Nouri’s challenge. He didn’t. That was probably a penalty. 26 min: What a tie we have now! Ostersunds are still in the ascendency here, and it’s a toxic environment for Arsenal. Wow. Straight from the kick-off, Ostersund score again! Iwobi carelessly gives the ball away, Edwards wins it back for the visitors and sends a brilliant lofted pass to Sema on the left. Bellerin is all out of position, Sema turns Chambers with a brilliant bit of skill and lashes a fierce low strike into the far corner. Ospina had no chance with that one! Graham Potter is dancing on the sidelines, Ostersund’s fans go wild, and Arsenal look stunned! It’s been coming. Arsenal lose the ball cheaply, Holding overcommits, Kolasinac fails to intercept the pass from Nouri and Aiesh, the Ostersund right winger, gets in behind Arsenal’s left back and sidefoots the ball past Ospina. It may have taken a small nick off Chambers on the way through, and might be given as an own goal. But it doesn’t matter, Ostersund are 1-0 up and full deserve their lead on the night. 20 min: A small break in play as Holding has a cut in the back of the head, which he sustained in a sliding tackle on Curtis Edwards. Holding is not hurt, but will need that patched up. 18 min: Really weird defending from Bellerin. He simply let Sema canter down the left side of the penalty box and have a shot on goal. Ospina parries and is lucky that the ball pops up kindly for him to gather at the second attempt. 15 min: There’s a half-baked penalty from Arsenal fans as Papagiannopoulos gives Kolasinac a gentle nudge in the box, but the Slovakian referee, Ivan Kruzliak, rightfully waves play on. 14 min: Corner to Arsenal, who take it short and proceed to make a series of backwards passes to Ospina. At least they kept the ball though, yeah?! 12 min: Arsenal have their first meaningful effort on goal: Iwobi drops the shoulder on the edge of Ostersund’s box, and curls it a full 20 yards wide. 10 min: One thing that Arsenal have done well is press Ostersund from their own goal kicks. Ostersund like to play out from the back but the keeper Keita is being forced to kick long, and it doesn’t look like he’s got the quality to break the press. 8 min: Ostersund break with pace, and Arsenal’s defence are horribly exposed: where are Elneny and Maitland-Niles?! Hopcutt gets to Arsenal’s box, squares to Ghoddos who plays a wonderfully weighted through ball to Nouri, but the Ostersund captain can’t control the simple pass. He was clean through, and all he needed to do was trap it! Nouri has his head in his hands, he knows what an opportunity that was. Arsenal are absolutely nowhere in these opening exchanges. 6 min: Wilshere and Iwobi finally get their foot on the ball, Arsenal start passing it around, and finally the hosts seem to have found their rhythm. 4 min: Another chance for Ostersund! Sema drives to the byline on Ostersund’s left, nutmegs Bellerin and squares to Hopcutt, who steers the ball towards the far post, and it’s only a fine block from holding that stops the Swedish side from taking the lead. Arsenal are rocking here. 2 min: Half-chance for Ostersund! A dreadful pass from Holding lets Hopcutt get one-on-one with Chambers. Hopcutt cuts the ball back for Ghoddos, but Bellerin nips in and hacks the ball out for a corner! Cleared by Arsenal, but that is a terrible start from the home side. Peeeeeep! We’re off. Ostersunds are about 100-1 to qualify, according to some bookmakers. Let’s see what happens. The teams are out. Even though they are playing at home, Arsenal are playing in their blue away kit. Ostersund are in their white home kit. Celtic are out of the Europa League. Get the latest with Nick Ames. In case you didn’t see the first leg, keep your eye on Ostersund’s Swedish-born Iranian striker Saman Ghoddos, who won the best forward award in last season’s Allsvenskan. He is small, quick, stocky and has an eye for goal. Another to flag up is midfielder Ken Sema, who has recently broken into Sweden’s national team. It will be interesting to see how he gets on against Arsenal’s least experienced starter: Ainsley Maitland-Niles. Elsewhere, Celtic are 3-0 down at Zenit, and need two goals in the minutes to qualify. In arguably the tie of the round, RB Leipzig v Napoli, it is now 3-3 after Lorenzo Insigne’s late goal, but the Italian side trail on away goals, they need one more in injury time. Tune in here. Wenger speaks! It’s not a formality. We have to show that we are focussed. Things are strange in football. You have to be intelligent and intelligent means focused. Many players think this is a competition where they have a chance to show their quality, and others see the final and Sunday and try to get a place in the team. Ostersund are ambitious, even more ambitious this year, they want to win the title in Sweden. The away fans are already packing the away end, we’re just over 20 minutes away from kick-off now. The club’s ultras are called Falkarna, they are already in excellent voice at the Emirates. Graham Potter, the Ostersund manager, speaks! It’s a wonderful opportunity for us. We understand the size of the club that we face, but we’ll dream and hope for a miracle. We’ll try to be offensive with our wide players. If you haven’t read this yet, do. It also includes a throwaway line from the Ostersund chairman at the end that is a little corny, but I’d say pretty poignant for the club’s story. If we lose we have to learn from that, so we always win, even if people think we lose the game. The last time that Arsenal played a weakened team, they got battered 4-2 by Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup third-round. Few chances taken by Wenger, then. Apart from a few defensive exceptions in Nacho Monreal, Laurent Koscielny and Shkodran Mustafi, this is arguably his strongest available team: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is cup-tied, Alexandre Lacazette is injured (as is Aaron Ramsey), Mesut Ozil is ill. Petr Cech is available but generally does not feature in the cup competitions. It’s pleasing to see Arsenal pay Ostersund the respect they deserve. Perhaps it is more than respect. Arsenal: Ospina, Bellerin, Chambers, Holding, Kolasinac, Mkhitaryan, Elneny, Maitland-Niles, Iwobi, Wilshere, Welbeck. Subs: Macey, Monreal, Mustafi, Xhaka, Nelson, Nketiah, Willock. Ostersunds FK: Keita, Mukiibi, Papagiannopoulos, Pettersson, Widgren, Aiesh, Edwards, Nouri, Sema, Hopcutt, Ghoddos. Subs: Andersson, Tekie, Bergqvist, Gero, Mensah, Arhin, Islamovic. Referee: Ivan Kruzliak (Slovakia) In all seriousness, it is probably worth checking in on Celtic. They are 2-0 (2-1 agg) down at Zenit, but only need one away goal to go through. Join Nick Ames, if that’s your thing. Arsenal are a wonderful club, an institution, and to go to the Emirates for the second leg is fantastic and crazy – because they have more people [60,000] in their stadium than we have in our whole town. This quote from Graham Potter, manager of Östersund and taken from Donald McRae’s interview from a couple of weeks back, seems a fitting way to begin this preamble, simply because it puts into perspective the two teams we have playing tonight. Even the most optimistic of Östersund fans will agree that their European adventure Europa League will almost definitely end tonight, Arsenal winning the first leg in Sweden 3-0. But what a way to go out: 5,000 Scandinavians rocking and rolling in the away end at the Emirates, 10% of the town’s total population. Östersund’s domestic league season ended in November, meaning this is a (cliche alert!) proverbial cup final for them, a match to be celebrated before it has even begun. It is going to be entertaining, whatever happens. Of course, the tie is still alive, just, although Arsenal would need a European collapse at the Emirates not seen since … this time last year for them not to progress to the last 16. It is a chance for them to rest some big players prior to Sunday’s Capital One Cup final against Manchester City, and a chance for others to impress. Unless you are a Östersund fan, if you want jeopardy, you’ve probably come to the wrong place. Try Zenit St Petersburg v Celtic for size. But if you like fun, and I know Graham Potter does, stay right there.

And an early vocal bid has come from a group wanting to establish a “female-led” theatre. Accalia Arts has raised more than £10,000 from crowdfunding. Were they to win, they would not be the first women to programme work at the theatre. In 1736, Charlotte Charke – cross-dresser, actress and poet – placed an ad promoting a summer season by “a mad company of comedians”: she was appearing in Hurlothrumbo as Lord Flame. That wildness from rebel voices looks appealing. The Haymarket could do with a shake-up. It has got stuck in a timid repertoire and sluggish stagings. Frozen raises the temperature. But not quite enough in Jonathan Munby’s production. First put on 20 years ago, Bryony Lavery’s play about the disappearance of a young girl is a distinguished piece of work. It clinically cuts through weepiness yet is emotionally open, showing the struggle to maintain accuracy when shaken by horror. A pre-teenager sets off on a visit to her grandmother and never returns. Shades of Red Riding Hood in this – but there is no other fairytale element. Three characters supply the chain of events and its consequences. Jason Watkins plays the man who sexually assaulted and murdered the girl, Suranne Jones her mother, and Nina Sosanya a psychiatrist researching serial killers (in an overdetermined touch, she comes from Iceland). They give their own accounts, frozen apart, before confronting each other. Sosanya’s part is the least developed but she brings her customary poise to debating the difference between crimes “of evil” and “of illness”. Watkins excels as the affectless killer: a chappie who sets about the business of abduction as he might tackle a complicated timetable: “You make it work”. He brings the same polythene and order to both his DVD collection and his act of murder. No one who has followed Suranne Jones from Coronation Street through Scott &amp; Bailey and Doctor Foster – or who saw her on the stage marvellously overblown in Top Girls – will be surprised at the power of her anguish here: quivering but contained. It was confusing and disappointing (to me at any rate) to hear Natalie Durkin of Accalia, when discussing her plans for the Haymarket on Woman’s Hour, describe Jones as hugely talented but “not very diverse”. If only these focused performances and concentrated script had been seen in a smaller space. Designer Paul Wills’s translucent screens, sometimes bearing the face of the dead child, loom like an army of giant ice cubes over the action. A tight play is slackened, looking more like a debate than a human study. According to her biographer, Fidelis Morgan, Charlotte Charke went en chevalier not to cop off with women but because she stood a better chance of getting a good job dressed as a fellow. To stay afloat in the theatre, a woman has always needed to do more than one thing. One of the skills that has kept Bryony Lavery’s theatrical career buoyant over some four decades is that of adaptation. Treasure Island, 101 Dalmatians, Our Mutual Friend and now Brighton Rock, in a joint production by York Theatre Royal and Pilot Theatre. Graham Greene’s 1938 novel of damnation by the seaside is ripe for dramatisation, coasting on highly charged realism and apocalyptic suggestion. Gangs, acid attacks, stabbings, protection rackets, sudden death, gaudy comfort, cakes in cafes, absolute cruelty. All lit up by the flare of Greene’s Catholicism. Fourteen years ago, the Almeida put on a tepid musical version. This is darker, less lavish and more emotionally ambitious. Lavery has filleted the book into a series of quick moments. Pilot’s new artistic director, Esther Richardson, has made a production that flickers from one brightly lit spot to another. Economical but lucid. Sara Perks’s design goes to the sad heart of the matter. An iron walkway twists above the stage, curving down to contain a dismal bedroom. Lit with spotlights, it becomes a pier: an illusion of gaiety perched on a dark sea. Hannah Peel’s music gives that heart a beat. Drums tick and thrum through the action. Occasionally a dainty melody – Elizabethan Serenade tinkles respectably – is given an icy turn. The warm, human hope of the evening, the bold, free-with-her-favours Ida, is given gorgeous voice by Gloria Onitiri in numbers with a touch of music hall and sometimes the swing of jazz; she moves through the play like a beacon in scarlet or leopardskin. In a mesmerising moment, Jacob James Beswick, as vicious Pinkie, sings to the waitress he has in his thrall: Sarah Middleton is sweetly persuasive as this teenage innocent. He is very still as he delivers – beautifully – the Agnus Dei. It rings out like a terrible taunt. The most arresting episodes spring from an imaginative staging that is not matched by individual performances. As yet. I saw Brighton Rock at preview, which in the case of this small company meant after only a couple of stagings. The cast has time to go up a notch as the production goes on tour. Then this could be really remarkable.

But Maria Ressa says “I never saw it coming.” The founder and driving force behind the Philippines news organisation Rappler admits to surprise when President Rodrigo Duterte effectively declared war on her journalists and heralded with it the biggest threat to freedom of the press the country has seen in decades. Rappler has only been in existence since 2012, beginning as an online news start-up with 12 reporters, established by Ressa, a former CNN Bureau chief. But over the past two months this small yet bullish group has been at the forefront of a battle against eroding press freedom in the Philippines. Duterte’s spokesperson - in language eerily evocative of Donald Trump’s White House - declared that “not only is Rappler’s news fake, it being Filipino is also fake.” It is an assault which began in January when their license was revoked and has quickly intensified as the year has gone on, with Rappler’s political correspondent barred from the Presidential palace for briefings. Then, last week, the government announced they were investigating Rappler for evading $2.5m of tax – a complaint Ressa called “ludicrous”. Ressa is now in a highly politicised David and Goliath fight for the survival of Rappler, which has reached the Supreme Court. “We’re ready to fight it,” she said defiantly. “The end goal is to keep reporting, as long as we’re a democracy, and this, as far as I know, is still a democracy. And in a funny way it’s a backhanded compliment that the president sees us, a small start-up, as a threat.” It was during Duterte’s second State of the Union speech in July that Ressa was first surprised to hear the President declare that Rappler was “fully owned” by Americans, and therefore in violation of the constitution. “It’s a ridiculous claim,” said Ressa, shaking her head. “We are owned 100% by Filipinos, the documents prove it.” It followed months of critical reporting by Rappler on Duterte’s increasingly bloody and brutal war on drugs and government sanctioned extrajudicial killings, which has taken an estimated 8,000 lives. The ICC are now looking into evidence that Duterte committed crimes against humanity. Duterte, angered by the coverage, decided to boycott, and then go after traditional media, determined to control the narrative. First of all he targeted the country’s biggest newspaper, the Philippine Inquirer, which had started a “kill list” documenting those who died in the drug war. Then he went after the biggest television station ABS-CBN, threatening not to renew their franchise. Finally, his attentions turned to Rappler. In August 2016, the Securities and Exchange commission demanded document after document from Rappler, first to prove their Filipino ownership, and then for other unknown reasons. “It was clearly a fishing expedition,” said Ressa. “It was case of being guilty until proven innocent. There was never any formal charge given.” In January, the government announced they had revoked Rappler’s licence. But while other news organisations kept their battle with the government quiet, Rappler did not. Ressa held an instant press conference outside their Manila offices, denouncing the attack on press freedom to the world. “I’m banking on the fact that there are still good people in government who will prevent this. I’ve been a journalist for more than 33 years, and at Rappler we refuse to change, I refuse to be bullied,” she said. The case is now in the Court of Appeals, which has often been known to take over a decade to come to a decision. Duterte also has an authoritarian grip on the legislature, with the power to appoint his own choice of Supreme Court justices. Rappler’s battles also exist in the digital world. It was in August 2016, following Duterte’s denouncement of the site, that Ressa first noticed that the social media campaign machine which had helped get him elected had “transformed and became weaponised.” “The first targets were journalists,” said Ressa. “Any journalist who asked critical questions, anyone on social media who questioned about the extrajudicial killings was bombarded with abuse, threats of violence death threats from trolls and bots and these fake Facebook accounts. We had endless rape threats, death threats, very misogynistic attacks on women. The end goal of that was to batter hate, to use hate to silence any dissent or critical questions.” It has been unrelenting ever since and as a result Ressa put in place extra security for her reporters and offered counselling. At one point Ressa found herself getting 90 death threats an hour though social media. The hand of Duterte in this is not known and hard to prove. When Ressa asked the president in December 2016 whether he was aware of the vicious army of trolls championing his agenda online “he just said ‘you know that I’m not online’. And he might not know but it’s plausible deniability - it’s how you use terrorist tactics,” said Ressa. The battering has taken its toll. “I used to be a war zone correspondent and I can tell you it’s easier than what we’ve been up against these two years - at least with conflict reporting you know your enemy and you know where it’s coming from. Right now we have no idea when we’re getting these exponential attacks,” Ressa said. For many campaigners, the survival of Rappler has become inseparable from the survival of press freedom – and democracy itself – in the Philippines. While Ressa believes that the country is going through a “transformation that we need to keep a close watch on”, she said that Duterte had not rung the death knell for democracy in the Philippines just yet. “I came of age in 1986 and I watched the people power evolve and watched the pendulum swing as every authoritarian, one man rule in southeast Asia gradually transformed to democracies,” said Ressa. “I would hate, as I end my career, to watch the pendulum swing right back.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/ng-interactive/2018/feb/28/gender-pay-gap-what-we-learned-this-week","type":"interactive","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T16:00:06Z","webTitle":"Gender pay gap: what we learned this week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2018/feb/28/gender-pay-gap-what-we-learned-this-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/ng-interactive/2018/feb/28/gender-pay-gap-what-we-learned-this-week","fields":{"headline":"Gender pay gap: what we learned this week","bodyText":"Welcome to the Guardian’s weekly update on the gender pay gap. This year, for the first time, all public and private sector organisations in Great Britain with more than 250 employees will have to reveal the difference between what they pay men and women. All private and public sector organisations and charities with more than 250 employees are required to submit their pay figures to the government by 5 April. About 1,290 companies have filed figures so far, but the legislation is expected to affect about 9,000 companies, which collectively employ more than 15 million people. So far it’s clear that men earn more money than women at most firms. The government data shows that of the companies that have reported – so far – 74% pay men more than women. About 15% of businesses with more than 250 employees pay more to women and 11% of firms said they pay both male and female staff the same. The median is the figure that falls in the middle of a range when everyone’s wages are lined up from smallest to largest. The median is a typically a more representative figure as the mean can be skewed by a handful of highly paid employees. The reasons for the disparity in pay vary from company to company but the broader source of the gap can be seen in the distribution of high earners by gender. Of all the companies that have reported to date the top pay quartile, the highest paid 25% of employees, is male-dominated. Almost two-thirds of the top quartile is made up of men, while conversely 57% of the lowest-paid employees are women. An emerging picture of high-street banks with significant pay gaps A number of UK high street banks reported their gender pay gap this week, showing particular differences in the bonuses paid to men and women. Lloyds had the most marked gap, with men earning more than double in bonus pay compared with women. RBS and Barclays also revealed low average pay and bonuses for women when compared with men. Other things we’ve learned Barclays reveals big gender pay gaps across its UK banking group. For basic pay excluding bonuses there was a median hourly gap of 43.5% at Barclays International, which includes the investment banking business. In the UK high street bank the gap was 14.2%. This represents the difference between the midpoints in the range of hourly pay for men and women. Barclays group service, which includes operations and technology, had a salary gap of nearly 30% and a bonus pay gap of 24%. Tui’s male employees are paid more than twice as much as female staff. Women at the group’s Tui Airways UK unit earn on average 56.9% less in hourly pay than men. Ninety-five per cent of Tui’s 870 pilots (earning an average of £111,683) are men. The pay gap persists in head office: although 62% of 3,308 head-office staff are women, men are more likely to hold the better-paid roles in senior management, engineering or technology. Marks &amp; Spencer revealed that it pays male staff 3.3% more than female staff (the mean gap is 12.3%), but there are other figures that are worth noting. A full 66.3% of M&amp;S’s top earners are women. But while 75.7% of women received bonuses, compared with 66.3% of men, women’s median bonus pay was 15.9% lower, and the mean bonus 53.4% lower. “We recognise there is more to do to close the gap,” said M&amp;S. “We are focusing on addressing our pipeline of women into senior roles as well as encouraging more flexible working.” Women at Phase Eight are paid nearly 65% less on average at the clothing business despite making up 97.5% of the workforce. Of just 44 men working in the company, 39 are employed at the head office, including the chief executive. More than half of the senior leadership team are men. In its gender pay gap report, Phase Eight said it was offering additional training and development and promoting flexible working. EasyJet’s chief executive, Johan Lundgren, has voluntarily taken a £34,000 pay cut to match the salary of his predecessor, Carolyn McCall, as he said he was “committed to giving equal pay and equal opportunity for women and men”. The company reported a 51.7% pay gap – which it put down to most of its pilots being male, on an average salary of £90,000 – while two-thirds of cabin crew were female, earning on average less than £25,000. The Wellcome Trust, Britain’s largest charity and one of the world’s biggest funders of biomedical research, pays women 21% less than men on average. Jeremy Farrar, director of the trust, said the figures “inevitably make uncomfortable reading. An organisation has to face up to uncomfortable things and say ‘we’re not where we want to be and we want to change that.’”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/feb/22/lionel-shriver-says-politically-correct-censorship-is-damaging-fiction","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T16:27:49Z","webTitle":"Lionel Shriver says 'politically correct censorship' is damaging fiction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/22/lionel-shriver-says-politically-correct-censorship-is-damaging-fiction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/feb/22/lionel-shriver-says-politically-correct-censorship-is-damaging-fiction","fields":{"headline":"Lionel Shriver says 'politically correct censorship' is damaging fiction","bodyText":"Lionel Shriver, the author of We Need To Talk About Kevin, has warned that “politically correct censorship” risks turning the world of fiction into a “timid, homogeneous, and dreary” place, and called on her fellow novelists to take a stand against it. Writing in March’s issue of Prospect magazine, Shriver said that authors in today’s “call out” culture are “contend[ing] with a torrent of dos and don’ts that bind our imaginations and make the process of writing and publishing fearful”. She provoked outrage in 2016 when she said in a keynote speech at the Brisbane writers festival that she hoped “the concept of ‘cultural appropriation’ is a passing fad”. Almost two years later, she has now written that “preventing writers from conjuring lives different from their own would spell the end of fiction”, because “if we have the right to draw on only our own experience, all that’s left is memoir”. According to Shriver, the “taboo” around cultural appropriation has become a “far bigger issue in literature” than it was when she first took on the issue. She pointed to the “sensitivity readers”, who are hired by publishers to look for what she called “perceived slights to any group with the protected status once reserved for distinguished architecture”, and to the “own voices” writers at Kirkus Reviews who review titles that have characters from their own particular background. “These days, straight, white fiction writers whose characters’ ethnicity, race, disability, sexual identity, religion or class differs from their own can expect their work to be subjected to forensic examination – and not only on social media,” she said. The Orange prize winner went on to highlight the propensity for umbrage to be taken in the modern age, citing cases including the decision by Black Lawrence Press in 2014 to drop Elizabeth Ellen from an anthology after she published a controversial essay elsewhere; the recent withdrawal in Minnesota of Huckleberry Finn and To Kill a Mockingbird from classrooms, over fears the classics could “marginalise” and “humiliate” students; and her own experience of including a black character in a short story in late 2016, against the advice of her agent, who told her to replace the character with a white one. The story was declined by a magazine that Shriver said had published her in the past. Shriver highlighted her own feelings – as someone with a self-cited “obstreperous streak a mile wide” – as now “more hesitant to fold a range of ethnicities, races, gender variants and classes into my work”, and her fears that unless she “push[es] back” against this, her “fictional worlds will fail to reflect the world I live in”. “I’ve plenty of recent experience of using non-white characters in my novels, only to have them singled out and scrutinised for thought crime,” she wrote. “If even writers like me are starting to wonder if including other ethnicities and races in our fiction is worth the potential blowback, then fiction is in serious trouble.” She said that it was “impossible to gauge the degree of politically correct censorship going on behind the scenes at publishing companies and literary agencies”, with authors whose work is rejected “left with uneasy suspicions about why their manuscripts might be attracting no takers, but with no hard evidence”. Conversely, she said that it was “equally impossible to gauge … the extent of writers’ collective self-censorship”. “The tetchiness and public shaming of ‘call out’ culture has to be influencing which subjects writers feel free to address and which they shy away from, as well as making many writers reluctant to include a diverse cast,” she wrote. “Rather than tiptoe through this minefield, plenty of writers must be playing it safe with characters, topics and plots that won’t get them into trouble.” She pointed to a piece in the Guardian following her comments in Australia, that saw contributions from, among others, Kamila Shamsie and Hari Kunzru, and was, according to Shriver, packed with “equivocation”, with Philip Hensher the only writer “willing to defend their liberty without a snowstorm of qualification”. Shriver warned that “if all modern literature comes to toe the same goody-goody line, fiction is bound to grow timid, homogeneous, and dreary”, and called on her fellow authors, and on the book industry, to make a stand. “The whole apparatus of delivering literature to its audience is signalling an intention to subject fiction to rigid ideological purity tests, unrelated to artistry, excellence and even entertainment, that miss the point of what our books are for,” she wrote. “Let’s see a little more courage, people – in the work and in the world.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"fashion/2018/mar/12/on-brand-how-the-logo-went-from-ironic-statement-to-post-logo","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T07:00:05Z","webTitle":"Logomania: from straight fashion statement to something a lot more complex","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/mar/12/on-brand-how-the-logo-went-from-ironic-statement-to-post-logo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/mar/12/on-brand-how-the-logo-went-from-ironic-statement-to-post-logo","fields":{"headline":"Logomania: from straight fashion statement to something a lot more complex","bodyText":"Study fashion over the past 30 years and you would think we should have reached peak logo by now. We’ve had logos as status symbols (Fendi, 1997), logos as jokes (Fuct, 1990), logos as resistance (Bristol Street Wear, 2016), logos as nostalgia trip (Versace, 2018), no logos at all (Céline, 2010) and logos drenched in irony (Vetements, 2016). Where else is there to go? This season, fashion’s answer to that question is to rework, destroy and mutate logos. Rather than use them as an easy visual gag, a route one approach to getting dressed, they are increasingly in-the-know statements. They can be abstracted (Kenzo), found in odd places (Gucci), ironically corporate (Martine Rose), blown up huge (Véronique Leroy) or a teeny-tiny statement (Céline). Emily Gordon-Smith, head of fashion at research consultancy Stylus, thinks the key word is “irreverence”. She says the brands doing well are the ones “becoming more unexpected in how they’re playing with logos”, such as Gucci, which has scribbled doodles all over them, and – for ultimate subversion – made genuine Gucci items with the look of bootlegs. “That impressive nature of traditional logos and branding [logos as status symbols] doesn’t exist for this generation,” Gordon-Smith says. “Their values are very different. This whole messing around with logos and branding is much more appealing.” Gordon-Smith relates this new mood in part to the recent growth of streetwear, with brands such as Palace and Supreme and their non-precious use of logos. But playful logos also have history at Fiorucci. If the golden rule of branding sees a consistent logo – the Chanel double C, the Louis Vuitton LV – as a way to guarantee global visibility, the Italian brand was an early disruptor: founder Elio Fiorucci created more than 100 different logos. Janie Schaffer, who relaunched the brand with her ex-husband Stephen in 2017, says this chimes with the millennial generation they are trying to reach. “I have been in brands my whole life and people are constantly reinventing an existing logo,” she says. “With Fiorucci, we’re lucky because there isn’t just one – we can do another one next season and it will be completely different but equally authentic.” This combination – authenticity, newness and playful branding – is heady for a demographic whose attention spans developed in the internet age. Martine Rose also has multiple logos in her collection – one has the feel of 90s corporate merch when found on hoodies, while another pays homage to MTV. The in-the-know humour of bootleg culture is key. “It’s possible I’ll get a cease and desist, though I haven’t yet,” Rose says. “Whenever I am using logos, it’s with that playful intention behind it.” Rose says this attitude is essential to using logos in a “post-ironic” way. “When I think of logos, I always think of that amazing 1997 David LaChapelle image of Lil Kim [the one with Louis Vuitton’s LVs on her body],” Rose says. “That was the height of logomania when the logo was an aspiration. I think the tone now is slightly different, it’s less dry.” The accessory to wear with your logo this season, then? An arched eyebrow."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"global-development/2018/mar/14/secret-aid-worker-abusive-men-aid-sector-sexism-harassment","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T07:00:05Z","webTitle":"No, abusive men in the aid sector won't 'grow out of it' | Secret Aid Worker","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/14/secret-aid-worker-abusive-men-aid-sector-sexism-harassment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/mar/14/secret-aid-worker-abusive-men-aid-sector-sexism-harassment","fields":{"headline":"No, abusive men in the aid sector won't 'grow out of it'","bodyText":"Beyond the horror stories and investigations into allegations of sexual abuse in the humanitarian field is the broader problem of workplace culture and the sexism and toxic masculinity at the heart of many NGOs’ operations. In the humanitarian sector there is a subset of aid workers – usually white male international staff – who remain blind to the way gender impacts on their work. They consider the issue an annoying detail that NGOs should be allowed to leave at the door when the context is an emergency and bombs are falling. The problem is seen as especially trivial when raised by young women who management and HR assume simply can’t handle the “hardship posting”. When you work and socialise on the same compound with the same people, and upper management continues to be male dominated, professional and personal boundaries are inevitably blurred. When you are sick in the field, your doctor is your boss. When you go drinking at the weekend, it is with the same man. This results in subtle and unsubtle power plays in the field, often with much poorer behaviour than is seen in other professions. Sexual harassment and sexual “ownership” of new expatriate female staff is a significant part of this story. In rural Africa we saw that visiting HQ managers liked to discuss the foolishness of past (female) staff whose dalliances with local men had led to pregnancy, redundancy and humiliation. These “lessons” were apparently aimed at coaxing isolated or lonely female staff into the arms of HQ visitors. However, the double standards run deep. It was an open secret that male staff often visited brothels or impregnated local women, leaving them without child support in situations of poverty. Then there was the tale of the senior manager who repeatedly asked female staff to tell him where their bedrooms were and telephoned them in the middle of the night. After constant pressure, some staff have sex with men like this, and those who reject them face the possibility of being undermined in their workplace. At one dinner party, conversation turned to maternal health, and the lead medic announced that he knew “what size speculum to use for each and every woman at the table”. This was apparently laughed off by senior management present. In my experience, this kind of workplace culture means that many young women working in the humanitarian space find themselves able to move ahead only through compromising on their values. HR responds by listening sympathetically and taking no action, maintaining the status quo and pacifying whistleblowers. In many cases the male staff were retained, promoted and moved countries. We were told that the organisation knew they had sexually harassed women or behaved inappropriately previously but hoped they would “grow out of it”. Overall there is little understanding on how to change workplace cultures in the aid sector to make them a safe place that values female staff. Although these incidents are nothing new and sexism in the workplace hardly shocking, it is an important next step in the debate on sexual abuse in the sector. If the humanitarian space is to practise what it preaches in terms of gender equality it needs to go further than investigating serious abuse and consider the sexism at the heart of many NGO work cultures.

(Actually, I realise, my mother did neither of these things, but went for the third, discredited approach – emotional blackmail: “One more mouthful, just for me.”) I don’t know if any of this worked, but, along with so many other rules about parenting, in the last 20 years it has been subject to thorough reassessment. Now, if you have a truculent eater, you are advised by paediatricians in the US not to go on about it. You are definitely not supposed to guilt them into eating, or raise the spectre of those less fortunate than them, or do anything at all to suggest that food, in the context of personal consumption, has a moral value and that your child’s relationship with it is indexed to your own emotional response. What this means in practical terms is that you end up chucking out a lot of food and also that you, or at least I, become a sort of pathetic supplicant trying to sneak around the rules. I hear myself sometimes, trilling away like Margo from The Good Life trying to pass off unappetising snacks as sweets. “It’s just like candy!” I’ll say, shoving a piece of freeze-dried mango at my child – or even more tragically, a roast carrot – before walking away in a pantomime show of disinterest. And while I’m relatively relaxed about TV and bedtime, and even managed to stifle a scream when my daughter licked a subway pole the other day, I have become undeniably weird in the way I talk about food. It has become a verbal tic, a kind of incantation along the lines that, as I long as I’m pushing fibrous snacks in their direction, I am keeping them safe from harm. As in so much of parenting and life, the only consolation is to look at other people and think: “Well, at least I’m not doing it like that.” “What’s in Madison’s lunch box?” I’ll ask my daughters slyly when they get back from preschool. “Madison has gummy worms,” says one of them. Oh does she, indeed; well Madison’s mummy hasn’t read the guidelines. Then, after wordlessly taking away the rejected fish fingers and peas, I let my daughter eat two cupcakes for dinner. Save for letting them subsist on a diet of Skittles alone, or making them sit all night until they have finished their sprouts, I have a feeling that in the long run nothing I do will make all that much difference. Most of these rules seem designed to make parents feel as if we have more control than we do. Still, I hope I grow out of it. I have an image of myself, 40 years from now, mumbling: “Dried cranberries, anyone? Half a boiled egg? Guys? Guys? Does anyone want a banana?” • Emma Brockes is a New York-based columnist for the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/23/berlusconi-salvini-united-italian-elections-forza-italia-lega","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T12:55:03Z","webTitle":"Berlusconi v Salvini: the bitter fight for control of Italy's right wing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/23/berlusconi-salvini-united-italian-elections-forza-italia-lega","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/23/berlusconi-salvini-united-italian-elections-forza-italia-lega","fields":{"headline":"Berlusconi v Salvini: the bitter fight for control of Italy's right wing","bodyText":"When Chi magazine published a photograph of Matteo Salvini’s fiancée Elisa Isoardi passionately kissing another man in Ibiza last year – the cover was emblazoned with the words “She loves another!” – it could have been shrugged off as typical tabloid fodder meant to embarrass a politician. In Rome however, it was seen as something else: a hit job by the former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi – who owns Chi – against Salvini, the far-right leader who is also Berlusconi’s key centre-right coalition partner as Italy heads to the polls in national elections next week. Berlusconi and Salvini – who has transformed Lega (League, formerly the Northern League) from a fringe party to a major political force – have since buried the hatchet, presenting a more unified image to voters than their rivals on the left. While Lega historically focused its vitriol on southern Italians, calling them lazy and a drag on the rest of the country, Salvini – who dropped Nord from Lega Nord to distance himself from the party’s secessionist roots – has even gained support in the south with his persistent attacks on African migrants, who he has claimed are invading Italy. Now, with polls showing they have 37% support of the electorate, the centre-right coalition is within sight of securing an absolute majority in parliament. A victory could give Berlusconi, who is the leader of the Forza Italia party, the power to choose the next prime minister of Italy. The 81-year-old is barred from running for office after a tax fraud conviction. The Chi episode highlights the depth of the personal animosity, on top of serious policy differences, between him and Salvini, which raises questions about who would be calling the shots in the event of victory. Will it be Berlusconi’s more moderate positions or Salvini’s far-right populism? At a political rally in 2016, Salvini declared that Lega would never again “be a slave”, least of all to Berlusconi. “Berlusconi is certainly in charge. He is still the master of the party. But depending on the election result, the relative strength on the centre-right will be decided by the vote,” said Stefano Stefanini, a consultant who previously served as Italy’s ambassador to Nato. “Should the League do particularly well, and better than expected, then obviously Salvini will not take instructions from Berlusconi.” Despite his past foibles, tax crimes, and political failures, the man known as Il Cavaliere (the knight) has emerged in the race as a relatively moderate statesman. Berluconi’s resurgence in Italian politics after his resignation from high office in 2013 has been welcomed with relief in Brussels, where he is seen as a predictable leader who can keep Italy’s populist and far-right forces – especially the Eurosceptic and anti-immigrant Salvini – in check. But there are questions about whether Berlusconi will be able to hold his own against Salvini. He is older and weaker than he once was, has avoided campaign rallies in favour of television appearances, and the political environment of today is very different than the one he once mastered. In the run-up to the election, Salvini has predicted that he would be named prime minister after the race. Under their “gentleman’s agreement”, if the centre-right win a majority of votes, whichever party comes out with the most votes within the coalition will name the next prime minister. While voters who support Berlusconi seem confident he can lead with the deft salesman’s touch he always has, he has never had to navigate such a complicated political landscape, in which an increasingly angry, anti-establishment and apparently anti-migrant fervour may drive the electorate to the far right. “We have never seen a case like this. Berlusconi as a spiritual guide, as a kingmaker but not a king,” says Francesco Galietti, the chief executive of the consultancy firm Policy Sonar. “Can he remotely control political actors? Nobody knows. It will depend on the balance within the centre-right coalition.” According to Italy’s notoriously unreliable polls, Forza Italia and the Lega are only between two to four percentage points apart within their alliance, but Berlusconi has claimed that Forza Italia has enough of a lead to deny Salvini a spot in Palazzo Chigi. If Salvini does emerge from Sunday’s vote with an edge over Berlusconi, who has suggested he would potentially name Antonio Tajani, the president of the European parliament, as a prime minister, it would have vast policy implications for Italy, the third largest economy in the eurozone. Berlusconi is critical of Brussels but ultimately supports the EU. He is seen as a leader who would essentially favour the status quo on budget and pension rules and the enactment of jobs legislation signed by the current Democratic administration. While he is a personal friend of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, Stefanini argues that Berlusconi’s foreign policy has always fallen within the mainstream. Salvini, on the other hand, wants to scrap Italy’s retirement age, change pension and budget rules, and has called for upending Italy’s migration and asylum policies as part of his “Italians first” campaign. While both Berlusconi and Salvini support lifting sanctions against Russia, Salvini has positioned himself with the far-right political forces across Europe who are aligned with the Kremlin, from Marine Le Pen in France to Viktor Orbán in Hungary. “If we do get a centre-right government, it will be different than in 1994 or 2011. There was a hegemony there, which was that Forza was in charge and all the others were secondary. That is no longer the case,” says Wolfango Piccoli, the co-president of Teneo Intelligence. “Berlusconi is a one-man show who has always worked through compromise. Salvini sells himself as a disruptor.” Even as Berlusconi has sought to make inroads with Lega by forging ties to Salvini’s rivals within the party, Salvini’s rising star has not been diminished by the former premier. On the campaign trail, Elisa is still at his side."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/feb/22/heathrow-expansion-john-holland-kaye-hits-back-airlines-cost-claims","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T14:04:40Z","webTitle":"Heathrow boss hits back at airlines over expansion cost claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/22/heathrow-expansion-john-holland-kaye-hits-back-airlines-cost-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/feb/22/heathrow-expansion-john-holland-kaye-hits-back-airlines-cost-claims","fields":{"headline":"Heathrow boss hits back at airlines over expansion cost claims","bodyText":"Heathrow has hit back at airlines’ claims that its expansion plans would blow the £14.3bn budget and drive up charges, saying it was looking out for passengers and the local community and not to “protect the self-interest” of British Airways. Airline executives, led by Willie Walsh of BA’s parent company, IAG, told MPs on the transport select committee this week that they should not trust Heathrow and warned that a “grossly off-target” budget could make the airport unaffordable. But Heathrow’s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said he “completely rejected” Walsh’s comments that others could deliver a third runway and new infrastructure cheaper. He insisted that there was still “good collaboration behind the scenes” despite the stance of IAG, which operates more than half of the flights at Heathrow. Holland-Kaye said: “Any airline at any time will complain about airport charges. That’s their main lobbying angle. Our job is not to protect the self-interest of our biggest customers. It’s to balance the interests of passengers, the local community and investors – not just protect the dominant customer.” He said charges were a small part of the price passengers pay, adding: “Bring in more capacity and competition will bring fares down.” Airlines have urged MPs to make a freeze on charges a condition of approving Heathrow’s expansion ahead of a vote in parliament due this summer. But Holland-Kaye said: “Look at the mess Carillion found themselves in by guaranteeing fixed costs they couldn’t deliver. It’s way too early. We said will keep costs close to current levels: that is a fantastic offer.” He added: “Airlines were clear that Heathrow is the answer and they won’t go to Gatwick if [the third runway] doesn’t happen, they will go abroad.” While record numbers of passengers (78 million) used Heathrow in 2017, Holland-Kaye said it was still losing out to competitors such as Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam. The possible relocation of Unilever’s headquarters to the Netherlands was “a vivid reminder”, he said. “When Heathrow was best connected in the world a lot of companies wanted to come here ... Brexit draws into sharp focus just how critical it is to have successful hub airport.” Separately, Stansted has announced plans to expand its capacity to 43 million passengers a year. The Essex airport expects to hit its current permitted limit of 35 million early in the next decade, following rapid growth to 26 million in 2017 and long-haul flights to the US and the Gulf starting this year. It has submitted a planning application to raise the cap, which it says can be achieved at current limits on flights and noise with quieter, larger aircraft.

That bird forever feathered, Of its new self the sire, After aeons weathered, Reincarnate by fire, Falcon may not nor eagle Swerve from his eyrie, Nor any crumb inveigle Down to an earthly tree. That fish of the dread regime Invented to become The fable and the dream Of the Lord’s aquarium, Leviathan, the jointed Harpoon was never wrought By which the Lord’s anointed Will suffer to be caught. Bird of the deathless breast, Fish of the frantic fin, That bright chimeric beast Flashing the argent skin, – If beasts like these you’d harry, Plumb then the poet’s dream; Make it your aviary, Make it your wood and stream. There only shall the swish Be heard of the regal fish; There like a golden knife Dart the feet of the unicorn, And there, death brought to life, The dead bird be reborn. Countee Cullen (1903-46) was one of the most talented writers of the Harlem Renaissance. This week’s poem was first published in the New Republic in 1929, and demonstrates how strongly Cullen was energised by the language and symbols of Romanticism. By this point, he was acclaimed by both black and white readerships, married to the daughter of the eminent African American scholar and activist WEB DuBois, and the recipient in the previous year of a Guggenheim fellowship enabling him to write in France. Nevertheless, he kept faith, as and when he chose, with an early influence and role model, John Keats. The unicorn in stanza one probably enters through the door of Endymion, in which there’s a short passage concerning a unicorn hunt. Judeo-Christianity is another of the poem’s sources, and one of the means by which Cullen fashions something new out of the classicist Keatsian tradition. There is the appearance of “that fish of the dread regime”, Leviathan, in stanza three, and the suggestion of God in a poet-like role of playful inventor. Throughout the poem, the four-square rhythms of the hymnal resound in the three-beat lines, although with a more fluid and variegated melody. The paradox of the beast “conceived but never born” seems at least grammatically related to the theological tradition of the Son of God as “begotten, not created” and there’s a celebratory, almost nativity-like mood at the start of the poem. Something magical has arrived and taken up residence, though not in the manger but “in the poet’s breast”. “The white-flanked unicorn” of the fourth line should be read as the subject of that stanza – the “bright chimeric beast” itself. In proclaiming the creature sacrosanct, Cullen is declaring his own rights to a sheltered poetic space. The unicorn of imagination – and, importantly, his solitude – will not be violated by “earthly” demands. Cullen’s syntax is convoluted and seems almost to build a physical shelter for these beleaguered magical creatures. “That bird forever feathered” must be the phoenix, but its anonymity seems like a device helping ensure its preservation. The sentence keeps us waiting; then in line six all is revealed. “Swerve” is a transitive verb, the phoenix being the object that will not be moved by the circlings of the falcon and eagle. The eyrie, as I read it, is the imaginary refuge of the phoenix. The third stanza brings us to the Leviathan of the Old Testament. Cullen’s rhyme of “jointed” and “anointed” is powerful. The biblical grandeur of the phrase “the Lord’s anointed” and the reference to the cruel design of the harpoon evoke Melville in miniature, and connect the mythical monster to vulnerable flesh and blood. There is a sense of Leviathan’s near-capture later, in the image of the “frantic fin”. All the creatures are objects of pursuit; all are animated, located and given sentience. But Cullen’s generous imagination desires and seems to ensure salvation all round, for the hunters as well as the hunted. He issues a challenge in the fourth stanza: “If beasts like these you’d harry, / Plumb then the poet’s dream.” This may be directed to his critics, a response, perhaps, to expectations that he should be a certain kind of poet, and that kind only. But the tone then softens, as if the critics were being invited into that same non-violent space that shelters the imagination. “Make it your aviary, / Make it your wood and stream.” A shortened last stanza gives two lines to each creature, with a nicely onomatopoeic couplet to Leviathan. The great creature can relax, and “swish” his vast length as he pleases. The silver unicorn will cut through the undergrowth on golden feet, and the phoenix will be self-resurrected. While Cullen wrote many poems more trenchantly concerned with social comment, and they tend to be his best known, the concept he defends here, of an inalienable human right to poetic freedom, was central to his political thought, too. That bright chimeric thing is also, perhaps, the pluralist vision he sustained over the course of a career that, though varied in range, was fundamentally unified."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2018/feb/24/stelios-easy-isa-investment","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-24T09:14:20Z","webTitle":"Stelios Haji-Ioannou’s new ‘easyIsa’ offers a 4% return","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/feb/24/stelios-easy-isa-investment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/feb/24/stelios-easy-isa-investment","fields":{"headline":"Stelios Haji-Ioannou’s new ‘easyIsa’ offers a 4% return","bodyText":"His business empire spans everything from low-cost flights, hotels and buses to coffee shops, dog-walking and groceries. Now Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou is moving into the world of savings and investment with an Isa paying a headline-grabbing 4.05%. But this is far from a risk-free investment. The billionaire founder of easyJet is launching (or rather, relaunching) a financial services arm called – what else? – easyMoney, and the Isa being unveiled on Saturday is the first of many planned products. EasyMoney is hoping to grab a slice of the billions of pounds languishing in poorly paying savings accounts. Haji-Ioannou says: “We’re offering something new and taking on the big boys.” On the face of it, the tycoon’s intervention will deliver a welcome boost to what was expected to be another lacklustre Isa season. Things have been pretty grim for Britain’s savers, with many desperate to find ways to boost their finances. But lots of people will wonder what sort of Isa this is, where the money goes, and what are the risks? The first thing to make clear is that the new easyMoney account isn’t a cash Isa, nor is it a stocks and shares one. Instead, this is what’s called an “innovative finance” Isa – one of the latest additions to the individual savings account family. The innovative finance Isa contains peer-to-peer (P2P) loans where lenders (the people who will be giving easyMoney their cash) are matched online with borrowers, while cutting out the banks. EasyMoney says it can offer access to “far higher” returns than cash Isas from high street banks because it gives investors access to loans secured against UK property. It adds that it “diversifies investors into multiple property-backed P2P loans”, all of which are secured by a first legal charge. A spokesman says easyMoney is not piggybacking on an existing peer-to-peer website – it will write its own lending, and there will be no minimum investment. But take note: that 4.05% is a “target” rate. Returns are not guaranteed and your capital is at risk. Crucially, people’s investments aren’t protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Intriguingly, the press release from Haji-Ioannou’s easyGroup is headlined “easyMoney launches in UK”, but the serial entrepreneur surely hasn’t forgotten this is actually the second outing for the brand. In August 2001 he unveiled easyMoney, which initially focused on credit cards before moving into products such as motor insurance. In recent years the brand seems to have gone quiet. A spokesman says: “There is no link between this business and the easyMoney credit card brand.” It is also worth remembering that since creating budget airline easyJet in 1995 when he was just 28 years old, Haji-Ioannou has had his ups and downs. Several of his ventures have been profitable, but easyCinema failed, and easyInternetcafe lost more than £100m. However, Andrew de Candole, chief executive of easyMoney, says financial services in the UK “are in desperate need of a shake-up” and the Isa market “is crying out for someone to give everyday investors more for their money”. The spokesman says the “easyIsa” is aimed at investors “who have had enough of the poor interest rates offered by cash Isas, and are nervous about the potential volatility of most stocks and shares Isas”. The new easyMoney venture is the trading name of a firm called E-Money Capital, which is authorised and regulated by the FCA. The spokesman says E-Money Capital “is simply the name of the corporate entity of easyMoney … It only operates easyMoney and nothing else.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/feb/23/art-weekly-tate-britain-freud-bacon-lorna-simpson-jasmina-cibic","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T16:35:10Z","webTitle":"The world according to Jet magazine and a century of bodywork – the week in art","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/feb/23/art-weekly-tate-britain-freud-bacon-lorna-simpson-jasmina-cibic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/feb/23/art-weekly-tate-britain-freud-bacon-lorna-simpson-jasmina-cibic","fields":{"headline":"The world according to Jet magazine and a century of bodywork – the week in art","bodyText":"Exhibition of the week All Too Human: Bacon, Freud and a Century of Painting Life The genius of Lucian Freud and his meaty friend Francis Bacon seen in a context of British “figurative” art from Sickert to Paula Rego and beyond. • Tate Britain, London, 28 February to 27 August Murillo: The Self Portraits This 17th-century Spanish painter’s self portraits are haunting metaphysical meditations on fame, time and death. • National Gallery, London, 28 February to 21 May Lorna Simpson: Unanswerable Surreal collages and dreamlike paintings that reuse old Ebony and Jet magazines to explore African American identity. • Hauser and Wirth, London, 1 March to 28 April In the Land Hepworth, Nicholson, Piper ... it’s the usual suspects in a survey of landscape in mid-20th-century British art. • Whitworth, Manchester, until 28 October Jasmina Cibic: This Machine Builds Nations The politics of modernist design explored in a trilogy of films entitled Nada, shown in a specially created installation. • Baltic, Gateshead, until 28 May Masterpiece of the Week The Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian, completed in 1475, by Antonio and Piero del Pollaiuolo The human body is good to paint, especially when it is suffering. Francis Bacon knew that and so did the Pollaiuolo brothers, who created this visceral image of torture at a time when the nude had only recently been revived as an artistic theme after centuries of censorship. They painted this altarpiece for the church of Santissima Annunziata in Florence, whose possession of a “miraculous” medieval painting gave it a special association with artists and made it the perfect place to demonstrate the very latest techniques. What this shocking picture does is dramatise and eroticise the male nude by having soldiers fire phallic arrows into Sebastian’s bare flesh at close range. Every detail, from their crossbows to the perspective of the landscape, is state of the art for 1470s Florence. This painting takes us to the bloody heart of the Renaissance.

The original painting it depicts is at least 64,000 years old, though it is unclear whether the animals and other symbols were painted later. In what was described as a “major breakthrough in the field of human evolution”, scientists said that Neanderthals had painted on cave walls in Spain tens of thousands of years before modern humans arrived.

The story detailed how one team employee had a history of violence against women within the organization while former CEO Terdema Ussery was alleged to have sexually harassed a number of colleagues. One former department head said there was “built-in protection for a lot of men” within the team. None of the allegations were against the playing staff. “It’s tough,” Nowitzki said on Thursday. “It’s very disappointing. It’s heartbreaking. I’m glad it’s all coming out. I was disgusted when I read the article, obviously, as everybody was. I was shocked about some of the stuff.” Nowitzki, a 13-time All Star with the Mavs, said he believed team owner Mark Cuban would address the issue. “[It’s] really, really disappointed that our franchise, that my franchise, that stuff like that was going on. It’s very sad and disappointing. But I think [Cuban] is trying to step up and lead this franchise to the right direction, and that is hiring investigators, finding out all the little details that we have to know as a franchise what really was going on. I think Mark is going to step up here. “As a franchise, obviously, we feel bad for the victims and for what happened to some of these ladies. Like I said, it’s truly, truly disgusting. Our thoughts and prayers are definitely with some of these victims.” The Mavericks have launched an independent investigation into the allegations, led by Krutoy Law. The New York firm is headed by Evan Krutoy, a specialist in sex crimes. “They’re going to do a very in-depth investigation,” Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. “They’re going to talk to everybody in the organization, and they’re going to find out the how, the why and the best way to resolve this. An outside party was brought in so there would be no local influence or anything like that. And these people are the best of the best.” Cuban admitted he had made a mistake in not firing Earl K Sneed, the employee with a history of domestic violence. “I want to be clear: I’m not putting the blame on anybody else,” Cuban told ESPN. “It came down to my final decision that I made.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"news/2018/feb/23/oxford-english-dictionary-can-worlds-biggest-dictionary-survive-internet","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T06:00:39Z","webTitle":"Inside the OED: can the world’s biggest dictionary survive the internet?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/feb/23/oxford-english-dictionary-can-worlds-biggest-dictionary-survive-internet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/feb/23/oxford-english-dictionary-can-worlds-biggest-dictionary-survive-internet","fields":{"headline":"Inside the OED: can the world’s biggest dictionary survive the internet?","bodyText":"In February 2009, a Twitter user called @popelizbet issued an apparently historic challenge to someone called Colin: she asked if he could “mansplain” a concept to her. History has not recorded if he did, indeed, proceed to mansplain. But the lexicographer Bernadette Paton, who excavated this exchange last summer, believed it was the first time anyone had used the word in recorded form. “It’s been deleted since, but we caught it,” Paton told me, with quiet satisfaction. In her office at Oxford University Press, Paton was drafting a brand new entry for the Oxford English Dictionary. Also in her in-tray when I visited were the millennial-tinged usage of “snowflake”, which she had hunted down to a Christian text from 1983 (“You are a snowflake. There are no two of you alike”), and new shadings of the compound “self-made woman”. Around 30,000 such items are on the OED master list; another 7,000 more pile up annually. “Everyone thinks we’re very slow, but it’s actually rather fast,” Paton said. “Though admittedly a colleague did spend a year revising ‘go’”. Spending 12 months tracing the history of a two-letter word seems dangerously close to folly. But the purpose of a historical dictionary such as the OED is to give such questions the solemnity they deserve. An Oxford lexicographer might need to snoop on Twitter spats from a decade ago; or they might have to piece together a painstaking biography of one of the oldest verbs in the language (the revised entry for “go” traces 537 separate senses over 1,000 years). “Well, we have to get things right,” the dictionary’s current chief editor, Michael Proffitt, told me. At one level, few things are simpler than a dictionary: a list of the words people use or have used, with an explanation of what those words mean, or have meant. At the level that matters, though – the level that lexicographers fret and obsess about – few things could be more complex. Who used those words, where and when? How do you know? Which words do you include, and on what basis? How do you tease apart this sense from that? And what is “English” anyway? In the case of a dictionary such as the OED – which claims to provide a “definitive” record of every single word in the language from 1000AD to the present day – the question is even larger: can a living language be comprehensively mapped, surveyed and described? Speaking to lexicographers makes one wary of using the word “literally”, but a definitive dictionary is, literally, impossible. No sooner have you reached the summit of the mountain than it has expanded another hundred feet. Then you realise it’s not even one mountain, but an interlocking series of ranges marching across the Earth. (In the age of “global English”, the metaphor seems apt.) Even so, the quest to capture “the meaning of everything” – as the writer Simon Winchester described it in his book on the history of the OED – has absorbed generations of lexicographers, from the Victorian worthies who set up a “Committee to collect unregistered words in English” to the OED’s first proper editor, the indefatigable James Murray, who spent 36 years shepherding the first edition towards publication (before it killed him). The dream of the perfect dictionary goes back to the Enlightenment notion that by classifying and regulating language one could – just perhaps – distil the essence of human thought. In 1747, in his “Plan” for the English dictionary that he was about to commence, Samuel Johnson declared he would create nothing less than “a dictionary by which the pronunciation of our language may be fixed, and its attainment facilitated; by which its purity may be preserved, its use ascertained, and its duration lengthened”. English would not be merely listed in alphabetical order; it would be saved for eternity. Ninety years after the first edition appeared, the OED – a distant, far bulkier descendant of Johnson’s Dictionary – is currently embarked on a third edition, a goliath project that involves overhauling every entry (many of which have not been touched since the late-Victorian era) and adding at least some of those 30,000 missing words, as well as making the dictionary into a fully digital resource. This was originally meant to be completed in 2000, then 2005, then 2010. Since then, OUP has quietly dropped mentions of a date. How far had they got, I asked Proffitt. “About 48%,” he replied. The dictionary retains a quiet pride in the lexical lengths to which it will – indeed, must – go. Some time in the late 1980s, Proffitt’s predecessor as chief editor, John Simpson, asked the poet Benjamin Zephaniah about the origins of the noun “skanking”. Zephaniah decided that the only way to explain was to come to OED headquarters and do a private, one-on-one performance. Skanking duly went in, defined as “a style of West Indian dancing to reggae music, in which the body bends forward at the waist, and the knees are raised and the hands claw the air in time to the beat”. The tale touches something profound: in capturing a word, a sliver of lived experience can be observed and defined. If only you were able to catch all the words, perhaps you could define existence. * * * The first English dictionary-makers had no fantasies about capturing an entire culture. In contrast to languages such as Chinese and ancient Greek, where systematic, dictionary-like works have existed for millennia, the earliest English lexicons didn’t begin to be assembled until the 16th century. They were piecemeal affairs, as befitted the language’s mongrel inheritance – a jumbled stew of old Anglo-Germanic, Norse, Latin and Greek, and Norman French. The language was perplexing enough, but in the mid-1500s it was getting ever more confusing, as political upheavals and colonial trade brought fresh waves of immigration, and with it a babel of recently “Englished” vocabulary: words such as “alcohol” (Arabic via Latin, c1543) and “abandonment” (French, c1593). Scientific and medical developments added to the chaos. In 1582, the schoolmaster Richard Mulcaster issued a frantic plea for someone to “gather all the wordes which we use in our English tung … into one dictionarie”. Such a book would stabilise spelling, a source of violent disagreement. Also, there would finally be rules for “proper use”. In 1604, a clergyman named Robert Cawdrey attempted a stopgap solution: a slender book entitled A Table Alphabeticall. Aimed at “Ladies, gentlewomen and other unskillful persons”, it listed approximately 2,500 “hard usuall words”, less than 5% of the lexis in use at the time. Definitions were vague – “diet” is described as “manner of foode” – and there were no illustrative quotations, still less any attempt at etymology. A Table Alphabeticall was so far from being completist that there weren’t even entries for the letter W. Lexicographers kept trying to do better – and mostly kept failing. A new “word book” edited by John Bullokar appeared in 1616 (5,000 words); another by Henry Cockeram in 1623 (8,000 words and the first to call itself a “dictionary”); yet another by Thomas Blount in 1656 (11,000 words). But no one could seem to capture “all the wordes” in English, still less agree on what those words meant. The language was expanding more rapidly than ever. Where would you even start? Comprehensive dictionaries had already been produced in French, Italian and Spanish; Britain’s failure to get its house in order was becoming an international embarrassment. In 1664, the Royal Society formed a 22-person committee for “improving the English language”, only to disband after a few meetings. In 1712, Jonathan Swift published a pamphlet on the subject, pouring scorn on sloppy usage and insisting that “some Method should be thought on for ascertaining and fixing our Language for ever” – arguing that English should not merely be exhaustively surveyed, but that its users should be forced to obey some rules. This task defeated everyone, too. It wasn’t until 1746, when a consortium of publishers managed to convince Samuel Johnson to take on this “great and arduous post”, that it seemed remotely likely to be completed. Johnson’s Dictionary, eventually finished in 1755, was a heroic achievement. He corralled 43,500-odd words – perhaps 80% of the language in use at the time. But in some eyes, not least the editor’s, the book was also a heroic failure. In contrast to the jaunty Enlightenment optimism of his 1747 Plan, with its talk of “fixing” and “preservation”, the preface to the published Dictionary is a work of chastened realism. Johnson explains that the idea of taming a fast-evolving creature such as the English language is not only impossible, but risible: “We laugh at the elixir that promises to prolong life to a thousand years; and with equal justice may the lexicographer be derided, who being able to produce no example of a nation that has preserved their words and phrases from mutability, shall imagine that his dictionary can embalm his language, and secure it from corruption and decay.” Much as lexicographers might fantasise about capturing and fixing meaning – as Johnson had once fantasised – a living language will always outrun them. * * * Still, the dream lingered. What if one could get to 100% – lassoing the whole of English, from the beginning of written time to the present day? Numerous revisions or rivals to Johnson were proposed, though few were actually created. After a Connecticut schoolteacher named Noah Webster published his American Dictionary of the English Language in 1828 (70,000 entries), British pride was once again at stake. In November 1857, the members of the London Philological Society convened to hear a paper by Richard Chenevix Trench, the dean of Westminster, entitled “On Some Deficiencies in our English Dictionaries”. It was a bombshell: Trench argued that British word banks were so unreliable that the slate needed to be wiped clean. In their place, he outlined “a true idea of a Dictionary”. This Platonic resource should be compiled on scholarly historical lines, mining deep into the caverns of the language for ancient etymology. It should describe rather than prescribe, casting an impartial eye on everything from Anglo-Saxon monosyllables to the latest technical jargon (though Trench drew the line at regional dialect). Most of all, it should be comprehensive, honouring what Trench called – glancing jealously at Germany, where the brothers Grimm had recently started work on a Deutsches Wörterbuch – “our native tongue”. The quest to capture the language in its entirety may have been centuries old, but, like a great railway line or bridge, this new dictionary would be thoroughly Victorian: scientific, audacious, epic and hugely expensive. Building it was a patriotic duty, Trench insisted: “A dictionary is a historical monument, the history of a nation”. For the first two decades, the New English Dictionary, as it was called, looked as if it would go the way of so many previous projects. The first editor died a year in, leaving chaos in his wake. The second had more energy for young women, socialism, folksong and cycling. Only after it was taken over by Oxford University Press, who in 1879 were persuaded to appoint a little-known Scottish schoolteacher and philologist called James Murray as chief editor, did things begin to move. Murray’s masterstroke was to put out an “appeal” in newspapers and library books for volunteer readers to search for quotations, which would illustrate the ways words changed over time – a “corpus” of data that would make the dictionary as accurate as possible. More than 2,000 enthusiasts from across the world and all walks of life assembled some 5m quotations to feed Murray’s team of lexicographers as they churned through the alphabet, defining words as they went. Even when it became evident that it would all take far, far longer than scheduled – after five years they were still halfway through the letter A – Murray kept the dictionary going. “It would have been impossible without him,” says the lexicographer and OED historian Peter Gilliver. The first part was published in 1884, A to Ant, and instalments emerged at regular intervals for the next 40-odd years. Although Murray died in 1915 – somewhere between “Turndun” and “Tzirid” – the machine churned on. In 1928, the finished dictionary was eventually published: some 414,800 headwords and phrases in 10 volumes, each with a definition, etymology and 1.8m quotations tracking usage over time. It was one of the largest books ever made, in any language: had you laid the metal type used end to end, it would have stretched from London to Manchester. Sixty years late it may have been, but the publisher made the most of the achievement, trumpeting that “the Oxford Dictionary is the supreme authority, and without a rival”. * * * Yet if you knew where to look, its flaws were only too obvious. By the time it was published in 1928, this Victorian leviathan was already hopelessly out of date. The A-C entries were compiled nearly 50 years earlier; others relied on scholarship that had long been surpassed, especially in technology and science. In-house, it was admitted that the second half of the alphabet (M-Z) was stronger than the first (A-L); the letter E was regarded as especially weak. Among other eccentricities, Murray had taken against “marzipan”, preferring to spell it “marchpane”, and decreed that the adjective “African” should not be included, on the basis that it was not really a word. “American”, however, was, for reasons that reveal much about the dictionary’s lofty Anglocentric worldview. The only solution was to patch it up. The first Supplement to the OED came out in 1933, compiling new words that editors had noted in the interim, as well as original omissions. Supplements to that Supplement were begun in 1957, eventually appearing in four instalments between 1972 and 1986 – some 69,300 extra items in all. Yet it was a losing battle, or a specialised form of Zeno’s paradox: the closer that OED lexicographers got to the finish line, the more distant that finish line seemed to be. At the same time, the ground beneath their feet was beginning to give way. By the late 1960s, a computer-led approach known as “corpus linguistics” was forcing lexicographers to re-examine their deepest assumptions about the way language operates. Instead of making dictionaries the old-fashioned way – working from pre-existing lists of words/definitions, and searching for evidence that a word means what you think it does – corpus linguistics turns the process on its head: you use digital technology to hoover up language as real people write and speak it, and make dictionaries from that. The first modern corpus, the Brown Corpus of Standard American English, was compiled in 1964 and included 1m words, sampled from 500 texts including romance novels, religious tracts and books of “popular lore” – contemporary, everyday sources that dictionary-makers had barely consulted, and which it had never been possible to examine en masse. The general-language corpora that provide raw material for today’s dictionaries contain tens of billions of words, a database beyond the wildest imaginings of lexicographers even a generation ago. There are no limits to the corpora that can be constructed: at a corpus linguistics conference in Birmingham last year, I watched researchers eavesdrop on college-age Twitter users (emojis have long since made “laughter forms” such as LOL and ROFL redundant, apparently) and comb through English judges’ sentencing remarks for evidence of gender bias (all too present). For lexicographers, what’s really thrilling about corpus linguistics is the way it lets you spy on language in the wild. Collating the phrases in which a word occurs enables you to unravel different shades of meaning. Observing how a word is “misused” hints that its centre of gravity might be shifting. Comparing representative corpora lets you see, for example, how often Trump supporters deploy a noun such as “liberty”, and how differently the word is used in the Black Lives Matter movement. “It’s completely changed what we do,” the lexicographer Michael Rundell told me. “It’s very bottom-up. You have to rethink almost everything.” But while other dictionary publishers leapt on corpus linguistics, OED editors stuck to what they knew, resisting computerisation and relying on quotation slips and researchers in university libraries. In the 1970s and 80s there was little thought of overhauling this grandest of historical dictionaries, let alone keeping it up to date: it was as much as anyone could do to plug the original holes. When the OED’s second edition was published in March 1989 – 20 volumes, containing 291,500 entries and 2.4m quotations – there were complaints that this wasn’t really a new edition at all, just a nicely typeset amalgam of the old ones. The entry for “computer” defined it as “a calculating-machine; esp an automatic electronic device for performing mathematical or logical operations”. It was illustrated by a quotation from a 1897 journal. By astonishing coincidence, another earthquake, far bigger, struck the very same month that OED2 appeared in print: a proposal by an English computer scientist named Tim Berners-Lee for “a large hypertext database with typed links”. The world wide web, as it came to be called (OED dates the phrase to 1990), offered a shining path to the lexicographical future. Databases could be shared, and connected to one another; whole libraries of books could be scanned and their contents made searchable. The sum of human text was starting to become available to anyone with a computer and a modem. The possibilities were dizzying. In a 1989 article in the New Yorker, an OUP executive said, with a shiver of excitement, that if the dictionary could incorporate corpus linguistics resources properly, something special could be achieved: “a Platonic concept – the ideal database”. It was the same ideal laid out by Richard Chevenix Trench 132 years before: the English language over a thousand or more years, every single word of it, brought to light. * * * The fact that so much text is now available online has been the most cataclysmic change. Words that would previously have been spoken are now typed on social media. Lexicographers of slang have long dreamed of being able to track variant forms “down to the level, say, of an individual London tower block”, says the slang expert and OED consultant Jonathon Green; now, via Facebook or Instagram, this might actually be possible. Lexicographers can be present almost at the moment of word-birth: where previously a coinage such as “mansplain” would have had to find its way into a durable printed record, which a researcher could use as evidence of its existence, it is now available near-instantly to anyone. Anyone, and anywhere – when the OED was first dreamed up in the 1850s, English was a language of the British Isles, parts of North America, and a scattering of colonies. These days, nearly a quarter of the world’s population, 1.5bn people, speak some English, mostly as a second language – except, of course, that it isn’t one language. There are myriad regional variants, from the patois spoken in the West Indies and Pidgin forms of West Africa to a brood of compound offspring – Wenglish (Welsh English), Indlish or Hinglish (Indian/Hindi English), and the “Chinglish” of Hong Kong and Macau. All of these Englishes are more visible now than ever, each cross-fertilising others at greater and greater speed. “The circle of the English language has a well-defined centre but no discernible circumference,” James Murray once wrote, but modern lexicographers beg to differ. Instead of one centre, there are many intersecting subgroups, each using a variety of Englishes, inflected by geographical background or heritage, values, other languages, and an almost incalculable number of variables. And the circumference is expanding faster than ever. If OED lexicographers are right that around 7,000 new English words surface annually – a mixture of brand-new coinages and words the dictionary has missed – then in the time you’ve been reading this, perhaps two more words have come into being. Most people, of course, now never go near a dictionary, but simply type phrases into Wikipedia (used more often as a dictionary than an encyclopedia, research suggests) or rely on Google, which – through a deal with Oxford Dictionaries – offers thumbnail definitions, audio recordings of pronunciations, etymology, a graph of usage over time and translation facilities. If you want to know what a word means, you can just yell something at Siri or Alexa. Dictionaries have been far too slow to adjust, argues Jane Solomon of Dictionary.com. “Information-retrieval is changing so fast,” she said. “Why don’t dictionaries respond intelligently to the semantic or user context, like figuring out that you’re searching for food words, and give you related vocabulary or recipes?” And not just words: “I’d love to include emojis; people are so creative with them. They’ve become a whole separate language. People sometimes need explanation; if you send your daughter the eggplant emoji, she might think that’s weird.” Some have dared to dream even bigger than polysemous aubergines. One is a computer professor at the Sapienza University of Rome called Roberto Navigli, who in 2013 soft-launched a site called Babelnet, which aims to be the dictionary to beat all dictionaries – in part by not really being a dictionary at all. Described as a “semantic network” that pulls together 15 existing resources including Wikipedia, Wiktionary and Microsoft Terminology, it aims to create a comprehensive, hierarchical root map of not just English but of 271 languages simultaneously, making it the largest lexicon/encyclopedia/thesaurus/reference work on the web. Navigli told me that his real aim was to use “semantic technology” to enable the holy grail for software engineers everywhere: autonomous machine-reading of text. “This is the dream, right?” he said. “The machine that can read text and understand everything we say.” Machines already understand a lot, of course. Some have talked of “culturomics”, a form of computational lexicology that uses corpus tools to analyse and forecast trends in human behaviour. A 31-month study of Twitter tried to measure the shifting sentiments of the British population about austerity, and there is even a claim – somewhat disputed – that a “passively crowd-sourced” study of global media could have foretold the Arab spring. At least on a large scale, computers, and the information giants who own and lease the data, may be able to comprehend language better than we comprehend it ourselves. For lexicographers and Google alike, one linguistic frontier remains stubbornly inaccessible. Whereas it’s now easy to assemble written-text corpora and open a window on how language functions in a particular environment, doing so for spoken language has always been far harder. The reason is obvious: recording speech, then transcribing it and creating a usable database, is both time-consuming and hugely expensive. Speech corpora do exist, but are notoriously small and unrepresentative (it’s easy to work with court transcripts; far harder to eavesdrop on what lawyers say down the pub). For lexicographers, speech is the most precious resource of all, and the most elusive. If you could capture large samples of it – people speaking in every context imaginable, from playgrounds to office canteens to supermarkets – you could monitor even more accurately how we use language, day to day. “If we cracked the technology for transcribing normal conversations,” Michael Rundell said, “it really would be a game-changer.” * * * For OED’s editors, this world is both exhilarating and, one senses, mildly overwhelming. The digital era has enabled Oxford lexicographers to run dragnets deeper and deeper through the language, but it has also threatened to capsize the operation. When you’re making a historical dictionary and are required to check each and every resource, then recheck those resources when, say, a corpus of handwritten 17th-century letters comes on stream, the problem of keeping the dictionary up to date expands to even more nightmarish proportions. Adding to that dictionary to accommodate new words – themselves visible in greater numbers than ever before, mutating ever-faster – increases the nightmare exponentially. “In the early years of digital, we were a little out of control,” Peter Gilliver told me. “It’s never-ending,” one OED lexicographer agreed. “You can feel like you’re falling into the wormhole.” Adding to the challenge is a story that has become wearily familiar: while more people are consulting dictionary-like resources than ever, almost no one wants to shell out. Sales of hard-copy dictionaries have collapsed, far more calamitously than in other sectors. (OUP refused to give me figures, citing “commercial sensitivities”. “I don’t think you’ll get any publisher to fess up about this,” Michael Rundell told me.) While reference publishers amalgamate or go to the wall, information giants such as Google and Apple get fat by using our own search terms to sell us stuff. If you can get a definition by holding your thumb over a word on your smartphone, why bother picking up a book? “Go to a dictionary conference these days and you see scared-looking people,” Rundell said. Although he trained as a lexicographer, he now mainly works as a consultant, advising publishers on how to use corpus-based resources. “It used to be a career,” he went on. “But there just aren’t the jobs there were 30 years ago.” He pointed to his shelves, which were strikingly bare. “But then I’m not sentimental about print; I gave most of my dictionaries away.” Even if the infrastructure around lexicography has fallen away or been remade entirely, some things stay pleasingly consistent. Every lexicographer I spoke to made clear their distaste for “word-lovers”, who in the dictionary world are regarded as the type of person liable to scrawl “fewer” on to supermarket signs reading “10 items or less”, or recite “antidisestablishmentarianism” to anyone who will listen. The normally genial John Simpson writes crisply that “I take the hardline view that language is not there to be ‘enjoyed’”; instead, it is there to be used. But love is, most grudgingly admit, what draws people to spend their lives sifting and analysing language. It takes a particular sort of human to be a “word detective”: something between a linguistics academic, an archival historian, a journalist and an old-fashioned gumshoe. Though hardly without its tensions – corpus linguists versus old-school dictionary-makers, stats nerds versus scholarly etymologists – lexicography seems to be one specialist profession with a lingering sense of common purpose: us against that ever-expanding, multi-headed hydra, the English language. “It is pretty obsessive-compulsive,” Jane Solomon said. The idea of making a perfect linguistic resource was one most lexicographers knew was folly, she continued. “I’ve learned too much about past dictionaries to have that as a personal goal.” But then, part of the thrill of being a lexicographer is knowing that the work will never be done. English is always metamorphosing, mutating, evolving; its restless dynamism is what makes it so absorbing. “It’s always on the move,” said Solomon. “You have to love that.” There are other joys, too: the thrill of catching a new sense, or crafting a definition that feels, if not perfect, at least right. “It sounds cheesy, but it can be like poetry,” Michael Rundell reflected. “Making a dictionary is as much an art as a craft.” Despite his pessimism about the industry, he talked with real excitement about a project he was about to join, working with experts from the Goldfield Aboriginal Language Centre on indigenous Australian languages, scantily covered by lexicographers. “Dictionaries can make a genuine difference,” he said. “They give power to languages that might have had very little power in the past; they can help preserve and share it. I really believe that.” Throughout it all, OED churns on, attempting to be ever so slightly more complete today than it was yesterday or the day before. The dictionary team now prefer to refer to it as a “moving document”. Words are only added; they are never deleted. When I suggested to Michael Proffitt that it resembled a proud but leaky Victorian warship whose crew were trying to keep out the leaks and simultaneously keep it on course, he looked phlegmatic. “I used to say it was like painting the Forth bridge, never-ending. But then they stopped – a new kind of paint, I think.” He paused. “Now it’s just us.” These days OED issues online updates four times a year; though it has not officially abandoned the idea of another print edition, that idea is fading. Seven months after I first asked how far they had got into OED3, I enquired again; the needle had crept up to 48.7%. “We are going to get it done,” Proffitt insisted, though as I departed Oxford, I thought James Murray might have raised a thin smile at that. If the update does indeed take until 2037, it will rival the 49 years it took the original OED to be created, whereupon it will presumably need overhauling all over again. A few days ago, I emailed to see if “mansplain” had finally reached the OED. It had, but there was a snag – further research had pushed the word back a crucial six months, from February 2009 to August 2008. Then, no sooner had Paton’s entry gone live in January than someone emailed to point out that even this was inaccurate: they had spotted “mansplain” on a May 2008 blog post, just a month after the writer Rebecca Solnit had published her influential essay Men Explain Things to Me. The updated definition, Proffitt assured me, will be available as soon as possible. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/feb/23/why-alan-partridge-is-returning-to-restrictive-stifling-bbc","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T12:25:31Z","webTitle":"Why Alan Partridge is returning to 'restrictive, stifling' BBC","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/23/why-alan-partridge-is-returning-to-restrictive-stifling-bbc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/23/why-alan-partridge-is-returning-to-restrictive-stifling-bbc","fields":{"headline":"Why Alan Partridge is returning to 'restrictive, stifling' BBC","bodyText":"It is fair to say that the TV presenter and North Norfolk Digital radio DJ, Alan Partridge, and his former employer, the BBC, did not part on the best terms. He once wrote that he hoped for a world without “famine and war and the BBC”. So it has come as a surprise to many TV industry watchers that the character, played by Steve Coogan, has been given a second chance with the broadcaster, some 27 years after his BBC debut. Partridge’s new show, This Time with Alan Partridge, a current affairs series, began filming this month. It will be a heady mix of consumer affairs, highbrow interviews and lightweight froth, the BBC says. It’s the latest step in Partridge’s evolution from chatshow host to heavyweight broadcaster. His most recent documentary, Scissored Isle, for Sky in 2016, looked at the divide between the “haves and the have-nots, or haven’ts”. Coogan, who created Partridge along with director Armando Ianucci and writer Patrick Marber in Radio 4’s On The Hour in 1991, has said the new series will cover Britain in the age of Brexit, something Partridge almost certainly voted for. “I think if he had a pint with Nigel Farage they’d get on like a house on fire,” Coogan said this week. Partridge has weighed in on Brexit before. Last year, in a debate for the Big Issue magazine, he said: “You hear a lot of grumbling from ReMOANers [whether teenagers, the Guardian or whoever] but when push comes to shove, the Leavers were in the majority.” It is an unusual move by the BBC to rehabilitate a character with a past record of sexism, homophobia and manslaughter, and who remains something of a broadcasting liability. Scissored Isle was his “journey of redemption” after calling a teenager a “chav” on his North Norfolk Digital radio show. “A lot of water has passed under the bridge,” says Shane Allen, the BBC’s controller of comedy commissioning. “It feels like Alan’s time has come again as the BBC seeks a seasoned presenter of his calibre and outlook as the country embarks on a time of introspection about our identity and place in the world. He’s also on less than a quarter of what he was paid back in the 90s.” Partridge is “a broadcasting legend”, Allen says. “The public love him and yet he’s had the integrity to turn down every reality show going and stay true to his inner sense of misplaced superiority. I believe he will one day feature on a Royal Mail stamp collection of the TV presenting greats ... second-class small letter probably.” Partridge has loomed large in popular culture in recent years, if not on the mainstream airwaves. The presenter’s famed gaffes and false modesty gave rise to the concept of Partridgisms, now used to describe similar moments in politicians and celebrities. Broadsheet opinion pieces have noted how relevant Partridge is becoming in an age of amateurs versus experts and a backlash against the liberal metropolitan elite. Partridge is resolutely regional and has said Eamonn Holmes and Bill Oddie are his only showbusiness friends. Partridge grew up in Norwich, in a house since demolished and replaced with Carphone Warehouse’s regional headquarters. An only child, the broadcaster wrote about his childhood loneliness in his 2011 autobiography I, Partridge: We Need To Talk About Alan. He went to East Anglia polytechnic and found work as a hospital radio DJ in Norwich. From there, he became the instore DJ for a branch of the music shop Our Price, before becoming a sports reporter on Saxon Radio in Bury St Edmunds. “I ascended the career ladder like a shaven Jesus ascending to his rightful place in the kingdom of heaven,” Partridge wrote. “I was poached by Radio Brodland [Great Yarmouth], Hereward Radio [Peterborough], Radio Orwell [Ipswich] and eventually Radio Norwich.” According to his memoir, it was during the British archery championships, held in Norwich, that Partridge reached a national audience after one of the competitors shot a steward and Partridge broadcasted the developing news story. It brought him to the attention of radio commissioners and he was encouraged to apply for a job as sports reporter on BBC Radio 4’s new current affairs show, On the Hour. When that moved to television in 1994 and was renamed The Day Today, Partridge went with it. It proved a momentous year for the presenter. He was given a BBC2 chatshow, Knowing Me Knowing You which, like The Day Today, had originated on Radio 4. Although initially successful, it wasn’t commissioned for a second series, partly because of falling audience figures, which Partridge explained by the evenings getting lighter and “more people out rambling or sitting in beer gardens” as well as his accidental fatal shooting of one of his guests. It seemed unlikely Partridge would again reach the heights of his early success. He returned to Radio Norwich to present the early morning show and cut his ties with the BBC. “The BBC is nothing if not risk averse and I was seen as a bit of a maverick,” he wrote. For several years, he made corporate videos and presented the military quiz show Skirmish for a satellite channel. The BBC broadcast I’m Alan Partridge in 2002,[1] following his life in a travel tavern after his marriage broke down. By 2010, he was a presenting a parody radio show, Mid Morning Matters, on North Norfolk Digital, which he also filmed and broadcast on YouTube. Partridge has been scathing about the BBC. In his memoir, he criticised its “restrictive, choking, stifling, suffocating bureaucracy and creativity-aborting compliance culture”. “He sees the BBC as unfinished business,” says the writer Neil Gibbons who, along with his writing partner and brother Rob, and Coogan, is co-directing the new series. “He was just getting into his stride – own show, production company, in the market for a six-bedroom house – and then he lost it all and he’s never really got over it. So he’s slagged them off ever since. He has that junior school mentality where your girlfriend dumps you and you make out you never liked her anyway. It’s just him reframing his sacking so as not to lose status.” What drives Partridge? “God knows what drives Alan,” says Gibbons. “I bet Alan doesn’t even know what drives Alan. On the one hand, he’s driven by resentment and a need to rub certain people’s noses in his success. On the other, he’s a little man who needs the validation of a big audience because he’s not comfortable in his own skin.” Despite his years in the broadcasting wilderness, Partridge remains respected among many of his peers. “There’s almost nothing he can’t do,” says the presenter and broadcaster Richard Madeley, who is not surprised by Partridge’s primetime comeback. “He came out of the womb a presenter. He’s a presenter born, not made, and second to none.” Partridge’s talent is “probably his gift for asking the unexpected,” Madeley says. “You never know, when you’re watching Alan interviewing somebody, quite what he’s going to say next. I think as far as his guests are concerned, they don’t know what to expect. I mean, he’s capable of homicide [legal note: he was never charged], which gives him a dangerous edge. In terms of the actual questions that he throws to people, they are almost always left of field.” Madeley says that of course he views Partridge as a rival, and says many other TV and radio presenters would say the same. “He’s out there, scoping for jobs that people like me want and yes, for us, he’s a problem.” Potted profile Born: 1955, King’s Lynn Career: After a start in hospital and regional radio, Partridge became sports reporter on the BBC Radio 4 current affairs show On The Hour, which transferred to TV in 1994 as The Day Today. His chat show Knowing Me Knowing You also began on Radio 4 before running for one series and a Christmas special on BBC2. He has been a DJ for Radio Norwich and for North Norfolk Digital. A documentary, Scissored Isle, for Sky, aired in 2016 and his new BBC series starts in 2018. He has written two memoirs: I, Partridge and Nomad. High point: Being named TV Quick magazine’s Man of the Moment in 1994, following the success of his chat show Low point: A Toblerone addiction They say: “On one level, Alan is very likable because he makes mistakes and vocalises a lot of the insecurities that people feel. He’s also a contemptuous Little Englander, the kind of person who I see as my life to rail against.” Steve Coogan He says: “Why am I clutched to the nation’s breasts? It’s because I’m normal. I’m one of you. I do what you guys do. Get up on a Saturday, make a batch of granola, put some toast on before doing a dozen lunges in front of Saturday Kitchen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/23/brexit-walls-theresa-may-customs-union-trade-bill-bystander","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T09:29:12Z","webTitle":"The Brexit walls are closing in on Theresa May from two sides | Rafael Behr","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/23/brexit-walls-theresa-may-customs-union-trade-bill-bystander","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/23/brexit-walls-theresa-may-customs-union-trade-bill-bystander","fields":{"headline":"The Brexit walls are closing in on Theresa May from two sides","bodyText":"Politics is like comedy in two ways: most of the people who think they would be good at it are wrong, and success depends on timing. With that in mind, the decisions by Theresa May last year to trigger article 50 and call a general election, in that order, look like a bad joke. Instead of choosing a destination and organising a strategy to get there, the prime minister went on a clown-car diversion, jettisoning her parliamentary majority and incinerating her reputation as a dependable leader. She didn’t mean to do it, of course. She pursued what looked like political wisdom at the time. And it now hardly matters how the cards might have been played better. May’s most precious commodity was time, and she misspent it. Yet time is still being frittered away. The government has postponed parliamentary debate on a bill to set the legislative framework for post-Brexit trade. It may not now come before the House of Commons for another two months. The reason is that MPs wanted to customise the law to enshrine contradictory Brexit preferences. The hard brigade want to expunge clauses that they see as gateways to retention of the EU’s customs union (or its restoration under another name). The soft squad would pass amendments to preserve such a union. Labour appears to be shifting towards that preference too. These are matters that a cabinet sub-committee is supposed to have resolved at Chequers on Thursday. Ministers are reported to have reached a common position on “managed divergence” from EU rules. But the decision to kick a foundational piece of Brexit legislation into April on the eve of the meeting doesn’t suggest confidence that any consensus will be sturdy. Even if the cabinet has indeed found some elegant solution to its various differences, there is no guarantee that backbench MPs will go along with them. Abandoning the customs union is uniquely tricky because, alongside the general economic problem of trying to avoid trade friction on borders, there is the specific political problem of Ireland, where border friction is another level of dangerous. In December the UK and the EU agreed that the frontier should stay invisible. They did not resolve how that can be done if May continued to insist that Brexit means leaving the single market and the customs union. And she does insist. That December deal is now being codified into a withdrawal agreement, of which a draft is due to be published next Wednesday by the European commission. Since this text aims to one day be legally enforceable it will be much less generous with the Irish fudge. The window of vagueness in which May has so far pretended that her no-customs-union policy and her no-Irish-border policy are compatible might then close. That in turn means the demise of her pretence that Brexit can satisfy the European Research Group (ERG) caucus of hard-right Tories, and ex-remainer, moderate Conservatives at the same time. The prime minister may also then realise that her reliance on the hardline Democratic Unionist party (DUP) for a majority in parliament and her desire for a “stable, orderly Brexit” pull in opposite directions. She can have the backing of the ERG-DUP, or she can have progress towards a collaborative, constructive partnership with the EU. She can’t have both. And this is all before next month’s European council summit when a decision is supposed to be made about the terms of transitional arrangements and – only maybe – the initiation of talks to settle the UK’s future relationship with the EU. Tick, tock. The walls are closing in on May from two sides. The negotiating timetable in Brussels is tight and so is the parliamentary arithmetic in Westminster. May was desperate to avoid having to negotiate Brexit with MPs as well as the rest of the EU. When she became prime minister in the summer of 2016 she took the referendum result as her mandate. She claimed to speak and act on behalf of the “will of the people”. Then, in the spring of 2017, she thought she saw a chance to convert that rhetorical mandate into legislative power. By sweeping up a vast majority, crushing Labour, the Tory leader would be able to enact whatever Brexit she saw fit. But the election she called had the opposite effect. Instead of being amplified and channelled through the voice of the prime minister, the people’s Brexit instructions came out diffused and distorted. May’s legacy as prime minister will be recorded as the collision of those two dramatic electoral events: the one that put her in charge of Brexit and the one that robbed her of the means to do it her way. The Eurosceptic ultras brandish the 2016 result – the single word “leave” – as licence to demand whatever they want. But parliament, elected a year later, has the authority to define Brexit in other, more moderate ways. In popular cultural terms, the referendum was the bigger deal. In constitutional terms, parliament is paramount. The contest between them is nearing its endgame and May looks more like a bystander than a player. • Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"stage/2018/feb/23/david-mamet-harvey-weinstein-play-bitter-wheat","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T11:35:45Z","webTitle":"David Mamet writes play about Harvey Weinstein","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/feb/23/david-mamet-harvey-weinstein-play-bitter-wheat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/feb/23/david-mamet-harvey-weinstein-play-bitter-wheat","fields":{"headline":"David Mamet writes play about Harvey Weinstein","bodyText":"David Mamet has revealed that he has written a play about Harvey Weinstein. In an interview to promote his new novel, Chicago, a prohibition-era murder mystery, the Pulitzer-winning playwright said: “I was talking with my Broadway producer and he said, ‘Why don’t you write a play about Harvey Weinstein?’ And so I did.” There are no official production details confirmed for the play, which is titled Bitter Wheat, but the Chicago Tribune’s Rick Kogan reports: “There has been great interest in the lead role expressed by a Chicago stage legend who is now a movie star.” Mamet previously explored allegations of sexual harassment in Oleanna, his 1992 play in which a student accuses her professor of misconduct. “I think about this a lot now,” he told Kogan. “I have a bunch of daughters, a young son,” he said. “Every society has to confront the ungovernable genie of sexuality and tries various ways to deal with it and none of them work very well. There is great difficulty when you are switching modes, which we seem to be doing now. People go crazy. They start tearing each other to bits.” Mamet is no stranger to writing about Hollywood. His 2000 film comedy State and Main followed the travails of a movie crew shooting on location in Vermont and starred Alec Baldwin as a wayward leading man and William H Macy as a stressed director. Mamet’s 1988 play Speed-the-Plow also satirised the film business and was staged at the Old Vic in London in 2008, with Kevin Spacey in the role of a desperate movie producer. Mamet’s last new Broadway play, China Doll, opened to lacklustre reviews in winter 2015 and starred Al Pacino as a fading power broker, a role written for him.

My actions did not demonstrate the values our team, myself and my family live and for that I am truly sorry.” Canada had lost the final to rivals the USA after a dramatic shootout, the first in Olympic women’s hockey history. It meant the USA winning their first Olympic title since 1998 and broke a run of four consecutive gold medals for the Canadians. Larocque’s wide-ranging apology was directed to “the IOC, International Ice Hockey Federation, the Pyeongchang Olympic Organizing Committee, the Canadian Olympic Committee, Hockey Canada and her teammates and fans”, in which she said she meant no disrespect. Melody Davidson, general manager of Canada’s national team programs, said she talked to Larocque, who did not mean to be disrespectful. “She is very remorseful and takes responsibility for her error,” Davidson said. “Emotions run high at the Olympic Games,” added Davidson, “and never more so than in a gold-medal game, but at all times we expect our team to act professionally and demonstrate sound sportsmanship. I would like to congratulate the United States on their victory.” Some social media users had leapt to Larocque’s defence after the medal presentation ceremony, pointing out that in disciplines featuring finals and third-place play-off matches, “you win a gold or a bronze medal, but you do not win a silver. You get it.” Another suggested: “If you’re out here bitching about Jocelyne Larocque taking off her silver medal you’ve probably never played a sport past middle school,” adding the hashtag #ifyourenotfirstyourlast. But she also faced widespread criticism, with social media postings suggesting she had shown “no class” and had acted in an unsportsmanlike, and even un-Canadian way. “As a Canadian I am embarrassed,” added one Twitter user. Larocque’s statement also said that she was “proud to be counted among the Canadian athletes who have won medals at these Games. Being on the podium at the world’s biggest sporting event is a great achievement and one that I’m thankful I was able to experience with my teammates.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/25/madrid-names-street-after-female-inventor-of-mechanical-ebook","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T14:00:59Z","webTitle":"Madrid names street after female inventor of mechanical 'ebook'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/25/madrid-names-street-after-female-inventor-of-mechanical-ebook","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/25/madrid-names-street-after-female-inventor-of-mechanical-ebook","fields":{"headline":"Madrid names street after female inventor of mechanical 'ebook'","bodyText":"Four decades after her death, a Spanish teacher who invented an ingenious mechanical forerunner to today’s ebooks has had a street in Madrid named in her honour. In 1949, Ángela Ruiz Robles, a passionate and innovative educator and writer from Galicia, came up with a way to expand her students’ knowledge and lighten their satchels at the same time. Her mechanical encyclopaedia – Spanish patent number 190,698 – was a pastel-green metal box packed with spools, innovation and pedagogical enthusiasm. Described as a “mechanical, electric and air-pressure driven method for reading books”, it featured audio, interchangeable reels on different subjects, a magnifying glass screen and a light so it could be read in the dark. Ruiz Robles’s aim was simple – “to make teaching easier; to get maximum knowledge with minimum effort” – and her work went on to win prizes and acclaim. Unfortunately the mechanical encyclopaedia failed to attract the necessary funding and today her prototype is on show at the national museum of science and technology in the Galician city of La Coruña. Ruiz Robles died in 1975 but her work has gradually gained posthumous recognition. On 28 March 2016 – which would have been her 121st birthday – she was the subject of a Google Doodle. This week, Madrid city council approved the naming of a street in the Spanish capital to celebrate her contribution to education and innovation. The move is part of a wider project to recognise the overlooked, marginalised or forgotten work of many pioneering Spanish women. “Keeping alive the memory of those people who have advanced culture or science is fundamental to any society,” said Rita Maestre, a spokeswoman for the Madrid government. “But that recognition will remain incomplete if – as has been the case until now – it ignores half of society. That’s why we have to redouble our efforts to recognise all those women who, in spite of the surrounding context, played key roles in the history of culture and science.” Last year, the city council decided to name streets after the writer and diplomat Isabel Oyarzábal and the philosopher Elena Cornaro, who was the first woman to receive a doctorate. It also unveiled nine plaques to commemorate women including the writer Elena Fortún, the poet Ernestina de Champourcín and the singer Dolores Vargas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/feb/23/picnic-hanging-rock-review-barbican-london-schoolgirls-valentines-day-outback","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T10:26:23Z","webTitle":"Picnic at Hanging Rock review – mesmerising mystery in the outback","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/feb/23/picnic-hanging-rock-review-barbican-london-schoolgirls-valentines-day-outback","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/feb/23/picnic-hanging-rock-review-barbican-london-schoolgirls-valentines-day-outback","fields":{"headline":"Picnic at Hanging Rock review – mesmerising mystery in the outback","bodyText":"I initially assumed, like most people, that both the 1975 Peter Weir movie and the 1967 Joan Lindsay novel on which it was based derived from a true story: that three schoolgirls and a teacher really did disappear during a Valentine’s Day excursion in 1900 to a volcanic rock in the hinterland of Victoria. Knowing that it is a manufactured myth, however, only adds to its potency; and the beauty of this stage version by Tom Wright, mesmerisingly directed by Matthew Lutton for Australia’s Malthouse and Black Swan companies, is that it is open to so many possible meanings. This 90-minute show is, in part, about the nature of theatre itself. It starts with five female actors, demurely clad in modern school uniforms and straw hats, recounting the story of the fateful trip to Hanging Rock. But the deeper they get into the narrative, the more they seem to become possessed by the past. I was fleetingly reminded of the girls in The Crucible who are haunted by the demons they themselves have invoked. Lutton’s production also shows the initial formality splintering and fragmenting. We get dreamlike glimpses of three girls dancing together in shadowy darkness. One of the disappeared, who virtually comes back from the dead, is persecuted by her insatiably curious classmates. A teacher torments a pupil in a classroom bare save for a solitary aspidistra. But, as well as being an exercise in the surreal, this is also a deeply political production. It is clear that it is very much about the vanity of a Victorian colonialism that saw Australia as a vast wilderness that needed to be tamed. Mrs Appleyard, who gives her name to the school in question is chillingly embodied by Elizabeth Nabben, sees it as her mission to bring the refined values of Bournemouth to the outback. Referring to imperialist explorers of the natural world, she also says: “We named things that had not been named.” But the whole point of this mysterious fable is that nature ultimately gets its revenge on those who seek to codify and harness it. You can also see this as a story about sex, in the same way that the incident in the Marabar caves in EM Forster’s A Passage to India revolves around unspoken desire. The girls’ disappearance through cavities in the rock hints at release from the routine repressions of boarding school. But there is also a rich ambivalence in the character of Michael, an upper-class English visitor hauntingly played by Amber McMahon. He almost sacrifices his life to his quest for the missing girls, yet at the same time seems drawn to a local Lawrentian stable boy who embodies a masculinity he himself does not possess. Occasionally, Wright’s narrative seems over-compressed as if depending on a prior knowledge of the book or film. But this is a compelling production with a versatile cast, including Harriet Gordon-Anderson, Arielle Gray and Nikki Shiels, and impressive technical effects such as the seismic rumbles of J David Franzke’s volcanic sound-design. Its great virtue, however, is that it turns an invented myth into a many-sided metaphor and leaves you feeling that there is something unknowable about Australia itself. • At the Barbican, London, until 24 February.

The bank, which is still 71%-owned by the government, made a profit of £752m in 2017, following a £7bn loss in 2016. Its chief executive, Ross McEwan, declared it a symbolic moment and an indication RBS had moved on. The bank, however, would still have been in the red if a long-anticipated fine from the US Department of Justice (DoJ) had arrived during the financial year. “RBS was the largest bank in the world 10 years ago, with a balance sheet of £2.2tn, and it spectacularly fell from grace,” McEwan told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We’ve been restructuring the bank, but it’s taken time and a lot of cost to come out of countries and businesses we didn’t want to be in.” McEwan flagged an ongoing investigation by the DoJ in the US over the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages, which is likely to dent any future profits. “We have been heavily hit with the sins of the past, and still have one large litigation and contract issue with the US Department of Justice,” McEwan said. The bank has yet to resume dividend payouts to shareholders and is expected to do so only once it has reached a settlement with the DoJ. Shares in RBS closed down nearly 5% on Friday, as the potential fine weighed on investors’ minds. The bank’s chairman, Sir Howard Davies, said it was “not the moment to declare a final victory. We still have costly legacy issues to resolve.” He added that uncertainty over Brexit was a challenge to the bank’s European business. McEwan told reporters the repair job would only be fully complete when it had a “normally functioning bank that our customers our proud to operate with, our staff are proud to be part of, and shareholders who actually want us. It’s clear the government - quite rightly - doesn’t want to be the long-term shareholder.” He said the swing back to profit was one of the signals the bank was returning to normality, but added a resolution with the DoJ and resumption of a dividend payment were also part of the story. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said RBS’s return to profit in 2017 amounted to “a stay of execution rather than a pardon” because of the looming US fine. “It’s been a tricky but momentous year for RBS, in which the bank has put to bed many of the legacy issues which have hampered performance since the financial crisis,” he said. “Two very big shadows still loom over RBS. One is the impending fine from the US, which is going to take a big slice out of the bank’s 2018 profits. The other is the large taxpayer stake, which has to be sold off at some point.” RBS became the latest bank to reveal it pays men a lot more than women, with female employees earning on average 37.2% less than their male colleagues. “The gender pay gap is not where we want it to be,” McEwan said. “What it shows is that we need to have more females in senior roles.” RBS is hoping to rebuild its reputation after a series of scandals, including the revelation that it deliberately mistreated thousands of struggling small business customers who came to it for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. Earlier this week an influential group of MPs said the bank’s treatment of small firms via its GRG division was disgraceful. The Treasury committee, chaired by Nicky Morgan, published a full unredacted report into the scandal after the City regulator published only a redacted version. “Our progress over the last few years has given us a stronger platform to compete in a rapidly changing market,” McEwan said. “And with many of our legacy issues behind us, the investment case for this bank is much clearer and the prospect of returning any excess capital to shareholders is getting closer.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/23/dana-loesch-women-gun-reform-rapists","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T13:49:57Z","webTitle":"Giving women guns wouldn't prevent rape: it would land women in jail | Jessica Valenti","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/23/dana-loesch-women-gun-reform-rapists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/23/dana-loesch-women-gun-reform-rapists","fields":{"headline":"Giving women guns wouldn't prevent rape – it would land women in jail","bodyText":"The NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch has told a lot of lies over the past 24 hours. Loesch, dispatched to counter the swell of young anger across the country, joined CNN’s town hall with Marjory Stoneman Douglas students on Wednesday night as part of the NRA’s post-Parkland damage-control tour. There, she lied to grieving students and parents about the NRA wanting expanded background checks (they oppose them) and insisted that “people who are crazy” should not be able to obtain guns despite the NRA’s opposition to gun bans on people with mental illnesses. The most insidious lie of the evening, however, was Loesch’s insistence that armed women could better defend themselves from rape – a claim that’s not only easily disproven, but that serves a very specific purpose: the NRA wants us to believe that guns protect the most vulnerable among us, instead of realizing the truth – that they kill the most vulnerable. Women are much more likely to be fatally hurt by a gun than saved by one. Women who live in abusive situations are considered at grave risk when a gun is in the home – no matter who owns it – and women killed by their partners are more likely to be murdered with a gun than all other weapons combined. (Loesch and the NRA know this, of course, yet have lobbied for years against measures that would keep guns out of abusers’ hands.) This is especially important considering that the vast majority of sexual assaults aren’t committed by strangers lurking in bushes, but by acquaintances, friends, and even loved ones. In addition to the overwhelming research that shows guns are more likely to kill than protect women, it’s also fairly clear what would happen if women did arm themselves against rapists and abusers. If a woman were raped and found not to be carrying a weapon, would we blame her for being foolish in the same way culture does now when women are attacked at night, or after they’ve had a drink? Over the last few months, we’ve seen the way women are treated when they dared to simply out the men who hurt them – does anyone really believe women shooting them would somehow go over better? And at what point should a woman who fears being raped shoot her attacker? Should she pull the trigger when he ignores her first “no”? After he pushes her on to a bed? Or would a woman need to wait until penetration is literally about to occur to shoot, just to be sure? Somehow I don’t have faith that a court system that continually fails and blames rape victims would be very kind to women who kill their attackers. In fact, women who have tried to protect themselves from sexual or domestic violence haven’t been lauded as second-amendment heroes – they’ve been arrested. Marissa Alexander was sent to prison after firing just a warning shot at her abusive husband. Bresha Meadows was just 14 years old when she shot her father in an attempt to protect her family from him – she was charged with aggravated murder. In both cases, not a peep was heard from the NRA. I’m sure it has nothing to do with the fact that neither Meadows or Alexander is white. Guns have not and will not protect us. They won’t help women, they won’t help children. They kill us. Loesch and the NRA know this already; but their bottom line has long trumped the safety of the most vulnerable Americans. In the words of my new hero, the shooting survivor Emma González: I call BS.

Joyce, despite insisting he could ride this crisis out, has finally fallen on his sword. Many commentators had deemed this outcome as inevitable. Joyce could have saved the Coalition a great deal of damage had his decision come earlier. Instead, the public spat consumed the Nationals and brought them to blows with their Liberal partners. The internal brawl did little to inspire confidence and robbed Malcolm Turnbull of any oxygen. It’s not over yet, though. On Monday, the Nationals will hold a party room meeting, where Joyce will formally resign and a replacement elected. Michael McCormack has been tipped as the frontrunner. Bridget McKenzie is expected to stay on as deputy. That’s where we’ll leave our live coverage. Our political editor Katharine Murphy will analyse the ramifications of Joyce’s decision in a piece that’s not too far away. Until then, you can catch up the day’s events in our main news piece, by my colleagues Paul Karp and Gareth Hutchens. Thanks for sticking with me. Until next time. We mentioned a little earlier that Darren Chester had ruled himself out of the leadership race. He’s now released a full statement. Chester says the party had been distracted for the past two weeks and it was now the time for unity. He said in the interests of a “smooth transition”, he was ruling himself out of the race and supporting Michael McCormack and the current deputy leader, Bridget McKenzie. Farmers for Climate Action have jumped on the leadership change, and sought to pressure any new Nationals leader to commit to action on climate change. A spokesperson for the group told the Guardian they will be airing an ad they recently made over the weekend. And after the new leader is announced next week, they will target them by airing the ad in their electorate. In an email to supporters this afternoon, the group said: Not too long ago, climate change was the elephant in the room in rural Australia. It’s well known that Barnaby Joyce and his ‘$100 roast’ scare campaign was a key reason for this. But now, things are rapidly changing in rural &amp; regional politics. On Monday there will be a new leader of the Nationals. With your help, we can make climate change the first thing on their agenda. The group is trying to fundraise to buy more ad space. You can watch it here: Sky News has reported that Darren Chester has ruled himself out of the leadership race. No real surprise there. He was considered a long shot. Chester, the former transport minister, was unceremoniously dumped from cabinet late last year and now sits on the backbench. Sky has reported that Chester will back Michael McCormack, boosting his prospects. The tributes to Joyce keep coming from his fellow Nationals. The agriculture minister, David Littleproud, said he had been the “best Nationals leader and deputy prime minister in living memory”. High praise indeed. Littleproud’s name is floating around as a potential replacement for Joyce, although he’s only been in parliament since late 2016. Littleproud’s statement makes no mention of his leadership aspirations or lack thereof. He says: Barnaby Joyce has been the best Nationals leader and deputy prime minister in living memory. Joyce led the Nationals into the 2016 election campaign, when the party took all before it, holding all its seats against the swing and gaining the extra seat of Murray. Joyce has been one of the great communicators of our time. He fought for the people who live on dirt roads, the people in the brick and tile houses and for better opportunities for all. Joyce has always been a powerful advocate for rural, regional and remote Australia and will continue to be. Just before his appearance on Sky, Nationals senator John “Wacka” Williams was on Sydney’s 2GB radio. He gave a bit more detail on his conversation with Joyce last night. Joyce told him the Daily Telegraph would be running a “crazy story” today that the National Party had received a sexual harassment complaint against him, and he was concerned it was all hurting the party and the government too much. “I read the story this morning,” Williams said. “I sent him a text and said look, if I was you I’d stand down … then he rang me back and we had a chat.” He said he didn’t try to convince Joyce to remain as the party leader because he understood why Joyce would want to step aside. But he said Joyce was “very cranky” that a woman had made a sexual harassment allegation against him when she hadn’t even gone to the police. “I said to him look you know, they throw so much mud some sticks, people they’ll allege this and allege that, and people get the wrong impression of so-and-so. “I’m glad he stood down … he’s been a great leader that’s achieved so much for regional Australia, but he’s also a human being, he’s got a personal life to have as well, and I think he’ll have a lot of pressure off him and he can do his job as the member for New England. “I did say to him ‘You’re not going to stand down as a member for New England?’ and he said ‘No way, that’s my passion, helping the people here’.” Williams said he didn’t know any details of the sexual harassment allegation. “I think he needs a breather,” Williams said. The NSW Nationals senator, John Williams, reveals that he spoke to Joyce last night. He said the resignation was not a surprise. Williams insists it was Joyce’s decision to resign. It wasn’t a surprise. I spoke to Barnaby last night and he said look things are just not backing off, there’s a story coming out today. Williams says Michael McCormack would make a good Nationals leader. Asked whether Joyce could come back, Williams says he won’t rule anything out after the last two weeks in politics. The Nationals president, Larry Anthony, said the party greeted the news of Joyce’s departure with “a heavy heart”. Anthony said he understood and respected Joyce’s decision, and said the Nationals’ thoughts and support were with the former deputy prime minister and “those closest to him”. Barnaby will continue to be a huge asset for the party as the Member for New England. The Nationals have a strong history of almost 100 years of delivering for regional communities and standing up for local issues. The party room will meet on Monday to elect a new leader that will take our team forward and continue the Nationals’ strong representation of regional Australia. Fellow National and resources minister, Matt Canavan, has issued a statement praising Joyce’s “courage” as leader. Joyce was so courageous, Canavan says, that he would often ignore the advice of his advisers and take stances that were “too courageous”. Pistol and Boo, anyone? Here’s Canavan’s full statement: Barnaby Joyce leaves as Nationals leader with a long list of accomplishments. As leader and before, he helped pull the Nationals back from the grave. Just a decade ago it was commonly accepted that the Nats would have to merge with the Libs to survive. Within a decade the Nats helped save a Coalition government from a first term defeat, in part due to Barnaby’s strong leadership. Barnaby has more courage than most. He often took up arguments or causes that many seasoned politicians, or advisers, would caution as being “too courageous”. Barnaby often defied their warnings and proved that courage is an essential ingredient towards the recipe of success. He did so to protect the interests of working people and small businesses in the bush. People who did not have a voice and often worked with very little, asked for less and struggled through drought, flood and price changes. He fearlessly defended the wealth-producing industries of Australia, such as farming, mining, forestry, fishing and manufacturing. Our wealth-producing industries find themselves under a coordinated and undue attack by the many, who ironically owe their comfortable 21st century existence to the comparable few who work in the sun and subject their fortunes to the whims of international markets and finance. I am sure Barnaby will continue that fight, as will the Nationals party. Now more than ever there is a need for a party to fight for those who produce the wealth that maintains our prosperity and builds our future. It is true that I consider Barnaby a mate. None of my mates are perfect, nor am I. Barnaby has made mistakes but I am sure he will recover, learn and be a better person from them. He now has a new partner and a new child to care for and that is much more important than any of his achievements in public life. I also express my regret about the impact this has had on Natalie and Barnaby’s four daughters. They are a beautiful family. Nat is a remarkable woman of strength, character and good cheer. All of their girls are bright, vivacious and full of life. I am sure they will thrive beyond these difficult times. The Nationals party is at its strongest when we work together as a team. I look forward to our Nationals team continuing to fight and deliver for the people of regional and rural Australia. We’ve got a full report up on Joyce’s resignation here. Do have a read. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, is out and about. The script writes itself for Labor, really. Shorten says: There is no question the relationship between the Liberals and the Nationals is fundamentally damaged, irreparably. That the deputy prime minister didn’t ring the prime minister to tell him he was going to resign shows you the fictional make-up they had last weekend was just a hoax. They both said after their meeting last Saturday that everything was fine. They were clearly lying and now the fact that the deputy prime minister has resigned and not even told the prime minister shows you there is deep division at the heart of this chaotic government. So, who’ll be our next deputy prime minister? The field is hardly stacked with household names. A promotion to deputy prime minister would be of meteoric proportions for some of these Nationals, many of whom are still in junior ministry positions. But hey, things can’t get much worse, right? Right? Michael McCormack, the current veterans affairs minister. McCormack is widely tipped as the frontrunner. 2. David Gillespie, the assistant minister for children and families 3. David Littleproud, the agriculture minister. Only elected in 2016. 4. Darren Chester, backbencher and former transport minister. Chester is an unlikely contender, given he was dumped from cabinet late last year. 5. Matt Canavan, resources minister and senator. Similarly considered an outside chance. Acting Nationals leader, Bridget McKenzie, has issued a statement that is glowing in its praise of Joyce. McKenzie said there “is no stronger advocate for regional Australia”. He has re-energised and grown the party since taking over the leadership in late 2016, she says, and always led from the front. His decision to stand aside is the right decision for the National party, the nation and most importantly his family. Barnaby has always remained focused on the people in the regions and in ensuring Coalition government policy always has the best interests of rural Australia in mind. His dedication was pivotal in returning the Coalition in the 2016 election. He has a proven record of delivering for our party and a vision to grow regional and rural communities. The images from Armidale are trickling in. A rather helpful offer to Joyce from Netflix. I’m sure he’ll be stoked. So, what did we learn from Barnaby Joyce’s press conference? Let’s recap: Joyce will resign as deputy prime minister and Nationals leader. He will stay on as member for New England. Joyce has referred a complaint of sexual harassment made against him to police. He says it is false and wants it properly investigated. He said the allegation was the final straw in a saga that has stretched over two weeks. Joyce said he could not possibly get up to speak at the dispatch box while that allegation was being investigated. Joyce has slammed the media’s intrusion into the life of his partner, Vikki Campion. He said he thought Australia was better than that. Not one of the “litany” of allegations against him have been proved, he said. Joyce has promised he will not snipe from the backbench. He’s writing a book and is expecting a baby, so has plenty to keep him occupied, he said. He wants his decision to act as a “circuit breaker” to end the public discussion about the saga. Malcolm Turnbull has just issued a statement on Joyce’s resignation. He thanked Joyce for his service and said the Coalition partnership was “undiminished”. John McVeigh – the Queensland LNP MP who is currently regional development minister – will fill Joyce’s infrastructure and transport portfolio until the Nationals sort themselves out internally. Here’s Turnbull’s formal statement in full: The Hon Barnaby Joyce MP has announced that he will resign as deputy prime minister and minister for infrastructure and transport, effective 8am on Monday. I thank Barnaby for his service as deputy prime minister and in his various ministerial roles in which he has been a fierce advocate for rural and regional Australia. The Coalition between the Liberals and the Nationals is Australia’s most successful political partnership, having endured for more than 95 years. This partnership is undiminished and will continue to deliver opportunity and security for all Australians. Pending the Nationals’ election of a new leader and consequent ministerial changes, the Hon John McVeigh MP will act as minister for infrastructure and transport. If you’re wondering who the Weatherboard Nine are, we have the answer. Viewers at home may have been wondering at a bizarre phrase the outgoing deputy PM seemed to throw out there at the end of his press conference. When asked what his legacy was, Joyce seemed to say: “I fought for the person in the Weatherboard Nine.” We can calm the speculation. He was saying “weatherboard and iron”. Here’s the proof. In this SMH interview from October 28 last year, Joyce was directly quoted as saying he wanted to “to give greater economic and personal advancement to the people in the weatherboard and iron in the regional towns.” He continued: “I didn’t give a toss for where power comes from, but one of the greatest afflictions for people in the weatherboard and iron is they can’t afford power.” Here’s the official Nationals account repeating it: And a video where you can watch him say it himself, and spark the same confusion in the comments: Joyce clearly intends to be using the phrase as a metaphor for the rural poor, a figure of speech known as synecdoche, where a part of something (in this case the materials of cheap housing) is made to represent the whole. Liberal MP Tony Pasin says the press conference was clearly difficult for Joyce. Pasin said he was shocked to watch it. “It’s obviously a shock,” Pasin told Sky News. “Watching that press conference, make no mistake, that was a difficult exercise for Barnaby.” He said the saga has been an ordeal and he’s glad it’s come to a head. Pasin gives us some clue as to who may put their hand up for the Nationals leadership, now that Joyce is gone. He says the field will be similar to the field that stood for the deputy leader position in December. That field included resources minister, Matt Canavan. Right, well. We expected it, eventually. But it’s still a huge development and a significant blow to the Coalition. So, how on earth did it come to this? Is your head spinning? Luckily, my colleague Naaman Zhou has compiled a very handy timeline on this whole sorry episode. It feels like it’s dragged on for an age. Apparently, it’s only been two weeks. Yep, two weeks. 7 February – Sydney’s Daily Telegraph breaks the story that Joyce is expecting a baby with Vikki Campion, a former staffer. Campion, a former journalist, began an affair with Joyce while she worked as his media adviser. 10 February – Joyce reveals that he and Campion lived in a rent-free apartment in Armidale provided by his friend Greg Maguire, a local businessman. 13 February – Pressure mounts over a job that Campion was given by Nationals colleague Matt Canavan, after she and Joyce began their relationship. Joyce declares it is above board because Campion was “not his partner” at the time. 14 February – A small group of Nationals MPs consider asking Joyce to resign as leader, but the movement fizzles. 15 February – Malcolm Turnbull announces that Joyce will be taking a week of leave, and will not become the acting prime minister while he is away. Hours later, he announces a ban on sex between ministers and staffers. He is scathing of Joyce’s relationship – calling it “a shocking error” that unleashed “a world of woe”. 16 February – Joyce immediately fires back and the prime minister and his deputy spend the day duelling through press conferences. Joyce calls Turnbull “inept”. Turnbull doubles down. 19 February – Nationals MP Michael McCormack, seen as a frontrunner to replace Joyce, refuses to rule out the possibility that he will one day challenge for the leadership. A Newspoll finds 65% of voters think Joyce should resign. 20 February – The West Australian branch of the Nationals calls on Joyce to resign. 21 February – Joyce – still technically on leave – offers an exclusive interview where he tells the media to “move on” and respect the privacy of his unborn son. 22 February – Nationals MP Andrew Broad becomes the first federal MP to call for Joyce to step down as leader. 23 February – Another MP, Andrew Gee, withdraws support for Joyce and declares “all bets are off”, after the Daily Telegraph reports that Joyce has been hit by a sexual harassment claim. The NSW Nationals have just released a statement, thanking Joyce for his service. The statement describes Joyce as a “staunch and uncompromising advocate” for regional Australians. Here’s the full statement. There we are. That’s the end of Joyce’s press conference. Just to reiterate – Joyce is stepping down as Nationals leader and deputy prime minister, but will stay on as member for New England on the backbench. He says he does not think the media should report on personal relationships in the future. He said the intrusion into in his partner Vikki Campion’s life was “just wrong”. I apologise to Vikki, the idea, walking across the road as a pregnant lady and just being, you know, put under so much pressure. I mean, I thought that’s not who we are in Australia. That’s not the kind of people we are. I’m the public figure, go after me. That’s what I get paid for but don’t go after private individuals. It’s just wrong. And always think of it when you see something like that on paper and you think it’s salacious, think: “What if that was me? My mother, my wife? How would I feel?” Joyce is asked whether he takes any responsibility for the events in recent weeks. He says he takes responsibility “for them talking about you”, but little else. Joyce says he was never made aware of the allegation of sexual harassment. He says he only heard of it in the “last day or so”. I have never been made directly aware of that. It was only in the last day or so I was made directly aware. But there were rumours. Joyce says he will remain in the seat of New England. He has no plans to remain as a minister. He’s writing a book and is expecting a baby, he says, so has a lot of things on his mind. Will he refrain from sniping, like Tony Abbott promised he would? No, I won’t snipe. I have a lot of things I need to do. I’m currently in the process of writing a book about precisely the people I was talking about and I want to make sure I get that concluded. I want to assist my colleagues where I can to keep their seats and also, quite naturally, in April, a baby will be born. I’ll have other things on my mind. Joyce says he has referred the allegation of sexual harassment to police for investigation. He says the entire episode and public intrusion into his life, and the life of his partner, Vikki Campion, has “got to stop”. It’s incredibly important that there be a circuit-breaker, not just for the parliament, but more importantly, a circuit-breaker for Vikki, for my unborn child, my daughters and for Nat. “This has got to stop. It’s not fair on them. It’s just completely and utterly unwarranted, the sort of observation that’s happened.” Joyce confirms he will step down on Monday as Nationals leader and deputy prime minister. He says it’s quite evident that he can’t go to the dispatch box (for question time) while allegations of sexual harassment are being investigated. This current cacophony of issues has to be put aside, and I think it’s my responsibility to do my bit to make sure that happens. Joyce says there needs to be “clear air”. He says there’s been a “litany of allegations”. “I don’t believe any of them have been sustained,” he said. He’s slamming the leaking and backgrounding, saying it will destroy the government. Joyce is speaking now. Can I say right from the start, this is never about me. It’s about the person in the weatherboard, something that manifestly expressed what the National party is about. If you’ve just tuned into the Barnaby Joyce coverage today, it’s worth reading this report of the latest developments from my colleagues Paul Karp and Katharine Murphy. Tim Fischer, former Nationals leader, has just appeared on Sky News. Fischer, who was John Howard’s deputy, was booked in by Sky to talk about gun control in the United States. But, inevitably, the interview soon moves to Joyce’s future. Fischer is asked how the party will recover from the weeks of damaging headlines. “We’ve been written off before … I think as a courtesy let’s wait and see what the deputy prime minister has to say in just a few minutes time. He says he doesn’t “dwell on day-to-day politics” in Australia anymore, but does feel for those who have been personally hurt in the saga. Fischer won’t say if he’s been sought out for counsel. He says the 24-hour media cycle is now relentless and unforgiving for politicians. “The margins of error – one bad press conference and you’re burnt for weeks,” he said. Derryn Hinch, the senator and human headline, reckons he’s got this picked. We’re still 30 minutes away from the press conference, but the cameras are already set up and waiting for Joyce in Armidale. The Nationals have been in lockdown for much of the morning. I still don’t know for certain whether Joyce will stay or go. My best punt is 2pm is more likely to be a departure than a digging in. The new allegation about sexual harassment – denied by the deputy prime minister – has been a blow. I’m told the complainant is a prominent person in West Australian regional affairs. Senior members of the government appear unaware of what Joyce will say at 2pm. Christopher Pyne is currently on Sky News, in his regular slot with Richard Marles. Pyne said he was not aware of the nature of Joyce’s planned statement, but said “all eyes” would be on the press conference. Indeed they will be, Christopher. The ABC’s Lucy Barbour is reporting that Joyce’s chief of staff has called a meeting of his Canberra office staff for 1.30pm. Several developments have piled on the pressure for Joyce in recent days. Nationals MP Andrew Gee on Friday joined fellow National Andrew Broad in withdrawing support for Joyce. Gee issued a statement that “all bets are off” when it came to the leadership. The Daily Telegraph reported on Friday that Joyce is the subject of a complaint of sexual harassment, made to the National party. Joyce has dismissed the report as “spurious and defamatory”. But the acting prime minister, Mathias Cormann, has said any allegations of sexual harassment are “very serious”. The decision of the deputy prime minister to give an exclusive interview to Fairfax Media, despite being on a week’s leave. Joyce used the interview to complain of being hounded out of his rent-free apartment and told us all to move on from the issue. His critics said the interview did nothing more than give new life to a story that was finally moving off the front pages. Malcolm Turnbull, who is in the United States, repeatedly failed to publicly back Joyce on Friday. Hello and welcome, We’re expecting big news from the Nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce, at 2pm. Joyce has scheduled a press conference in Armidale. Channel Nine caught up with him earlier today, and asked him whether he would remain Nationals leader. Joyce responded “Let’s do the presser”. Fairfax Media has reported Joyce is “increasingly likely” to resign. Needless to say, it’s all sounding rather ominous for Joyce. Stay with us. We’ll take you through developments as soon as they happen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/feb/23/france-v-italy-six-nations-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T22:00:34Z","webTitle":"France 34-17 Italy: Six Nations – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/feb/23/france-v-italy-six-nations-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/feb/23/france-v-italy-six-nations-live","fields":{"headline":"France 34-17 Italy: Six Nations – as it happened","bodyText":"Right then, I’ll be off. Bye! Sergio Parisse talks: It was a tough game for us but I think the performance was not too bad. We played against a French team with a lot of pressure. We kept the pressure on them in the first half, but at the beginning of the second half they scored. I think our defence was much better than the first two games. Just keep going, keep working. It’s difficult when you lose, but we have another two games to possibly get a win. Bastareaud is being lauded on television, and rightly – his was a typically powerful performance, and his try almost comic as he swatted three blue shirts aside. He was involved in one of the fluffed nearly-tries, but can hardly be blamed for a ball passed at point-blank range into his knee. 83 mins: A vital win for France, but a far from faultless one. 81 mins: They give the ball to Bastareaud, but he can’t quite force his way over the line. They have a penalty, and they tap and go … not very far. 81 mins: The clock ticks into the red. France have the ball, and still want that fourth try. And they nearly have one! 80 mins: Marcello Violi is hurt and needs to go off, and Italy have used up all their substitutions, so they will end the game with 14 men. 89 mins: A fine break, at the end of which Matteo Minozzi goes over! Some in the crowd spotted a knock-on and sound grumpy, but in fact a legal pass had deflected forward off a Frenchman. 89 mins: Italy clear their lines. France are sniffing a bonus point, for which they need one last try. 77 mins: Fall, who has caught the eye with his running down the wing, bursts forward. The tryline beckons. He passes inside, and France mess it up again. 74 mins: François Trinh-Duc, just arrived on the pitch, makes no mistake with the conversion. 73 mins: France attack in numbers again, and this time there’s no stopping them – Bastareaud powers his way through whichever Italians get in his way and blasts over the line! 71 mins: Machenaud kicks another penalty, and it will be his last touch, as France make a string of replacements. 70 mins: France push forward again, hint at a try again, and mess it up horribly again. The referee was playing an advantage, so there’s another penalty here, but some of the home side’s decision-making and execution in crucial situations has been comical. 66 mins: This has,in truth, been a rather poor and error-strewn match. But not without moments of excellence – Beaxis produces one of them, with a fine stretching, mid-air steal at the end of a rare decent Italy attack. 65 mins: No problem at all. 64 mins: Quaglio is penalised for an offside, and have a penalty. It’s a way out, but from the centre of the pitch Machenaud will be confident of making this. 61 mins: Precisely what France wanted and needed, as the ticking clock and the narrowness of their advantage increased tension. 60 mins: Bastareaud bursts through two tackles, passes outside to Bonneval, who gives the ball to Grosso, takes it back again and goes over the line! 57 mins: Sebastian Negri goes on a fine run, but Tauleigne stops him, then Bastareaud gets involved, and it ends with Italy conceding a penalty. 55 mins: A fine cross kick from left to right finds Benjamin Fall, but then Mattia Bellini tackles him, and steals the ball for good measure. 52 mins: There’s lots of grumpy noises coming from the stands, though on the television it’s hard to tell if they’re angry, or just doing more Mexican waving. 50 mins: For the first time this evening, Tomasso Allan kicks a penalty. And his aim is true. 48 mins: Sergio Parisse is taken out off the ball, and Italy have another penalty. This time, they’ll be happy with three points. 48 mins: Italy win a penalty way out on the left, onceded by Vahaamahina, and go for touch. France win the line-out. 46 mins: France’s lead is now a fairly healthy seven points. 45 mins: The referee plays an advantage, so France know they can have a penalty if they want one. Despite this, and in the circumstances with no obvious purpose, Beauxis attempts a hurried drop-goal. He misses. Still, a penalty. 43 mins: France have a wonderful try-scoring chance, and they make a mess of this one as well! Beauxis has the ball, with space in front of him to burst into, and he bursts into it, runs 30 yards with two team-mates outside him, and then messes up his pass, and then the ball’s knocked on, and it all unravels horribly. 41 mins: France win the first line-out of the second half, and lose the ball from it. 41 mins: And they’re off! Again! The players are back out. Guirardo has been passed fit to continue. … though they should have scored at least two more tries. Anyway, this from Niall Mullen: “What is it with rugby fans? France are losing at home and there’s a Mexican wave,” he opines. “I’ve seen this in other games too. The stadium cam will pick out some fans of the losing side and the fans will mug up for the camera instead of ignoring it with a thousand yard stare. They should be tense &amp; gnawing on their fists not having a party. Do rugby fans actually care about the result or are they just there for the crack?” I am a fellow Mexican-wave curmudgeon. I can accept them in the 70th minute of a dire and irrelevant goalless draw in association football, but in very few other situations. 40 mins: There is time for the restart, but not a lot else. France take a deserved lead into the break, and only further second-half fitness-related self-combustion can stop them winning this, surely. 40 mins: It’s good, and France extend their lead! They have been clearly the better side for all but about 120 seconds of this half. 39 mins: Another penalty. Guilhem Guirado appears to have taken a blow to the head, and needs to go off for a medical check-up. 38 mins: Various Italians take turns to run straight into opponents. Eventually one of the opponents – Bastareaud – rips the ball out of an Italian’s arms and the French spring forward. 35 mins: A first replacement: Dean Budd is off and George Biagi is on. 34 mins: And they mess it up again. A foot from the line the ball is passed into Bastareaud’s knee, bounces off him and is lost. 33 mins: And France have yet another penalty. Doumayrou takes it quickly and heads for the line, but doesn’t quite make it! 32 mins: A scrum has to be reset a couple of times. When it eventually holds up, Remy Grosso goes on a long run, Italy steal the ball back and then Mattia Bellini, the other No11, goes on a run of his own. Another turnover, and France are pushing again. 29 mins: Machenaud’s kick sails between the posts, and France are back in the lead. They have been far from clinical with their try-scoring chances, but at least they’re no longer losing. 29 mins: And it will be a penalty, which Machenaud will take. 28 mins: Again, the French get within a couple of strides of the tryline. Can they cross it this time? The referee is playing an advantage, so there’s a penalty as a worst case scenario. 26 mins: Italy have the line-out but no clear plan for what to do after it, get a bit stuck, and Andrea Levotti concedes a penalty. France again go in search of a try. 25 mins: The ball ends up in touch, after Minozzi lands a perfectly decent tackle, and some players get very upset about something. There’s an extended period of pushing, shoving, and general aggressive posturing. 24 mins: The ball is stuck around the halfway line, inside the French half. But then it’s worked wide by the French, with speed, to Remy Grosso, and he sprints 35 yards down the line. 20 mins: A physio comes on to look at Leonardo Ghiraldini, who has an issue with his right shoulder. 19 mins: Tauleigne carries the ball to within a yard from the tryline, but with another try beckoning France fumble, and the ball rolls five yards forwards to a blue shirt, and the moment is lost. 16 mins: France pass the ball to Lionel Beauxis, who powers between two Italians and 10 yards towards the tryline, a lovely run, but he can’t find a pass at the end of it and France contrive to give away a penalty. 15 mins: The backs haven’t really stretched their legs yet. It’s been a game of mauls, scrums and line-outs thus far. And a somewhat controversial decision. 12 mins: It’s a penalty try! Wayne Barnes eventually decides that the maul did collapse, and though he can’t identify a culprit he can award the penalty try, which is precisely what he does. 11 mins: Over to the TMO. Was the ball grounded? It looks like it wasn’t, so it’s not a try. But then, was the maul collapsed? It looks like it was, in which case it’s a penalty try. 10 mins: What a surge from the Italians! From the line out they just roll forwards, with the French defence disorganised and disjointed. All the way to the tryline, and over it! 10 mins: A few moments later Italy themselves have a kickable penalty, and they too kick for touch, preferring to go for the tryline. 9 mins: Italy have a line-out, and catch France off guard by throwing short to Alessandro Zanni. They swiftly force him into touch, though. 7 mins: Machenaud misses the conversion. Still, a fine start for France who have been absolutely in control. The ball disappears from view as players from both sides collide a yard from the line, but then Paul Gabrillagues pops out the back and calmly places the ball an inch over the line! 5 mins: From the line out, France grab the ball and surge for the line. 4 mins: The France pack has the ball and pushes Italy back. The referee signals a penalty, but lets play continue as France continue to push. Eventually, though, he blows his whistle. It’s totally kickable, but they want the try and go for touch again. 3 mins: Italy play the ball from right to left, but Bastareaud gets in the way and wins a penalty, which is booted into touch. 1 min: It has begun. Marco Tauleigne catches cleanly, and France, in white, have the ball. The preamble is over. The action is about to begin. And they’re out! Indeed, the Italians are already singing their anthem. With great gusto. The teams are in the tunnel! Jonathan Davies is having a chat about the game on the BBC, allowing us to glimpse his view of the pitch – he is a long, long way up. In this picture the French dressing room looks only marginally quieter than the Italian one – and there’s nobody in it. This is what the inside of the Italy changing room looks and sounds like. Disappointingly quiet, really. Hello world! Here are some wooden spoons, delightfully described as “a bouquet of spoons” in the caption supplied by the agency responsible for the photograph. As the only winless teams after two matches in this season’s Six Nations, it seems likely that one of these teams will be the recipients of the notional wooden spoon, though they are unlikely to think of them as bouquets of any sort. France come into the game having not only lost twice, but having also dropped a total of eight players for “not respecting their status as international players” during a night on the town after defeat to Scotland a fortnight ago. Completing a rather objectionable picture, Mathieu Bastareaud returns to the team following a three-week ban for homophobic abuse. Italy have won four of their 69 matches against France, and only once on French soil – they have never done that in the Six Nations – but this might be their best chance yet. Here are the teams: France: Bonneval, Fall, Bastareaud, Doumayrou, Grosso, Beauxis, Machenaud, Poirot, Guirado, Slimani, Gabrillagues, Vahaamahina, Lauret, Camara, Tauleigne. Replacements: Pelissie, Priso, Gomes Sa, Taofifenua, Gourdon, Galletier, Couilloud, Trinh-Duc. Italy: Minozzi, Benvenuti, Boni, Castello, Bellini, Allan, Violi, Lovotti, Ghiraldini, Ferrari, Zanni, Budd, Negri, Mbanda, Parisse. Replacements: Bigi, Quaglio, Pasquali, Biagi, Ruzza, Gori, Canna, Hayward. Referee: Wayne Barnes (England). Simon will be here shortly. Both these teams are winless after two matches, and Italy head coach Conor O’Shea senses an opportunity to avoid the wooden spoon: We have a young group which learns match after match. We knew that the first two games against England and Ireland would be very tough but there were a lot of positives in our performance. A year ago the depth and the internal competition we can count on today were totally different, and I hope everyone in the environment will see the great progress we are making with Benetton and Zebre. In Dublin in the first half we did not do what we expected but it is important for us on Friday to learn from our mistakes and show our game plan, show off our rugby throughout the game. For us, Friday is a new opportunity. We must focus on ourselves, and I hope we can offer ourselves and our fans a performance to be proud of."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/23/football-transfer-rumours-raheem-sterling-to-real-madrid","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T08:37:59Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Raheem Sterling to Real Madrid?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/23/football-transfer-rumours-raheem-sterling-to-real-madrid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/23/football-transfer-rumours-raheem-sterling-to-real-madrid","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Raheem Sterling to Real Madrid?","bodyText":"Raheem Sterling is mainly famous for crazy antics such as spending his own money as he pleases and generally acting as though he’s some kind of free human being. But he is also an excellent footballer, and Manchester City have yet to discuss a new contract with him even though he has two years of his current deal still to run, a situation which has been noted by Real Madrid. City and Madrid also share an interest in Mauro Icardi, though Wanda Nara, Icardi’s wife and agent, is refusing to confirm the interested parties. But City need to add some experience to the homegrown talent so patiently nurtured by the genius of Pep Guardiola, while Madrid see him as the ideal replacement for Karim Benzema. Also in line to leave the Bernabéu is Gareth Bale. Despite the fine work he has done developing his muscles and hair, Madrid no longer see him as fitting into their team, the problem being that none of the clubs able to afford him are looking for a elite attacker of unreliable fitness. Meanwhile, Matteo Darmian will leave Manchester United this summer and sign for Juventus. They are well furnished with defensive specialists but lack an all-rounder deficient in pace, skill, strength, height, nous, leadership, composure and attacking threat. In other defensive news, Chelsea are looking at Jamaal Lascelles of Newcastle. A lot of time and trouble goes into signing players these days, and painstaking research has revealed that he satisfies all essential criteria, being both English and young – just like Ross Barkley. Across London, Arsenal are also getting busy. Barcelona have decided not to pursue an interest in Nabil Fekir, Lyon’s unreliable and undecorated attacking midfielder. Naturally, this has piqued Arsène Wenger’s interest – he would like to add the player to his unique collection, and feels that Fekir will look perfect on the mantlepiece alongside Henrikh Mkhitaryan. Elsewhere, Atlético Madrid would like to buy Reece Oxford from West Ham. Oxford, who once played fairly well against Arsenal, is now on loan at Borussia Mönchengladbach, enjoying yet another thrilling title race in Europe’s most fan-friendly league. West Ham value their man at £12m. Also leaving West Ham is José Fonte. With spring almost upon us, the club no longer requires its dressing room draft excluders, and as such, will accept a £5m offer from Dalian Yifang, who will then spend another £27m on Atlético’s Yannick Carrasco."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/23/barnaby-joyce-resigns-nationals-deputy-prime-minister-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T04:50:53Z","webTitle":"Barnaby Joyce quits as Australia's deputy prime minister and Nationals leader","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/23/barnaby-joyce-resigns-nationals-deputy-prime-minister-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/23/barnaby-joyce-resigns-nationals-deputy-prime-minister-australia","fields":{"headline":"Barnaby Joyce quits as Australia's deputy prime minister and Nationals leader","bodyText":"Barnaby Joyce has announced his resignation as Nationals leader and deputy prime minister of Australia after weeks of fallout over his affair with a former staffer and now partner, Vikki Campion, who is pregnant with his child. Joyce saw his support diminish after the revelation on Thursday night that a sexual harassment complaint had been made against him to the country-based National party, the junior partner in the ruling Liberal-National Coalition. After earlier dismissing the complaint by a Western Australian woman as “spurious and defamatory”, Joyce told a press conference in Armidale on Friday he could not continue as leader while it was being investigated. He said he would resign on Monday, clearing the way for an 8am ballot to determine the Nationals leader and deputy prime minister, for which the minister for veterans affairs and defence personnel, Michael McCormack, has put himself forward and is the frontrunner. David Gillespie, the assistant minister for children and families, has also put himself forward. Joyce said “without a shadow of a doubt” he would remain the member for New England, but did not rule out a return as deputy prime minister. The Nationals whip, Michelle Landry, said he would “focus on clearing his name … [and] will sit at the backbench for the moment”. Joyce said he had faced a “litany of allegations” that he did not think had been sustained but the sexual harassment complaint was “the straw that broke the camel’s back”. Thanking the people of his New England constituency and his supporters, Joyce observed: “I don’t deserve the support that you’ve given me.” He lamented the fact his relationship with Campion had been exposed by the media and the immense pressure she has been under since Sydney’s Daily Telegraph published a photograph of her, visibly pregnant, crossing the road. “I thought that’s not who we are in Australia. That’s not the kind of people we are. I’m the public figure, go after me.” Joyce said his resignation should be a “circuit breaker” for the parliament, “for Vikki, for my unborn child, my daughters, and for [my wife] Nat”. “This has got to stop. It’s not fair on them. It’s just completely and utterly unwarranted, the sort of observation that’s happened.” In a statement on Friday, Malcolm Turnbull thanked Joyce for his service and boasted that the Coalition had been “Australia’s most successful political partnership”. “This partnership is undiminished and will continue to deliver opportunity and security for all Australians,” the prime minister said. Reports suggest Joyce did not call Turnbull before making the announcement, and Joyce himself said he had informed acting prime minister, Mathias Cormann. Joyce refused to endorse a successor but McCormack is likely to gain support from the party’s social conservative base. Gillespie had also indicated to colleagues that he would put his hand up if Joyce resigned, and he confirmed that on Friday afternoon on 2GB radio. After dodging the question last week McCormack confirmed he would run for the leadership so the National party could “grow local economies, increase local opportunities and create local jobs”. “We can do this together as a united team,” he said. “I am a fighter and I have the drive to deliver.” McCormack, a former regional newspaper editor, entered parliament in 2010, joined the ministry in 2013 and has held various portfolios including small business. Nationals MPs believe David Littleproud, who was catapulted into cabinet in the December reshuffle after his election in 2016, would also enjoy support. But he has not declared as a candidate. The former infrastructure minister Darren Chester told ABC Radio that Joyce had made the “right decision” to clear the air in what had become a distraction for the government. He ruled out running for the leadership, citing the fact he did not have the numbers and the party was “not ready for someone a bit more moderate”. Chester endorsed McCormack, noting that he was the party’s “most experienced House of Representatives minister”. He told the ABC he would take a ministry position in future if he had the opportunity but was not “applying for a new job”. It is not considered tenable to have Victorians in both leadership positions. The party’s current deputy, Senator Bridget McKenzie, and Chester are both Victorians. Landry said senators could not run, which rules out McKenzie and Joyce’s former chief of staff, the resources and northern Australia minister, Matt Canavan. A generous tribute from Canavan suggested Joyce would “continue [the] fight” for regional Australia. “None of my mates are perfect, nor am I,” he said. “Barnaby has made mistakes but I am sure he will recover, learn and be a better person from them.” The party’s federal president, Larry Anthony, said Joyce was “a fierce advocate for regional Australia” and would “continue to be a huge asset” for the party as member for New England. “He made an enormous contribution to the Nationals, highlighted by his herculean efforts to lead the party to our best electoral result in 20 years at the 2016 federal election, which was critical to forming a Coalition government.” Joyce shot to fame internationally in 2015 when he threatened to have dogs belonging to the actors Jonny Depp and Amber Heard put to death for a breach of biosecurity rules. In October the high court ruled that Joyce was ineligible to sit in parliament because he was a dual New Zealand citizen, one of nine Australian politicians thus far to resign or be forced out by a rigid but – until recently – little-enforced constitutional disqualification. After a campaign in which he was forced to fend off questions about his private life, Joyce won back his seat of New England in a resounding victory. At a press conference outside the White House in Washington DC on Thursday, Turnbull repeatedly refused to express support for Joyce. Before Joyce’s announcement on Friday, a second Nationals MP, Andrew Gee, withdrew his support, backing Andrew Broad’s call for him to stand down and resolve the leadership with a ballot. The minister for regional development, John McVeigh, will act as infrastructure and transport minister pending the election of a new Nationals leader and ministerial changes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/feb/23/sandra-bernhard-ronnie-scotts-london","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T15:46:50Z","webTitle":"Sandra Bernhard review – swagger, songs and starry stories","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/feb/23/sandra-bernhard-ronnie-scotts-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/feb/23/sandra-bernhard-ronnie-scotts-london","fields":{"headline":"Sandra Bernhard review – swagger, songs and starry stories","bodyText":"“If I looked at a crib sheet that much during my show,” I heard one punter complain on leaving Sandra Bernhard’s gig, “I wouldn’t have a career.” Ah yes, one might reply – but you’re not Sandra Bernhard, who is here to sell not her craft, but her charisma. Movie star, singer and raconteur, Bernhard is one of those acts – her compatriot Kathy Griffin, a recent visitor to these shores, is another – who trades less on any one skill than on force of stellar personality. That, and a four-decade career’s worth of names to drop. I give you a typical line from tonight’s show: “Recently both Diane Keaton and Lily Tomlin commented on my height … ” When such names can be rallied to boost your stature, why bother learning lines? Or adapting your material to the country you’re visiting? Bernhard’s show Sandemonium – some stories, some songs, some chat – is full of perplexing references to AARP (come again?), Nina Griscom (who she?) and Crown Heights. “I’m just trying things out,” she says. “Tomorrow night I won’t talk about things you don’t know about.” Which is great news – for tomorrow night’s audience. As for tonight’s – well, we get the crib sheets and the parochial references, but we also get a winningly easy swagger to Bernhard’s performance. There’s a lot of love for her in the room, and she surfs it with style and occasional welcome self-irony. Which she needs, early on, as – before her well-heeled London crowd relaxes – several lines engineered to elicit whoops (on the upcoming Roseanne reboot: “Nancy is back!”) are greeted with uncertain silence. You can almost hear Bernhard recalibrating as anecdotes that might get US audiences hurling their baseball caps in the air are received here with frigidity. “Isn’t that a great story?,” Bernhard is reduced to asking, anxiety barely concealed. But too often the answer is: no, it’s not. It’s a mildly amusing observation (about gun crime, say, or bitcoin) that she’s not really bothered to process into comedy. In many instances, her stories peter out before coalescing into anything resembling a point: the one about going to see Hello, Dolly! on Broadway; the one about finding a $50 bill on the sidewalk. She recites an email exchange with Jane Fonda, which relies on its protagonists’ star power for its limited comic charge. A later section finds Bernhard reading out small ads and fragments of conversation she’s overheard on the subway, barely any of which are notably funny, although our host’s emphatic, sarcastic delivery almost persuades you into thinking otherwise. She keeps it passably entertaining because she’s a good sport, and has a few neat lines in her locker (including one about her dad’s girlfriend, “who bedazzles scenes of the desert on sweatshirts – don’t underestimate Bonnie!”). Then there are the songs, not all of which convince, in a venue that exposes Bernhard’s voice to close scrutiny. Backed by a three-piece band led by Mitch Kaplan, she pulls off the rockier numbers best, including Patti Smith’s The People Have the Power, while her closing medley of Let It Be, Let It Go and Take on Me by A-ha is endearing in its oddity. It’s a genial if casually thrown together 75 minutes – which, had I paid the £50-£100 ticket price, I might have felt less inclined to indulge. • At Ronnie Scott’s, London, until 23 February.

With Joyce bowing to the inevitable on Friday and confirming that he will quit his leadership positions and go to the backbench after two weeks of ceaseless controversy about his private life, McCormack is considered to be the frontrunner to replace him. McCormack, who will be backed by social conservatives, made a pitch that he could unify the party after the Joyce turmoil, and would stand up for the interests of regional Australians. “When water rights were challenged in my electorate, I crossed the floor to get a better deal. When a big American company came knocking to take over GrainCorp, I stood up for our farmers and opposed it,” McCormack said in a statement after Joyce’s resignation. “As I said in my inaugural speech to parliament in 2010: I promise not to be silent when I ought to speak.” While McCormack is the frontrunner, fellow New South Wales National David Gillespie has also confirmed he will throw his hat in the ring when the Nationals meet in Canberra on Monday. In his pitch to colleagues, Gillespie also positioned himself as a unity candidate, and said he would like to put “new issues” on the agenda such as federal state relations, the GST carve-up, small businesses getting a better deal out of industrial relations, “and the perpetual problem of federation dysfunction”. “We have so many Council of Australian Governments agendas and there’s always and argy-bargy with mixed responsibilities, mixed funding, we need to really define who’s in charge of what [between the state and commonwealth],” he said. It is also possible that Queensland’s David Littleproud, an ally of Joyce and promoted by the former party leader in last year’s ministerial reshuffle, could run. Victorian Darren Chester – controversially punted by Joyce in the same ministerial reshuffle last year – confirmed on Friday he would not stand for the party leadership, and threw his support publicly behind McCormack. Chester said the looming leadership transition was an opportunity to “reset the Nationals” and bring the party together after a period of division. Joyce confirmed he would go to the backbench after weeks of controversy and round-the-clock media reporting about his affair with former staffer and now partner, Vikki Campion, who is pregnant with his child. The deputy prime minister was publicly excoriated by Malcolm Turnbull for his conduct, and Joyce did not inform the prime minister about his decision to resign in advance of telling reporters on Friday afternoon. Instead he told the acting prime minister, Mathias Cormann, of his plans. Asked why he got the news and Turnbull did not, Cormann said: “These are two strong personalities.” The Nationals deputy leader, Victorian Bridget McKenzie, paid tribute to Joyce, saying there had been no fiercer advocate for regional Australia. She said voters in regional Australia “were never in any doubt about who he was backing”. McKenzie said Joyce’s decision was the right one for the National party and the Turnbull government, and his departure would allow the government to focus on its agenda. She confirmed she would not run for the leadership on Monday morning, and would “not run a running commentary on Monday’s meeting”. “I like us to have our conversations indoors,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/24/labors-fence-sitting-on-adani-has-become-a-double-backflip","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-24T00:42:20Z","webTitle":"Labor's fence-sitting on Adani has become a double backflip | Katharine Murphy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/24/labors-fence-sitting-on-adani-has-become-a-double-backflip","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/24/labors-fence-sitting-on-adani-has-become-a-double-backflip","fields":{"headline":"Labor's fence-sitting on Adani has become a double backflip","bodyText":"The backflip is standard operating procedure in professional politics, we all know that, but the double backflip is a somewhat rarer event. Yet under the cover of yet another seismic convulsion inside the Turnbull government, Bill Shorten looks to be lining up for the dubious double on the controversial Adani coal mine. After signalling quite clearly in late January that Labor would toughen its position on the project, the Labor leader has cooled off noticeably on that notion over the past week or so. Just before David Feeney announced he would resign from parliament because he couldn’t prove he was eligible to sit in the lower house, triggering a byelection in his lower house seat of Batman, Shorten used an appearance at the National Press Club to telegraph a shift on the mine. Labor had perched uncomfortably on the fence on Adani for a very long time, with a stock formulation along the lines of we don’t like it, but if the project has been through approvals, it should be welcomed on the basis it will create jobs, and by the way, we won’t give it a cent of taxpayer money. Climate groups had been active with Shorten over the summer break, trying to persuade him to adopt a legal option of stopping the mine. The Labor leader changed the working formulation on the project in late January, and backed in the putative shift in the weeks immediately following, suddenly revving up the negative environmental impacts of the project. With the pivot in full flight, Shorten jumped on a story by my Guardian Australia colleagues, Amy Remeikis and Michael Slezak, suggesting that Adani had submitted an altered laboratory report while appealing a fine for contaminating wetlands near the Great Barrier Reef. “If Adani is relying on false information, that mine doesn’t deserve to go ahead,” the Labor leader thundered. It became known that the party was examining legal triggers to stop the project, perhaps overhauling the Environmental Protection Biodiversity and Conversation [EPBC] Act to insert a “climate trigger”, perhaps reopening an assessment because of the negative impact of the project on water, or on the health of the Great Barrier Reef. The Adani pivot, which had been tightly held in Labor’s leadership group (where a lot of issues are tightly held), then went to the shadow cabinet for a discussion. There were, and are, a range of views about how hard to go. One significant internal player, Anthony Albanese, nailed his colours to the mast publicly this week, declaring (before any formal decision) that Labor wasn’t going to overhaul the EPBC Act to stop a mine that had already been through the relevant approvals. The shadow climate minister, Mark Butler, fellow left winger and Albanese ally in an institutional sense, has a different view. He’s been on the record for months opposing the project, and he’s not alone in having that view. Shortly after the shadow cabinet discussion, momentum drained from the redux. There was also another complication. The mining union made it known publicly that Labor should not harden its position on the Carmichael project, because if it did, it would trigger a divisive internal debate about the future of coal – a debate the party wasn’t ready to have. With institutional forces in play internally, the tectonic plates shifting, Shorten scampered up to Queensland over this past week to trial a line that Labor didn’t care for Adani, but did care for coal and coal miners, and a Labor government would look after Queensland with an industry policy that would deliver a pipeline of blue collar jobs. Presumably there will now be a period of settling to determine whether attempting to be all things to all people actually flies with the voting public. Where it is unlikely to fly is in Batman, where the Greens have been running an anti-Adani ground campaign against the ALP for months, a campaign local activists will intensify over this weekend, with Labor’s equivocations on the project now built into the scripts for the Greens door knockers and the phone bankers. Perhaps at a political level that doesn’t matter much to Shorten, as hard heads have been pessimistic about Labor’s chances of holding the seat given that area of Melbourne has been in the process of going Green. But a few things will matter to Labor at the next federal election. One will be having a climate policy that appeals to progressive as well as traditional voters. Another will be having a leader who isn’t perceived by voters as a flip-flopper, or a climate warrior of convenience. While Labor can’t and shouldn’t forget blue collar workers and succumb entirely to the post materialist sensibilities of its inner urban constituency, toughening its line on Adani represented an opportunity for Labor to try to unify the progressive left, which has engaged in poisonous recriminations as a consequence of the toxic climate wars which have divided Australian politics for more than a decade. As well as settling at least one ongoing war with the Greens, opposing the project would also have the added benefit of enlisting a flotilla of progressive activist groups to bolster its campaign efforts at the next federal poll. The #StopAdani campaign is the biggest civil society action seen in Australia since the Franklin campaign. Best have that wind in your sails rather than sailing into that headwind. And of course, there’s the substance. While Labor can perhaps defer the future of coal debate that the Construction, Mining and Energy Union conceptualises, doubtless correctly, as a looming rupture in the party and the wider movement, but that debate can’t be avoided forever. Butler in a speech to the Sydney Institute this week made it plain why it can’t be avoided. The corporate world is not avoiding it. Regulators are not avoiding it. Insurers aren’t avoiding it. If institutions in this country stick their heads in the sand, and fail to get serious about policies to constrain greenhouse gas emissions, Butler correctly pointed to the potential for future litigation to “recover damages for losses incurred as a result of climate change from people who should have prevented those losses from occurring”. “One-eyed reliance on scenarios that pretend that the world is not changing is simply unsustainable and, potentially, legally negligent,” Butler said. “Investors are already voicing their expectations that companies do better in this area. But government and regulators clearly have a role to play in improving standards as well.” If the world is to meet the climate targets agreed in the Paris deal, the reality no politician or political party can now avoid is simple. More coal will have to remain in the ground."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/feb/23/snapchat-redesign-scandal-kylie-jenner-what-went-wrong","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-24T06:00:07Z","webTitle":"'We're watching a company explode': is Snapchat becoming irrelevant?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/23/snapchat-redesign-scandal-kylie-jenner-what-went-wrong","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/feb/23/snapchat-redesign-scandal-kylie-jenner-what-went-wrong","fields":{"headline":"'We're watching a company explode': is Snapchat becoming irrelevant?","bodyText":"More than 1.2m Snapchat users signed a petition urging the company to reverse its “annoying” redesign – but it was a single tweet from Kylie Jenner that may have caused real damage. After the celebrity tweeted “sooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore? Or is it just me” to her 24m followers, shares of the app’s parent company Snap plummeted 6% – a $1.3bn drop in market value that launched a fresh cycle of embarrassing headlines. But some analysts and Snapchatters said this was more than just a one-day PR snafu. Facing backlash from brands and influencers and ongoing competition from Facebook and newer apps like Musical.ly, another platform hugely popular among children, Snapchat is suffering from a larger existential crisis, and it’s unclear how it will recover. “We’re watching a company explode into bits,” said Eric Schiffer, CEO of private equity firm Patriarch Organization, arguing that the redesign scandal was the “greatest app debacle” he had ever seen in Silicon Valley: “This is a kiss of death to a brand like Snapchat with their base that has stuck with them.” The redesign, launched earlier this month, featured substantial interface changes, including distinguishing content between friends and publishers and reorganizing Snapchat Stories, which are videos and photos that disappear after 24 hours. While major changes to social media platforms often spark brief waves of criticism, the Snapchat controversy could have longer-term impacts, and is just the latest in a series of struggles. “The whole thing is an absolute mess,” said Scott Levy, CEO of social media agency Fuel Online, noting that his firm generally advises clients not to spend resources on Snapchat. “People are not using it any more. On top of that, you’re getting public celebrity backlash.” Snap has recently suffered steep losses as Instagram, owned by Facebook, has attracted hundreds of millions of users to its Stories feature, which functions like Snapchat. “A lot of my friends were saying they were going to delete it,” said Claire Pachter, an 18-year-old California high school student who has been using Snapchat for about six years and hated the redesign. “It’s so ugly and it’s really hard to understand.” Despite the viral criticisms, Snapchat said this week the new design was here to stay. That’s a risky strategy that could cause serious problems if more users leave Snapchat and the stock suffers further, said Michael Pachter, a Wedbush Securities analyst and Claire’s father: “They clearly didn’t do their homework in testing with users and anticipating reaction.” Pressure increased on Thursday when makeup brand Maybelline asked its followers if it should quit Snapchat given that its “views have dropped dramatically”. A Snapchat spokesman said the goal of the redesign was to make the app “more personal for everyone”, adding in an email: “This new foundation is just the beginning and we will always be grateful for any feedback from our community as we roll out new products.” While Instagram has continued to dominate, other lesser-known apps have also grown in popularity, posing further threats to Snapchat. Musical.ly is a lip-synching app that launched as a gimmick and has grown into a massive video-sharing platform that has attracted millions of teens, turning some of them into stars. It combines features of Instagram, Snapchat and Vine and has expanded at the same time Snapchat’s growth slowed following the launch of Instagram Stories. Although Musical.ly has a different and younger audience than Snapchat, the music video app is heading in a positive direction, said Schiffer: “It’s only going upwards.” Snapchat, he said, is heading toward “irrelevancy”. Bilal Khan, a Pakistani singer and actor, said he used Snapchat to connect with fans and has seen a drop in views since the redesign. He has no plans, however, to leave the app: “I guess I just have to accept it and work with it.” Not all Snapchatters are complaining. Cyrene Quiamco, a popular Snapchat influencer who goes by CyreneQ, said she thought people were overreacting and argued that Snapchat has built a unique community that other apps can’t replace. “It just takes time to get used to … I’m not too worried,” said Quiamco, 28, who visited Snap headquarters in Los Angeles this week. Snapchat and its audience would persist, she said: “I don’t think it’s going away anytime soon.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/feb/24/winter-olympics-2018-day-15-from-pyeongchang-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-24T14:48:37Z","webTitle":"Winter Olympics: curling, cross-country skiing and more – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/feb/24/winter-olympics-2018-day-15-from-pyeongchang-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/feb/24/winter-olympics-2018-day-15-from-pyeongchang-live","fields":{"headline":"Winter Olympics: curling, cross-country skiing and more – as it happened","bodyText":"Canada win hockey bronze: The Canadians wanted gold, but have to settle for bronze as they see off the Czech Republic 6-4. Interestingly, injured Canada net-minder Ben Scrivens, who played no part in this match, has pulled a full John Terry and has dressed in full kit, and that’s a lot of kit, including his helmet, to join in the celebrations. Czech’s bouncing back! That bronze medal hockey match isn’t over yet! It’s Canada 6-4 Czech Republic with 1min 40sec left in what’s turning out to be a thrilling conclusion. Canada lead Czech Republic in the ice hockey: With just a couple of minutes to go in the men’s ice hockey bronze medal match, Canada are firmly in control. They lead the Czech’s 6-2. Ester Ledecka has made history by winning gold in two sports - the Alpine super-G and the Parallel giant slalom. Arguably the story of the Games. Billy Morgan takes bronze in the men’s Big air to lift Britain’s medal tally to five - the highest in a single Winter Games in the country’s history. Sebastien Toutant of Canada takes gold. Switzerland’s Nevin Galmarini wins gold in the men’s Parallel giant slalom, pipping South Korea’s Lee Sangho. It’s been a good day for the Swiss all round - with gold in the Alpine team event too. Finland’s Iivo Niskanen puts in a marathon effort to win the 50km cross-country ski. Both of Britain’s four-man bobsleigh teams are out of medal contention after the initial runs. The British women’s curling team miss out on bronze after going for the win with the final shot of their match against Japan. Eve Muirhead had the courage to take on a potentially match-winning shot, but lacked the composure to make it. Team GB speak: “The shot was there and of course we went for it,” says Eve Muirhead, talking to the BBC. “As a skip it’s hard when you miss with the last shot. We’ve battled so hard and it’s sad that we’re going home with nothing. We had control in the last end and unfortunately it just didn’t work out. It’s going to take a long time to sink in. It’s hard when you don’t make that last shot because that’s what you practice for day in and day out. “The Olympics is a hard gig and unless you’re here you don’t see that. We played our hearts out but Japan played well. I’m absolutely devastated, I’m gutted. I’m gutted for myself, I’m gutted for my team and for everyone who helped us along the way. It’s going to take a long time to sink in.” Great Britain 3-5 Japan Great Britain had the hammer and Eve Muirhead at the chance to win the match for Great Britain with her final stone. She went for it, but her gamble didn’t come off as she knocked the Japan stone into the button. Japan take the bronze and their players hug each other , the tears flowing freely. Great Britain go home with nothing after going for the shot to win the bronze, but coming up short. Great Britain 3-4 Japan A match that’s cagier than London Zoo edges towards its conclusion. Japan take one in the ninth end to leave Great Britain trailing going into the final end. They need one to take the match to an extra end, or that still elusive two to snatch the bronze from Japan. Crucially, Great Britain have the hammer in the 10th end. Great Britain 3-3 Japan: The tit-for-tat continues with Japan taking a point. Great Britain have the hammer going into the ninth end. They’ll probably be happy to blank this one and take the hammer into the 10th end. The match is entering its knockings and we’ve yet to see either team score more than a one. Great Britain 3-2 Japan: A wonderful final shot from Eve Muirhead leaves Satsuki Fujisawa with a tough task to knock her stone out of the house. The Japanese skip does exactly that to blank the end. Her team is behind but has the hammer in the eighth end. Fujisawa is beaming - they seem very happy with life, these Japanese curlers. If smiling was a winter Olympic sport, they’d be top of the podium. Nana Takagi (Japan) takes speed skating gold: It’s gold for Japan in the women’s mass start final, with Nana Takagi finishing ahead of South Korea’s Kim Bo-Reum. Irene Schouten of the Netherlands has finished in third place. Great Britain 3-2 Japan: The sixth end finishes a blank, with Japan retaining the hammer for the seventh. Can they take a two? Great Britain 3-2 Japan: This is attritional, tight, bad, very boring curling. If Jose Mourinho was a team skip, this is the kind of curling he would play. The teams continue to exchange ones, but Eve Muirhead can consider herself unlucky not to have bagged herself that elusive two in the fifth end. The players will now have a short break in this women’s curling bronze medal match. Great Britain 2-2 Japan: This game has yet to spark into anything approaching life. Team GB had a stone in the button, but a good throw from Japan’s Satsuki nudged it out. The end finishes with four stones very close together, but Japan taking a point. Sample dialogue from the fourth end: “Line’s good, guys! Line’s good! It needs to curl! Line’s good! GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! It NEEDS TO CURL!!! HARD!!!” Great Britain 2-1 Japan: Eve Muirhead attempts to blank the end with the last throw, but leaves her stone in the house while knocking out Japan’s. Muirhead is displeased, as she wanted to go for a two in the next end. Great Britain 1-1 Japan: It’s all square after two quiet ends, with Japan taking one in the second. It remains very quiet in the arena, which makes it easy to hear the conversations between the various participants. Great Britain 1-0 Japan: In an eerily quiet and only half-full Gangneung Hockey Centre, Great Britain get off to a decent start. They’ve taken the lead with one of the 10 ends gone. Play is underway in the women’s curling bronze medal match between Great Britain and Japan. Both teams are on the sheet and end one is in its infancy. Russian bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva has admitted an anti-doping violation and has been disqualified from the Winter Olympics, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has said. As the International Olympic Committee (IOC) were meeting to discuss Russia’s possible Olympic reinstatement, CAS said in a statement that Sergeeva had tested positive in an out-of-competition test for the banned heart condition product trimetazidine two days before her race. Sergeeva finished 12th with Anastasia Kocherzhova in the women’s bobsleigh competition in Pyeongchang on Wednesday. “The athlete has admitted the anti-doping rule violation; she is disqualified from the women’s bobsleigh event,” it said. “The results obtained by the team at the same event are disqualified with all resulting consequences; the athlete is excluded from Pyeongchang 2018; her accreditation shall be withdrawn. These proceedings shall continue before the CAS between the IBSF (International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation) and the athlete after the end of the Games; the IOC is no longer a party to this procedure. - Reuters. The Great Britain women’s curling team will do battle with Japan in the bronze medal match at 11.05am GMT. Eve Muirhead and her team were beaten in the semi-final by Sweden yesterday, but must rouse themselves for this third place play-off. While Billy Morgan’s bronze medal in the men’s Big Air means Britain have reached their medal target of five, as my colleague Sean Ingle pointed out yesterday, Team Muirhead need to beat Japan “to avoid searching questions about their £5.6m funding from UK Sport”. You can read Slalom Seanie’s report on that semi-final below ... This is a huge win for the USA curling team: There’ll be a Cool Runnings or Dodgeball style plucky underdog movie made about these guys some day. Four-time Olympian John Shuster and his team of US curling rejects have prevailed in the most unlikely of circumstances. The former bartender came ninth at Sochi and was thrown off his country’s performance training programme (one he thought he’d be running) and so assembled a team of his own: Tyler George, John Landsteiner and Matt Hamilton, who gloried as a sort of self-styled Team Rejects before winning the 2015 national championships and coming fifth in the worlds. It was at this point that USA Curling saw the error of their ways and welcomed them back into the fold. It is the ultimate feel-good underdog story ... There are handshakes all around as the USA take a thoroughly deserved win the men’s curling. They beat Sweden 10-7 to take gold, with Switzerland taking the bronze. The American team’s No1 an will be pleased. Men’s curling: Sweden pull two points back in the penultimate end to make it USA 10-7 Sweden with just one end to go. It being a gold medal match, the Swedish team opt not to concede the match, but nothing short of a miracle will get them out of jail here. Incredible scenes at the curling! The USA have just taken five points (five!) from the eighth end. That is a massive score. The USA had the hammer, Nicklas Edin left a double and John Shuster, in his fourth Olympic games, made no mistake. USA lead 10-5 with two ends to go. There’s no chance of them losing from here ... Lee Sang-ho became the first South Korean to win a snowboarding medal when he claimed silver in the parallel giant slalom. Despite never having won a World Cup event, the 22-year-old, who is ranked 10th in the world, was regarded as the host nation’s best medal hope in the freestyle skiing and snowboarding events, albeit a slim one. With thousands of fans packing the stands at Phoenix Snow Park, many of them waving South Korean flags, Lee admitted he had felt the pressure. “Before I started competition I was quite nervous because this is my first Olympic Games and I also wanted a good result to return the gratitude and thanks that I owe to the people who have supported me,” he told reporters. If Lee was nervous, he did not show it as he moved through the heats before edging past Slovenia’s Jan Kosir and reaching the final. With Lee guaranteed a medal, the home crowd went wild, spurring him on in the final against Switzerland’s Nevin Galmarini, who won by 0.43 seconds. “It is great honour to be the first Korean medallist in snowboarding,” said Lee. “I wish that with this medal then it could create an opportunity for the Korean government and people to support Alpine snowboarding so we can have more competitive snowboarders in the future.” - Reuters Curling: It’s all square with the score at 5-5 with three ends to go in the gold medal match between USA and Sweden. Swedish skip is not playing well and is looking fairly fed up with life, but he rescues a point for his side with the final throw of the end. There are three left and USA have the hammer in end eight. Good day, everybody. Loud is the whooping and a hollering from the curling arena, where Sweden and America are contesting the men’s gold medal match. It’s 5-4 to the USA and we’re in End 7. In the sixth, Swedish skip Niklas Edin had a poor penultimate throw, looking gutted as he left an AMerican stone in the house. For the Americans, John Shuster scored two to put his side back in the lead.

There’s more Curling medal action at 20:05 when the British women battle Japan for bronze.

There’s another battle for bronze at 21:10 when the Czech Republic and Canada duke it out in the men’s Ice hockey. At 20:00 the women kick off a couple of hours of Speed skating action for both sexes in the first semi-final of the night.

From Reuters. A Canadian athlete competing at the Winter Olympics has been charged with stealing a car in the early hours of Saturday morning, South Korean police said. A police official in charge of international crime at Gangwon Provincial Police Agency said the athlete, his wife and manager had gotten into an unlocked car that had been left unoccupied with the engine running in Pyeongchang. The official said the manager then drove off with the car before it was stopped by police. The manager has additionally been charged with drunk-driving. Once the investigation is complete, the results would be sent to the prosecution, the official said, adding that unless the alleged offence was deemed a serious crime, they would be able to leave the country after paying a fine. At a news conference on Saturday, Canadian Olympic Committee CEO Chris Overholt said they were aware of the situation but declined to confirm the identities of the three. “We can confirm that an incident occurred involving the police around midnight Friday or early morning Saturday,” Overholt said. “We have confirmation that individuals attached to our team are involved in the investigation and are cooperating. We take this matter very seriously. “However, until we know the results of the investigation we’re not really in a position to comment further.” We’re into end six in the men’s curling and it’s still anyone’s game. Sweden are back in the driving seat at 4-3 but the way this is going, it’s going to go right to the wire. From the Press Association. Russian bobsleigh pilot Nadezhda Sergeeva has been disqualified from the Winter Olympics after admitting to an anti-doping rule violation. The Court of Arbitration for Sport’s anti-doping division announced her expulsion, saying Sergeeva had tested positive for the heart drug trimetazidine. Her anti-doping rule violation follows that of Alexander Krushelnitsky, who on Thursday was stripped of the mixed doubles curling bronze medal he won with his wife, Anastasia Bryzgalova. Sergeeva and her brakewoman Anastasia Kocherzhova finished 12th in the women’s two-person bobsleigh, which took place on Tuesday and Wednesday, but their results have now been expunged. The US sneak into the lead 3-2 in the curling after an incredibly tight call to finish the fourth end.

The crowd don’t care about the position, roaring him on as he gives them a wave on the final straight. Great to see. It’s all square again in the curling too. The US hit back immediately against Sweden to make it 2-2. It’s shaping up as a tight one. Excitement she wrote. It’s all over. Niskanen races home. Bolshunov in second with his Russian countryman Larkov taking bronze. Brilliant from Niskanen who looked like his legs had gone at one stage. Well played that man. No sooner have I posted that then Niskanen makes a push for it. Out of nowhere he’s put Bolshunov 10m behind him. We’re into the pointy end in the 50km cross-country ski. It’s Niskanen chasing Bolshunov into the last few kilometres, very little in it as they close in on the final sprint. The photo below tells you all you need to know. The pack are well behind them, four in a race for bronze - Larkov (Russia), Harvey (Canada), Sundby and Holand (both Norway). We’re just over the two-hour mark. It’s first blood to Sweden in the curling. They’re 2-0 up after the second end. The US trying to get back into it as we speak. A minimum of eight ends means there’s plenty of time for a turnaround though. Here’s the British man of the moment, Billy Morgan, in his own words after winning bronze in the big air, courtesy of PA. On his medal-winning trick: “A front-side 14 triple with mute and tail-grab - so I get a few more points for that double grab, but essentially it’s a triple cork frontside wipe.” On fear: “Today I was like, even if I completely wreck myself it doesn’t matter. I’m going to go and do it. Normally if I’m worried I just pie it off and go home. But today I was just, I’m going to go out and send it for the boys.” On friends and family: “My dad had an aneurysm in April. That was a heavy hit. He’s a big part of my life. But he’s come a long way and he’s at the pub watching. He’s called Mad Eddie. He’s nuts.” On Pyeonchang: “We got some electric scooter things. We had a wow good time. We were blazing through the forests. Anything like that does help. If I just sit in my room I go crazy.” On his former life: “I come from a very genuine background. I used to work on building sites to pay for my winters and that makes me a relatable dude. I loved working on the sites. I almost miss it, getting my shirt off, working on the roofs.” On partying: “I come from the last generation of snowboarders who can get away with it. I use it as a distraction. I get scared a lot and I worry about it and it does help to have a couple of drinks, relax and not think about the scary stuff I have to do.” The men’s curling final is under way now too with Sweden taking on the US. Who doesn’t love a bit of curling? And of course, you can always recreate the joy of curling in your own home if you’ve been bitten by the bug. The good news for every other cross-country skier out there is Norwegian golden boy Hoesflot Klaebo has shrugged his shoulders and decided three golds will do this year after skipping today’s mass start 50km race to head home. Can’t really blame him. A 50km trek through the snow or being showered with laurels and champagne at Oslo airport? Sounds like an easy choice to me. That’s enough plaudits for Ledecka for now (I’m sure there’ll be more over the next couple of days). Let’s get to the action in the men’s 50km cross-country … if you can call a gruelling trudge through the snow ‘action’. The current leader is Finland’s Iivo Niskanen with Russia’s Alexander Bolshunov 12 seconds behind and Alexey Poltoranin (Kazakhstan) slumping back to third a further four seconds back. There’s a sizeable gap between those guys and the rest. Well over a minute in fact. Under 20km to go though so anything can happen. AP are first with the Ledecka report. Ester Ledecka has won the second leg of an unheard-of Olympic double, taking the gold medal in snowboarding’s parallel giant slalom to go with her surprise skiing victory in the Alpine super-G earlier in the games. The Czech star is the first to win gold medals in both sports. She is top-ranked on the snowboarding circuit but never a threat, until now, in skiing. She outraced Selina Joerg of Germany to the line in the final and won by .46 seconds, a much more comfortable margin than the .01-second edge in the super-G race that left her staring at the clock in shock. This time, it was no surprise. Ledecka crossed the line and simply pumped her fist, then offered a long congratulatory hug to Joerg. The Swiss proves too good, ruining what would have been a fairytale for South Korea - not that the home crowd mind too much. It’s an excellent silver medal for Lee nonetheless. The emotion gets the better of Galmarini as he collapses to the ground in celebration. He had the tighter line all the way down. Men’s final now, and home favourite Lee will take on Galmarini in the battle for parallel giant slalom gold. The crowd are loving this. Nothing to separate them in the opening section. Kosir slips slightly but then makes it up - and when Dufour slips too, it’s all over. The bronze goes to Kosir. Phew. Almost forgot there’s a men’s event too. Small final first. It’s Slovenia’s Kosir versus Frenchman Dufour. Awesome achievement. Joerg pushes Jedecka all the way, but for the final quarter the Czech was always in control. Such composure with so much pressure on her shoulders. A gold medal in two disciplines. That’s bronze for Germany, and they’ll get another medal in the big final as Czech Ledecka takes on the German Joerg. History beckons for Ledecka. Hofmeister cruises to the bronze medal as her Russian opponent slips at the halfway mark. She was trailing slightly anyway. Hofmeister catches her breath at the finish then let’s out an almighty ‘woop’. Yep, he’s done it. It’s official. Lee will face Galmarini in the parallel giant slalom final. That was incredibly tight. Over to the women. Small final first. Zavarzina v Hofmeister. Good lord! What a finish. Lee sends the crowd into raptures with a comeback victory right on the line. So, so tight. Kosir looked like he had the edge for most of the run but Lee battled back admirably. It’s still not entirely clear if the result will stand... It’s neck and neck until about the halfway stage, then a mistake from Dufour gifts it to Galmarini. He’ll go through to the big final but who will he face? Next up it’s Zan Kosir of Slovenia against South Korea’s Lee Sangho. No prizes for guessing who the crowd are shouting for. Over to the men’s semis where Dufour (france) is facing Galmarini (Swiss). Big stakes. Who’s going to join her in the final? Zavarzina (OAR) versus Jeorg (Germany) go head to head in the other semi - but Zavarzina stumbles early and Joerg cruises down the slope to book her place in the showdown with Ledecka. Ledecka against Hofmeister in the first semi. It looks like Hofmeister is juuuust edging ahead but then she slips slightly to gift Ledecka a free run through to the next round - and a shot at history. First though, let’s head to the parallel giant slalom where the men are currently flying down the slopes. As mentioned (sort of) Ester Ledecka has won through her opening two knockout rounds in the women’s event, so the dream is still alive. There have been a couple of surprises so far, but perhaps the biggest was when a squirrel ran straight into the path of the oncoming Daniela Ulbing. What a time to forget where you’ve put your nuts. Afternoon everyone, thanks for joining me for the penultimate day of icy action from Pyeongchang. After two weeks of thrills, spills and chills, the finish line is in sight – although, speaking literally, that’s almost cruelly untrue for the men’s Cross-country skiers, who have just started a 50km jaunt through Alpensia. Let’s hope someone’s got some mulled wine and a log fire waiting for them at the end. I’ll come back to them soon, but first, like a confused Christmas ghost, I’ll run down what’s already happened and what’s coming up before returning to the present. In the men’s Big air, a final run full of crashes meant Billy Morgan, a ‘veteran’ at 28, sneaked onto the podium in bronze position to take the British tally to a record haul of five medals. It also meant Sebastien Toutant (Canada), who led after the second run, kept his place to win gold - as did silver medalist Kyle Mack (USA). In the Alpine team event, a dominant Switzerland saw off Austria in the final to take gold. The buzzing Norwegians took bronze with a tight victory over France. Coming up Here’s what is up for grabs, in terms of medals, for the rest of the day. All times are local – Pyeongchang is GMT +9, EST +14, AEDT -2, but our schedule will tell you the times wherever you are, should those timezones not apply. They’re battling it out in the knockout stages of the Parallel giant slalom as we speak, with the finals due to kick off at 14:28 (ladies first). All eyes are on Ester Ledecka, who is still very much in the mix as she seeks to follow up her gold in skiing with one on her snowboard. At 15:35 it’s the men’s Curling clash for gold between Sweden and the US. There’s more curling medal action at 20:05 when the women battle it out for bronze. Japan stand in the way of the British team. But can the Brits pick themselves up after the disappointment of that semi-final shellacking to Sweden? There’s another battle for bronze at 21:10 when the Czech Republic and Canada duke it out in the men’s Ice hockey. Canada will be favourites, but after that shock loss to Germany, their state of mind might not exactly be on the job. At 20:00 the women kick off a couple of hours of Speed skating action for both sexes in the first semi-final of the night. The women’s final starts at 21:30 with the men’s final rounding out the night at 22:00."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/24/wayne-swan-warns-centre-left-against-running-tame-economic-agenda","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T20:00:21Z","webTitle":"Wayne Swan warns centre left against running 'tame' economic agenda","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/24/wayne-swan-warns-centre-left-against-running-tame-economic-agenda","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/24/wayne-swan-warns-centre-left-against-running-tame-economic-agenda","fields":{"headline":"Wayne Swan warns centre left against running 'tame' economic agenda","bodyText":"The progressive left needs to “set the economic agenda and to ruthlessly organise to implement it” or risk being over-run by the populist right, which is in the ascendancy because of a global crisis in governance, according to the former Labor treasurer Wayne Swan. Swan will use a speech to a Sydney conference on Saturday to warn centre left political parties against running “a tame and insipid economic agenda”, arguing if that’s the offering, they will be “run over by rightwing populists who use race and gender politics to camouflage a wealth concentration agenda”. Swan’s public call comes as the ALP national left will caucus in Sydney in preparation for the party’s mid-year national conference, and renew calls for Labor to adopt a so-called “Buffett rule”, which would make high wealth individuals pay a minimum level of tax. A position paper prepared by left faction convenors Andrew Giles and Pat Conroy, seen by Guardian Australia, declares that “attacking inequality, whether it be in income, wealth or physical access to jobs and the broader society must be the raison d’être of a Labor government”. “Labor must examine alternate methods of raising revenue that attack speculation and inequality, such as, but not limited to, the Buffett tax and Tobin tax.” The left’s decision to revive the internal conversation about the Buffett rule defies repeated attempts by the Labor leader Bill Shorten and the shadow treasurer Chris Bowen to shut down debate on the proposal. The new left manifesto also calls for reform to “open up Labor’s structures”, including allowing rank and file party members to have a say in the selection of Senate candidates. It argues Australia “is on the wrong path – we are headed towards a society in which there is an unbridgeable gulf between haves and have-nots” and it warns the ALP “cannot be half-hearted in our opposition to neoliberal austerity”. “Inequality is close to, if not at, record highs. Wages are stagnating while corporate profits are booming. Families are being drowned by the pressure of insecure workplaces with the rise of casualisation and mass underemployment.” Conroy says: “With the growing dissatisfaction with Australian politics and the state of the economy, Labor has a great opportunity to radically shift the economic debate, but we have to be bold and, above all, progressive”. “We have to deliver for working people – anything less would be a betrayal of our historic mission.” As the left deliberates, Swan, a Queensland rightwinger, will take up similar points at a weekend conference focussing on economic and social inequality. The gathering will feature speakers from the US and the UK including Neera Tanden, the president of the Centre for American Progress, Harriet Harman, the former deputy leader of UK Labour, and Tom McMahon, former executive director of the Democratic National Committee. The former Labor treasurer will argue the election of Donald Trump in the United States may not be “a temporary blip or even a wake-up call – without an adequate alternative agenda, his election might mark the beginning of a long-term rightwing supremacy”. Swan will argue Australia’s record of mixing strong economic growth with social equity has contained the rise of reactionary and populist political figures – so buttressing that tradition is vitally important. “The difference between Australia having a Hanson in the Senate and the United States having a Trump in the White House is as simple as the difference between the US having 30 years of wage stagnation and Australia having 30 years of wage growth,” he will say."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/23/teen-held-in-isolated-cell-for-10-months-in-western-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T09:05:49Z","webTitle":"Teen still in isolated cell after 10 months in Western Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/23/teen-held-in-isolated-cell-for-10-months-in-western-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/23/teen-held-in-isolated-cell-for-10-months-in-western-australia","fields":{"headline":"Teen still in isolated cell after 10 months in Western Australia","bodyText":"A teenager allegedly held in solitary confinement in a Western Australia detention centre is still in the unit more than 300 days later. His mother says he is seeking to transfer to the adult prison because “any place has to be better than here”. In January Guardian Australia revealed an Amnesty investigation into allegations two teenagers had been held in isolated cells for more than 250 days, and three allegedly subjected to extended periods of solitary confinement. Guardian Australia understands one of the two boys was sent back to the general detention population this week, but another remains in the notorious cells formerly known as the Harding Unit, now called the Intensive Support Unit. “He’s getting his required time out of the cell at the moment but they aren’t giving answers about when he’ll get back to general population,” his mother said. “He’s 302 days now and he’s done nothing to still be in there.” While serving his sentence at Banksia Hill, her son is also awaiting trial on charges related to his involvement in a destructive incident at the centre in May. He has been in the unit since the incident. Since the reports he has been given a few hours out for a couple of days each month, his mother said. He was also issued a deportation notice for when he finishes his sentence, despite moving to Australia from New Zealand when he was 10 years old, and having no support network there. In January former Northern Territory juvenile detainee, Dylan Voller, attempted to meet with the teenager - who is now 18 - but was refused entry to Banksia Hill. According to the teen’s mother, a guard took her son aside to ask why Voller would want to visit him, making the remark: “so two abused boys can have a cry together?” “I was really angry about that,” she said. WA Corrections said it was unaware of any such allegations but noted there were mechanisms for detainees to make confidential complaints. “The department is responsible for the ongoing support and wellbeing of young people and takes any allegations of mistreatment seriously.” It said the focus of the Intensive Support Unit was to help detainees reintegrate into the general population. The teenager’s mother said she is frustrated and angry that her son remains in an isolated unit after 10 months, being told he has no prospect of leaving it. She said he told her he would apply to transfer to the adult prison, than “any place has to be better than here”. “It’s fair that he’s let out of Harding, he’s done nothing to warrant being in there apart from doing an interview with Amnesty International,” she said. The woman, who lives in Kalgoorlie and is unable to regularly visit her son, said in January she was not told her son’s mental health had declined and he had become a continuous self-harmer. “He put on a brave face for quite a long time and I just don’t trust that he isn’t doing the same thing,” she said. “I can’t physically tell whether he’s ok [because I’m in Kalgoorlie].” She also claimed she had sought to speak to her son’s psychologist but had been denied since the original stories came out. Writing on Facebook, the woman called for supporters to check in to the detention centre in protest. “The government has ignored our cries to release the boys from the isolation unit, and back in to general population,” she said. “As a mum, I have pleaded, I have threatened, I have done all I can. I am now asking everyone to stand with me, my son and the other boys who have been severely mistreated.” Amnesty’s original allegations, drawn from interviews with the detainees, included: deprivation of family contact and education, excessive use of force and disproportionate restraints, degrading treatment and lack of adequate medical treatment – including psychological care. WA Corrections said young people were not held in solitary confinement at Banksia Hill. “Some young people in the department’s care have complex needs or require targeted care and intervention, as a result of being at risk of harm to themselves or others, and may be accommodated in the Intensive Support Unit,” the spokesman said. “While being accommodated in the Intensive Support Unit, young people are provided with programs, education and daily activities. They have access to the same privileges as other young people and participate in a structured day between 70am and 7.30pm.” An investigation into the allegations by the Inspector of Custodial Services is expected to report in March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/feb/27/tuesday-best-tv-divorce-pedalling-dreams-fgm-detectives","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T06:20:13Z","webTitle":"Tuesday’s best TV: Divorce; Pedalling Dreams; The FGM Detectives","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/27/tuesday-best-tv-divorce-pedalling-dreams-fgm-detectives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/27/tuesday-best-tv-divorce-pedalling-dreams-fgm-detectives","fields":{"headline":"Tuesday’s best TV: Divorce; Pedalling Dreams; The FGM Detectives","bodyText":"Divorce 10.10pm, Sky Atlantic After all the craziness of series one, actually signing the divorce papers is surprisingly fuss-free for Frances (Sarah Jessica Parker) and Robert (Thomas Haden Church).

Stokes has not played for his country since his arrest in Bristol last September. He pleaded not guilty to affray at Bristol magistrates court this month and then flew to New Zealand. Since arriving on 16 February, the all‑rounder has been getting reacquainted with team‑mates and has been training the past week, including in Auckland where he was joined by Joe Root, Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes and Jonny Bairstow – the rested quartet for the Trans-Tasman T20 Tri-Series – while other players had some time off. What has helped the 26-year-old has been a hunger to keep himself as fit as possible to ensure a smooth transition back into the side, which has come after it was confirmed that Stokes would not need to be present for his first hearing at Bristol crown court on 12 March. Eoin Morgan has been impressed by the all‑rounder’s body and mind. “We’re expecting [him to play], providing there aren’t any hiccups,” the captain said. “He’s pulled up well over the last couple of days. Providing he gets through a little bit of bowling these next two days of prep, then he’ll be fit. If he’s not, it’s not a big decision for me to leave him out. “He’s travelled very well and he’s turned up incredibly fit. The bowling would be the hiccup if he did pick up a niggle or something where it might put him back but at the moment it’s looking good.” Two days out from the match, Stokes had a long batting session before turning his arm over for almost 10 overs’ worth of bowling at full tilt. Those close to him say he has never been fitter. There need not be a risk taken considering the volume of cricket on the horizon for Stokes. But the easiest time to pick him is in this opening match. A 4-1 ODI series victory against Australia without him was a confidence boost, but the poor showing in the Tri‑Series highlighted the value of an all‑rounder, not just Stokes, as England lacked options when their frontline bowlers went awry. Even if there is uncertainty over whether Stokes can get through his 10 overs – unless it is because of, say, a muscle injury rather than having to build up the stamina to bowl his full allocation – Morgan would have no qualms drafting him in. Similar to during the ICC Champions Trophy last year, when Stokes had a knee injury going into the tournament, he will not be relied upon to bowl his full allocation. “He could equally be picked as a batter,” Morgan said. “If he can’t bowl, there will be a reason behind that – a niggle or something. If he’s fine he should be able to play some part with the ball.” It looks like Alex Hales will miss out. The Nottinghamshire batsman, who this week signed an 18-month white-ball-only contract with his county, has struggled to get going since returning to the side, albeit starting at the less familiar position of No 3, with Jason Roy and Bairstow opening during the Australia ODI series. New Zealand are in red-hot form, having won eight ODIs on the bounce, with 3-0 and 5-0 wins against West Indies and Pakistan, the Champions Trophy holders, respectively. Morgan expects a tussle that will be a lot closer. “It is a big series. They went a long stretch of winning one‑day international cricket so they are a strong side particularly at home and we are going to have reproduce similar performances or better than we produced in Australia to win the series.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/23/leicester-stoke-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T12:17:31Z","webTitle":"Leicester City v Stoke City: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/23/leicester-stoke-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/23/leicester-stoke-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Leicester City v Stoke City: match preview","bodyText":"Leicester have lost some momentum in the league following a disappointing run that has been overshadowed by Riyad Mahrez’s antics.

Fight Brexit","bodyText":"Many years ago, I was outside the studio of the BBC’s Today programme waiting my turn to be interviewed about the latest sterling crisis. Alongside me were two gentlemen of a certain age who were keeping themselves to themselves and looked as though they would not hurt a fly. When my turn came, I said to the studio assistant: “As a matter of interest, who were those two gentlemen outside?” “Oh, them? They are the Militant Tendency.” For younger readers, the Militant Tendency were an extreme leftwing group who came very close to capturing the Labour party. Not all of them were as harmless-looking as those two, and it is to the eternal credit of Neil Kinnock and Roy Hattersley that they fought them off. Another important role was played by Denis Healey. Shortly before he died, the former Labour defence secretary and chancellor told me that he regarded beating Tony Benn to the post of deputy leader of the party in the early 1980s as one of his proudest achievements. Well, the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s Momentum movement, and the disturbing return of “deselection” of candidates not to the leadership’s liking, has revived unhappy memories of the early 80s among veteran Labour politicians and voters. Moreover, I have lost count of the people who are fed up with the Tories and wish Labour would get its act together in front of the open goal that is the May government’s craven approach to Brexit. Talking of which, there is a marvellous summary of the state the May government has reached in the forthcoming Johnson’s Brexit Dictionary, by Harry Eyres and George Myerson. In the spirit of Dr Johnson’s famous dictionary – he of the dictum “patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel” – they define Brexit as “a negotiating process in which no real negotiation ever gets done; a promise of trade deals that somehow fail to materialise; the taking back of control leading to ever-intensifying chaos; or a play by Samuel Beckett in which the main character never arrives”. I belong to a generation of men that is not easily moved to tears. If the situation were not so serious, all this stuff about “regulatory alignment” and “ambitious managed divergence” could easily reduce one to hysterical laughter. Our “negotiators” are intelligent men and women involved in the futile exercise of cherry-picking a barren tree – trying to have their cake and eat it when, oddly, we already possess the cake and are in danger of throwing away both it and the cherries. I have said before that the prospect of Brexit has made us a laughing stock around the world. Does it not mean anything to Mrs May and the Brexiters who have captured her that the only two world leaders who approve of this gadarene rush to the cliff are Trump and Putin? Some commentators have welcomed the way that Brexiters’ extreme demands over, for example, the “divorce bill”, have yielded to reality. But May still says we are leaving the customs union and the single market – the single market Kenneth Clarke regards as Margaret Thatcher’s greatest achievement. A recent Harvard survey of small- and medium-sized British businesses, conducted by Ed Balls, found that “the overwhelming majority” wished to stay in the customs union and “a large majority” wanted to remain in the single market. Mention of Ed Balls – much missed on the political scene – brings us back to the Labour party. It is about time Labour’s present leaders, and their influential advisers in the shadows, recognised that the health service they affect to believe in is being severely damaged by the threat of Brexit and their own shilly-shallying over the issue. Lord Kinnock, who fought so bravely against the extremist wing of the Labour party in the 1980s, has taken issue with Boris Johnson’s characteristically duplicitous claim that Brexit would be good news for the NHS. He says of Johnson: “He dodges the repeated reports from impeccable bodies that, since the referendum, the number of nurses coming to work in the NHS from the EU has fallen by 89% and the number leaving risen by 67%.” Moreover, the British Medical Association finds that a fifth of EU doctors working in the NHS plan to leave as a direct result of the prospect of Brexit. Kinnock makes no bones about it: Labour should be arguing for remaining in both the customs union and the single market. We face the biggest crisis most of us have experienced in our lifetimes. At present, just as it was over Suez in 1956, the country is split down the middle. Suez was recognised by the Observer as a catastrophic mistake. Subsequently this was acknowledged by majority opinion. Do we really have to wait for realisation to dawn until after the deluge? Labour leaders, please, for your country’s sake: wake up before it is too late!"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/feb/23/lulu-returns-to-west-end-after-three-decades-for-42nd-street","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T19:34:49Z","webTitle":"Lulu returns to West End after three decades for 42nd Street","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/feb/23/lulu-returns-to-west-end-after-three-decades-for-42nd-street","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/feb/23/lulu-returns-to-west-end-after-three-decades-for-42nd-street","fields":{"headline":"Lulu returns to West End after three decades for 42nd Street","bodyText":"Lulu is returning to the West End stage after an absence of more than 30 years to star in 42nd Street as the veteran diva Dorothy Brock. The Scottish singer has been a star since she was 15, with a career in pop music, film and theatre stretching back to the 1960s, and the unforgettable opening bellow of Shout!, her first hit record. She won the Eurovision song contest in Madrid in 1969 with Boom Bang-a-Bang. Her first major acting role came in 1967, when she starred with Sidney Poitier in To Sir, With Love, and she had a No 1 hit in the US with the title song. In the 1980s, she appeared in a string of big musicals in London, including Song and Dance in 1982 and Guys and Dolls in 1984. She was last seen in The Mystery of Edwin Drood, which closed after just 68 performances at the Savoy in 1987. She will take over from Sheena Easton from 19 March in the role of Brock, an ageing, jealous and vengeful star of the musical stage. The backstage musical has been a hit at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane since it opened in April last year. Lulu, 69 – born Marie McDonald McLaughlin Lawrie in Stirlingshire in 1948 and brought up in Glasgow – was making professional singing appearances from the age of 12. She recently completed an international concert tour, promoting an album of her own songs, Making Life Rhyme. She was awarded an OBE for services to music in 2000. Career highlights include her hit version of David Bowie’s The Man Who Sold the World, produced by Bowie himself, and her No 1 hit in 1983 for Relight My Fire, in collaboration with Take That. She was chosen for the Bond theme song The Man with the Golden Gun, in 1974, but later said she and Madonna, who recorded Die Another Day in 2002, had the worst Bond songs: “Except I think mine was probably the worst one ever. Mine was not a great song.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/09/invest-time-as-wisely-as-money-oliver-burkeman","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T15:00:51Z","webTitle":"Why you should invest your time as wisely as your money | Oliver Burkeman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/09/invest-time-as-wisely-as-money-oliver-burkeman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/09/invest-time-as-wisely-as-money-oliver-burkeman","fields":{"headline":"Why you should invest your time as wisely as your money","bodyText":"One of the oldest cliches in personal finance advice – “pay yourself first” – is a cliche because it works. And, to put it bluntly, it works because you’re weak. If you take a portion of your pay the moment you receive it, and squirrel it away into savings or for paying off debts, you probably won’t feel its absence when it comes to buying groceries, paying bills, etcetera. But if you approach things the other way round and “pay yourself last” – spending on necessities first, and saving what remains – you’ll often find there’s nothing left to save, because you spent it without noticing. True, paying yourself first isn’t infallible: it may not work if you live on the poverty line, try to save too much or have a credit-card addiction. But paying yourself last is a recipe for disaster, because it demands both endless willpower (to prevent indulgent purchases) and long-range planning (so you can properly weigh the benefits of any potential purchase against the benefits of saving). And humans are terrible at both. If you’re halfway decent with money, you probably knew this. But what you may not have realised – or I hadn’t, anyway, until I read a recent post by the cartoonist and creativity coach Jessica Abel – is that it works exactly the same with time. If there’s something you’re passionate about – from writing your novel to launching a business to spending more time with your kids – the only way to make it happen is to do a bit of it now, no matter how many urgent tasks are pressing in. “If you don’t save a bit of your time for you, now, out of every week,” Abel writes, “there is no moment in the future when you’ll magically be done with everything and have loads of free time.” To focus instead on “clearing the decks”, so as to make time later, is enormously tempting, but that’s equivalent to “paying yourself last”. And it fails for the same reason: in each moment, all those little expenditures of time will seem important. Many of them will be important, but you have neither the willpower nor long-term perspective to choose wisely between them, leaving plenty of time later for the big stuff. So don’t try. Do a little of the big stuff first. This is, of course, the insight embodied in the timeworn advice to work on your most important project for the first hour of each workday, or to schedule meetings with yourself, marking them in your calendar, so other commitments can’t intrude. But thinking in terms of “paying yourself first” turns these from one-off tips into a life philosophy: if you’re going to spend at least some of your time on the planet doing what matters to you most, you’d better actually start doing what matters most. It probably won’t feel great at first, as you’ll be actively resisting the momentum of busyness. Ironically, you may have to tolerate feeling less productive, as the tasks on those uncleared decks start to pile up. Yet you’ll still find that, if those tasks need doing, they get done. And if they don’t get done? Well, perhaps they didn’t need doing.

The Local Government Association (LGA) said councils in England would raise an estimated £1.1bn through higher council taxes in 2017-18, but this would not cover the £1.4bn lost through cuts to central government funding plus the higher wage bill of £1bn. Nearly half of English councils with responsibility for providing social care for adults and children will increase council tax by the maximum 5.99% allowed – 2.99% for general council tax plus a further levy of up to 3% to pay for the care of older and disabled adults – but this will not prevent further cuts to services, according to the LGA. Councils will continue to reduce or close services such as children’s centres, libraries, leisure centres, parks, museums and road repairs to plug growing gaps in adult and children’s social care and homelessness services, it says. The widespread emergence of what some councillors have dubbed “pay more, get less” budget settlements comes as town halls struggle to balance the books after years of cuts in core government funding. Northamptonshire county council effectively declared itself bankrupt earlier this month after admitting that rising costs and shrinking income made it unable to set a legal budget. The council must set out revised plans for cuts at a meeting this week after an auditors report warned that its existing proposed budget plans were “not credibly achievable”. Northamptonshire’s predicament highlights how councils are increasingly reliant on one-off measures such as dipping into reserves, or selling buildings and land, to meet the spiralling cost of social care. Those pressures are being compounded in some cases by the failure to deliver savings with existing cuts. The LGA said 147 of the 152 English authorities that provide social care services would levy a 3% council tax precept from April to raise extra cash for the care of older and disabled adults. Although this will raise an extra £548m, it will be wiped out by the cost of meeting the national minimum wage. These councils face additional costs estimated to be at least £400m over the next 12 months as result of a legal judgement that requires care employers to pay the minimum wage to carers working sleep-in shifts, backdated for six years. Out of the 152 “social care” authorities, 108 also plan to increase general council tax by between 2.95% and the maximum 2.99% allowed. This will raise an estimated £548m. Five councils have said they will freeze council tax for 2018-19. The LGA chairman, Lord Porter. said: “Faced with severe funding pressures, many councils feel they are being left with little choice but to ask residents to pay more to help them try and protect their local services. “The extra income this year will help offset some of the financial pressures they face but the reality is that many councils are now beyond the point where council tax income can be expected to plug the growing funding gaps they face. This means councils will have to continue to cut back services or stop some altogether to plug funding gaps.” A spokesman for the Department of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “As part of our finance settlement, we are delivering a real-terms increase in resources to councils over the next two years, more freedom and fairness, and greater certainty to plan and secure value for money. “We want to work with local government to develop a new funding system for the future and encourage councils to submit responses to the review currently under way.” England’s councils have experienced a 40% cut in central government funding since the start of the decade and face a £5bn funding gap by 2020. The Local Government Information Unit thinktank warned this month that many English local authorities were teetering on the edge of financial crisis."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2018/feb/28/qs-world-university-rankings-2018-arts-and-humanities","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T13:30:28Z","webTitle":"QS world university rankings 2018: arts and humanities","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/feb/28/qs-world-university-rankings-2018-arts-and-humanities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2018/feb/28/qs-world-university-rankings-2018-arts-and-humanities","fields":{"headline":"QS world university rankings 2018: arts and humanities","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/23/good-friday-agreement-irish-brexit-northern-ireland","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T15:23:48Z","webTitle":"The Good Friday agreement is under attack.

Can we really risk ditching it?","bodyText":"Many years ago, and mainly because of the way it looked, I bought a book called Handbook of the Ulster Question, which was published by the Stationery Office, Dublin, in 1923. It has a green cardboard binding and a front cover decorated in the Celtic revival style, which the Irish Free State also adopted for its postage stamps. An empty wallet inside the back cover once contained maps. “Lacks maps,” says a pencilled note on the front endpaper next to its price (30p), though the text pages still have a few that fold out, including one of Ireland’s then extensive railway system, which has a dotted line crossing it in 19 places. The dotted line represents the border created by the partition of Ireland in 1921. Suddenly, we are in modern territory. The map shows how “the customs land frontier of the Six-County Area [of Ulster]” will interfere “with the normal traffic of the country” to poor effect. The line separates Londonderry from its Donegal hinterland and the town of Newry from its port, Greenore. It twists back and forth across one of the cross-country routes of the largest railway, the Great Northern, no fewer than six times in seven miles. (Forty years later, very little of this railway remained apart from its main line from Dublin to Belfast. Its tunnels grew mushrooms. A withering of branches to border towns such as Clones and Enniskillen left middle Ireland train-less. Of course, there was more to blame than the border – railways closed everywhere – but the rot started with partition.) “As Ireland is an obvious geographical unit, so also it is an obvious economic unit,” says the handbook’s introduction, “and it is in the economic field … that the evils of partition become most apparent.” As a customs frontier would be “an inevitable and automatic consequence”, the introduction continues, not even the most enthusiastic supporter of partition would defend it on economic grounds: “There, beyond all denial, it stands self-condemned.” In 1923 the border was still provisional. The UK government had appointed a boundary commission that would decide its final course after reading submissions of evidence from the two sides. My “handbook” is really a compilation of the Dublin government’s case, which very roughly was that any partition at all was a bad idea (“calamitous in practice”), but that its more glaring injustices could be corrected “by restoring the maximum number of unwilling citizens to the government of their choice”. What this meant was drawing the boundaries of the new northern state more tightly, to exclude Catholic-majority areas such as Derry City and the counties of Fermanagh and Tyrone. Many tables and charts support Dublin’s case in statistical detail; scholarly analogies are made with the boundary set between Germany and Poland in Upper Silesia, and the “mixed population” of Transylvania. But the boundary commission paid no notice to any of this evidence, and in 1925 simply confirmed the border as it already existed – in the handbook’s words, “an arbitrary line in a small country clearly marked for unity by the sea”. For the next 70-odd years, the sea was no match for the roar of political and religious identities. And then, in 1998, came the Belfast or Good Friday agreement, a multilayered and subtle set of documents that mandated a power-sharing government for Northern Ireland, and, as an international agreement, redefined the triangular relationship between Belfast, Dublin and London. Thanks to it, the border was minimised as a contentious physical and psychological presence in Irish life. The army’s watchtowers and the queues of lorries at frontier posts disappeared. Now only the keenest-eyed travellers know when they have left one country for another. The agreement was popular. Separate referendums in the Republic and Northern Ireland endorsed its implementation by votes of 94% and 71% respectively, and last year the United Kingdom agreed with the European Union that it would protect all the agreement’s provisions after Brexit. We all know the difficulty here. Maintaining a “frictionless” border means that the UK must keep its regulations fully aligned to those of the internal market and the customs union, which seems impossible unless the British government modifies its stated ambition to leave both. Or unless the credibility of the Good Friday agreement can be undermined to the point where it needs revision and replacement. In this context, last week’s attack on the agreement by a trio of Brexiteers is a development worth unpicking. On 15 February, the Irish historian Ruth Dudley Edwards wrote a Daily Telegraph article on the 13-month impasse at Stormont that concluded: “Realists believe the [deal] has served its purpose and run its course, leaving behind the unintended consequence of enshrining sectarianism in the political process.” The following day the Tory MP Owen Paterson, a former Northern Ireland secretary, tweeted a link to the piece with a comment: “The collapse of power-sharing in Northern Ireland shows the Good Friday agreement has outlived its use.” Last Saturday the Tory MEP Daniel Hannan wrote, again in the Telegraph, that the agreement was “often spoken about in quasi-religious terms … but its flaws have become clearer over time”. Finally, two days later, the Labour MP Kate Hoey told the Huffington Post that she thought the agreement needed “a cold, rational look”, and that the power-sharing Northern Ireland executive it mandated was “not sustainable in the long term”. The condemnation of Paterson, Hannan and Hoey has been fierce: this week Hoey told the Northern Ireland affairs select committee that finding fault with the Good Friday agreement was “as if you’re saying you want to kill all babies at birth”. In their defence, all three could argue their criticism was directed at Stormont’s failure rather than the agreement’s international aspects, such as cross-border trade and cooperation. But their long-held position on Brexit – Hannan was one of its chief architects – suggests a different motive: “If the Belfast agreement must die so that the glorious ideal of Brexit may live, so be it,” to quote Fintan O’Toole in today’s Irish Times about this “cynical and reckless” exercise. Where did I pay my 30p for the Handbook to the Ulster Question? I think in Belfast in the early 1970s: a secondhand shop somewhere near City Hall. The owner, on hearing the thud of a distant IRA bomb, said nonchalantly, “Oh, I thought it was time we had one of those today.” There were many old books on theology; helmeted British soldiers in the streets; rain. Many people fear that a revival of a hard border and the abandonment of the Good Friday agreement will mean a return to those days. Enemies of the agreement, who include members of the Democratic Unionist party, describe this as moral blackmail; others (including O’Toole) think that 20 years of relative peace may at last have broken the link between political failure and blood on the streets. But say the worst happened – would the British army return to enforce the law? Would its soldiers be willing to risk life and limb knowing it was the perversity and vanity of their politicians that had put them there – a final British misadventure? There would be no stomach for it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/24/castleford-hull-fc-super-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-24T17:59:18Z","webTitle":"Jamie Ellis kickstarts fightback to help Castleford Tigers see off Hull","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/24/castleford-hull-fc-super-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/feb/24/castleford-hull-fc-super-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Jamie Ellis kickstarts fightback to help Castleford Tigers see off Hull","bodyText":"Jamie Ellis helped Castleford secure their most impressive result of the Super League season so far with victory over Hull FC. Such has been the nature of their opening two performances, the Castleford coach, Daryl Powell, has called for calm, warning it would take time for last year’s Grand Finalists to replicate the form that made them such a force in 2017. At half-time, Jake Webster’s try ensured they had overturned an eight-point deficit to lead 10-8, Hull having led courtesy of a try and two goals from Marc Sneyd. Ellis provided a telling contribution in that Webster try and continued to exert his influence after half-time. Ellis’s kick allowed Mike McMeeken to touch down five minutes into the second half, before Castleford extended their lead two minutes later. This time it was Ellis’s half-back partner, Luke Gale, who kicked a 40-20 before creating the space for Michael Shenton to score. Bureta Fariamo’s fine try on the hour mark kept matters interesting but Castleford soon re-established their two-score lead when Shenton – on the wing after Greg Eden withdrew with an injury the first half – scored his second.

I know this because half the people I know are on them – and that’s only the half I know about. Antidepressants saved my life, they tell me, and I believe them. I don’t say: “The only thing you’ve swallowed is propaganda, mate, straight from Big Pharma’s chalky teat.” I would have to be a maniac to do that. And I’m not a maniac. At least, not in that way. I’ve been on antidepressants at various points in my life. And I’ve always been one of the 80% who come off them within a month, looking for another way. I quickly tire of the tweaking of drugs and dosages required to find the appropriate prescription. I freak out at the initial side-effects – the flaccidness in my brain, the lack of ideas in my underpants. More than that, I’ve always had been uncomfortable accepting there is something medically wrong with me. To some extent, I stand by that. Our social structures perpetuate inequality, our media feeds feelings of inferiority, while our politics is an accelerated zoetrope of horror. I feel unnerved when I meet someone who isn’t depressed. What’s wrong with you, I want to ask. Still, while it’s not wrong to feel viscerally offended by many aspects of the modern world, when the strength of those feelings stops you living your life, it’s not a solution, either. What struck me from that study, below the headline, was another of its findings: that talking therapies are equally as effective at treating moderate to severe depression. I’ve certainly found that being open about my mental health – not just to professionals, but also people I trust – has been an incalculable force for good in my life. Whether you’re on medication or not, we should all be talking about feelings more. We should talk about them as much as we talk about Brexit or dirty burgers or Blue Planet II. We should talk about them way too much, just to get the habit. Because, at first, it feels impossible. Sadness can wall you in and seem too vast to communicate. I remember trying to explain that to someone; to talk about my inability to talk. I felt like a robot, taking off his breastplate to reveal the fizzing, severed wires inside and a voided warranty stamp that simply read “All Broken”. But there are good reasons to keep trying. First, the act of being honest with yourself, while altering nothing externally, will change absolutely everything. Being a fugitive from your own truth gives you no place to be at ease. Second, being honest with people in your life is a generous act. They will feel closer to you and better able to help. It also gives them a chance to be open with you. All my most important relationships have deepened, in work, friendship and love, after talking honestly about feelings. Even the ones I’m ashamed of. Especially those. It’s astonishing how many people can be down there with you, and you would never know. Since writing about my depression, strangers of every background have written to me to share their experiences. It can be overwhelming to confront how much unhappiness we’re swimming in. There are no magic bullets, medication included. But for me, the connection that comes from expressing the problem feels like a big part of the answer. Queer Eye’s view of the world is more than skin deep I wish there were a TV channel dedicated to men opening up emotionally. Clearing their throat while holding a photograph of their father, losing control of their lower lip five hours into a Bruce Springsteen concert, bawling at the births of their daughters. All of that stuff. In its absence, I will happily rewatch the Netflix reboot of the makeover show Queer Eye. In the show, five gay lifestyle consultants make improvements to the life of a usually straight man. The division of labour between the five is way out of whack, it has to be said. While Tan wades through decades of mountain-man plaid and male defensiveness and Bobby redecorates an entire house, handsome Karamo is in charge of “generally having a swaggy attitude”. Food and wine expert Antoni’s main job is to show the subjects what an avocado is, like Sir Walter Raleigh presenting the potato at court. But it’s not really about avocado, or copper accents in the kitchen. What the presenters are really good at is emotional diagnosis and support. This series takes place in the US state of Georgia, full of self-described rednecks, and the resulting conversations between differently modelled forms of masculinity are beautiful to watch. “You can’t selectively numb feeling. If you try to numb vulnerability you will also numb joy,” is a typical thing that Jonathan, there to dispense pomade, might say. That manipulative emotional “beat” – that surface improvements are a conduit to self-love – is part of all reality shows. But Queer Eye commits to the truth of it in a way that’s more than cosmetic. There are challenging conversations on Black Lives Matter, heterosexual stereotypes of gay relationships and why Nascar racing is the most boring sport ever invented; all delivered with sympathy, sass and exfoliating tips. It’s the blueprint for a better tomorrow for us all. Pointless in Pyeongchang: chemically-assisted curling While we’re talking about controversial drugs, I am confused by the story of Alexander Krushelnitsky, the Russian curler found guilty of doping. The part that baffles me is which part of curling begs for chemical assistance. Shoving what looks like a cheddar truckle along a gently curved trajectory? Handling the little sweep? The part of it, which is all of it, that is basically shuffleboard on ice? It’s like having a bionic arm installed so you can drink a cup of tea more efficiently. And Krushelnitsky and his wife still finished third in the mixed doubles, so not that efficiently.

Her empathy resonates from the pages as she acknowledges that is hard work “adjusting to this new version of ourselves”.

Superficially, her life is a dream: large London house, thoughtful and creative husband, extended family who regularly pop round for garrulous meals. But Nancy is having an affair with an older colleague, and her love for him reduces her availability for her family. Meanwhile, the disappearance of her itinerant brother, David, highlights their codependent sibling relationship. Nancy is too narcissistic and selfish to invite any great sympathy, or to make a believable therapist. But Hourston immerses the reader in the moral, emotional and practical dilemmas of infidelity in this well-crafted cautionary tale.

Faith schools have to follow the national curriculum, but they can choose what they teach in religious studies. They may have different admissions criteria and staffing policies to state schools, although anyone can apply for a place. The majority of faith schools in England are Church of England or Roman Catholic. According to a House of Commons briefing paper, at the end of January 2017 there were 27 Muslim faith schools in England. Are faith schools subject to the same checks as other state and private schools? Faith schools are inspected by Ofsted, the schools watchdog. Ofsted is responsible for inspecting maintained schools and academies, some independent schools and many other educational institutions and programmes outside of higher education. Has Ofsted expressed concern about faith schools in the past? In December, Amanda Spielman, the chief inspector of schools in England, said private faith schools run by religious conservatives were “deliberately resisting” British values and equalities law. She said the discoveries made for uncomfortable reading but denied it amounted to criticism of faith schools in general, and appealed for school inspectors to be given new powers to seize evidence during visits. Has religious extremism been previously identified in schools? The most high-profile allegations of extremism in British schools were made during the so-called Trojan horse affair. An investigation was launched in Birmingham amid claims that conservative Muslims were attempting to infiltrate several schools and impose an extreme version of Islamic faith. A letter that warned of the plot was later found to be fake and the controversial subsequent investigations failed to turn up any evidence. But the impact of the allegations is still felt by many still wary of alleged influence of religious leaders on curricula across the country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/23/west-bromwich-albion-huddersfield-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T11:44:08Z","webTitle":"West Bromwich Albion v Huddersfield Town: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/23/west-bromwich-albion-huddersfield-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/23/west-bromwich-albion-huddersfield-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"West Bromwich Albion v Huddersfield Town: match preview","bodyText":"Alan Pardew has put his faith in Jonny Evans to lead West Bromwich Albion out of trouble saying “God teaches us to forgive” with regard to reinstating the defender as captain.

The new thin and light laptop follows on from Huawei’s MateBook X from 2017, released in 2017 and looks strikingly familiar to Apple’s top-of-the-line notebook, with an aluminium body that’s available in silver or “space grey” – just like the MacBook Pro – a chiclet keyboard and large trackpad. But it is the 14in 3K LTPS screen that Huawei hopes to sell the MateBook X Pro, which the company says, manages to fit into the body of a more traditional 12in laptop. “The MateBook X Pro has the world’s first full-view screen in a notebook, featuring a massive 91% screen to body ratio, which is down to the amount of engineering work we’ve done to reduce the bezels around the display,” said Peter Gauden, senior product marketing manager for Huawei. “With a 178-degree viewing angle range, if you’re working on confidential documents on a plane or train you’re going to have to invest in a privacy screen because everyone is going to be able to see what you’re working on – it’s that good.” The MateBook X Pro comes with the latest Intel 8th generation quad-core i7 U series processor, up to 16GB of RAM and an Nvidia MX150 discrete graphics processor with 2GB of memory. It also supports Thunderbolt 3, has two USB-C ports, a USB-A port and headphones socket, squeezed into a wedge shape that tapers from 16.6mm to 4.9mm, weighing 1.33kg. The power button doubles as a fingerprint scanner, which Huawei says will start and securely log into Windows from cold in under eight seconds. The laptop also has four speakers – two treble speakers at the back and two bass speakers at the front – supporting Dolby’s Atmos sound system. The spill-proof chiclet keyboard resembles that fitted on Apple’s MacBook Pro, but has a trick up its sleeve: a recessed camera that hides under a key in the centre of the top function row. Gauden said: “It’s hidden away so you can be completely comfortable with your privacy concerns over cameras – just pop it up when you want to use it.” Huawei rates the battery life of the MateBook X Pro at 12 hours of video playback. The company is going to sell the machine with a new compact 65W USB-C charger, which is about the same size as smartphone fast chargers, describing it as “intelligent enough to charge anything safely”. Huawei also announced three new MediaPad M5 Android tablets. One with an 8.4in screen and two larger 10.8in versions including a “Pro” model that ships with a stylus. All three have 2K resolution LCD screens, Harman Kardon speakers and at least 10 hours of battery for video playback. All three tablets will also run Huawei’s EMUI 8, which is based on Android 8 Oreo, with the two larger models capable of attaching to a keyboard case and presenting a desktop-like Android experience for productivity.

As fellow policemen turned hoses and dogs on black youngsters nearby, the kids made it plain they knew what they were doing and continued marching towards the demonstrations. A reporter asked one of them her age. “Six,” she said, as she climbed into the paddy wagon. Events in Birmingham proved a crucial turning point in the civil rights era. Before protests started, only 4% of Americans regarded the struggle for racial equality as the country’s most pressing issue; after Birmingham, it was more than half. And young people were crucial to its success. That was no accident. Adult breadwinners had too much to lose, and the campaign was faltering, so Martin Luther King’s organisation trained young people to carry the mantle. Soon they were filling the city’s prison cells. “There were 12 people in [my] jail cell,” Dennis Mallory, who was a teenager in town at the time, told me. “And 11 were from my school.” The political courage and leadership of the young people in Florida who took on the gun lobby this week stands in the storied, inspiring tradition of youth activism in America and beyond. Whether it was Paris, Mexico or Brazil in 1968, Soweto in 1976, the intifada of the late 80s, Seattle in the 90s, the Prague spring of 1968 or the Arab spring of 2011, the young have often led resistance against injustice or for progressive change – and sometimes both. In Florida the familiar cycle of carnage, thoughts, prayers, rage and stasis has been broken by an impassioned and uncompromising demand for gun control triggered by the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school, where 17 people were shot dead last week. There have been die-ins outside the White House and school walkouts around the country: they have grilled (and, frankly, toasted) their Republican senator and a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association (NRA), and lobbied the state legislature. When liberals see young people challenging authority in this way, they can start to wax romantic. Youth can be fetishised as though it holds intrinsically radical properties. It doesn’t. It is not an abstract identity. Youth interacts with class, race, gender, nationality, region and a range of other factors in different ways at different times. During the 1926 general strike in Britain, students were used as scab labour. Young people, aged 18 to 24, voted for Margaret Thatcher in 1979 and 1983, and Ronald Reagan in 1984. The under-35s in India went for the Hindu nationalist Narendra Modi. Young white people backed Donald Trump. And while the young can at times make an impact on the streets, they are among the least likely to vote, – if indeed they are even eligible to vote – and cannot withdraw their labour to any devastating effect. There is a limit to what they can achieve alone. In the days after the shooting, Emma González, 17, who was at the school when the shooting happened, emerged as an impressive, articulate champion for gun control, saying: “We are going to be the last mass shooting.” There have been four since their school attack, and at the rate things are going this year the United States is due another school shooting before the end of the month. But at a moment like this, far more problematic than overstating the impact of young people’s protest is underestimating it. If there is one unifying element in the nature of youth and student protest over the past 50 years, it has been the likelihood of it finding its greatest potency precisely when established political structures have shown themselves to be obsolete – structures young people feel neither beholden to nor indebted to. There are few better illustrations of this than guns in the US. A consistent majority favours stricter gun laws, and support for background checks is almost unanimous. Yet thanks to a combination of big money, gerrymandering and political spinelessness, each mass shooting is received in a mood of learned hopelessness. Citing Sandy Hook, people understandably insist that if nothing changed when the kids were younger, and the president cried and called for action, then nothing ever will change. When reporting for my book about all the children and teens shot dead in one random day in America, I asked each family an open-ended question: what did they think had made the tragedy possible? Not one mentioned guns. When I asked the more leading question, of what they thought about guns, most had an opinion: they were too easily accessible. After a while, I concluded that they looked on gun deaths as being a bit like traffic fatalities. If your child was run over by a car, you might call for a traffic light, speed bump or lower speed limit – and no one would claim that was unconstitutional. But you wouldn’t call for an end to traffic. Who could imagine a world without traffic? To these parents, that would be as bizarre as a world without guns. But González was 12 when Sandy Hook happened. She and her fellow students have not learned to be hopeless. Nobody can tell them to lobby through the proper channels, because there are no working channels. So they have gone for the source. The tone of urgency, rage, hope and mocking disbelief in their resistance is one of the things that has been missing from this debate. America’s rate of gun death – seven children and teens a day, as well as around 80 adults – is an obscenity the nation has become accustomed to. It is not just the fact of their opposition but the tone that is thrilling. “Calling BS” on the political class and the NRA, facing down senators and lobbyists, they have acted independently of both political parties and a mostly white, middle-aged, suburban-led gun control movement that has little connection with the communities most acutely affected by gun violence. This is fantastic, as far as it goes, but on its own it doesn’t go far enough. History has shown that young people and students have the ability to expose a crisis and challenge it, but rarely defeat or solve it unilaterally. They are more likely to be the spark for the broader struggles than the flame itself. The systemic threat youth and students pose is one of contagion – that their energy and commitment will infect others with more leverage, who may join them. Of the victory against segregation in Birmingham, the historian Taylor Branch wrote: “Never before was a country transformed, arguably redeemed, by the active moral witness of schoolchildren.” That may have been the first time. Let’s hope it is not the last. • Gary Younge is a Guardian columnist and the author of Another Day in the Death of America"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/23/usa-womens-figure-skating-winter-olympics-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T14:34:32Z","webTitle":"USA once dominated women's figure skating.

So what happened?","bodyText":"A mentally spent Mirai Nagasu told reporters she couldn’t wait to fly home after ending her Olympics on Friday afternoon with a disappointing and anticlimactic free skate, sounding mostly relieved it was over. None of the US contingent of Bradie Tennell (who finished ninth), Nagasu (10th) and Karen Chen (11th) skated cleanly in the women’s singles here, marking the first time an American woman failed to finish in the top six in any Olympics since World War Two. Make no mistake: the US women’s figure skating team, once the toast of the world and the sport’s gold standard, is now an outsider. Whatever podium hopes the American women harbored were dashed on Wednesday when all three fell on the opening jump or combination of their short programs, but the nightmare didn’t get any better on Friday afternoon. First up was Chen, last year’s US national champion and surprise fourth-place finisher at worlds, who fell once and mixed in a bunch of technical errors, skating well below her best. Next was Tennell, who burst from obscurity to win last month’s nationals. But the 19-year-old stepped out of two landings in the middle of Friday’s free skate after falling on her opening jump of Wednesday’s short – her first tumble in 34 jumping passes this season. Then came Nagasu, who became the first ever American woman to land a triple axel at the Olympics during last week’s team event. But the veteran fell to the ice when attempting it on Wednesday and couldn’t pull the trigger on Friday. And that was before her bizarre remarks afterward in the mixed zone which included thinly veiled shots at US team-mate Nathan Chen and the revelations her focus during the free skate was “auditioning for Dancing With the Stars”. On an afternoon when 15-year-old Russian Alina Zagitova became the youngest Olympic champion since Tara Lipinski, the dizzying heights of the America’s long-held dominance never seemed further away. The glamour event of the Winter Olympics was once friendly ground for American women, who accounted for 19 of a possible 45 Olympic medals in the women’s singles from 1952 through 2006, a roll of iconic alumnae that included Lipinski, Peggy Fleming, Dorothy Hamill, Kristi Yamaguchi and Sarah Hughes. They’ve won exactly zero at the three Olympics since and have only made the podium once in the last 11 world championships: Ashley Wagner’s home-soil silver in 2016. And while American women had slipped from consistent podium contenders to the fourth-to-seventh range over the last decade, their Pyeongchang showing indicates a downward trend. The decline can be put down to a constellation of factors including the sport’s decline in popularity from the dizzying Tonya-Nancy heights. The rise of cold-weather alternatives popularized by the X Games have affected participation and thinned the domestic field. And the loss of lucrative TV contracts and sponsorship dollars have had a trickle-down effects including shrinking prize money and appearance fees. The lack of financial incentive exacerbates the economic barriers to entry that have always been present in a sport where the costs of participation – equipment, ice time, private lessons, choreography, costumes, et al – are prohibitive. But even more responsible is the failure of American coaches to adjust to the International Skating Union’s scoring system. Skating has become a numbers game since the changes in judging after the 2002 score-fixing scandal. Now each jump or spin has a fixed base value and judges then assign grades of execution for each element, while marking for components like choreography and footwork. Detractors say the sport has become a jumping contest and bemoan the calculated tactics of Zagitova, who backloaded all of her jumps into the final two minutes where they’re subject to a 10% technical bonus meant to reward stamina. They also note the career-shortening effect of the emphasis on athleticism over artistry: gone are the days of any top skater winning nine straight national championships as Michelle Kwan did in the late 1990s and early 2000s. But by failing to fall in, the United States has fallen behind. Only recently did American officials revamp the scoring system at the juvenile and novice levels to reward skaters for attempting more technically advanced jumps, a move Russia made years ago. Ultimately, it will take a special athlete to light up the sport in America once more. But until then, it’s time to acknowledge America’s underwhelming Pyeongchang performance as what it is: not an outlier but the new normal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"global-development/2018/feb/23/luiz-loures-un-official-accused-of-sexual-harassment-stands-down","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T13:33:00Z","webTitle":"Top UN official accused of sexual harassment stands down","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/feb/23/luiz-loures-un-official-accused-of-sexual-harassment-stands-down","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/feb/23/luiz-loures-un-official-accused-of-sexual-harassment-stands-down","fields":{"headline":"Top UN official accused of sexual harassment stands down","bodyText":"Luiz Loures, a UN assistant secretary general and the subject of a recent sexual assault allegation, is standing down from his position. UNAids said Loures would not seek renewal of his contract, which is due to expire at the end of March, adding that the decision had no connection to the allegations against him. An internal inquiry recently cleared Loures of wrongdoing following complaints from a female employee that he assaulted her in a lift. While investigators found the allegations to be unsubstantiated, campaigners said the investigation process was flawed and should have been handled externally. UNAids said in a statement that Michel Sidibé, the agency’s executive director, had accepted Loures’ decision, adding: “Mr Sidibé also thanked Dr Loures for his 22 years of dedicated service to UNAids.” Loures had been attempting to rally support within UNAids. Last week, staff were approached at their desks and asked to sign a letter stating that Loures behaves respectfully and is committed to advancing women’s rights. One employee told the Guardian at the time: “The letter said that as a staff member working at UNAids I can attest that I’ve only ever seen irreproachable and respectful behaviour from Luiz and that he has always supported the meaningful participation of women’s rights organisations.” Another added that they feared their loyalty would be questioned if they did not sign the letter. UNAids said its staff were free to exchange and express their views, and that policies were in place to protect them from retaliation. Last week, Britain’s secretary of state for international development was urged to call for an independent inquiry into allegations of harassment and sexual misconduct within the agency. In the letter, the Labour MP Gareth Thomas warned of “inadequate processes” for dealing with complaints at UNAids. There has been “a decade’s concern about a declining culture in the organisation, described to me as misogynistic and patriarchal”, wrote Thomas, a former minister at the Department for International Development. Sidibé has been criticised for his handling of the recent inquiry into Loures. During an investigation by the World Health Organization’s inquiry team, Internal Oversight Services, Sidibé was questioned over allegations that he attempted to interfere in the case. UNAids said the investigation was independent and had “followed due process and complied with applicable procedures, both in letter and spirit”. The agency does not tolerate sexual harassment, it said, adding that there are numerous confidential channels available to staff. “This includes the ethics office and the anonymous and confidential integrity hotline, which is open 24 hours a day, every day, to report complaints.” A staff member within UNAids welcomed Loures’ decision to stand down, but said a wider investigation into cases of sexual harassment within the agency was needed. “He is just one example. But this is certainly a step in the right direction,” they said. Paula Donovan, co-director of the campaign group Code Blue, said that the UN’s handling of the case fell short of its claim to have “zero tolerance” for sexual exploitation and abuse. “I truly hope that this courageous claimant has opened the floodgates to a #MeTooUN movement,” she added. Loures has yet to respond to a request for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/23/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-carabao-cup-final-arsenal-dynasty","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T12:45:03Z","webTitle":"For Pep Guardiola this final could start a Manchester City dynasty | Jamie Jackson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/23/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-carabao-cup-final-arsenal-dynasty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/23/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-carabao-cup-final-arsenal-dynasty","fields":{"headline":"For Pep Guardiola this final could start a Manchester City dynasty","bodyText":"If Manchester City beat Arsenal in Sunday’s Carabao Cup final their quest to become one of English football’s most successful single-season sides takes flight. Suddenly the value of the least desired major competition is priceless because of what it could be a part of for City and their manager, Pep Guardiola: a treble of League Cup, Premier League and Champions League. In 1999 Sir Alex Ferguson’s Manchester United won the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup. This placed the XI of Roy Keane and David Beckham as these shores’ highest achievers and ranked them among football’s finest. The stakes for City are almost as high: Guardiola’s side have a chance to become England’s third winners of a treble, emulating Liverpool’s 1983-84 collection of European Cup, Football League Championship and League Cup trophies. The first demand is to defeat Arsenal. A 16-point lead in the title race means City have all but sealed a third Premier League crown. They hold a 4-0 advantage over Basel in the Champions League after the opening leg so are near-certainties for the quarter-finals and from this stage all opponents will hope to avoid City, the tournament favourites. Achieving the treble would be significant regarding what Guardiola and City might achieve in the coming years. The arguments that his gilded CV is due to having managed Lionel Messi’s Barcelona and the Bundesliga’s dominant force, Bayern Munich, would be silenced. City’s rivals would also face a starker truth: that the 46-year-old could be on the verge of establishing a hegemony not seen since the Ferguson years at United. On and off the field Guardiola is certainly tightening his hold on the domestic game in a manner not seen since the Scot stepped away from United in May 2013. In Guardiola’s campaign to protect his players from “dangerous tackles” echoes of Ferguson’s cold‑eyed professionalism can be found. This kind of protest can work only from a position of strength and after 18 months Guardiola’s increasing domination is emboldening him, just as Ferguson’s lofty status did. City may be flying but this has not stopped Guardiola, by marking referees’ cards, from trying to ensure his side will not be stopped by tackles that could rule out a star talent. Just as Ferguson tried to make himself a factor in officials’ decisions so too Guardiola, whose public condemnation was followed by City arranging a meeting with the Premier League referees’ body regarding the matter. As Ferguson’s players echoed their manager’s prevailing message during his tenure so too Guardiola’s, with Raheem Sterling claiming team-mates were being “butchered” and Bernardo Silva saying they were being “targeted”. After a 12-month bedding-in period Guardiola has transformed City into this year’s dominant force and is intent they should not prove a one-season wonder. He now seems likely to stay for a minimum of five years, despite a source close to Guardiola telling the Guardian a few months after the manager joined in summer 2016 there “was no way” an extension to his three-year contract would be sought. This was because of the prospect of burnout given Guardiola’s near 24/7 devotion to the job and the natural cycle of a head coach at any major club. The mood music has changed. The City executive are convinced Guardiola may be in charge for a decade or more and, though this seems optimistic, he will sign for longer in the close season and enjoy a five-year tenure, at least. “Everything is set up perfectly for Guardiola” might be the unofficial mantra of the way City have sought to ensure he can prosper, and it is reaping the desired dividend. Following last year’s barren opening term he is set to deliver in spectacular style. Sunday is a chance for Guardiola to initiate this. Since Ferguson no manager has claimed more than one Premier League title, with Manuel Pellegrini, José Mourinho, Claudio Ranieri and Antonio Conte guiding City, Chelsea, Leicester City and Chelsea to the championship respectively. Three have accrued more than one trophy – Mourinho (four), Pellegrini (three) and Arsène Wenger (three) – and Mourinho (twice) and Pellegrini (once) have won two competitions in a single season. If Guardiola can outmanoeuvre Wenger and claim the League Cup he is almost certain to join Mourinho and Pellegrini as a multiple winner in one term given that the title is a fait accompli. Claiming the Champions League may be far harder but a squad bursting with A-listers and assisted by the experience Guardiola gathered from two triumphs in charge of Barcelona has a real chance of elevating City into the elite band of continental heavyweights. The shock FA Cup defeat at Wigan Athletic on Monday night ended the dream of a historic quadruple, and will have disappointed the perfectionist that is Guardiola.

It is most workers’ worst nightmare: not content with seeing them every day at the office, the boss summons them for an awayday, far from home. Worse than that, she then schedules an eight-hour meeting, with dinner thrown in. But Theresa May’s gamble of getting her ministerial troops away from the Westminster hothouse appears to have achieved its most basic objective – persuading the key players to sign up to a Brexit negotiating stance without any of them flouncing out. What do we know about what was agreed? Brexiters were quick out of the blocks to claim victory: “Divergence was the victor,” one said afterwards. Another minister said David Davis’s Vienna speech, in which the Brexit secretary suggested Britain would take control of its own regulations, though they may not change that much from the EU ones, was an “extensive hint” of what was agreed. The phrase both sides used to describe the outcome was “ambitious managed divergence”. Weary journalists fear this may become the new “deep and special partnership” for the weekly game of PMQs bingo. So we’ll still have red tape, but it will be our red tape? Essentially, yes: the Davis school of thought, shared largely by Michael Gove, the environment secretary and a leading figure in the leave campaign, is that the clinching argument for Brexit is sovereignty. The vision of a future farming policy set out by Gove in recent days, for example, doesn’t smack of deregulation: but of a different approach to suit Britain’s particular circumstances. In other sectors, such as the car industry, Britain would happily sign up to EU standards, and hope Brussels will continue to allow automotive parts to travel unchecked across the European supply chains. On services, meanwhile, where borders tend to be more fluid, the UK would hope to set its own standards. This approach appears to be what May was driving at when, during her “Brexit means Brexit” period, she frequently suggested membership of the customs union was “not a binary question”. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, who was sent out to explain what had been agreed despite not having been at Chequers, said: “What we are saying is that we want to agree frictionless trade, by agreement between two sovereign bodies, the UK and the European Union.” That sounds a bit flimsy, do we have much detail? Not yet: we’ll know more next week when May gives a speech setting out her position. The reaction of both camps will be crucial. Is there any wriggle room on membership of a customs union? Apparently not. Asked whether there was any possibility of the government coming round to the idea, Hunt said simply: “No”. May will hope to convince pro-remain colleagues that her solution addresses most of their concerns. Signed up are Philip Hammond, the chancellor, and Amber Rudd, the home secretary, both of whom favour a close relationship with the EU. Why has so much focus been on resolving internal Tory party tensions? There is a deep historical divide in the Conservative party between free traders and protectionists, going back to the schism over the Corn laws and beyond, and another, not always coterminous split between “citizens of nowhere” and “little Englanders”. Brexit presents Tory MPs with an acute version of both divisions that cannot be ducked. Overlay that with the cross-cutting leadership ambitions of a good number of the cabinet, who know full well that May cannot fight another general election and want to style themselves as the standard bearer for the party’s pro-Brexit membership, and you have a toxic mix. What happens next? A pressing priority for the government is to agree on the details of a transition deal. A leaked negotiating text (pdf) published on Wednesday morning suggested there were few major differences between the UK and EU. Those that remain, including the rights of EU27 citizens who arrive in the UK during the transition period, and the slight difference between the two sides on when that period should end, look highly likely to be resolved in the EU’s favour. What could go wrong? Quite a lot. EU experts say “managed divergence” is unlikely to survive contact with Brussels – whose overriding political aim is to protect the integrity of the customs union and single market – though it’s possible that may not become clear until negotiations on the final deal begin in earnest. In the interim, ministers are on a charm offensive, with Davis flying to Lisbon on Friday morning, in the hope of convincing EU capitals to be more pragmatic. Perhaps a bigger short-term headache is the parliamentary arithmetic. Rebel Tories are determined to force a vote on a customs union. An amendment to the forthcoming trade bill tabled by the Conservative MP Anna Soubry and supported by Labour backbenchers, is gathering support. If Jeremy Corbyn whipped his MPs to back it, it could defeat May and send her Brexit inner cabinet back to the drawing board – or worse, back to Chequers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/feb/23/mug-twarz-review-malgorzata-szumowska-mateusz-kosciukiewicz","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T16:08:37Z","webTitle":"Mug review – metalhead meets giant Jesus in peculiar Polish comedy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/23/mug-twarz-review-malgorzata-szumowska-mateusz-kosciukiewicz","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/feb/23/mug-twarz-review-malgorzata-szumowska-mateusz-kosciukiewicz","fields":{"headline":"Mug review – metalhead meets giant Jesus in peculiar Polish comedy","bodyText":"Małgorzata Szumowska’s Twarz (Polish for “face” or “mug”, the latter of which is the film’s English title) delivers the pleasure of vigorous storytelling. It is scabrous, mysterious and surprisingly emotional – inspired partly by the giant statue of Christ the King in Świebodzin in western Poland, completed in 2010, the tallest statue of Jesus in the world and a fierce religious and nationalist symbol. It is the face of patriotic Poland, and this is a film to put you in mind of Eliot’s lines about preparing a face to meet the faces that you meet. Szumowska’s movie imagines a guy named Jacek (Mateusz Kosciukiewicz), employed as a builder on a giant statue like this as it begins to loom surreally over the landscape. He is an amiably scruffy, long-haired metalhead living at home with his extended family, whom he annoys with his vague plans to move to London. His brash brother-in-law (Robert Talarczyk) – a man with a fondness for jokes about blacks, Muslims and Jews – tells him the Brits are “wised up” to immigrants these days and won’t let him in; he says this, moreover, with every appearance of respect. Szumowska has perhaps moved the time period forward to a Brexit-zeitgeist. Jacek has a girlfriend (Małgorzata Gorol), but the person who seems to love him most is his sister (Agniezska Podsiadlik). All these people have something in common – they are exasperated by Jacek’s appearance: dishevelled, grinningly cheeky. Then Jacek is involved in a horrible accident at work. Standing on Jesus’s neck, preparing for his huge head to be lowered on to the shoulders, Jacek stumbles and falls face-first into Jesus’s huge hollow concrete torso. His injuries are horrendous and he has to have a face transplant, which is reasonably successful. His family, girlfriend and local priest have to decide how much they want to chip in for Jacek’s continuing medical bills and how they feel about someone with what seems like a new identity. Mug is a strange, engaging film – well and potently acted and directed, a drama that puts you inside its extended community with a mix of robust realism and a streak of fantasy comedy. The first scene is a bizarre “underwear sale” at an out-of-town hypermarket – not a sale of underwear, but a sale in which buyers must first strip down to their underwear before they stampede into the shop, perhaps to make the inevitable physical tussles over bargain flatscreen TVs fairer, or perhaps just for the spectacle – a dream vision of the consumerism and undignified greed over which Giant Jesus impassively presides. And what does Jacek’s new face symbolise? Perhaps nothing very much at all. He suffers as no one else in his community suffers, and certainly not the priest (Roman Gancarczyk), who has theoretically put Jesus’s suffering at the centre of his own vocation. And Jacek endures his suffering with unassuming dignity and integrity as he is betrayed or let down by everyone but his sister. It is an absorbing and strange story, expertly managed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"cities/2018/mar/01/smart-cities-data-privacy-eindhoven-utrecht","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T07:30:04Z","webTitle":"'Living laboratories': the Dutch cities amassing data on oblivious residents","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/mar/01/smart-cities-data-privacy-eindhoven-utrecht","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/mar/01/smart-cities-data-privacy-eindhoven-utrecht","fields":{"headline":"'Living laboratories': the Dutch cities amassing data on oblivious residents","bodyText":"Stratumseind in Eindhoven is one of the busiest nightlife streets in the Netherlands. On a Saturday night, bars are packed, music blares through the street, laughter and drunken shouting bounces off the walls. As the night progresses, the ground becomes littered with empty shot bottles, energy drink cans, cigarette butts and broken glass. It’s no surprise that the place is also known for its frequent fights. To change that image, Stratumseind has become one of the “smartest” streets in the Netherlands. Lamp-posts have been fitted with wifi-trackers, cameras and 64 microphones that can detect aggressive behaviour and alert police officers to altercations. There has been a failed experiment to change light intensity to alter the mood. The next plan, starting this spring, is to diffuse the smell of oranges to calm people down. The aim? To make Stratumseind a safer place. All the while, data is being collected and stored. “Visitors do not realise they are entering a living laboratory,” says Maša Galic, a researcher on privacy in the public space for the Tilburg Institute of Law, Technology and Society. Since the data on Stratumseind is used to profile, nudge or actively target people, this “smart city” experiment is subject to data protection law. According to the Dutch Personal Data Protection Act, people should be notified in advance of data collection and the purpose should be specified – but in Stratumseind, as in many other “smart cities”, this is not the case. Peter van de Crommert is involved at Stratumseind as project manager with the Dutch Institute for Technology, Safety and Security. He says visitors do not have to worry about their privacy: the data is about crowds, not individuals. “We often get that comment – ‘Big brother is watching you’ – but I prefer to say, ‘Big brother is helping you’. We want safe nightlife, but not a soldier on every street corner.” When we think of smart cities, we usually think of big projects: Songdo in South Korea, the IBM control centre in Rio de Janeiro or the hundreds of new smart cities in India. More recent developments include Toronto, where Google will build an entirely new smart neighbourhood, and Arizona, where Bill Gates plans to build his own smart city. But the reality of the smart city is that it has stretched into the everyday fabric of urban life – particularly so in the Netherlands. In the eastern city of Enschede, city traffic sensors pick up your phone’s wifi signal even if you are not connected to the wifi network. The trackers register your MAC address, the unique network card number in a smartphone. The city council wants to know how often people visit Enschede, and what their routes and preferred spots are. Dave Borghuis, an Enschede resident, was not impressed and filed an official complaint. “I don’t think it’s okay for the municipality to track its citizens in this way,” he said. “If you walk around the city, you have to be able to imagine yourself unwatched.” Enschede is enthusiastic about the advantages of the smart city. The municipality says it is saving €36m in infrastructure investments by launching a smart traffic app that rewards people for good behaviour like cycling, walking and using public transport. (Ironically, one of the rewards is a free day of private parking.) Only those who mine the small print will discover that the app creates “personal mobility profiles”, and that the collected personal data belongs to the company Mobidot. ‘Targeted supervision’ in Utrecht Companies are getting away with it in part because it involves new applications of data. In Silicon Valley, they call it “permissionless innovation”, they believe technological progress should not be stifled by public regulations. For the same reason, they can be secretive about what data is collected in a public space and what it is used for. Often the cities themselves don’t know. Utrecht has become a tangle of individual pilots and projects, with no central overview of how many cameras and sensors exist, nor what they do. In 2014, the city invested €80m in data-driven management that launched in 80 projects. Utrecht now has a burglary predictor, a social media monitoring room, and smart bins and smart streetlights with sensors (although the city couldn’t say where these are located). It has scanner cars that dispense parking tickets, with an added bonus of detecting residents with a municipal tax debt according to the privacy regulation of the scanner cars. But when I asked the city to respond to a series of questions on just 22 of the smart projects, it could only answer for five of them, referring me to private companies for the rest of the answers. The city also keeps track of the number of young people hanging out in the streets, their age group, whether they know each other, the atmosphere and whether or not they cause a nuisance. Special enforcement officers keep track of this information through mobile devices. It calls this process “targeted and innovative supervision”. Other council documents mention the prediction of school drop-outs, the prediction of poverty and the monitoring of “the health of certain groups” with the aim of “intervening faster”. Like many cities, Utrecht argues that it acts in accordance with privacy laws because it anonymises or pseudonymises data (assigning it a number instead of a name or address). But pseudonymised personal data is still personal data. “The process is not irreversible if the source file is stored,” says Mireille Hildebrandt, professor of ICT and Law at Radboud University. “Moreover, if you build personal profiles and act on them by targeting an individual person, you are processing personal data and need to comply with data protection law. Targeting based on profiling can also lead to prohibited or unwarranted discrimination.” She points to Utrecht’s plan to register the race and health data of prostitutes, which came in for heavy criticism from the Dutch Data Protection Authority. Another unanswered question regards who owns data that is collected in a public space. Arjen Hof is director of Civity, a company that builds data platforms for governments. “Public authorities are increasingly outsourcing tasks to private companies. Think of waste removal or street lighting,” he says. “But they do not realise that at the same time a lot of data is collected, and do not always make agreements about the ownership of data.” ‘A smart city is a privatised city’ Hof gives the example of CityTec, a company that manages 2,000 car parks, 30,000 traffic lights and 500,000 lamp-posts across the Netherlands. It refused to share with municipalities the data it was collecting through its lamp-post sensors. “Their argument was that, although the municipality is legally owner of the lamp-posts, CityTec is the economic owner and, for competitive reasons, did not want to make the data available,” Hof says. This was three years ago, but for a lot of companies it remains standard practice. Companies dictate the terms, and cities say they can’t share the contracts because it contains “competition-sensitive information”. When I interviewed the technology writer Evgeny Morozov in October, he warned of cities becoming too dependent on private companies. “The culmination of the smart city is a privatised city,” he said. “A city in which you have to pay for previously free services.” Morozov’s fear about public subsidies being used for private innovation is well illustrated in Assen, a city of 70,000 people in the north of the country. Assen built a fibre-optic network for super-fast internet in 2011, to which it connected 200 sensors that measure, among other things, the flow of cars. There was an experiment to steer people around traffic jams, even though traffic in the city is relatively light. The city also connected its traffic lights, parking garages and parking signs to this grid. The cost of €46m was split between Brussels, the national government, the province and the municipality. Companies such as the car navigation firm TomTom have used the sensor network to test new services. The project, called Sensor City, filed for bankruptcy a year ago. Now the publicly funded fibre-optic network, sensors and all, will be sold to a still-unidentified private company. The municipality will have to strike a deal with the new owner about the use of its public traffic lights and parking signs.

Muppets to play first ever UK shows","bodyText":"The Muppets have announced their first ever live shows in the UK, to take place at the O2 Arena, London, in July. Kermit the Frog said fans could expect “music, comedy, incredible surprises, plus total and complete chaos”. Meanwhile, Miss Piggy said: “I can’t wait to be there to entertain, astonish, dazzle and otherwise gobsmack all moi’s fabulous fans! Wear socks, sweetie, cause I’m gonna knock ’em off. I will amaze everyone with this first-ever live performance.” She added that the O2 Arena would be renamed the Moi 2 Arena. The madcap menagerie of puppets, formed in 1955 under the stewardship of Jim Henson, achieved their greatest fame in the 70s with the TV series The Muppet Show. Six successful feature films followed, before a hiatus that began in 1999. The troupe returned for the reboot movie The Muppets in 2011, which won an Oscar for best song, and then again for Muppets Most Wanted in 2014. More recently there was an ill-starred TV mockumentary series, The Muppets, cancelled in 2016 after one season. Until last year, though, the felt friends had never performed live. Their first concerts took place at the Hollywood Bowl in September, and featured cover versions of Queen and David Bowie tracks by the house band Dr Teeth and the Electric Mayhem; Miss Piggy performing Adele’s Hello; and spoofs of The Walking Dead (“The Walking Bread”, featuring the Swedish Chef) and Keeping Up With the Kardashians (“Keeping Up With the Crustaceans”, featuring Pepe the King Prawn). The Muppets have regularly visited London on film before, trawling Dickensian London for The Muppet Christmas Carol, and vying with a villainous Ricky Gervais in Muppets Most Wanted, which features a heist scene at the Tower of London. As well as the failed TV series, there was another rocky patch for the puppets recently when Steve Whitmire, the longtime puppeteer for Kermit the Frog, was fired in July 2017 for “unacceptable business conduct”. Whitmire alluded to conflict with Disney, who bought the rights to the Muppets in 2004, speaking of the company’s “limitations with respect to how well they know the Muppets”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/23/second-russian-athlete-tests-positive-for-doping-at-winter-olympics","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T10:26:25Z","webTitle":"Second Russian athlete tests positive for doping at Winter Olympics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/23/second-russian-athlete-tests-positive-for-doping-at-winter-olympics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/feb/23/second-russian-athlete-tests-positive-for-doping-at-winter-olympics","fields":{"headline":"Second Russian athlete tests positive for doping at Winter Olympics","bodyText":"Nadezhda Sergeeva, who finished 12th in the two-woman bobsleigh, has become the second Russian to test positive for a banned substance at the Winter Olympics. According to reports in the Russian media, the substance involved was trimetazidine, a stimulant usually used to treat patients suffering from angina. The disclosure of another positive doping test comes 24 hours after the Russian curler Alexander Krushelnitsky was stripped of an Olympic bronze medal. The news will heap further pressure on the International Olympic Committee, which will meet today to decide whether the Russian team will be allowed to march under their own flag at tomorrow’s closing ceremony. As things stand, the Russian Olympic Committee is banned, although 168 of the country’s athletes have been competing in Pyeongchang under the Olympic Athletes from Russia banner. Alexander Zubkov, president of the Russian Bobsleigh Federation, confirmed Sergeeva’s positive test to the Russian newspaper Sport Express. Zubkov said that the 30-year-old Sergeeva, who finished second in the European Championships in Winterburg earlier this year with Nadezhda Paleeva, had tested negative in an out-of-competition test on 13 February but returned a positive test five days later. Sergeeva was also among several Russians who tested positive for meldonium in 2016, after it was put on World Anti-Doping banned list. However she was cleared after Wada adopted an amnesty for athletes who had a low dose. It is believed that Sergeeva tested positive at Pyeongchang 2018 after ingesting the banned substance in a nose spray. Trimetazidine is the same drug that China’s three-time Olympic swimming champion Sun Yang tested positive for in 2014 and served a secret three-month ban. Earlier this week, the Russian coach Sergey Belanov said he believed Krushelnitsky had been framed. “It’s just stupid to use a single dose of meldonium,” he said. “It does not work that way, the drug needs a course to restore the heart muscle.” He added: “We live in a hotel in the Olympic Village. Every day a person of five passes through the rooms without us. There comes housekeeping, and completely different people: the grandmothers sweeping the floor, the young guys and girls in gauze dressings bring towels to change. Replace the bottle with another, with the contaminated substance – yes it is easy!” Having called for the Russian Olympic Committee to consider isolating all its athletes in the future to stop further sabotages he drew a strange parallel with Krushelnitsky’s case and chemical attacks in Syria. “I have a complete analogy with what is happening in Syria with chemical attacks,” Belanov said. “How is it organised there? The gang, covered by the US army, brings chlorine and infects territory. Then the guys in white arrive, they take off all this nonsense primitively and rudely, although it is clear that everything is sewn with white threads.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/25/elijah-doughty-protests-hundreds-call-for-justice-ahead-of-parole-hearing","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T04:47:52Z","webTitle":"Elijah Doughty protests: hundreds call for justice ahead of parole hearing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/25/elijah-doughty-protests-hundreds-call-for-justice-ahead-of-parole-hearing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/25/elijah-doughty-protests-hundreds-call-for-justice-ahead-of-parole-hearing","fields":{"headline":"Elijah Doughty protests: hundreds call for justice ahead of parole hearing","bodyText":"Hundreds of people marched in Kalgoorlie on Saturday, protesting the possible parole of a man who ran over and killed a 14-year-old boy. Elijah Doughty died when he was run over by the man driving a Nissan Navara in August 2016. The man had pursued Doughty, believing the motorbike Doughty was riding had earlier been stolen from his home. The man who was sentenced to three years in jail for running down Doughty in bushland reportedly has a parole hearing this week, and may be released just 18 months after his conviction for dangerous driving causing death. He was acquitted on a charge of manslaughter. Family and friends of the child maintain Doughty was murdered. “He should have got more time. He got a slap on the wrist in other words. It sends the wrong message: you kill a black and you can get away with it,” Doughty’s grandfather, Albert, told the ABC at the protest. His grandmother Rhonda Tucker said the march was calling for justice. “18 months is not enough.” A small number of counter-protesters confronted the rally, holding signs which read “all lives matter”, “harsher measures for all crime”, and “Kalgoorlie residents have had enough”. A number of protesters noted the increasing tension in the town, exacerbated by Doughty’s death. A leaflet calling for a “cull a thief day” was found outside the Kalgoorlie train station. “If a thief was to steal my motorbike, I would run him down with my Nissan Navara,” it said in large red writing. It then added “cull a thief day, justice is served”. A picture of the leaflet was posted to Facebook by Kalgoorlie resident, Jacqueline Spurling. “It’s sad to know I live in a town with people that supports killing children for material possessions,” said Spurling. “Whoever you are that took the time to create this rubbish &amp; used the ink to print front &amp; back, LEAVE!” Kalgoorlie police were unable to comment if they were investigating the leaflet. Despite the counter-protest and leaflet, police said the march remained peaceful after organisers worked with authorities ahead of the event. In the days following Doughty’s death, people rioted outside the courthouse, throwing rocks and damaging police cars. Local social media pages began calling for vigilante justice against juvenile crime. The man’s identity has been suppressed for his protection and was sent to an unnamed jail. His family fled interstate and their house was burned down."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/25/nationals-deputy-wants-barnaby-joyce-succession-contest-to-be-one-horse-race","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T19:19:49Z","webTitle":"Michael McCormack set to be deputy PM as Nationals replace Barnaby Joyce","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/25/nationals-deputy-wants-barnaby-joyce-succession-contest-to-be-one-horse-race","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/25/nationals-deputy-wants-barnaby-joyce-succession-contest-to-be-one-horse-race","fields":{"headline":"Michael McCormack set to be deputy PM as Nationals replace Barnaby Joyce","bodyText":"Australia will know its new deputy prime minister on Monday morning, with Michael McCormack, the veterans affairs minister, expected to be appointed the new Nationals leader to replace Barnaby Joyce. The Nationals will meet in Canberra at 8am on Monday to select a new leader after Joyce last week confirmed he would go to the backbench after a fortnight of ceaseless controversy about his private life, and the lodgement of a sexual harassment claim against him with the National party, which he contests. The New South Wales MP David Gillespie withdrew from the race on Sunday afternoon. There had been speculation that agriculture minister and staunch Joyce supporter, David Littleproud, could have a tilt but late on Sunday he said he would not stand. The Nationals deputy leader, Bridget McKenzie, signalled it would be desirable if only one leadership contender put up their hand on Monday morning, and she said the Coalition agreement did not need renegotiation. McKenzie told the ABC on Sunday it was important the government, which has been battered by the controversy, achieved “a seamless transition tomorrow”, rolling over the existing private agreement between the Liberal and National parties, and ministerial portfolios, rather than putting everything up for grabs. She said “conventionally” the leadership of the National party had been decided by acclamation rather than a contested process. That had always been the situation in the past, McKenzie said. When asked whether the Coalition agreement should be made public, McKenzie said the document was administrative, not “sacred” and she said: “The governor general is across it. That’s all that we need to worry about.” With the Joyce imbroglio dominating political coverage for the best part of a fortnight, a new ReachTel poll commissioned by Sky News had Labor ahead of the government on a two-party-preferred basis 54% to 46%. Over the weekend, the outspoken Queenslander George Christensen declared the Nationals should use Joyce’s departure as a trigger to end the formal coalition with the Liberals. Christensen said on Facebook he would “rather see a Liberal prime minister, Liberal deputy prime minister, and a full cabinet of Liberal ministers than have to compromise our values and the welfare of the good people we represent”. “We should not let the trappings of politics and positions of power compromise our desire and our ability to deliver,” he said. Christensen’s NSW Nationals colleague, John “Wacka” Williams, flatly rebuffed that idea. “George can have his opinion but we’d lose so much – we’d lose our ministers who deliver the achievements for regional Australia.” Over the weekend in Washington, Malcolm Turnbull – who publicly excoriated Joyce for his conduct before leaving the country – papered over the row by declaring the Coalition would remain “strong and enduring”. The education minister, Liberal Simon Birmingham said on Sunday “George says a lot of things” but he said the Nationals as a group understood that the best way to influence anything was “to be at the table”. In South Australia, the deputy Liberal leader, Julie Bishop, said come Monday morning there would be a new leader of the National party “and the Coalition continues”. After Joyce confirmed his intentions last Friday, McCormack positioned himself as the unity candidate. While some colleagues are concerned he won’t stand up against the Liberals in the way that Joyce did, McCormack has declared himself a “fighter” with “the drive to deliver”. “When water rights were challenged in my electorate, I crossed the floor to get a better deal. When a big American company came knocking to take over GrainCorp, I stood up for our farmers and opposed it,” McCormack said in a statement after Joyce’s resignation. • with Australian Associated Press"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/feb/25/manchester-united-v-chelsea-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T16:04:10Z","webTitle":"Manchester United 2-1 Chelsea: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/feb/25/manchester-united-v-chelsea-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/feb/25/manchester-united-v-chelsea-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Manchester United 2-1 Chelsea: Premier League – as it happened","bodyText":"Without much further ado, I’m going to hand you over to our coverage of the League Cup final – with Rob Smyth. It’s Arsenal v Manchester City. Hope you’ve enjoyed the last couple of hours and thanks, as ever, for your company and contributions. That’s it! United go back into second. Conte and Mourinho shake hands, the latter also offering a half-pat on the back that the former doesn’t quite welcome, but that is cordial enough. Lukaku and Courtois have an impossibly silly-looking hands-over-mouths conversation. And it was Lukaku’s good work that did much towards winning this for Chelsea, a goal and a fine assist for Lingard doing the job. United were much better in the second half although this was no classic. Conte may wonder whether replacing Hazard just before the winner was a good idea – his team could find no way back after Lingard’s strike. 90+6 min: Chelsea win a corner at the death and Courtois is up! It’s delivered and headed up in the air, and that’s ... 90+4 min: Will it jinx this if I say that United are seeing it out absolutely consummately? 90+3 min: They do but Giroud, after originally getting in the way of Fabregas, sees his effort blocked. Lukaku then takes possession and rampages a full 70 yards, at one stage looking set to home in on goal before Christensen gets in the way. But Mourinho loves that. It buys United time, space and a throw-in near the left-hand flag. 90+2 min: Matic is back on but that took its time so presumably we can make it five minutes. United keep the ball in the corner for a while and Chelsea really need to get out. 90 min: Not much sign of a Chelsea equaliser at the moment and the ball is spending a fair amount of time in their half, albeit not with much intention of scoring on United’s part. Matic is down, so play stops for a while. And that may add to the FOUR minutes we will see after the 90. 88 min: Morata appears to win the ball beautifully from Smalling as he tries to launch a counter, but is pulled up and booked. I guess that counts as a tackle from behind even if he hooked his leg around the side. 87 min: “Looks like Chelsea are going with a 2-3-5 formation for the last 10 mins of the match. If it works, we can call it ‘Contenaccio’,” quips Joe Rodrigo. 86 min: The pair do combine and it gives rise to some Chelsea pressure, which ends with Morata seizing upon a Fabregas chip and beating De Gea ... only to be flagged *just* offside. That was very tight. 85 min: What have Chelsea got left? Will Fabregas be able to dink one up to Giroud? He may get a chance to now as Matic takes a yellow for hauling Willian back in the middle. 82 min: Pedro puts a pass out of play, needlessly, and Conte has daggers for eyes. Forget the air of calm – he would hate to lose this. We get some on-pitch handbags in the meantime, Matic taking exception to a Rudiger challenge on Lingard. 81 min: Sanchez makes way for Bailly, now, in a move intended to hold onto what Mourinho has got. Disappointing afternoon for Sanchez really, but United won’t care if they grab the win. Drinkwater is replaced by Fabregas for Chelsea at the same time. 79 min: Willian tries to beat De Gea again at his near post but this time the goalkeeper dives to save. Then Lindelof’s clearance is charged down by Morata and for a moment Pedro is in, but Smalling is in to bail his colleague out! It’s a corner, and on comes Olivier Giroud for Moses. That comes to nothing but perhaps Chelsea will shift things up a gear now, because I think they’ve been punished for taking it down a notch or two. The substitute turns it right around! There isn’t a lot of obvious threat when Lukaku takes possession out on the right, far from goal and with defenders back. But Rudiger and Pedro don’t offer much challenge as he turns inside, improving his angle for a cross, and his left-foot ball in is perfect for Lingard – ahead of Sanchez – to meet with a flashing header past Courtois! Now Old Trafford is making some noise! 75 min: A clumsy Alonso challenge by the corner flag gives Young the chance to make something. He shows Sanchez and Lingard how it is done, but Christensen gets to the cross just ahead of Pogba. 73 min: Christensen takes a clobbering from Pogba and there’s a delay ... but in the meantime we see Hazard, often bright today but perhaps suffering after taking a whack of his own from Valencia a few minutes back, replaced by Pedro. 72 min: We haven’t seen or heard much from either manager in this half. We are shaping up for a pretty tame outcome in all departments. 69 min: Chelsea respond and Valencia is booked for a foul in a threatening position on the left. Can they put something together now? Willian flashes in a low delivery ... and De Gea does lose sight of it for a second, needing two attempts to gather. 67 min: Brilliant from both Lukaku and Courtois! Oh, that’s so much better. Lukaku twists in the air to take a chipped cross from the left and volleys towards goal with excellent technique – only for the goalkeeper to fingertip it over superbly! 66 min: United win a corner and this is a particularly dull spell so maybe ... no, Lingard’s delivery is even worse than the earlier one by Sanchez. There has, let’s be clear, been very little quality shown out there today. 64 min: Yes, here is Lingard. He replaces the fairly decent Martial. I think Sanchez is lucky not to be the one hooked. 62 min: Half-hearted appeals for a United handball as Martial knocks it against – I think – Azpilicueta but that was never on. All told it’s been a slow start to the half with a couple of bursts of mild excitement. I think we’ll see Jesse Lingard soon, can he add something? 60 min: Willian, brimful of confidence, jinks inside and blazes miles off target with surely his worst shot of the week. 57 min: Unconvincing again from De Gea, who spills a speculative shot from Drinkwater – perhaps hindered by the bright sun – and is fortunate to see the ball cleared by a quick-reacting Valencia before Alonso can gobble up the rebound. 56 min: In it swings from Sanchez ... and away it is headed at the near post. Sanchez has, a spot of good work in the move for the goal aside, been wasteful so far today and not quite on the pace. 55 min: Martial has a long-range dig blocked, amid a United attack of rather more intent than many we’ve seen today. They eventually win a flag kick ... 53 min: Sanchez ignores an obvious ball to an open Valencia and instead loses possession, to groans. 51 min: United are playing a few yards higher up at the moment and pressing Chelsea as they try and play the ball out. It’s caused a couple of half-flutters but nothing more yet. 49 min: Martial combines well with Sanchez but rather fritters away what comes next. At the other end Morata nips in ahead of Smalling and seems to be away for a second ... but he’s pushed a bit too far and wide, and by the time he checks back inside and shoots there are enough bodies around to block. 47 min: Pogba is pulled up for a foul – at least showing more fight there than in the buildup to Willian’s goal, when he completely failed to challenge for the ball before Chelsea countered. United start it. What dramas await? Ok, the second half is coming up in five ... Interesting to note on United’s goal that Christensen takes a knock to the head in the buildup, thinks about staying down but gets up, carries on and isn’t quite in position. If he stays down, does that goal happen? “Good to see Willian getting a bit of appreciation recently,” writes Woolie Madden. “Always rated him, but I feel he has gone somewhat underappreciated over the years. Shall we try for a Premier League outfield XI of underappreciated players who never seem to quite take the highest plaudits? As well as Willian, I’d put Heung-Min Son in there; Fernandinho too. Any other suggestions?” I agree, although I think Son has now worked his way to a more exalted status and Willian is pretty much there now too. It has taken time. “Stop me if this sounds ridiculous,” instructs David Wall. “But is it possible that United’s stodginess in recent weeks had been more due to their just being in a period of poor form rather than some anti football masterplan by Mourinho. “At different times this season, all of the clubs challenging for the top four (City aside) have had periods where they have played great, and others where they have stank and faced calls for the manager’s head from fans claiming the are betraying the ethos of their respective clubs. United are just in their slump right now and it is exaggerated because Liverpool are in a really excellent spell. “I understand that social media has changed the rules, and City have pushed things too this year, but didn’t we used to accept that individuals and teams could have periods of better and worse form without it bringing about the end of days?” We did, and for what it’s worth I think your broader point is right. Lukaku’s nicely-worked equaliser came at an important time for United, who have been the less impressive of these two teams. Willian scored a fine opener of his own, while Morata has hit the post and – at the other end – Sanchez missed a good chance. The managers have even had a bit of a chuckle together! Should be plenty more to enjoy in around 15 minutes, then. 45+1 min: We will see two added minutes of a half that has suddenly chirped up. 44 min: I should underline that United’s goal came from a very sharp interplay around the box. Perhaps this attacking shape can work after all! Now for a Willian free-kick, though, that is clipped towards Morata but ends up with De Gea. 41 min: Ooooh, Hazard almost gets a clear sight of goal after a quickly-taken free-kick but eventually enough defenders get back and the ball ends up with Alonso, who misses the target. This one has hotted up! And that is, ahem, a response. Lukaku had not started this game well at all but is alive when Martial, receiving a sharp slide-rule Sanchez ball into the box, lays it off to him. He takes a touch and slides comfortably past Courtois from eight yards. I must admit I did not see that coming. 38 min: United have ... errr ... mounted no response whatsoever yet and if anything Chelsea seem more exuberant. “Your city is blue ... just like London, your city is blue,” chant the Chelsea fans. 35 min: Alonso takes a cute ball from Hazard and for a second you think it calls for a crack of that sweet left peg, but he clearly doesn’t like the angle and works it onto his less sweet right, curling well wide. 34 min: Chelsea deserve that, for my money. It doesn’t seem to matter how attacking, on paper, United’s lineup is – it’s all invariably so stodgy. Now then! Willian heads away a Valencia cross in his own box and then, going for the ball again, comes away on the counter. He finds Hazard and then keeps on going, eventually receiving a perfect return pass from the Belgian, running clear on the right and lashing past De Gea! It’s at his near post and the goalkeeper may be disappointed, but Willian really hit that. What a rapier-like counter that was, and superb work from the in-form Willian in both boxes. 30 min: Pogba does beautifully to ease past Kante and what results – a foul that earns Kante a yellow card before his foe can get too far away – is never really in doubt. Even allowing for that Sanchez chance, I find this broadly accurate. 28 min: Chance for Sanchez! He usually gobbles them up! Space opens up 10 yards out after fine work from Martial and it’s crying out for a first-time finish, but he takes a touch and ends up, slightly off-balance, prodding harmlessly at Courtois! 27 min: Willian plays a sloppy pass across his own defence, now, and Lukaku seizes onto it but there’s never quite the angle for a shot – and he can’t successfully play Sanchez though. Then a Young cross finds its way right through to Lukaku at the back post; he spins but his shot is blocked. I guess that’s better from United. 25 min: Kante messes up a Chelsea move that, at one stage, oozed promise before slowing down. United counter and Martial finds space on the left but not a lot comes of that either. My sense is that he is what you’d call a “manager’s player”. Takes instructions, acts on them, does a job for the team. Today’s job is to deal with Hazard – which he’s doing fairly well so far. 22 min: A Chelsea free kick, wide right. It’s hugging the touchline, can Willian generate some threat? It’s not a bad delivery, dipping towards the six-yard box, but Matic hooks away. 20 min: Yes, at the moment it is pretty scrappy. De Gea shanks one out of play. Old Trafford is, you’ll be surprised to hear, quiet bar a few taunts from the away support about exactly that fact. 18 min: A slower spell, with Chelsea dominating the ball. Willian wins a free-kick from Matic and ... wait for it ... Mourinho and Conte appear to share a joke in the technical area! I saw smiles! There’s your back page – certainly at this rate, because the set piece is cleared easily. Broadly just ahead of McTominay and Matic, although I think he’ll still have to do some defending. 14 min: Moses, busy early on and getting some joy, tries to bundle through on the right but Young does well. He gets a yard on Young moments later and Lindelof stabs the fizzed low centre away. 12 min: Lukaku lays off smartly for Sanchez after some good work from Valencia. It comes to nothing but United seem to have settled after being caught cold in those early minutes. 10 min: Morata upends Pogba just beyond the left corner of the box and United have their first dangerous-looking situation. Sanchez will deliver ... but it’s easy for Courtois. Disappointing. 8 min: Now Christensen takes the opportunity to run the ball forwards from defence but ends up losing possession. Chelsea are playing with freedom here though. 7 min: Now United put a few passes together and, as a minimum, they need that because Chelsea started like a train and ought to be a goal up. 5 min: Morata clatters the bar ... then De Gea saves! A delightful crossfield ball from Hazard to Alonso is equally delightfully volleyed across goal first-time by the wing-back – and Morata steams onto it, jabbing the ball plum against the crossbar at full tilt from close range! Hazard gathers the rebound as it bounces up, and his deflected effort is tipped over at full stretch by De Gea. The corner comes to nothing, but what a chance that was for Morata. He should score, if you look at the slow-motion, but in real time that was tough because Alonso drilled the ball across at such speed. 4 min: Rudiger goes on a huge run from back to front, which takes him into a good crossing position inside the area, but he scuffs it a bit. Chelsea keep up the early pressure. United haven’t got on the ball yet. 2 min: And that early Chelsea positivity wins them a corner. It’s pulled back low, quite cleverly, but Matic spirits it away from the primed Morata. Chelsea get straight onto the front foot. “I think Mourinho has an inferiority complex and always parks the bus against teams if he feels inferior to their manager. Enjoy the borefest!” writes Malcolm Shuttleworth. The handshake happened. It was brief and transactional. Now: the football. Mourinho is playing the game, shaking hands with all the Chelsea team. No confrontation between the managers yet. But out of the tunnel they now go ... JR in Illinois has a prediction: “You want to know what I expect? In the immortal words of Clubber Lang, ‘Prediction?.....Pain.’ For the viewing audience that is. I blame Mourinho.” My thing with Sanchez is that he has played in *such* an intense fashion for so many years, for club and country, and he is not getting any younger. When he slows up, which he will quite soon, what else is there unless he adapts pretty eyecatchingly? If used correctly he should get a good season at United next year but you’d have to say they have bought a player who, logically, will be on his way down beyond that. Harry Kane has won it for Spurs in the 89th. It’s fair to say that was coming. Will we see similar drama at Old Trafford? Get your emails and tweets in as I want to know exactly what you expect. Five minutes to go at Selhurst Park and Spurs still ... somehow ... haven’t scored. It’s goalless and like the Alamo. Yes, it does feel a bit like a midfielder’s game doesn’t it? But then again it’s also the kind of match Alexis Sanchez, yet to really catch light at Old Trafford, was bought for. There’s another Premier League game ongoing at the moment and you really ought to join Tom Davies for it. It’s Palace 0-0 Spurs, there’s half an hour to go and Harry Kane has missed a sitter: These are, on paper, both very attacking teams – albeit in hands that are more than capable of turning this into a stultifying borefest if they wish. I, like you I’m sure, hold optimism for the former. Man Utd: De Gea, Valencia, Lindelof, Smalling, Young, McTominay, Matic, Pogba, Martial, Lukaku, Sanchez. Subs: Bailly, Mata, Lingard, Carrick, Rashford, Shaw, Joel Pereira. Chelsea: Courtois, Azpilicueta, Christensen, Rudiger, Moses, Kante, Drinkwater, Alonso, Willian, Hazard, Morata. Subs: Caballero, Fabregas, Pedro, Giroud, Zappacosta, Cahill, Emerson. Referee: Martin Atkinson Pogba and McTominay! It’s the dream – but guess what ... you’re not dreaming! Morata starts too for Chelsea in a fairly attack-minded lineup. “Me and him face to face. I’m ready. I don’t know if he’s ready.” Remember that? That was Antonio Conte seven short weeks ago, issuing a very loud Bring It On to Jose Mourinho. In fairness Mourinho doesn’t really need to do the bringing – his team are the ones at home – and since that highly amusing and slightly unsavoury set of exchanges last month the temperature does, it is fair to say, seem to have been dialled down. The pair clearly have no love for each other and the Handshake Police will be out in number ... but anyone seeking touchline handbags at dawn may be disappointed to learn that the pair will almost certainly have been given a little friendly advice about their conduct in the run-up to this. So there’s a chance we might have to content ourselves with a mere football match! Inconvenient, because we’re all body language experts now, aren’t we! So, on pain of boring you, what awaits us here? I’m going to look like a massive sort-of hypocrite here and wonder if we’ll see Paul Pogba back in the United starting XI – if he’s not then that situation will be looking even more interesting. And I wonder whether Chelsea, in particular, may want to freshen things up after their Champions League exploits on Tuesday. This is of course a big game in the Race For Second and I would suggest, in that context, that Conte’s team really need to win it. So which way will he go? Find out here over the next few hours – and keep me posted on your thoughts on goals, handshakes, insults, shocking omissions from starting lineups and all the rest. Nick will be here soon. In the meantime, here’s Andy Hunter’s preview to the match: It is the fixture that releases an adrenaline rush at Manchester Unitedaccording to José Mourinho, the game that carries extra significance for supporters and the rivalry of the Premier League. According to Mourinho that fixture is Liverpool. He has demoted Chelsea to the ranks of “any normal game”. The ramifications of Sunday’s result at Old Trafford ensure it is anything but. The United manager will find few dissenters to his argument that Chelsea’s visit has lost an edge as neither team is competing for the title, despite sitting second and fourth at the start of the weekend. On a personal level he claims the memories of delivering three Premier League titles to Stamford Bridge fade with every encounter against his former club. The importance of victory over a Champions League rival and competitor has not diminished, however, not when those supporters who Mourinho claims have Liverpool’s arrival on 10 March circled in their diaries are craving signs of genuine progress at Old Trafford.

For many South Koreans it was the first time they’d ever met any of their northern neighbours. The DPRK’s male minders made sure, though, that they were kept very separate from the general population. Miss: Mike Pence It was a tough Olympics for US vice-president Mike Pence. Before and during the Games he was vocally criticised by LGBT athletes Gus Kenworthy and Adam Rippon for his attitude to gay rights. Then at the opening ceremony Pence found himself awkwardly sat near to Kim Jong-un’s sister and the North Korean VIP delegation, at a time when at home the USA was piling more diplomatic pressure on the DPRK over its nuclear programme. He did not shake their hands. Hit: Marit Bjørgen Norway’s Marit Bjørgen made history as the most decorated ever Winter Olympics athlete. With 15 medals overall, she claimed her seventh and eighth gold medals in cross-country skiing in South Korea. Aged 37, it was her fifth Olympics. The top three Winter Olympians of all time are Norwegian: Ole Einar Bjørndalen and Bjørn Dæhlie have 13 and 12 medals respectively, and the country topped Pyeongchang’s medal table. Miss: Elizabeth Swaney Swaney performed the world’s dullest halfpipe ski routine, attempting virtually no tricks, to much ire on social media. She was born and bought up un the US, but her grandparents are from Hungary, allowing her to compete for that country. Her unambitious programme would usually guarantee she’d finish above competitors who had fallen and failed to score, but on this occasion it took her no further than finishing last in qualification. Still, she fulfilled her long ambition to reach the Games, and gets to call herself an Olympian for life. Hit: Team GB’s Super Saturday It was an unprecedented feat as Britain’s first Olympic medal-winning skier Izzy Atkin was joined by Lizzy Yarnold’s gold and Laura Deas’s bronze in the skeleton. The first time Team GB had ever won three medals in a day at a Winter Olympics, with Yarnold becoming the first Briton to retain a Winter Olympic title in the process. But your heart went out to Austria’s Janine Flock. Her final run saw her slip from leading the skeleton, to missing out on the medals altogether. Team GB ended up with their best ever Winter Olympics medal haul. Miss: Elise Christie In stark contrast to Team GB’s success on the skeleton track, on the speed skating ice Elise Christie crashed out. Not once. Not twice. But three times. Despite being a triple gold medal winner in 2017’s World Championships, Christie now has a run of six successive crashes or disqualifications at the Olympics. Hit: South Korea’s ‘garlic girls’ The gold medal eluded them in the end, but the five Kims on South Korea’s women’s curling team became national heroes as they unexpectedly reached the final. Dubbed the “Garlic girls” after their garlic-producing hometown Uiseong, the nation took them to their hearts as they made thrilling progress through the tournament. Miss: South Korea’s speed-skating ‘bullies’ Less popular with the South Korean public were the women speedskaters. Kim Bo-reum and Park Ji-woo were accused of bullying team-mate Noh Seon-yeong after a disastrous pursuit quarter-final where Noh had been dropped off the back of the team, and was left in tears by the trackside. In a press conference afterwards one of the skaters appeared to laugh about Noh not being able to keep up. More than 500,000 people then signed a petition calling for Kim and Park to be ousted from the team. Hit: Chloe Kim and her ice cream desire Chloe Kim became one of the stars of the Games at just 17, becoming the youngest woman to win an Olympic snowboarding medal, taking gold in the women’s snowboard halfpipe. Her approachability was typified by a tweet she sent saying “Could be down for some ice cream right now” – in the middle of competing. Miss: weather High winds saw several events included ski-jumping cancelled and pushed back a few days. Not so the women’s snowboarding slopestyle final, which went ahead in conditions described by competitors as “too dangerous”. Only nine of the 52 runs in the final were clean, making the result something of a lottery. Hit: trousers and knitting Beyond topping the medal table, Norway also made a sartorial impact, with their curling team once again sporting extravagant trousers. On Valentine’s Day they graced the Pyeongchang ice with a uniform featuring pink love hearts. Meanwhile Finland’s Olympians caught the eye with their knitting hobby – the squad was collectively making a blanket for the Finnish president’s newborn child. Miss: the Gabriella Papadakis dress French ice dancer Gabriella Papadakis will remember her appearance in Pyeongchang for all the wrong reasons. While dancing with Guillaume Cizeron, her dress became unfastened, revealing rather more than intended. “It was my worst nightmare happening at the Olympics,” she said. The couple retained their composure, however, and eventually secured silver."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/25/winter-olympics-closing-ceremony-10-highlights-from-pyeongchang","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T14:15:14Z","webTitle":"Winter Olympics closing ceremony: 10 highlights from Pyeongchang","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/25/winter-olympics-closing-ceremony-10-highlights-from-pyeongchang","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/feb/25/winter-olympics-closing-ceremony-10-highlights-from-pyeongchang","fields":{"headline":"Winter Olympics closing ceremony: 10 highlights from Pyeongchang","bodyText":"South Korea marked the end of the 2018 Winter Olympics with a spectacular closing ceremony in Pyeongchang. All the usual elements were there – the costumes, the fireworks, and the ceremonial handover to the next hosts. With an overarching theme of winter turning into spring, the two-hour show had some amazing highlights. A real-life guitar hero One of the first musical numbers featured 13-year-old guitarist Yang Tae-hwan, who did a metal-inspired guitar version of excerpts from Vivaldi’s Four Seasons. But it was the gravity-defying dancers in the background that grabbed the attention in this sequence. Standing on top of some squiggly lines that seemed to represent the frequencies of the music, they looked like a real-life version of Guitar Hero. ‘A proper hangover cure, that one’ In the UK, where the ceremony started at 11am on a Sunday morning, the BBC’s commentary team were not over-impressed by the appearance of South Korean post-rock band Jambinai. They mix classical South Korean instruments with guitar, drums and bass, and end up sounding something like Mogwai or Explosions in the Sky. Athletes with conspicuous selfie sticks The organisers of the closing ceremony changed Olympic etiquette slightly for the athletes’ entrance. Usually, at the closing ceremony they come in as one big happy bunch, but this year they were still marshalled into different teams and countries. But there was no missing the selfie sticks. At least at the Winter Olympics you imagine they could be used for some impromptu ice hockey. The bit where it paused for a medal ceremony The women’s 30km mass-start classic cross-country skiing event had its medal presentation in the middle of the ceremony. And that meant that the most successful Winter Olympian of all time, Norway’s Marit Bjørgen, was presented with her eighth gold – and 15th medal overall – in front of the largest possible television audience. It seemed very, very fitting. Accent on youth As well as the overall theme of winter turning to spring, there was a real emphasis on youth during the ceremony, whether it was the 13-year-old guitarist or two small children holding snow globes. They were both born on the day in July 2011 when Pyeongchang learned it would host the Games. The singing of the Olympic anthem was entrusted to an 11-year-old boy, Oh Yeon-joon, who had won the South Korean version of The Voice. And neatly tying the the closing ceremony to the opening ceremony, the five children who had been the focus two weeks ago made another appearance. He did it again Of course he did. Tonga’s Pita Taufatofua once again went topless for the closing ceremony. That awkward diplomatic seating plan Ivanka Trump was representing the US in the audience – her father having tweeted that “we cannot have a better, or smarter, person representing our country” on Friday. Rather like the situation with Mike Pence at the opening ceremony, Ivanka found herself seated close to a controversial figure from the North Korean regime. Kim Yong-chol has been blamed for the sinking of a South Korean naval ship that killed 46 sailors. The 72-year-old previously headed up the Reconnaissance General Bureau – North Korea’s spy agency. The handover from South Korea to China There’s always something historic about the handover of the Olympic flag from host city to host city, and so it was with the flag passing from Pyeongchang to Beijing – not just for geopolitical reasons. With Tokyo hosting the summer games in 2020, it represents six years that the Olympics will be centred in east Asia. Beijing will also become the first city ever to have hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics. China’s amazing glowing inline skating pandas Beijing got to contribute its own section to the show – and it started with some astonishing lit-up see-through inline skating pandas. Top that. It was all about EXO K-pop band EXO’s fans have been dominating social media in the buildup to the closing ceremony. Within minutes of the ceremony starting they managed to get #Olympics_EXO to be the number one trending Twitter hashtag worldwide. The eight-piece boyband performed their huge hit Power, accompanied by a massive fireworks display, after entering the arena on individual trucks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/feb/25/new-zealand-v-england-first-odi-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T09:07:30Z","webTitle":"New Zealand beat England in first ODI after dramatic finale – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/feb/25/new-zealand-v-england-first-odi-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/feb/25/new-zealand-v-england-first-odi-live","fields":{"headline":"New Zealand beat England in first ODI after dramatic finale – as it happened","bodyText":"So there we go: New Zealand take the lead in the five-match series; join us for the next instalment on Wednesday. Until then, enjoy the rest of your weekend. Boult and Southee did superbly to slow England down towards the end of their innings, and the partnership between Latham and Taylor was special. But the match turned for the final time when Santner somehow got a perfect yorker away for four; no boundary off the first ball of the final over and the pressure is properly on. These two teams are a) well-matched and b) excellent. As such, these series/seres/serieses are going to be a lot of fun. That’s why this format is so good! So many swings of momentum in so short a period, plenty of room for all the intricacies and vagaries of the game. Fantastic! 49.3 Wow! Santner waits, swings down, and creams, batters and fries a giant six over midwicket! What a match! 49.2 Slower ball outside off, slanted across the left-handed Santner ... but it’s wide! New Zealand need 5 from 5. 49.1 Oh! This is a really good ball from Woakes, hammering in a perfect yorker, and Santner somehow slices it through his own legs for a fortuitous four! New Zealand need 6 from 5. Woakes it is... 48.6 That last ball was also a no ball but no one notices, and another single to long on means 9 are needed off the final over! Excitement! New Zealand are favourites I’d say ... who’s going to bowl? Stokes or Woakes? New Zealand need 9 from 6. 48.5 Slower one and Santner gets enough of this! It’s too straight and hands drag body through it for four! New Zealand need 10 from 7. 48.4 Southee takes a swing but drags a slower ball to the man at long on; he missed out there. New Zealand need 14 from 8. 48.3 Yorker from Curran, excellent gear, and Santner can’t make space for the slog; single. New Zealand need 15 from 9. 48.2 Southee gets hold of this but picks out long on. New Zealand need 16 from 10. 48.1 Slower ball from Curran, single over the top down the ground. New Zealand need 17 from 11. 48th over: New Zealand 267-7 (Santner 28, Southee 6) Target 285 Here we are! Santner down on one knee to hoist Rashid’s wrongun over cow corner for six! Here we are! Front of the hand, too short, Santner down again, and six over long on! 22 off 16 required! Rashid sends down a wide – he needs some quick mindfulness – then a floaty legspinner goes for one. A dot follows, then another single to cover, then another to long on. New Zealand need 18 from 12, and Rashid has done a fine job putting England in with a shout despite a brutal final over, 16 from it. 47th over: New Zealand 251-7 (Santner 14, Southee 5) Target 285 The run rate is nearly up to 11 and it’ll take something for New Zealand to sort things from here ... but New Zealand are something. Curran is tearing in now, and slings down an aggressive-ass yorker that Southee does well to block. They just can’t get the ball away, three singles from the first five balls, but then a wider slower one is right in Southee’s swing, too full, and the go-go gadget arms cream over cover for a one-bounce four. New Zealand are just about in this still, 34 off 18 required. 46th over: New Zealand 244-7 (Santner 12, Southee 0) Target 285 Could it be two in two?! Southee takes a big stride, misses, and Butter drops the ball, picks it up, and bumps the stumps. Was Southee’s foot off the ground? Possibly, but the footage is inconclusive and there’s no reason to overturn the on-field call. Brilliant over from Rashid though. Well there we are! Well done Eoin Morgan and well done Adil Rashid! Taylor goes, but picks the wrong ball to go at, one which dips and grips; he misses by a fortnight, Buttler has the bails off in a trice, and what a finish we now have in store! 46th over: New Zealand 244-6 (Taylor 113, Santner 12) Target 285 Eoin Morgan gambles, bringing back Rashid; Taylor will have to get after him. The first four balls yield just three singles, but. 45th over: New Zealand 241-6 (Taylor 112, Santner 10) Target 285 England would probably expect to win from here if they were New Zealand, but would definitely expect to win from here if they were England, which they are. At some point, Taylor is going to have to go, the problem being that if he gets himself out it’s over. It doesn’t need to be now though! Curran’s bowled a decent over into the pitch, but then seeking a yorker he sends down a full toss and Santner mashes a pull over long on! An overthrow follows next ball, and that’s the run rate satisfied! 44th over: New Zealand 232-6 (Taylor 111, Santner 2) Target 285 Stokes gives Taylor width and he makes sure not to miss out, power-carving four through backward point. A wide then follows, then one slips out the hand high - it’s above waist-height, no no-ball is called, Taylor cracks through third man and waits quizzically for the free hit which never arrives. The rest of the over is tidier , two singles from it, and the rate is 8.83. Might that be the end of Stokes? Either way, we’re set for a serious finish. 43rd over: New Zealand 221-6 (Taylor 102, Santner 1) Target 285 Curran sends down a leg-side wide which trims the air immediately adjacent to the leg bail. The required rate is now up to 8.93 as the batsmen take a single each; Taylor is on 99; and he wallops cross-batted behind square on the off side, and that raises a magnificent hunnert. He’s been in control pretty much from the start, but now he needs help from one more team-mate ...and Santner nearly ensure it isn’t him, knocking one down that almost skips back into the stumps. 42nd over: New Zealand 215-6 (Taylor 98, Santner 0) Target 285 England are working around Taylor and New Zealand, who looked almost home, now look almost out of it. Sport, eh. Some people! Ben Stokes is some person! He flings down a slower ball outside off, De Grandhomme plays le grand homme, throwing hands and arms at it, edging behind! That error from Buttler cost England nothing! 42nd over: New Zealand 215-5 (Taylor 98, De Grandhomme 2) Target 285 Ben Stokes is exactly the gadgie you want to have the ball right now, but what does he have left? Taylor plays him down into the ground and puts him in a race with De Grandhomme, one after the ball the other the crease; the latter wins. Taylor then dabs down a fine slower ball and adds one before they try for two by way of leg-byes ... Woakes chucks in ... and Buttler, in front of the stumps according to the current vogue, misses the ball! Laugh! 41st over: New Zealand 210-5 (Taylor 96, De Grandhomme 1) Target 285 That wicket ball was a proper half-volley; Nicholls will be proper naused it did for him. Two singles and two leg-byes complete the over. One brings two! It’s a procession! Etcetera! Curran goes around to Nicholls and cramps him slightly; he flings the cut, doesn’t get all of it, and suddenly England are favourites! 40th over: New Zealand 205-4 (Taylor 94, Nicholls 0) Target 285 That’s the height of Stokes is that, finding a way to find something even if ostensibly, it had very little to do with him. Well then! Latham is knackered, so stands to try and shmice a boundary, picking out Root at mid on instead. What a partnership though, 178 and made under serious pressure. 40th over: New Zealand 205-3 (Taylor 94, Latham 79) Target 285 Stokes barrels in does a good enough job to begin with, conceding two singles and a wide from his first four balls. 39th over: New Zealand 202-3 (Taylor 93, Latham 78) Target 285 Curran returns and England need him to reproduce the form which got them a win in that final ODI against Australia in Perth. But this pitch is much slower than that pitch, the problem for England being that New Zealand have so many wickets in hand that simply using it to restrict the runs probably won’t be enough. But then off the final ball of the over, a slower one,Latham slams into the air! Bairstow and Moeen both look at it, Bairstow goes from square leg ... eventually ... getting there eventually, having gone the long way round ... and he grasses it on the dive! Oh dear! That was a regulation chance made to look hard. 38th over: New Zealand 198-3 (Taylor 91, Latham 76) Target 285 Stokes back into the attack; “Come on bro” says Taylor as Latham turns down a single. But quickly it doesn’t matter because Stokes then strays to leg and Taylor is having no such thing, four carted over backward square leg ... followed by four more when another down leg is edge-pulled fine. Taylor adds a further single before Latham absolutely middles one to the man one the fence for another, then another makes this a fine over for NewZealand, 11 from it. They are looking so confident and it’s very hard to see a way for England. 37th over: New Zealand 174-3 (Taylor 81, Latham 75) Target 285 A pair of singles and the target is down to single figures; one more follows, and an appeal when Latham misses with a sweep, summarily rejected. He had treatment for cramp during drinks and perhaps all those quick singles are telling. 36th over: New Zealand 184-3 (Taylor 79, Latham 74) Target 285 The expertise with which these two have RO-tated the strike has been brilliant, but Woakes keeps them quiet with four dots and a single before one bounces a little bit more and beats Latham as it cuts in, missing the stumps by the cube root of nowt. And to rub it in, Woakes then donates some width, Latham duly guiding four through third man. Just when he thought he was out, they pulled him back in. 35th over: New Zealand 179-3 (Taylor 78, Latham 70) Target 285 I wonder how many runs England wold pay for a wicket here; maybe a barter system would revitalise the format. Rashid continues, but after singles are milked, Latham sends a leading edge soaring and dropping, to no one! When it’s your day it’s your day. Talking of soaring, I heard a Scottish woman on the radio the other day talking about how when said by her, saw, sore and soar are all said differently, but in London they’re homonyms. Any more for any more? 34th over: New Zealand 172-3 (Taylor 75, Latham 66) Target 285 Mike Hesson is interviewed and he’s wearing his hat at a jaunty angle, peak all flat. But things are going well for his boyz, Taylor cutting a length ball from Woakes to the fence; he is so strong square of the wicket. Four singles also come from the over, and New Zealand are all over this now! Drinks, and England could use a skinful. 33rd over: New Zealand 164-3 (Taylor 69, Latham 64) Target 285 Rashid has been a threat but needs a wicket, instead offering Taylor some width and being smacked through backward point for four! And then again, but this time Bairstow saves the boundary and they run three. Ten from the over, and this match could run away from England now. 32nd over: New Zealand 154-3 (Taylor 61, Latham 62) Target 285 England bring back Woakes, and his first ball hits Taylor in line; not out, says the umpire, so England review and apparently it’s bouncing over the top. A couple of slower dots follow, but when Woakes goes short, Taylor isn’t befuddled or rushed, simply monstering it to the square-leg fence for four. A single follows, and then Latham pulls one that’s both slow and short in front of square. All of a sudden, a good over for England is a good over for New Zealand. 31st over: New Zealand 145-3 (Taylor 56, Latham 58) Target 285 Rashid beats Taylor, who pushes at one outside off but misses entirely. Three singles off the over, and the partnership is 118; the current rate is 4.67 and required rate 7.36. 30th over: New Zealand 142-3 (Taylor 54, Latham 54) Target 285 This is looking very easy now, four singles and a wide, then Latham reverse sweeps around the corner and past Stokes for four. What will Morgan try next? It’s got to be something. 29th over: New Zealand 133-3 (Taylor 52, Latham 51) Target 285 Latham top edges but the ball goes safe; single. Taylor then makes to moves across, then backs away and cuts; single; Latham then bunts down the ground to raise his fifty; what a partnership this is, short on pyrotechnics, long on competence. Five off the over. 28th over: New Zealand 128-3 (Taylor 50, Latham 48) Target 285 Root into the attack; will the batsmen have a dart at him? On the one hand the rate is 7.24, on the other this is a chance.He’s a funny bowler, Root - he doesn’t have any tricks but he manages to rush through overs before anyone can do anything to him, and this one disappears with two singles and a wide coming from its first fives balls, before Taylor makes room backing away, feels he’s missed out when he picks out Curran ... who helpfully dives over it! That’s fine fifty for Taylor! 27th over: New Zealand 121-3 (Taylor 45, Latham 47) Target 285 Taylor gets a leading edge to Rashid’s first delivery; it yields a single. And Rashid does very well with the rest of his over, four dots, then an inside edge into the thigh pad from Latham, and Buttler drops! He was diddled by the second deflection! 26th over: New Zealand 120-3 (Taylor 44, Latham 47) Target 285 Morgan fiddles with the field as the batsmen, both excellent players of spin, milk Moeen. Six from the over, with minimal apparent effort. 25th over: New Zealand 114-3 (Taylor 42, Latham 43) Target 285 I wonder if Morgan might try an over or two from his opening bowlers, because he won’t be happy letting this go as it is. in the meantime, four singles then two dots comprise Rashid’s latest over, though Rashid does well at the end of it. First, Taylor fails to pick a googly but is far enough down not to be given lb, then fizzes one past the bat as Taylor charges down, narrowly avoiding being stumped. 24th over: New Zealand 110-3 (Taylor 40, Latham 41) Target 285 Taylor is batting really nicely, and after Latham takes a single, he dabs a sweep around the corner for 7000 ODI runs, Stokes chasing and diving in futility for extra satisfaction. 23rd over: New Zealand 104-3 (Taylor 35, Latham 40) Target 285 Morgan introduces Deirdre Rashid – “his wicket-taking spinner,” says Nasser. That’s not intended as an indictment of Moeen, but, well. Anyway, there’s turn there and Rashid’s third ball deceives Taylor in the flight, hitting him on the pad. And the final delivery of the over is a bit quicker, hurrying through Taylor; promising for England. 22nd over: New Zealand 91-3 (Taylor 27, Latham 36) Target 285 Moeen strays down leg side, so Taylor plays a one-handed backhand glance for four, beautiful! Five other runs make this a good over, and England need something. 21st over: New Zealand 91-3 (Taylor 27, Latham 36) Target 285 Curran returns, and his second ball, persuades an outside edge from Taylor, but into the ground for one. So he comes around to Latham, goes for another one, and then a slower ball sticks in the pitch, bounces slowly, and hovers with “kick me” chalked on its back. Taylor obliges, ramming four through square leg, and three more come from the remaining two deliveries. There’s still plenty of work to do, but this partnership is going along very nicely even if the required rate is now 6.7 20th over: New Zealand 81-3 (Taylor 21, Latham 32) Target 285 Moeen continues and Latham turns his first ball for two then wears his third on the pad, getting down to sweep. There’s a big appeal but the ball pitched outside the line and Joe Root at slip gives sage advice against reviewing. 19th over: New Zealand 76-3 (Taylor 20, Latham 28) Target 285 Stokes keeps at it, bowling pretty drily in all senses of the word. He does sling down a full toss with his final delivery, but Taylor doesn’t get hold of it because [redcated]. 18th over: New Zealand 73-3 (Taylor 19, Latham 26) Target 285 Moeen into the attack, and Taylor immediately unfurls the sweep for one, then again when Latham contrives a single of his own. He adds another too, and New Zealand are going nicely now. 17th over: New Zealand 69-3 (Taylor 17, Latham 24) Target 285 Stokes continues and suddenly I’ve just contracted earworm, most likely subconsciously fantasising about the night out I’m still on, not that this would be my chosen noise if I actually was. Five off the over, all of them singles, as the PA plays Ed Sheeran and suddenly Roger Sanchez sounds like exactly what we all need. 16th over: New Zealand 64-3 (Taylor 14, Latham 22) Target 285 England will be wanting to break this partnership now, he said insightfully, because it’s starting to get going and there isn’t loads of batting to come. Curran’s over is nicely milked, seven from it including a slower-ball wide; I wonder if we’ll see spin presently – or after drinks anyhow. 15th over: New Zealand 56-3 (Taylor 10, Latham 19) Target 285 Jeering as Stokes runs in, some singing too - I think they’re even calling him a name. So Stokes goes short, and Latham pulls him for four. 14th over: New Zealand 51-3 (Taylor 9, Latham 15) Target 285 Curran offers Taylor some width and powers his hands all the way through it and then some, sending four to the point fence. These two look in now, but after a single to each batsman, Curran sends down an overspun, seam-up slower ball out of the back of the hand; that’s very nice, so too the one which follows it. 13th over: New Zealand 44-3 (Taylor 3, Latham 14) Target 285 Binyamin Stokes is back into the attack after five months, er, gardening at fine leg. England don’t expect they’ll get 10 overs out of him, but I’d be wary of asking for the ball back if things are going well. Latham twists a single to midwicket off his first ball, but Stokes is working up some pace here, and Taylor’s single to cover is the only other scoring shot in the over. The required rate is now 6.43. 12th over: New Zealand 42-3 (Taylor 2, Latham 13) Target 285 Curran replaces Willey, and Taylor struggles to pick him up; there’s a shadow across the pitch and the bowlers are coming from light to dark. Ian Smith is keen to make this point; “they’re close to calling it off,” says Nasser. Two from the over, and England are slowly strangulating. 11th over: New Zealand 40-3 (Taylor 1, Latham 12) Target 285 Willey continues - as long as possible, reckons Nasser, on the basis that he can go towards the end of an innings. But he can go towards the start too, Latham planting his front foot and driving for four through the covers for four, then again! That was so easy for him! And he goes again, but Stokes has been sent to sweep and he keeps them to two, right in front of the family area; how apt. Two singles follow, and New Zealand needed that. 10th over: New Zealand 28-3 (Taylor 0, Latham 0) Target 285 Guptill didn’t quite hit that drive, or one or two others, with all he had, the suggestion being that he hasn’t recalibrated from T20. England have been brilliant! Woakes is wider with this one, but all a frazzled Guptill can do is slap it straight to Stokes at short cover! Suddenly 284 looks a nifty total; it’s possible England won’t need that teefed final run! 10th over: New Zealand 27-2 (Guptill 17, Taylor 0 Target 285 I hate myself for saying this but it’s so nice to have Sky back. Nasser reminds us that Williamson plays that shot in Tests when there’s a cordon, but that he was only ever getting one for it so what was the point. England have been excellent thus far, and Guptill almost sends himself hutchward bound, a Woakes delivery sticking in the pitch which he drives just short of the man there specifically to catch that error. 9th over: New Zealand 27-2 (Guptill 17, Taylor 0 Target 285 New Zealand aren’t exactly in trouble, but they’ve certainly got a problem. Neither out batsmen needed to play the shot that they did. Huge wicket for England! Williamson tries a late cut but doesn’t have the width, so ends up cutting late. Off he pops! 9th over: New Zealand 27-1 (Guptill 17, Williamson 8) Target 285 Guptill lines Willey up but, this being 50 not 20 overs, checks his loft and scuffs to the fielder instead.Next ball, he turns around the corner, but Curran saves the boundary. 8th over: New Zealand 26-1 (Guptill 16, Williamson 8) Target 285 Here he is! Williamson is a genius, and he hops back, stands tall, and in the same movement strokes four through cover. He is a master, what else do you want ta kna? But the run rate is 3.05, which is good for England and good for their spinners. “Just do away with T20s,” tweets Andrew Benton. “They’re the haikus of international cricket, without the quality. Or, compromise with a T35 competition.” The feline has escaped the receptacle I’m afraid. I could see a case for keeping T20 to club cricket, but my guess is it’s bringing a new audience to the game. 7th over: New Zealand 22-1 (Guptill 12, Williamson 4) Target 285 Williamson has started knocking it around in understated fashion, taking two singles from the over - one drive, one flicked - with Guptill having one of his own. Decent over from Willey, that. 6th over: New Zealand 19-1 (Guptill 11, Williamson 2) Target 285 Trevor Bayliss suggested the other day that the 50-over format should be binned but for World Cups, and there’s some sense in that I guess. Something has to give, because players missing series is ridiculous, and it can be hard to muster arsèdness without context. On the other hand, this version of the game has arguably never been in better nick, and we’d miss it if it were more or less gone. I don’t know, but given I’d sacrifice everything to protect Test cricket I’d think hard about giving it a go. One off the over. 5th over: New Zealand 18-1 (Guptill 11, Williamson 1) Target 285 Joe Root’s been moved from slip; England have him on the drive instead. And after four dots, Guptill edges to where he’d have been, though perhaps he wouldn’t have in different circumstances. These are the only runs of the over. 4th over: New Zealand 14-1 (Guptill 7, Williamson 1) Target 285 I wonder what we’ll see from Woakes this tour. He was disappointing in Australia, and the question in the end will be whether that was because he was coming back from injury or because he doesn’t have the nip or craft to take wickets on flat tracks; I hope it’s the former but suspect it’s the latter. I should note some (exceedingly) minor controversy: England have had a single removed. The final delivery of their innings elicited an lbw appeal, and when the finger went up, the ball became dead, so the single they ran didn’t count. Except the appeal was overturned when Willey went upstairs, which is to say that the rule needs some work. 3rd over: New Zealand 12-1 (Guptill 6, Williamson 0) Target 285 Willey has started really well here, but Guptill gets away squeezing one out off his pads for two. That’s second ball, and three dots follow, only for a poor delivery to turn up in Guptill’s slot; he bashes it down the ground for four. 2nd over: New Zealand 6-1 (Guptill 0, Williamson 0) Target 285 Be careful what you wish for. Kane Williamson comes to the wicket to disburse an easy hundred. Well isn’t this a mess! Munro comes down, Woakes fires wide, Munro swings for the fence anyway, and feathers an edge behind. There was no need for that whatsoever. 1st over: New Zealand 7-0 (Guptill 0, Munro 6) Target 285 England will be desperate to keep it tight at the start. I mean, of course they will, but especially on a slow track, they’ll want to restrict scoring while the ball is still hard. Chris Woakes is gliding in, and his second effort is picked up immediately by Munro, who takes a step forward and turns length into half-volley, getting low and swatting over square-leg for six! 1st over: New Zealand 0-0 (Guptill 0, Munro 0) Target 285 Rob Key reckons the first 10 overs will be vital; more news as I get it. There’s a bit of swing for Willey first up, his first delivery too good for Guptill and five dots following with the ball moving both ways. Anyway, here come the batsmen. If one of these two gets stuck in, England will struggle. It’s early, but this made me laugh. Root also says that players “pigeon-holed” as white-ball cricketers can play Tests. I wonder what Adil Rashid thinks about that. Ian Ward and Nasser Hussain are interviewing Joe Root, who says he doesn’t think the team did much wrong in terms of their behaviour in Australia. I agree with that, he’ll be pleased to not learn. If, after the Jonny Bairstow thing, Andrew Strauss had said to the press “Lads, I don’t care about this and neither do you,” things would’ve worked out much better and he wouldn’t have had to send home Ben Duckett. I could easily watch that Wood/Billings video for the remainder of the day. Sitting in the dressing room, both sides will probably be satisfied with where they’re at. England total is gettable, but on a slow pitch, it might not be easy. We’ve got ourselves about half an hour before it begins, so in the meantime, enjoy this. Top o’ the mornin! Well, thanks to Joe Root and Jos Buttler, along with Trent Boult and Tim Southee, we got ourselves a ball game. This chase should be a lot of fun. Excellent bowling at the death from New Zealand keeps the score below 300, and in the vague vicinity of par. It’s been a well-contested match so far, but what of the hosts’ reply? Daniel Harris will be with you shortly to talk you through it. Bye! 50th over: England 285-8 (Willey 11, Curran 0) Southee’s first delivery clips Willey’s inside edge and rolls away for a flukey four, and a single off the next brings Buttler on strike. The following ball is dismissed down the ground for six and the next should have followed it, but is mishit and squirts away for a single. Buttler goes from the penultimate ball, and the last is inside-edged into Willey’s pad and away for but a single - he’s initially given out lbw, but it’s overturned on review. Willey can only push the ball limply back to the bowler and Buttler, backing up enthusiastically, is stranded! 49th over: England 272-7 (Buttler 72, Willey 6) England have just picked out fielder after fielder these last few overs. When Willey sends the ball at pace towards the rope Southee dives to stop it going over. Boult’s final delivery of the innings, though, is smitten down the ground, flat and hard, for six. 48th over: England 259-7 (Buttler 64, Willey 2) England have totally lost the map to boundary central, and have at the most crucial time got lost in the one-way system around single street. 47th over: England 253-7 (Buttler 62, Willey 1) Boult bowls, Buttler tries a ramp but he can’t nail the pace of the ball and gets nothing on it. The variations of pace and width are keeping the batsmen under lock and key. There are two singles here, a dot, the wicket, and one boundary, pulled to square leg by the about-to-depart Woakes. New Zealand’s bowlers are not only bowling excellently, they’re also catching pretty well! Boult’s slow ball deceives Woakes, who edges it straight back at him! 46th over: England 247-6 (Buttler 60, Woakes 6) Southee comes back to take control of the closing stages for the Kiwis, and he starts by taking the pace right back against Buttler, who eventually works a single, and then ramps it up again with Woakes on strike. Every delivery is yorker length, and neither batsman can get much on any of them. There are, in the end, five singles and a wide. 45th over: England 242-6 (Buttler 58, Woakes 4) The Santner clause is coming to town for England. This is his last over, and most of it is excellent. Still, he walks away at its end muttering angrily under his breath, because one delivery was pitched up, and Buttler thumped it through cover for four. 44th over: England 237-6 (Buttler 53, Woakes 4) Dropped! Sodhi bowls, Buttler heaves and top-edges into the air; Nicholls runs round, gets underneath it, feels the ball drop into his hands and then watches it worm its way out again! And that could be a very big moment in this match. 43rd over: England 232-6 (Buttler 51, Woakes 1) Buttler completes his 50 from the first ball, worked towards cover for a single. But there’s not much else for England to celebrate, but for a couple of singles. The two spinners, Sodhi and Santner, have come back together and are keeping the batsmen honest. 42nd over: England 229-6 (Buttler 49, Woakes 0) A fine over from Sodhi, one run and one wicket from it. Sodhi returns, for the first time since Buttler thrashed him about for three successive sixes, and the move pays off! Moeen mistimes, the ball flies high into the air, and when it lands Guptill’s under it! 41st over: England 228-5 (Buttler 48, Moeen 28) Another couple of boundaries for Moeen, and he too is rolling at more than a run a ball. His first, pulled to deep square leg, has Henry Nicholls sprinting to his right in an attempt to cut it off; the second, sent down to long leg, has Nicholls sprinting to his left. On both occasions, he might as well just have stood still. 40th over: England 217-5 (Buttler 47, Moeen 18) Into the last 10 overs we go. Buttler, on 47 off 36, seems to be the key man, scoring fast and in good touch. Moeen though seems in the mood for some runmaking as well, hitting a couple of stylish fours. He then picks out a fielder at deep square leg when he might have had another, but the ensuing single allows Buttler to get another boundary of his own. 39th over: England 203-5 (Buttler 43, Moeen 9) Blammo! Munro is sent down the ground for six by Moeen! A couple of singles later, Moeen tries to pull, and bottom-edges into his legs, which save him from a infuriating dismissal. Root has a little chat on the telly, in which he totally refuses to be drawn on what he thinks a good total is. 38th over: England 192-5 (Buttler 40, Moeen 2) Boult bowls; two singles and a wide. 37th over: England 189-5 (Buttler 37, Moeen 0) New Zealand have taken regular wickets throughout this innings, but now England need to keep a partnership together for a while. This one isn’t particularly troubled by Munro’s latest over, which yields three singles. 36th over: England 186-5 (Buttler 37, Moeen 0) A lovely cover drive from Buttler, beautifully timed, sends Southee’s first delivery away for four. But only one of the four remaining deliveries yields any runs at all, and that’s a single. There’s also a slower ball that Moeen totally fails to pick. 35th over: England 181-5 (Buttler 32, Moeen 0) Well that wicket changes everything. For as long as Root was at the crease England’s innings had an anchor, it had an air of comfort. Now, though, they’re squirming a little bit. Root’s gone! He just misjudges that in every way, swipes across the line of the ball, misses it entirely and his off stump is ripped out of the ground! 34th over: England 179-4 (Root 70, Buttler 31) Unsurprisingly, given what Buttler made of his last over, Sodhi is replaced. Southee returns, and after four singles Root flays the ball to extra cover, where Santner dives to his right, gets his his right palm to the ball but can’t hold on! That would have been a fabulous catch, one for the highlights reels, but instead it goes down as a drop. 33rd over: England 174-4 (Root 67, Buttler 29) Up until about five minutes ago this had been a finely balanced match, but the batsmen appear to have mounted a coup. They are now in control here. 32nd over: England 168-4 (Root 66, Buttler 24) An explosive over from Ish Sodhi, which starts with yet another Root single and continues with a six, and then another six, and then a third six, all of them sent down the ground by Buttler. The first is the finest, hardest, cleanest of them, but all three were pretty emphatic. 31st over: England 148-4 (Root 65, Buttler 5) Buttler gets off the mark with a boundary, trying a reverse sweep, getting almost everything about it wrong and somehow getting four runs for his troubles. 30th over: England 141-4 (Root 63, Buttler 0) Sodhi continues; Root gets a single off the first but Buttler can’t do the same, displaying an admirable array of mistimes and fielder pickouts to remain scoreless, after seven deliveriess. 29th over: England 140-4 (Root 62, Buttler 0) There are, as it often seems when Root is around, two games in play here. One, involving him, is nerveless, chanceless and gently remorseless; the other, involving all other batsmen, is chaotic. Stokes gets a thick top edge, the ball disappears high over his left shoulder, and he starts walking. Behind him Taylor runs across, eyes on the ball, and makes no mistake. 28th over: England 138-3 (Root 60, Stokes 12) Excellent fielding from Williamson, who comes across from mid on and dives to stop a ball that was otherwise away, rolls, leaps up, returns it, and all the time the sunglasses perched on his forehead remained lodged perfectly in place. that’s the really impressive thing: impeccable sunglass placement there. Root sends his next shot in a similar direction, only much harder and higher, for six. 27th over: England 130-3 (Root 53, Stokes 11) De Grandhomme’s back, and Root completes his half-century, tickling the ball just wide of Latham and away for four. 26th over: England 121-3 (Root 46, Stokes 9) It’s hard to know how long the game will stick to its current retro stylings. It seems that 260 would be widely considered a decent-to-good score on this wicket. 25th over: England 119-3 (Root 45, Stokes 8) A couple more singles for Root, whose portion of the game appears in his total and absolute control. And a couple for Stokes, whose form is yet to become clear. 24rd over: England 114-3 (Root 41, Stokes 6) Sodhi’s sixth over, and so far they have cost on average six runs. The latest yields five, thanks to a single and a Stokes reverse sweep for four. 23rd over: England 109-3 (Root 41, Stokes 2) Boult is back, and England score a few singles. It could have ended with another wicket, though, as Stokes fends the last delivery back to the bowler. It’s a bit awkward for the bowler, arriving just under knee height, and the catch never looks likely to stick, but Boult seems furious with himself for letting it drop. 21st over: England 106-3 (Root 39, Stokes 1) Morgan slams the ball over midwicket, the ball landing a foot or so beyond the rope for six, only to be outdone by the googly next ball. Ben Stokes comes in, with a few cobwebs to shake loose. Well Morgan doesn’t pick this one at all, gets a thick leading edge and the ball loops to mid off. 21st over: England 98-2 (Root 38, Morgan 2) Three dots, two singles and a Root four, tickled fine. 20th over: England 92-2 (Root 33, Morgan 1) New Zealand bring in a slip for the new batsman, but he doesn’t get anything to do. 19th over: England 89-2 (Root 31, Morgan 0) A brief break for drinks, and then a fine over from Santner. His fourth delivery turns just a fraction, enough to beat the bat. Roy smacks the next through cover for four, agricultural but effective, and then goes next ball. A breakthrough! Roy, one from his half-century, tries to work the ball into the leg side for a single, misses, and it flicks off his pads and into the stumps. 18th over: England 84-1 (Roy 45, Root 30) Dropped! Roy hits the ball right back at Sodhi, but he can’t keep it in his hands. Then two balls later Roy slogs the ball into a neighbouring time zone, which in the circumstances has got to smart. “You have to feel that this is Adelaide and the Cardiff semi done right,” writes Sachin Paul. “Slow pitch, good bowling attack, nippy bowling. If we get 300 and then Curran, Willey etc take the pace off the ball, it’ll be one of the most mature victories of this side ahead of next year’s world cup.” 17th over: England 76-1 (Roy 38, Root 29) More spin, with Santner returning to form a spinny double-act with Sodhi. England are scoring quite slowly (though Root is rolling at a run a ball), but wickets have not been falling and there’s time. 16th over: England 73-1 (Roy 36, Root 28) Roy goes down on bended knee to sweep the ball away, but top-edges it again, and gets away with it. It’s a single, and after another Roy tries to pummel the ball again, more successfully this time, and it whistles down the ground for four. 15th over: England 66-1 (Roy 30, Root 27) Ball and boundary are finally reunited, though it’s a leg bye, De Grandhomme’s delivery clipping Root’s pad and rolling away. 14th over: England 59-1 (Roy 28, Root 26) Wrist spin now from Ish Sodhi, and England pilfer a few more singles, as well as being donated a wide. England’s last 17 scoring shots have all been singles. 13th over: England 54-1 (Roy 26, Root 24) A third consecutive binary over, in which each delivery has yielded either one run or none. 12th over: England 49-1 (Roy 24, Root 21) Santner is yet to find any real grip in the surface, and England calmly work the odd single or five. 11th over: England 44-1 (Roy 22, Root 18) Colin de Grandhomme bowls. It’s Grandhomme day. And neither batsman can really get to grips with his sleepy medium pace. 10th over: England 41-1 (Roy 21, Root 16) The first three deliveries go for singles, and then after a dot Roy goes after one, gets a thick edge and it flies just over mid-on and off to the rope. 9th over: England 34-1 (Roy 16, Root 14) Southee continues. Good lines, good lengths, variations in pace, two singles. Now to find out if the early turn Kane Williamson predicted at the toss is indeed there for the spinners, as Mitchell Santner has the ball in his hands. 8th over: England 32-1 (Roy 15, Root 13) Roy tries to heave the ball over extra cover, but it’s a slower delivery and he doesn’t pick it at all, sending it steepling over his shoulder and up into the air, and is extremely fortunate to see it drop safely between fielders. Then Boult bowls across Root, a similar delivery to the one that did for Bairstow, and he almost get another! Root swings his bat, edges, and is saved by his own power, which carries the ball above the two slips. The next is sent smoothly and calmly through the covers for another four. 7th over: England 23-1 (Roy 14, Root 5) Roy tries to batter Southee’s first delivery, misjudges it, and inside-edges wide of his stumps and away for a streaky but welcome four. Then Root works the ball through midwicket, sweetly timed, and it races away from the chasing fielder for four more. 6th over: England 14-1 (Roy 9, Root 1) Still nowhere for the batsmen to go, except into their shells. They get a run each, Roy’s courtest of a finall-ball edge that goes wide of second slip. 5th over: England 12-1 (Roy 8, Root 0) Now this is an intriguing start to an international match. England’s batsmen are being well shackled, in conditions that are pretty helpful for New Zealand’s frontline bowlers. 4th over: England 10-1 (Roy 6, Root 0) Roy sends the first ball of the over through midwicket for four, and Bairstow edges the last ball of the over to slip for a wicket. Bairstow, author of one nice, controlled scoring shot and little but uncertainty besides, edges to the solitary slip, who pockets the catch! 3rd over: England 5-0 (Roy 1, Bairstow 4) Southee slings the ball into Roy’s pad and launches an excited appeal, but the ball was sliding down leg. Still, that’s one of five more dots in this over, and England’s innings remains on the start grid, engine revving but brakes still engaged. 2nd over: England 4-0 (Roy 0, Bairstow 4) Before he starts his run-up Trent Boult, limbering up, leans over, and a large clump of hair flops down into an exaggerated horizontal quiff, making him look like a winded, black-haired Tintin. The over starts excellently, the ball being angled across Bairstow, close to the body. But after four dots the batsman pulls for four, and England are off the mark. 1st over: England 0-0 (Roy 0, Bairstow 0) Movement here for Southee, and no runs here for Roy. A maiden to start the day. The players are out, and action is about to get under way. England’s batting line-up looks pretty formidable, but will be braced for a battle. The New Zealand team: Martin Guptill, Colin Munro, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Tom Latham, Henry Nicholls, Colin De Grandhomme, Mitchell Santner, Tim Southee, Ish Sodhi, Trent Boult. So Alex Hales, in the week that he officially and publicly dedicated his career to the pursuit of white-ball excellence, is out, and Stokes is in. Eoin Morgan speaks: Probably would have looked to do the exact same. We’ll be playing two spinners. Ben Stokes comes back in which allows us to play our full, balanced team, with two spinners. We’re playing against a very strong team who’s in good form, so we’re going to have to play at our best to win this series. New Zealand win the toss and will bowl first. Further team news: England team news: Ben Stokes is in the line-up: The match may or may not turn out to be any good, but the sky is absolutely fabulous. Classic cumulus action there. Hello world! Let’s kick things off with a couple of stats: The two teams’ last 10 ODI results: New Zealand: LLWWWWWWWW England: LWWWWWWWLW Number of ODIs in New Zealand between these teams in last 25 years: 19 Number of those ODIs in which either team has scored more than 250 runs: 4 Chance of one or both sides scoring 250 or more today: a good deal more than four in 19. Simon will be here shortly.

Clarke says critics failed to understand the FA’s “real objective ... we’re encouraging progressive change.” • Among the core messages Clarke plans to promote in Qatar – four months after his Eni Aluko inquiry ended with a conclusion of “inappropriate banter”: “Integrity, inclusion and transparency – the great social values football can bring”. Meanwhile: also educating Gianni Infantino – warning Africa’s football heads that Fifa are “monitoring them” for good ethics. Infantino, who sacked the ethics team investigating him last May, says he’ll purge “anyone who still thinks he can enrich himself, illicitly or illegally, using football money”. • Also busy last week: a) Jack Warner, securing another nine-month delay to his US extradition. Warner, who started using Trinidad’s appeals process in July 2015, denies racketeering. b) Panama-based kit firm Mimo International, admitting they paid the former Costa Rica FA head Eduardo Li a $300,000 bribe. Li, banned last year, set out his leadership vision in 2009 – a commitment “to teach football’s values and responsibilities to the youth of Costa Rica. The future begins today.” And c) @SeppBlatter, weighing up the relative merits of two World Cup 2026 bids – the USA, home of the FBI, and Morocco. “Morocco would be the logical host! It is time for Africa again!” Reflex of the week Russia’s acting FA head Alexander Alayev – uneasy with media coverage of Spartak fans’ violence in Bilbao. Alayev said Russian fans were facing “absurd allegations”, having been “provoked by the local community”. • Among the Russian FA’s previous best work on Spartak’s issues: security head Vladimir Markin’s response last year to reports of fans racially abusing Liverpool players: “Sometimes foreign media come here just with the purpose to write dirty stories … That’s what depresses me most.” Markin also reviewed the BBC documentary Russia’s Hooligan Army last year as “black PR, like a piece of rotting meat which they can’t sell so they spice it up to mask the stench. They feed this shit to everyone”; and assessed the real risk of crowd disorder this summer: “I’m not worried about our fans. I’m just worried they’ll be provoked.” Other news: agent of the week Spain: Catió Baldé, reacting to client Ruben Semedo’s third arrest in four months. Baldé says the Villarreal defender, who denies robbery, kidnap, possession of illegal weapons and attempted murder, is “a good boy, led astray by vultures … He’s the victim here.” Sum of the week £2.56m: Richard Scudamore’s pay deal last year, as the Premier League built up cash reserves of £1.6bn on behalf of clubs. 3: Number of those clubs accredited as Living Wage employers. Bid of the week Owen Oyston – found last year to have “illegitimately stripped” Blackpool of £26.77m with son Karl – dropping all outstanding libel action against fans. Reports say Oyston made the move as part of a charm offensive to “bring the fans back to Bloomfield Road”. Most in breach Spain: Rayo Vallecano, fined €30,000 for “the deployment of an unauthorised display” by fans. Disciplinary officials ruled that the fans’ display – an anti-racism tifo alongside banners reading “united against racism” – represented a “serious breach” of ground regulations. Speech of the week Brazil: Vitória coach Vagner Mancini – previewing his club’s “Derby for Peace” against Bahia, which ended early after nine red cards: “It’ll be a wonderful day: no violence, both teams playing by the same rules, 11 athletes on each side. Healthy rivalry, just as it should be.” Most regrets Ecuador: Independiente del Valle U20 coach Juan Carlos León, reacting after defender Angelo Preciado was banned for “using a corner flag as a spear”. León said the spear was out of character. “He’s really been maturing.” Fewest regrets Brazil: América-MG president Marcus Salum, asked if he still felt that calling a linesman “a tramp, a bum” while being held back by police was the right thing to do. “Of course. I will not be falling for these tricks any more. Everyone tries to destroy us. América will not be broken.” Hire of the week Argentina: Independiente coach Ariel Holan, defending his decision to hire “celebrity warlock” El Brujo Manuel to join his technical staff before a cup defeat. “He didn’t do anything bad. People are so judgmental when they hear the word ‘warlock’.” And most reflective Brazil: Operário’s Jeferson Reis – “very sad” to be sacked for beating up a ball boy. Reis said the 19-year-old “over-celebrated” a goal then “slapped our physio, so I lost my mind”. His plan for the future: “I’ll just have to put my faith in God now. My time will come again.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/24/russia-putin-syrian-war-intervention-assad-ghouta-turkey-iran","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-24T20:15:01Z","webTitle":"Moscow mired in Syria as Putin’s gameplan risks a deadly ending","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/24/russia-putin-syrian-war-intervention-assad-ghouta-turkey-iran","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/24/russia-putin-syrian-war-intervention-assad-ghouta-turkey-iran","fields":{"headline":"Moscow mired in Syria as Putin’s gameplan risks a deadly ending","bodyText":"From his spot in the ruins of east Ghouta, Arif Othman sees the current phase of Syria’s war as brutally simple. The longer he holds out against Bashar al-Assad and his allies, the worse it will get – especially at the hands of the Russians. “We were supposed to have surrendered by now,” he said at the end of the most intensive week-long barrage anywhere in Syria in the past three years. “When we didn’t, the bombs were bigger, the planes more regular, and the injuries like nothing we’ve seen. All sent from Moscow.” The Russian-led air blitz has been the sum of all fears for the besieged population on the ground. Up to 400,000 people, with nowhere to run, have been pinned down by Vladimir Putin’s air force as Syrian and Iranian-backed ground troops edge closer to the largest and most important opposition area anywhere south of Idlib. For Assad and Putin, Ghouta is the key to controlling the capital, and winning the war. But outside the Syrian cauldron, friends and foes alike are starting to believe both men have miscalculated. Nearly 18 months into Russia’s intervention to prevent Assad’s defeat at the hands of rebel groups that were advancing on his heartland areas of Latakia and Tartous, it is increasingly unclear just how Moscow will recoup its investment in the world’s most complex and intractable conflict. While it no longer appears Assad is in danger of falling, what remains of Syria looks nothing like the prewar country he used to rule. Central authority in the once-rigid police state has been subsumed several times over – first by opposition groups, and then by regional players also increasingly invested in shaping postwar outcomes in their own interests, which only partly align with what Putin wants. Protagonists on both sides are drowning in a swamp they did not see ahead. Putin, in particular, is learning that Syria in its present form is ungovernable. His December claim of “victory” at a Russian airbase near Idlib has been followed by a dizzying series of events which, on the contrary, have drawn Russia further into the war. At the same time they have exposed the Assad regime’s near-total dependence on proxy support to hold its positions, let alone secure more gains. The statement is looking every bit as premature as George W Bush’s claim of “mission accomplished”, made in a speech on the flight deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln in 2003 at the end of the war in Iraq. In attempting to showcase a superpower’s military strength, the former president instead exposed its diplomatic limitations. Across Syria, and in the region itself, alliances that were more or less predictable are now splintered and opaque. A chessboard once easy to read could now outwit a grandmaster of global geopolitics. From Ghouta north to the Turkish border, from Hama in the west to the oil-rich Deir ez-Zor in eastern Syria, where up to 200 advancing Russian mercenaries were killed by a US counterattack on 7 February, a new regional order is being fought out. “And we will be trampled like mice under the feet of buffaloes,” said Ayman Thaer, a volunteer at an aid centre in Ghouta, where at least 500 people were killed this past week by Russian and Syrian bombs. “May God damn them all.” Just how to balance the increasingly potent interests on display in Syria is bedevilling all who have tried. “The only winner so far is Iran,” said Bassam Barabandi, a former Syrian diplomat who defected from the regime in mid-2013. “It achieves what it wants without too much noise. Iran enjoys Russian-American conflict because it makes Russia more dependent on Iran to survive.” The clash between the US and Russian mercenaries sent to Syria was kept quiet by Moscow, which – in different circumstances – would have complained bitterly if 200 of its citizens had been killed by a rival power. For Putin to admit even that the men were there would have belied his claim of victory and withdrawal from a war that no longer needed him. Acknowledging they were advancing on an oil refinery held by US Kurdish proxies would have been an equally tough sell, at a time when securing Syria from the threat of terrorism and US hegemony remains the official narrative. US intelligence officials believe the company that recruited the Russians – the Wagner Group – is controlled by a Putin confidant, Yevgeniy Prigozhin. Also staking its claim in Deir ez-Zor is Iran, with which Russia has partnered to ensure that what remains of the anti-Assad opposition can no longer win the war. Russian officials have complained to counterparts in Turkey that Iranian aims are increasingly at odds with their own. A senior Turkish diplomat told the Observer Moscow feels especially threatened by what it sees as Iran’s determination to build a state security structure in Damascus modelled on its Revolutionary Guard Corps – the most powerful institution in Tehran 40 years after the Islamic Revolution. “But how can they stop them?”, the diplomat said. “Putin won’t have it his own way from here. And we can see [the Russians] getting irritated by it.” From mid-2016, Putin started to draw Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan into an alliance with Iran which aimed to bring the war to an end on terms to Assad’s benefit. The alliance was a death knell for an opposition that Turkey backed in the north. It culminated in a trilateral summit in Sochi last November, which was supposed to deliver a diplomatic victory that had eluded all others – and at the same time sideline a moribund UN-backed process. It was an embarrassing failure. Diplomacy has since collapsed and violence, first in Idlib and now in Ghouta, is nearing record levels. Turkey has reframed its involvement in the war, started to oust Assad but now aimed at keeping Kurds from controlling the Turkey-Syria border. Last month Turkey sent troops – and Arab militia – into the Syrian border enclave of Afrin to fight Kurdish militias. The move was quietly sanctioned by Moscow. But in the past week, forces loyal to Assad were allowed into Afrin to counter the Turks. Russia’s position on this development is unclear. “Russia always says it does not have the leverage on Assad the way the world thinks. This is true,” said Barabandi. “Iran has more influence on Assad. Put simply, Iran came to stay in all of Syria and to challenge the US by threatening Israel. Syria will be the theatre in any coming war between Hezbollah and Iran against Israel. At least this is what the Iranians are hoping. “And Iran is happy that Russia has taken the lead in Syria and let them empower their forces without distraction. None of the players trust each other and what we see is short-term contracts that may shift at any time. The only thing they have in common is they want the US to be out of Syria.” Meanwhile, Russia – which had high hopes that Syria would be a launching pad for a new power projection, ensuring Assad’s survival and securing its own lead role in shaping order in the region, and perhaps far beyond – is focusing on more short-term gains. “As we helped the brotherly Syrian people, we tested over 200 new types of weapons,” said Vladimir Shamanov, head of the Russian Duma’s defence committee. “Today our military-industrial complex made our army look in a way we can be proud of.” With little to bank, Russia will continue to find its veto at the UN Security Council a potent tool. It has vetoed UN resolutions against Assad 11 times."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/feb/24/vice-chancellors-expenses-scandal-channel-4-dispatches-universities","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-24T20:31:28Z","webTitle":"Revealed: British university vice-chancellors’ five-star expenses","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/feb/24/vice-chancellors-expenses-scandal-channel-4-dispatches-universities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/feb/24/vice-chancellors-expenses-scandal-channel-4-dispatches-universities","fields":{"headline":"Revealed: British university vice-chancellors’ five-star expenses","bodyText":"The lavish expense accounts of some of Britain’s university vice-chancellors are today laid bare in an investigation whose revelations have drawn comparisons with the 2009 scandal that did much to undermine the reputation of Britain’s MPs. A Channel 4 Dispatches programme has unearthed evidence that, at a time when lecturers are taking industrial action over potential cuts to their pensions, those charged with running many of the country’s universities are enjoying first-class air travel, five-star hotels and fine dining. Almost 200 Freedom of Information requests sent to institutions around the country reveal for the first time the claims made by vice-chancellors and their staff. They include a series of questionable items including a “pornstar martini”, a silver salver, Easter eggs and a Fortnum &amp; Mason hamper. One university even paid £1,600 for its new vice-chancellor’s pet dog, a Maltese called Oscar, to be relocated from Australia. Between them, the country’s vice-chancellors and their senior colleagues claimed almost £8m in expenses over the last two years, Dispatches discovered. The findings will reignite the debate about the remuneration of those paid to run the country’s universities, which rake in £17bn a year from their students who are paying up to £9,250 in annual tuition fees. The debate was intensified in 2016 by the revelation that the University of Bath had provided its vice-chancellor, Dame Glynis Breakwell, with a grace and favour property, a perk condemned by MPs and academics. Breakwell – whose total pay package of £468,000, the highest in the land, was attacked as excessive by former Labour education minister Lord Adonis – agreed last year to step down from her position in August this year. But last month the university’s court, an advisory board, passed a motion of no confidence, calling for her to stand down immediately. But with more than 60 vice-chancellors now earning in excess of £300,000 a year, there are concerns that their pay packages and perks are out of kilter with those of their academic colleagues who have received an average 1% annual pay rise since 2012 – a fall in real terms. Last week, the prime minister waded into the row, claiming “the level of fees charged do not relate to the cost or quality of the course”, and adding: “We now have one of the most expensive systems of university tuition in the world”. In a bid to ensure students get value for money, the government is to establish the Office for Students, whose board includes Professor Steve West, the vice-chancellor of the University of the West of England. Dispatches reveals West claimed £43,000 in expenses, including £10,000 on executive cars with a firm that describes itself as “the premier chauffeur service in Bristol and the south-west.” Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University and College Union, questioned what message West’s appointment sent to students. She also queried the arcane way in which most universities allowed their vice-chancellors to attend meetings of their remuneration committees, absenting themselves only when their pay was decided. “If you’re a leader you have to be open and clear about what’s going on, and hiding in a toilet, going out for a cup of tea while your mates decide your salary – sorry that doesn’t make sense to me,” Hunt said. “That’s not how big salaries should be decided.” Commenting on the findings, Robert Halfon MP, the Conservative chairman of the Commons Education Select Committee said: “Those kinds of examples are pretty shocking. Dare I say it being an MP, but the dog example is slightly comparable to duckhouses, which caused the expense scandal for members of parliament in the first place.” Of the universities asked about vice-chancellors’ expenses, 13 either did not respond or refused to do so.Halfon called for all universities to publish the expenses of all their senior management. “We live in an age of transparency, we live in an age of accountability. We have enormous pressures on the public sector. We have a duty to the taxpayer, we have a duty to the student.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/23/england-scotland-calcutta-cup-robert-kitson","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T16:55:57Z","webTitle":"Calcutta Cup crucible can reveal real England and test Scotland resurgence | Robert Kitson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/23/england-scotland-calcutta-cup-robert-kitson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/feb/23/england-scotland-calcutta-cup-robert-kitson","fields":{"headline":"Calcutta Cup crucible can reveal real England and test Scotland resurgence","bodyText":"Several lively debates are raging around English rugby. Some reckon the national team are starting to plateau and, despite a striking win-loss ratio under Eddie Jones, could be vulnerable to a chilly blast of reality at Murrayfield on Saturday. Others argue that is nonsense and insist world domination is imminent. By Saturday evening the truth should be much clearer. Part of the problem is that sporting beauty is in the eye of the beholder. The more England scrap their way to scruffy wins, without always dazzling the neutral with their attacking rugby, the easier it is to underestimate them. If Scotland had won 24 of their last 25 games – even New Zealand, by comparison, have lost three and drawn one – no one would be queuing up to conduct a similar autopsy. It boils down to the perennial question: are Jones’s England widely misunderstood? If they emerge into the cold Caledonian air and proceed to rip asunder a Scotland side who have won eight of their last nine home matches and rattled the All Blacks in November, the impact will be felt in both hemispheres. If, on the other hand, the Scots rule the breakdown, expose a few more faultlines out wide and kick their goals, England’s prospects in Japan next year will inevitably come back under scrutiny. To be remembered for peaking between World Cups, as the Kiwis famously used to be, really would be galling for Dylan Hartley and his squad. There is no doubting England have kicked on under Jones: more resilient, more composed and tactically sharper. There remain, however, a couple of critical unknowns: do they really have a further 20% in them as Jones insists and to what extent will the opposition gather momentum over the next 18 months? This weekend will be particularly revealing on both fronts. England are at a venue where, historically, they have seldom found life entirely comfortable and Scotland are back in their preferred role of sharp-toothed underdogs. That said, they have not scored a solitary try at home against England since Simon Danielli – once of England Under-21s and employed by Bath at the time – touched down in 2004. They last beat England a decade ago and went down 61-21 at Twickenham a year ago. If nothing else it would be a perfect moment for England to make a definitive statement and silence those who believe they got slightly lucky against Wales. The reality, for all Scotland’s potential under Gregor Townsend, is that England will expect to win here and see off France in Paris in a fortnight. Anything could happen in their final game against Ireland at Twickenham on St Patrick’s Day but, in some ways, the two away games will tell Jones more. As the head coach said this week: “You don’t hear Manchester City talk about playing away from home. You just hear them talk about playing.” That is certainly the mindset Jones wants to instil by the time his side arrive in Sapporo on the northern island of Hokkaido, where England kick off their 2019 campaign against Tonga. Once the first bagpiper appears and the temperature starts to drop, though, there will be no mistaking their weekend surroundings. It is a shame Scotland do not have the excellent Alex Dunbar and Duncan Taylor available in midfield and that WP Nel and Richie Gray, among others, are not starting in the pack on Saturday. If their execution unravels as it did in Cardiff, Scotland could end up sliding away quicker than poor Elise Christie. A more encouraging scenario involves Finn Russell and Stuart Hogg showing the best of themselves, the lurking Hamish Watson and John Barclay disrupting plenty of English ball and the home side hoisting an exploratory garryowen or two in the direction of Jonny May. The best Scotland v England games all involve a generous helping of semi-organised chaos and pale-kneed blue-shirted back-rowers rampaging far and wide. A shortened lineout or two, to further break up English rhythm, would also maintain the necessary tempo; Scotland absolutely cannot afford to be behind when the clock hits the hour mark. Most Scottish supporters would walk 500 miles to watch their country beat England at tiddlywinks, never mind lift the Calcutta Cup, so a raucous atmosphere can also be guaranteed. With the BBC’s Ian Robertson about to commentate on this historic fixture – this is the 125th edition, though Robbo has missed a couple – for the last time, there are a few reasons to anticipate a noisy afternoon. Barclay, for one, admits stopping the visitors will take some doing: “They are one of the best teams in the world, their record is fantastic and they come here as massive favourites, in my opinion. They are a quality side with quality players throughout … it’s a big challenge for us to stop them.” That is pretty much what every Scotland captain has muttered down the ages, before striding back to their team’s inner sanctum and roaring something wholly different. England did enjoy some fortune in their last game and Saturday’s television match official will be on particularly high alert. Hartley’s men have played well in parts this season but, on tour in Argentina apart, have seldom cut loose since the Scotland romp last year. That game was shaped by Fraser Brown being sent to the sin-bin early on, from which the Scots never properly recovered. Saturday’s encounter, even so, still feels like England’s to lose. If Owen Farrell maintains his authoritative form, Joe Launchbury shines again on his 50th cap, England’s scrummaging sessions against the mighty Georgians pay immediate set-piece dividends and their special heated trousers keep their bench “finishers” nice and warm, it is even possible they could rack up a double-figure margin, reviving distant memories of John Carleton sprinting away to clinch a grand slam in 1980 rather than David Sole’s slow march a decade later. The visitors should certainly be capable of a better outcome than France, who faded badly in the second half a fortnight ago before going on a night out in Edinburgh that ended even more messily. It is now 30 years since Dean Richards and John Jeffrey infamously took the Calcutta Cup out for an impromptu night-time session but England are here on business rather than pleasure this time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/feb/25/can-tourist-ban-save-dicaprios-coral-paradise-thailand-maya-bay-philippines-boracay","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T06:00:15Z","webTitle":"Can a tourist ban save DiCaprio’s coral paradise from destruction?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/25/can-tourist-ban-save-dicaprios-coral-paradise-thailand-maya-bay-philippines-boracay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/feb/25/can-tourist-ban-save-dicaprios-coral-paradise-thailand-maya-bay-philippines-boracay","fields":{"headline":"Can a tourist ban save DiCaprio’s coral paradise from destruction?","bodyText":"Our Thai tour guide, Spicey, takes a drag on her cigarette and gestures sadly towards the beach. “The problem with people is that they are too greedy. They see a beautiful place and they want it. They take, take, take from nature. And then they destroy it.” The golden sands of Maya Bay where Spicey stands are some of the most famous in the world. This once-idyllic cove, on the tiny Thai island of Koh Phi Phi Leh, was the paradise location of The Beach, Danny Boyle’s 2000 film starring Leonardo DiCaprio. It was then pushed by tourism officials in advertising campaigns to entice more wealthy visitors to Thailand. But mass tourism has since taken a vast toll on the fragile coral reefs here: 80% of the coral around the bay has been destroyed, the result of millions of boats dropping anchor on it, tourists treading on and picking it, or poisoning by rubbish and suncream. It is a sad tale replicated across the once-unspoilt bays and beaches of south-east Asia. It was here that the world’s greatest diversity of coral and marine life used to occur, but the reefs are now the most threatened on the planet, with 80% of what remains at high risk. Human pollution has combined with overfishing and the lucrative tourist trade to deliver appalling environmental destruction. “What we are seeing now with coastal tourism in Boracay [in the Philippines], Maya Bay and Koh Phi Phi Leh is not new, but what is surprising is that this story is still very real today,” said Dr Loke Ming Chou, a tropical marine science professor at the University of Singapore, who said that “frenetic, makeshift and ad-hoc development driven only by profit” was a curse for these pristine beaches. “After so many lessons of overwhelmed beach locations, the rush to make money still ignores the environment, which is what attracts tourists in the first place. This is not sustainable and such places will collapse when tourists stay away to avoid swimming in their own muck.” This month it seems that governments are finally paying attention to a situation that is spiralling out of control. According to recent announcements, both Maya Bay and Boracay could be shut down for up to six months to give the environment a chance to recover. In the Philippines, the president, Rodrigo Duterte, has called for Boracay’s temporary closure, comparing it to a “cesspool”. “You go into the water, it’s smelly,” said Duterte. “Of what? Shit. Because everything that goes out in Boracay … it’s destroying the environment of the Philippines and creating a disaster.” In Thailand, where the ministry of environment has already banned smoking and littering in beachside locations, the mooted June-to-September shutdown of Maya Bay would be the most far-reaching attempt yet to get a grip on an industry that is both a money-spinner for the nation and an environmental menace. In the high season, Maya Bay, just 200 metres long, receives up to 5,000 visitors a day. About 300 speedboat trips are made here every day. Larger boats sailing round the islands also stop by the cove. Although the beauty of the place is still evident, the atmosphere resembles a busy industrial port more than a paradise beach, with the endless roar of engines and the smell of petrol in the air. By 9am, as the speedboats continually pull up, the beach is so tightly packed with people that it resembles a mass game of sardines. Every patch of sand is fought for, especially by the optimistic few who risk lying down for a spot of sunbathing. People visibly duck to avoid the selfie sticks and umbrellas that fill the air like strange antennae. Three uniformed national park police stand on the shore, blowing their whistles at the boats that park directly on the beach, obstructing the view of the bay. If tourists want to swim in the sea, there is a small area on the left side of the beach, where they are packed in as tightly as on the sand, many in orange life jackets. Paradise? American tourist Chad Roberts certainly thinks so. “It’s amazing, better even than the pictures, I can’t believe how blue the water is,” he said. “I don’t mind all the people. Look, I come from the middle of America and we don’t have anywhere like this at home. Most beautiful place I’ve ever seen.” But Spicey, who was born in Phuket and has been a tour guide for almost seven years, said she hoped the Thai government followed through on its pledge to close Maya Bay, even for a few months. “It needs just a small break to heal.” She spoke sadly of the destructive behaviour she has witnessed from the millions of tourists who come through Maya Bay on the island-hopping tours. The corals and fish that used to be visible when snorkelling have all but disappeared, she said, yet tourists still insist on taking bits of coral to feed the fish, which is illegal as it stops the fish cleaning the coral, causing it to die. “Most people don’t care – they want to see the fish, so they feed them anyway,” she said. “All the tourists will try to take everything and see everything they possibly can in the short time, and they don’t really care about the cost to nature. I have had so many arguments with tourists, asking them not to take the coral.” According to Spicey, most tour guides just let the tourists do what they want. “There is no respect, and the attitude of most tour guides is ‘it’s illegal but I will close my eyes’. It happens usually when the tour guides are foreign. We Thai tourist guides love our home. We want to protect it. But for foreign tourist guides, when they’ve earned enough they fly back to their home, what is left for us? Nothing.” The local environmental authority has laws in place to protect Maya Bay and the surrounding national park, but the fines are so low – often only 500baht (£12) – that the rules are routinely flouted. A year and a half ago, a law was put in place that prevented boats throwing down anchors, and possibly destroying 10 years’ worth of coral growth in a single second. But Kezia, a diver who has spent the past year in Koh Phi Phi Don (the largest inhabited island on the Thai archipelago), said it still happens. “In low season last year we had this one big fancy boat that came to the national park every day for diving, and they just didn’t care about throwing down the anchor because the fine is not very much,” she said. “They just paid it every day and still used the anchor.” There is still a reluctance by local authorities to prioritise the environment over profit. Maya Bay is a massive money earner. Every visitor has to pay 400baht (£10) simply to access the island, which can add up to a daily revenue of £50,000. According to another tour guide, Yass, temporarily closing Maya Bay is not enough. People must be taught to look after it if the place is to remain a beautiful tourist destination rather than become a ruined paradise. “I see the guys in the speedboats fix the oil and change the engine on top of the reef in the morning, and you can’t say anything to them,” he said. “It makes me so angry that they have all this beautiful landscape and they don’t educate people how to look after it.” More than 1,600 miles away, Boracay – which, like Maya Bay, features on every list of paradise destinations – is grappling with the same problems. More than 2 million tourists flock to this five-mile-long island every year. Unregulated development has seen the rise of hotels, restaurants and food chains along the entire shoreline of its famed White Beach, which runs the length of the island. Inland is also covered with huge hotels. Everywhere, new construction projects are visible. The sea is suffering as a result. An endless flow of sewage is pumped into the ocean, as well as detritus from the construction work. The sparkling clear waters seem pristine, but the huge destruction of coral over the past few years tells a very different story. Jojo Rodriguez works for Sangkalikasan Producers Cooperative, an NGO that has been monitoring the state of Boracay’s reef since 2012. He believes the authorities “purposefully turned a blind eye” when it came to environmental issues that could threaten the tourist trade. After a massive die-off of coral in 2015, local authorities threatened to declare Rodriguez persona non grata after he publicly linked the disaster to the sewage being pumped into the sea. He said intimidation tactics and threats have since been used against reporters and campaigners who have tried to speak out about the environmental damage. “All these huge profit makers don’t want anyone to get in the way – everybody is afraid to lose the tourism money,” he said, “and so we’re slowly losing Boracay.” Many living on the island said that while there were technically rules in place to save the environment, bribes meant these were rarely upheld. “It’s really corrupt. If you have money, you can do what you want, build what you want here,” said Simone, the owner of a kite-surfing shop. As in Maya Bay, boats are the great destroyers. On White Beach the entire horizon is filled with sailing boats, speedboats, jet-skis, yachts and traditional fishing boats, and a steady hum of boat engines fills the air. Fertiliser from the island’s vast golf course (built purely for tourists) is also a major pollutant of the coral, as are the mounting piles of rubbish that end up in the sea. Angie, a diver from Worcester in the UK who moved to Boracay five years ago, said they often came back from dives with bags of rubbish they have picked up off the coral. Michael Martillano, president of the diving association on the island, is conflicted over Duterte’s declaration that he might shut down the island. “Boracay definitely needs some help,” he said, “but we shouldn’t all be punished for the few who are breaking the rules and causing the problems to the environment.” He conceded that the marine life of Boracay is nowhere near as rich as it used to be. “The reef is now totally different from when I first started diving here in 1994,” he said. “You used to see a lot of sharks and barracudas, all the big stuff. Now you’ll see one, maybe two sharks if you’re lucky, nothing like before. “And there used to be a lot of crustaceans, like lobsters, but now I see more in the market because there’s a real tourist demand to eat them. The island really needs help.” Is there still hope for the island? “Boracay will never be the same again,” said Rodriguez. “The president said close down Boracay, but it’s not going to be solved in six months. For the island to heal itself? Maybe 60 years if we are lucky.” In both Maya Bay and Boracay, a six-month tourist ban may not be nearly enough to solve an ecological crisis. That is certainly the view of environmental campaigners. But as the coral reefs of south-east Asia continue to die, it would be a start."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/mar/03/immunotherapy-cancer-patients-rheumatoid-arthritis-robin-mckie","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-03T18:00:24Z","webTitle":"Cancer patients shed new light on rheumatoid arthritis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/03/immunotherapy-cancer-patients-rheumatoid-arthritis-robin-mckie","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/mar/03/immunotherapy-cancer-patients-rheumatoid-arthritis-robin-mckie","fields":{"headline":"Cancer drugs shed light on rheumatism","bodyText":"The human immune system is one of the most effective defence mechanisms known to nature. It can ward off myriad microbial invaders: bacteria, viruses and parasites. It is sometimes overwhelmed by disease, of course, but the billions of men and women who now live on Earth are a testament – at least in part – to the effectiveness of their immune defences. However, on occasions they go too far. Instead of killing off invading organisms, our immune systems turn on our own tissue and attack it. Conditions such as type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus are all triggered in this way, very often with deeply unpleasant consequences. In the case of rheumatoid arthritis, immune cells – mainly lymphocytes and macrophages – start to attack the tissue that makes up joints, and these become painful, stiff and swollen. Around one-third of those who develop rheumatoid arthritis will have stopped working within two years of its onset, so painful are its effects. And given that the disease affects more than 400,000 people in the UK, its financial impact is also high: estimates suggest it costs the economy between £3.8bn and £4.8bn a year. Similar conditions include ankylosing spondylitis, which affects the joints in the spine, again causing pain, stiffness and restricted movement. Around 200,000 people in the UK are affected, at an estimated annual cost of up to £3.8bn to the economy. Meanwhile, juvenile idiopathic arthritis affects 12,000 children under 16, many of whom will suffer severe limitations in movement in their adult life. Trying to understand exactly why a person’s immune system turns on the body has proved to be tricky, a hindrance to developing cures. “In most cases of rheumatoid arthritis, for example, we can provide treatments that alleviate the worst symptoms, but patients will have to take these drugs for the rest of their lives,” says immunologist Prof Adrian Hayday, of the Francis Crick Institute in London. Recently, however, researchers, including Hayday, have found an unexpected ally in their battle against autoimmune disease: cancer. It is an unexpected link, but a promising one, as Hayday explains. “In the past five years, there has been a revolution in the way we treat some cancers – by using immunological techniques,” he told the Observer. “These have had unprecedented positive results against metastatic melanomas and non-small-cell lung carcinoma. By giving patients drugs, we have been able to turn up their immune systems so they successfully mount attacks against these cancers. We have armed their immune systems and made them active.” It is one of the most important developments in the battle against cancer this century. But side-effects have recently emerged. “There are around 140 patients undergoing immunotherapy for their cancer at Guy’s hospital in London, where I do my clinical research,” says Hayday. “Our cancer drugs boost our patients’ immune systems to help them kill off their tumours. But of course, that is the same sort of thing that happens in people with rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes: something triggers their immune systems so that they become overactive and souped-up. “As a result, some of the cancer patients – happily, not too many – who are being treated with immunotherapies are beginning to develop rheumatoid arthritis and type I diabetes. By boosting their immune systems,” Hayday said, “we have exacerbated any tendency for these people to have had these conditions and we are beginning to see the occasional case arising among our cancer patients.” The appearance of these conditions raises important issues for cancer patients. “We have to be very careful about ensuring quality of life for people once they have undergone cancer treatments, so obviously this is a concern,” Hayday says. However, there is also a more positive consequence of the discovery that cancer immunotherapies have the effect of triggering autoimmune diseases in some cases: “For the first time, we now have a chance to study rheumatoid arthritis at its earliest stages, and that is tremendously important.” At present, people are not diagnosed with the condition until symptoms have already made their lives so unpleasant they have gone to see their doctors. “By then the condition is well established, and that makes treating it difficult,” said Hayday. “But if we have people in the ward who never had the disease but who, after we have given them drugs for their cancer, begin to develop rheumatoid arthritis or type 1 diabetes, then we can study and understand autoimmune diseases like these for the very first time.” As a result, research – backed by Cancer Research UK and Arthritis Research UK – has been launched with the aim of uncovering the roots of autoimmune disease from research on cancer patients. “You know that when you give a patient an immunotherapy drug for their cancer, if they are going to get an autoimmune disease, they are probably going to get it over the next few months,” says Prof John Isaacs, of the Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle. “So, we can monitor them – take regular blood samples and follow these patients very carefully – if they are happy for that to happen. In this way, we can get a handle on the very first events that lead to them getting autoimmune cells. Can we see if something is happening to their B-cells or their T-cells that later leads them to get rheumatoid arthritis or another autoimmune condition, for example?” The scientists involved stress that their work is only now beginning and warn that it will still take several years’ research. Nevertheless, uncovering the first stages of an autoimmune disease emerging in a person’s body should give researchers a crucial lead in ultimately developing treatments that will prevent or halt a range of conditions that currently cause a great deal of misery and require constant medication. “Autoimmune diseases are horrible afflictions,” adds Isaacs. “Now, for the first time, we can think seriously of halting them in their tracks one day.” Our immune defences consist of a range of cells and proteins that detect invading micro-organisms and attack them. The first line of defence, however, consists of simple physical barriers like skin, which blocks invaders from entering your body. Once this defence is breached, they are attacked by a number of agents. The key cells involved here are white blood cells (leukocytes), which seek out and destroy disease-causing organisms. There are many types. Neutrophils rush to the site of an infection and attack invading bacteria. Helper T-cells give instructions to other cells while killer T-cells punch holes in infected cells so that their contents ooze out. After this macrophages clean up the mess left behind. Another important agent is the B-cell, which produces antibodies that lock on to sites on the surface of bacteria or viruses and immobilise them until macrophages consume them. These cells can live a long time and can respond quickly following a second exposure to the same infections. Finally, suppressor T-cells act when an infection has been dealt with and the immune system needs to be calmed down – otherwise the killer cells may keep on attacking, as they do in autoimmune diseases. By slowing down the immune system, regulatory T-cells prevent damage to “good” cells."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2018/feb/26/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T15:00:19Z","webTitle":"Tips, links and suggestions: what are you reading this week?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/feb/26/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2018/feb/26/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","fields":{"headline":"Tips, links and suggestions: what are you reading this week?","bodyText":"Welcome to this week’s blog. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. We begin with a lesson in perseverance from Ulzana, who has been re-reading David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest: Enjoying it tremendously. I am always amazed by Foster Wallace’s prose and ability to shift mood and tempo. Always, have a sense though that I am missing a lot , if not most, of the references. There is a constant interplay between profundity and levity, which can be dizzying to read. This sense of constant change and motion, isn’t helped by the structure of the book and the awareness that, some of the chapters are as self contained as any short story. I am wondering how it all coalesces, as I seem to remember it does, however I have always remembered one strand of the story which appeared to lead nowhere. However it is incredibly enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone, with the request to persevere with it. Also taking up the baton is Gretsch83, who found rewards in Paul Beatty’s The Sellout: It felt teetering on the edge of tedium at times, the long sentences and obscure cultural references like a convoluted sociology lecture gone wrong (ironic, given the narrative...) That’s not to say there was not plenty to enjoy, at least one belly-laugh gag every 10 pages or so, and some really sharp phrases that almost moved me to reader’s applause. Letting it settle for a couple of days, I found my fondness for this novel greatly increased. A creative, timely satire is a rare thing and even rarer is one that is actually funny. As an example of perseverance rewarded, this book is a fine one at that. Another kind of lesson comes from Larts, after reading Don’t Skip Out On Me by Willy Vlautin and uncovering hard truths about the way of the world: I find myself sympathising with kind, considerate losers in this novel. I think that’s the point, the bleak point, of the novel. That the powerless, the dreamers are ripped off by ruthless, powerful crooks is exactly the nub of capitalist society and Vlautin has imagined a story in just that setting. Elsewhere, pearcesleftfoot has enjoyed If Nobody Speaks of Remarkable Things by Jon McGregor: It reminded me of some of the greats of Southern Gothic - the attention to the minutiae, of the seemingly inconsequential, of ordinary people living their ordinary lives with the occasional shock of remarkable things. It was a lovely book and the ending will stay with me for a long time, I expect. Joanna Cannon’s debut, The Trouble with Goats and Sheep has pleased BaddHamster: I honestly haven’t read a novel I’ve enjoyed so much in a long, long time. The writing is unselfconsciously good and natural and her eye for a lovely, odd metaphor is as sharp as Sharpo Marx would have been, if he’d existed. And the great Elizabeth Strout’s Anything Is Possible has impressed Tom Mooney: What a writer she is. This is some of the finest contemporary fiction around ... Strout is on superb form describing the pain and consolations of growing old in this collection of linked stories. She taps into something inside everyone; life. It really is a kind of simple, fabulous brilliance. She has become one of my favourite writers. Finally, here’s a challenge from safereturndoubtful who has recently conquered With The Right Enemies by Rob Pierce: This is my first Pierce book... To say it’s “hard-boiled” isn’t going far enough, as that term gives an impression the exterior is hard and that underneath there is something warmer. It’s the group of characters that make the story so readable, especially 15-year-old Vollmer for whom the book is something of a gangster’s coming of age. It’s actually a sequel to Uncle Dust , but reading that not a prerequisite. It’s clear Cormac McCarthy is a big influence. Not for the faint-hearted. Are we brave enough? Interesting links about books and reading Gore Vidal on being a public author, back in 1965. Anna Aslanyan blogs about Peter Ackroyd’s Hawksmoor and David Bowie’s Outside.

He has plenty of scope for further improvement and will tempt many in at around 9-2. The big field is a very different test after beating a total of 14 horses in three races, however, and there is much more depth here than Acting Lass has faced to date. The favourite makes the market for horses such as Tintern Theatre, a course-and-distance winner at Christmas who is reunited with Sam Twiston-Davies, but the price that really catches the eye is the 14-1 about the Paul Nicholls runner Art Mauresque (3.35). He was eight lengths behind the excellent Waiting Patiently at this track last time out and the winner gave the form a boost last weekend. Kempton 1.50 Four promising young chasers in the field but Cyrname stands out on his close second behind Terrefort in a Grade One last time. The winner was getting 3lb there, the time was good and the third horse home was 20 lengths adrift. The Unit may give him a race, but Paul Nicholls has won nine of the last 12 runnings of this race and a 10th is imminent. Lingfield 2.05 Gracious John would be an obvious pick on his form over course and distance in December, but he has finished last on his two starts this year and looks like a false favourite. Karijini is in good form but the drop back to five furlongs is a concern so Orvar has to be the pick at around 4-1. He is unbeaten on two starts on artificial tracks and posted a good time to win at Wolverhampton a couple of weeks ago. Kempton 2.25 Beau Gosse will be Guillaume Macaire’s first runner in Britain since October 2015, and the trainer thought enough of him to give him a crack at France’s juvenile championship event over hurdles at Auteuil in November. He is not in the Triumph Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival though, unlike Redicean, who has taken well to hurdles and is 10-1 for next month’s meeting. A smooth win here should take his price into single figures. Newcastle 2.45 Milansbar would be the selection with Bryony Frost taking off 3lb after their front-running win at Warwick last month, but the jockey is claimed to ride at Chepstow and that just tilts the balance in favour of Vinnie Lewis. is just four races into his chasing career and making rapid progress with victories off 113 and 127 on his past two starts. This extreme test will suit him well and he can shrug off a further 9lb rise in the weights. Kempton 3.00 Scarlet Dragon, who was Group-class on the Flat for Eve Johnson Houghton, is a fascinating hurdling debutant for Alan King in a race won on debut by Nicky Henderson’s Flown in 1992 before following up in the Supreme Novice Hurdle at Cheltenham. Carntop, second in the 2016 Lingfield Derby Trial, is another intriguing arrival from the summer game, but the experience of Destrier may make the difference.

Are the stakes too high?","bodyText":"The idea of care homes for older people being traded like financial instruments might be unpalatable, but it is a reality in today’s adult social care sector. In what has been called the “financialisation” of care, private equity investors have pounced on a £16bn industry, attracted by a steady stream of income in the shape of fees from a growing population of older people. Some 410,000 older people live in care homes in the UK, according to official figures, receiving everything from specialist dementia care to less complex nursing and bed and board. Those numbers are set to rise with lengthening life expectancy. While these changing demographics are attractive to profit-hungry private equity firms, fears are mounting that some have racked up such huge debts to buy into the sector, they could trigger a financial crisis. Investment in care homes has gone badly awry in the not-too-distant past. When care home provider Southern Cross imploded in 2011, residents of its 750 homes were plunged into a period of uncertainty. Much of the outrage focused on the firm’s former owner, private equity group Blackstone, which walked away with estimated profits of 500m, leaving cash-strapped local authorities to pick up the pieces. Today, 95% of the 11,300 care homes for older people are provided by the independent sector (both for-profit and charities). A total of 360 are owned by struggling private equity-backed Four Seasons Health Care. In January, the Clova House care home in Ripon, Yorkshire, closed after Four Seasons said it was no longer financially sustainable. The shock news caused confusion and fear among residents, some already suffering the disorientating effects of dementia. Yet such closures are far from rare. A recent study by healthcare analysts LangBuisson found that 929 care homes, housing more than 30,000 older people, have closed in a decade, some for financial reasons, others due to serious failings in care. Recent closures include 12 homes owned by Scottish provider Bield, Bupa’s Hillview home in Eston, North Yorkshire and Valley View in Blaydon in the north-east, where residents were given a week to pack their things and leave. According to accountancy firm Moore Stephens, one in six UK care homes is at risk of failure. A recent report by the Competition and Markets Authority warned that some providers “may be carrying unsustainable levels of debt, and therefore may be at risk of financial distress”. In the event of a financial failure, “there could be a risk of disruption to residents while local authorities step in to ensure continuity of care provision.” Within the last few months, cracks have started to show at some of the country’s biggest providers, some laden with high levels of debt thanks to a succession of not-so-careful owners. While there is no reason to believe any are in danger of imminent failure, there are certainly signs of strain. Loss-making Four Seasons is owned by Terra Firma, the investment vehicle of Guernsey-based financier Guy Hands, which had hoped to extract £890m from the company via costly loans. Rising staff costs, stagnant fee income and crippling interest payments have since destroyed its profits and raised fears about the firm’s survival. With the business in difficulty, Terra Firma is now under pressure from US investment firm H/2 Capital Partners, which bought Four Seasons’ debt. Ongoing rescue talks aimed at securing a financial future for the company have been acrimonious and protracted, although the care homes appear safe for now. HC-One, which was created from the ashes of Southern Cross and has more than 300 homes, is another major player with the shadow of high finance hanging over it. Its debts are thought to have shot up to more than £600m last year after HC-One refinanced its debts and bought 122 care homes from Bupa in a £300m deal. The company says its debt is “modest” and that it is “very healthy financially”. The ownership and debt structure of care home chains would not give cause for concern were other structural issues not becoming more serious. Len Merton, chief executive of healthcare firm Advinia, which owns 38 residential and nursing care homes, says the industry is under strain due to a toxic combination of rising costs and stagnant income due to government austerity. “There’s a desperate shortage of nurses, a situation that has worsened since Brexit was announced because nurses aren’t coming over from Europe,” he says. This has left employers turning to temporary agency staff, who cost more. Meanwhile, the “national living wage” – and the way it is being applied in care homes – has inflated payroll outgoings. “Costs have gone up and the fee contribution from local authorities has been behind where it needs to be for the past seven or eight years,” says Merton. The government announced an extra £2bn in funding for social care last year, but the Local Government Association says only a quarter of that is reaching care home companies because the government asked councils to spend most of the money on reducing delays in discharging patients from hospitals. “Our estimate of the funding gap between what councils pay and what providers say they need right now is £1.3bn,” says Linda Thomas, vice-chair of the LGA’s community wellbeing board. Many councils are due to levy a 3% council tax “precept” from April to raise extra cash for the care of older people, but the £548m raised will be wiped out by increased staff costs. The financial squeeze is most keenly felt in homes that have a high proportion of council-funded residents. On average, in 2016 “self-funders” paid £846 a week, while the council paid just £621 a week for those without the means to pay for themselves. Nick Hood, a social care expert whose firm, Opus, has restructured the finances of many care homes, says debt-financed businesses have a particular problem. These firms, he says, typically need profit margins of up to 14% to be able to afford their massive debt interest payments. “It’s completely inappropriate to have a financialised business model for a sector that isn’t just low margin, it’s no margin,” says Hood. “The bottom line is that the sector makes no money and will make less and less as the minimum wage goes up. I’m deeply concerned that these heavily over-indebted care providers are underinvesting in homes, with serious implications for residents.” Research by consumer group Which?, ranking providers of homes for the over-65s by the percentage deemed inadequate or in need of improvement, shows that private equity-backed firms are rated among the worst. HC-One was placed 32nd of 54, with 29% of the 98 homes included in the study deemed not good enough. Four Seasons was 43rd with 35%. Orchard Healthcare, owned by private equity group Alchemy Partners, came in 49th, with nearly 45% of its 44 homes providing care that was not satisfactory. The Care Quality Commission, which regulates the sector, keeps a close eye on the financial sustainability of care home companies that are so big that they would be difficult to replace. Hood fears that councils, who would have to pick up the pieces if a major provider failed, could not take the strain. “When Southern Cross happened, a lot of local authorities were still running homes and had the capacity and the expertise to bail these things out. That’s not true any more. The capacity has disappeared and expertise has been absorbed into the major private operators. I’m really not sure what the government thinks would happen if any of those businesses went bust.” Merton, while reluctant to criticise peers in the industry, also has concerns about large debt-fuelled care home companies. “When you look at the top three or four providers with in excess of 200 homes, it depends on their financial model. If they’re in large debt to buy those homes, they could be at risk.” But if the sector is so unprofitable, why do private equity firms still find it so attractive? Hood says they are “dazzled by demographics ... they look at the market and say there will be another 25% who’ll need care in the next 15 years. They think that sooner or later the government will have to make funding available and those prices will go up. But the numbers don’t work right now because the government won’t put the money in.” Barbara Keeley, shadow minister for mental health and social care, says: “The financial fragility of larger providers has been made worse by eight years of Tory cuts, raising serious doubts about how equipped councils are to step in in the event of provider failure. Labour would invest £8bn during this parliament with £1bn this year to ease the funding crisis. The social care system urgently needs a longer-term, sustainable funding solution to secure the future of services but questions must also be asked about the care system’s reliance upon care home chains with continually high levels of debt. The piecemeal funding offered by the Tories is not enough to ease the crisis their cuts have caused.” In response, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesman says: “We know the social care system is under pressure due to our growing ageing population — that’s why we’ve provided an extra £2bn and recently announced a further £150mfor next year. We will shortly outline the government’s plans to reform social care to ensure it is sustainable for the future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/feb/26/five-ways-avoid-becoming-victim-prescription-drugs-errors","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T06:00:05Z","webTitle":"Five ways to avoid becoming a victim of prescription drugs errors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/feb/26/five-ways-avoid-becoming-victim-prescription-drugs-errors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/feb/26/five-ways-avoid-becoming-victim-prescription-drugs-errors","fields":{"headline":"Five ways to avoid becoming a victim of prescription drugs errors","bodyText":"Up to 22,000 people could be dying in England every year as a result of mistakes in the writing or dispensing of prescriptions, according to new research. In a speech last week, the health and social services secretary, Jeremy Hunt, demanded fresh measures to tackle the problem, which was identified in a government study carried out at York, Manchester and Sheffield universities. Researchers found that 270m such mistakes occur annually. While the vast majority cause no harm, more than 700 deaths a year are definitively linked to prescription errors, which could be implicated in the deaths of as many as 22,303 more people. They may have taken the wrong drugs or the wrong dose – or been forced to wait too long for their prescription. Dr Helen Stokes-Lampard, the chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, told the Guardian that “medication mistakes can and occasionally do happen”. She places the blame in part on the “intense” workplace pressure on NHS doctors, saying: “The long-lasting solution to this is a properly funded NHS with enough staff to deliver safe patient care.” Whether or not Hunt heeds that warning, there are steps that patients can take themselves to mitigate the danger of a dodgy prescription, says Mike Hewitson, a Dorset-based pharmacist who sits on the board of the National Pharmacy Association. “The last line of defence against errors is always the patient,” he says. Get to know your pharmacist The first step to safe medication is building a relationship with your local pharmacy team. Patients who regularly get their drugs from different pharmacies are considered to be at higher risk, says Hewitson, “because their pharmacists don’t have the opportunity to see how they use their medication and to spot when that medication changes”. Educate yourself Today, most prescriptions are delivered electronically, but ask your pharmacist about them, particularly if your drugs or the side-effects seem different to normal. “We’d rather have 100 people asking questions than for one to take the wrong medicine,” Hewitson says. Don’t trust the internet All pharmacists have at least five years of medical training, which is five years more than Dr Google. “The internet is a great tool,” says Hewitson, “but if it’s used incorrectly it can be harmful.” It’s far safer to seek face-to-face advice from a qualified medical professional and to buy your drugs in person than to do either online. Don’t hoard old drugs Many people hoard old medicines, says Hewitson. That is a mistake. “They were prescribed antibiotics six years ago and they get what they think are similar symptoms, so they start taking old medicines, which can be dangerous.” Don’t worry The new study sounds scary, Hewitson admits. But it shouldn’t be. “When you are dealing with a billion prescription items every year, even the lowest error rates will lead to some quite big numbers,” he says. “The first thing I would say is not to panic. Overall, the system is very safe.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/24/syria-eastern-ghouta-the-women-sharing-news-of-war","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-24T07:00:11Z","webTitle":"‘We can change this reality’: the women sharing news of war in Ghouta","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/24/syria-eastern-ghouta-the-women-sharing-news-of-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/24/syria-eastern-ghouta-the-women-sharing-news-of-war","fields":{"headline":"‘We can change this reality’: the women sharing news of war in Ghouta","bodyText":"When the bombs start falling, two dozen adults and children gather in one room in Bayan Wehan’s home in besieged eastern Ghouta, Syria. They hold hands, hug each other and try to find hope. “I put my brother’s daughter in my lap, she is five-years-old, and I try to make her forget the shelling noises. I tell her stories about beautiful things,” says Wehan, who has endured half a decade under siege. “When the bombardment stops, for a little bit, we just go to prepare food, enough to stop ourselves starving,” she says. “Difficult as it is, I am better than thousands of other families. I have some wheat, and tomato sauce, which is one of the most luxurious foods in Ghouta.” A human rights activist and women’s officer at a local council, Wehan is one of the women who have been keeping eastern Ghouta going and are now playing a prominent role in efforts to share news of a brutal bombing campaign by forces loyal to the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. “Women are the sources for most of the stories we are hearing or reading,” says Zaina Erhaim, an exiled Syrian journalist. “I can name eight women in Ghouta I am following to get the daily news and only two men activists. Women are even the faces for the misery and the massacres.” As an estimated 400,000 people trapped in the former breadbasket of Damascus face one of the most intense assaults of a long and bitter war, more women are telling their stories on camera and behind it. “They are doing videos speaking to the audience, publishing their personal and others’ stories on daily bases, speaking to media and giving their eyewitness accounts,” Erhaim says. In other rebel-held areas, even during crises like the siege of Aleppo, women’s voices have been marginalised, sometimes by conservatives within their own communities and sometimes by the influence of hardline extremists from abroad. “In Aleppo you saw films, sometimes an hour long, where no woman even passed in front of the camera,” Erhaim adds. Women’s prominence in eastern Ghouta may be partly because so many men are missing, having been killed or detained by forces loyal to the regime in the early years of the war, killed fighting or still serving on the front line. Many of their peacetime roles are now filled by women. The area’s location on the outskirts of Damascus may also have made it easier for women to step into public roles, despite a relatively conservative community. It was easy for women to travel into the capital for work and education in the years before the war, and many did. “Women in Ghouta are the majority, their numbers exceed those of men. They sacrificed and suffered more than men for the revolution,” says the paediatrician Amani Ballour in a video made shortly before the latest assault began. In many areas, a revolution begun by men and women morphed into a war dominated by hardline Islamists with extremely conservative values who created extra challenges and risks for women. “Gender roles were very much emphasised by the war and patriarchal armed groups,” says Erhaim. And while everyone in eastern Ghouta is suffering after years under siege, for women there are extra challenges. “During menstruation, I wouldn’t know what to do, because there were no sanitary pads,” says the activist Lubna Al Kanawati in a video about life in the area. “This was just a small thing compared to all the other troubles, but it was huge for me as a woman living alone. “After a while they started making homemade pads and diapers, and selling them on market stalls. They were knitted and covered with a layer of plastic. You couldn’t possibly use them.” Al Kanawati has since left Ghouta, forced out in part by her worries about extremists moving into the area and crackdowns on female activists, but she works for an organisation that supports other women on the ground. Syrian feminists are campaigning to challenge gender stereotypes even during the war, and women like Wehan and Ballour refuse to be cowed. “I hear a lot of criticism from people here – for example, why is a woman in charge of the hospital? Don’t we have male doctors? They say this openly,” Ballour says. “In my opinion, we can change this reality. “Our society sees things from a particular perspective and it will always be this way if we remain scared, staying home and subject to the decisions made by our society.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/feb/25/moules-britannia-why-are-90s-celebs-flocking-to-cafe-rouge-in-highgate","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T15:00:13Z","webTitle":"Moules Britannia: why are celebs flocking to Café Rouge in Highgate?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/feb/25/moules-britannia-why-are-90s-celebs-flocking-to-cafe-rouge-in-highgate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/feb/25/moules-britannia-why-are-90s-celebs-flocking-to-cafe-rouge-in-highgate","fields":{"headline":"Moules Britannia: why are celebs flocking to Café Rouge in Highgate?","bodyText":"It’s not every day you get to watch Ray Davies enjoy a full English breakfast and a cup of tea. Unless, that is, you spend every day in the Highgate branch of Café Rouge, in north London. The former Kinks frontman comes in “on a daily basis” and always places the same order, says Thea Karmpini, formerly the cafe’s assistant manager. Davies is not alone. The Highgate branch of the chain, which is scoffed at by foodies, has become almost as much of a celeb hangout as the Ivy or Soho House. Jude Law comes in with his children. Kate Moss sits outside with her dog and a cup of coffee. Like Davies, director Christopher Nolan eschews the French onion soup and the steak baguette and opts for the full English. The actor Matt Smith, the newsreader Jon Snow and the film-maker Terry Gilliam have all been spotted there. George Michael, who lived round the corner, was a regular. For months after his death, Karmpini says, friends and fans came in to pay tribute to the musician. “People were so emotional,” she says. “It was very touching.” Liam Gallagher is another frequent visitor; recently, he took the Guardian in for an interview. When the branch’s manager, Colin Jamieson, read the resulting piece, he called his boss. “Fame at last,” was the response. Jamieson says they “had a good laugh about it”. Interviews are common. “I always thought customers meant job interviews, but I’m not so sure now,” says Jamieson, who points out that the cafe’s many “nooks and crannies” make it a good place for those in search of quiet and discretion. Wealthy, but still retaining vestiges of liberal bohemianism, Highgate is home to a number of rich artists who appreciate privacy, but don’t want to feel like they live in a gated community. Eating my croque monsieur, I can see the attraction: the place is enormous, set on various levels, half-full of mostly well-heeled, retired ladies and gentlemen, and quite cosy. It is also Café Rouge, where the 90s never died, which makes it an appropriate setting for some of the main players of Cool Britannia – Jude, Kate and Liam – and the people who influenced them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/23/brighton-swansea-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T15:26:32Z","webTitle":"Brighton & Hove Albion v Swansea City: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/23/brighton-swansea-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/23/brighton-swansea-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Brighton & Hove Albion v Swansea City: match preview","bodyText":"Brighton and Swansea are both enjoying a spell of good form and are unbeaten in five and 10 matches respectively in all competitions.

The 2018 QS world university rankings, published on 28 February, show that the UK is home to the world’s leading universities in 10 subjects – two more than last year. UK universities make up a third of the world’s top three positions, but these are concentrated in the arts and humanities. UK universities only topped the world’s lists for engineering and technology subjects twice, while they made the top three lists for arts and humanities subjects 10 times. The rankings come as the prime minister, Theresa May, pushes ahead with funding reforms that may see universities cut their fees for social science and humanities courses based on their lower costs of delivery, leaving science and technology courses more expensive. The results show the resilience of the UK’s universities in the face of Brexit. Ben Sowter, research director at QS, said: “Though there are still legitimate concerns about the type of relationship that the UK’s universities will have with, say, EU research programmes and student mobility frameworks post-Brexit, these results offer grounds for optimism.” At least one UK institution was ranked in the world’s top three in 32 of the 48 subjects. Seven UK universities lead the world rankings in 10 areas, with the University of Oxford top of the list for four subjects: anatomy and physiology, archaeology, English language and literature and geography. This makes it one of just three universities to perform best in more than one subject, alongside Harvard University, which comes first in 14 subjects, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which comes first in 12 subjects. The University of Cambridge is ranked as best in the world for anthropology, after failing to land a top spot for any subjects last year. The Royal College of Art is the world leader for art and design, with UCL Institute of Education ranked first for education. The University of Sussex is ranked first in the world for development studies, again beating Harvard University, while Loughborough University is the world leader in sports-related subjects and the University of Sheffield leads in library and information management. The University of Cambridge, with 37 subjects in the world’s top 10, and the University of Oxford, with 35 subjects in the world’s top 10, have more top 10 departments than any other institution in the world.

Known only as TP, a 52-year-old ex-City worker – who has non-Hodgkin lymphoma and the lymph node condition Castleman disease – is launching a landmark challenge at the high court after becoming financially worse off under the new benefit system. This couldn’t come sooner. In October, I warned of the hidden cut within UC for disabled people: thanks to the abolition of both the severe disability premium (SDP) and enhanced disability premium (EDP). As a result, according to the disability charity Scope, the move to UC will see claimants lose as much as £395 a month. The outcome of the legal challenge could have widespread ramifications for 230,000 disabled people who it is estimated will be hit by the removal of disability premiums under UC. The government says that disabled people will be protected by “top-up payments” as they transfer to UC but no such payments are planned until July 2019. The Department for Work and Pensions claims UC means support is focused on those “who need it most”, but a government removing SDP and EDP – benefits designed to help severely disabled people living without a carer – is pulling a safety net from citizens with the greatest needs. This includes disabled single parents who, without their benefits to pay for help to cook or wash, are likely to be forced to rely on their children as young carers. TP’s case shows this inhumanity in a nutshell. He discovered he was dying in 2016 and moved to London to receive treatment, but as it was an area where UC had already been rolled out in the capital, his benefits were cut by £178 a month. It’s the political equivalent of kicking someone when they’re down. Disabled people are already hardest hit by austerity, especially when cash-strapped councils are increasingly charging them for their social care (a charge that can hit those receiving SDP even harder as they don’t have a family carer). Research from disability charity Scope this month finds disabled people have to pay on average an extra £570 a month for the costs of disability for anything from taxis to specialist food, with one in five paying more than £1,000 extra per month. Since its rollout, UC has become synonymous with hardship, often heaped on the most disadvantaged families: from an increase in food bank use and rent arrears, to now one million children set to miss out on free school meals because of UC’s new earnings threshold. But the threat to disabled and chronically ill people has up until now gone largely under the radar. Yet severely disabled people will collectively lose £2bn in disability premium payments (a fraction of what the government is spending on UC’s delayed rollout). Or to put it another way, a mother with multiple sclerosis won’t be able to afford to put the heating on or pay for a carer to help her wash. Launching a multibillion pound benefit system only to remove vital income from some of the poorest people in the country is a particularly warped use of public money – and a move that exemplifies just how low the Conservatives are willing to sink in their rush to gut Britain’s safety net. The campaign group, Disabled People against Cuts, is launching a national protest in responseon 1 March. As UC is hailed as the biggest reform to the welfare state since Beveridge, there’s a very real risk that its greatest achievement will be making more disabled people hungry and housebound. Led by one terminally ill man, the time has come to fight it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/feb/26/a-200-year-old-secret-plaque-to-mark-baths-hidden-role-in-frankenstein","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T14:13:39Z","webTitle":"'A 200-year-old secret': plaque to mark Bath's hidden role in Frankenstein","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/26/a-200-year-old-secret-plaque-to-mark-baths-hidden-role-in-frankenstein","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/feb/26/a-200-year-old-secret-plaque-to-mark-baths-hidden-role-in-frankenstein","fields":{"headline":"'A 200-year-old secret': plaque to mark Bath's hidden role in Frankenstein","bodyText":"In December 1816, a teenager wrote to her lover from a lodging house in Bath that she had finished the fourth chapter of her book, “a very long one and I think you would like it”. This year marks the bicentenary of the publication of that book, Frankenstein – famous in its day and ever since, interpreted in art, film, comics, ballet and music. The almost forgotten link between its creation and the city of Bath will be marked for the first time by a plaque to be unveiled on Tuesday. Mary Godwin – child of the feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, who died 10 days after her daughter’s birth, and the radical writer and campaigner William Godwin – wrote much of the book during months living in Bath while her life was scarred by traumatic events. Her father had refused to see her since she eloped with Percy Shelley – accompanied by her stepsister Claire Clairmont – though he continued to borrow money from Shelley. While in Bath, she learned of the suicide in Swansea of her half-sister Fanny. She also supported the discreet birth, in lodgings five minutes from hers, of Claire’s child by Lord Byron, and her own marriage to Shelley was made possible by the suicide of his pregnant first wife. The Lake Geneva link with the tale of Frankenstein giving life to a monster patched together from corpses is renowned. In a later bestselling edition, Mary told of events in June 1816 when she, Shelley, Byron and Dr Polidori scared one another into fits reading and telling ghost stories in a villa by the lake. She never mentioned Bath, where she wrote a large part of her story. “It’s almost as if she spent those five months here as an object of scandal, without wanting anyone to know where she was – and the secret has been kept for 200 years,” said Sheila Hannon, the founder of the Show of Strength theatre company, who leads Mary Shelley walks through the city. “How she managed to get anything written at all is astonishing, but perhaps the book was her salvation. Her time in Bath is a very dark story, and she deserves to be celebrated.” Hannon lives in Bristol, where Fanny, who may also have been in love with Shelley and felt bitterly excluded when both her sisters went off with him, stayed over on her last tragic journey west. Hannon had first visited the Lake Geneva sites, and then learned in astonishment of the connections on her own doorstep. The plaque will be outside the famous Pump Room and Roman baths beside a nondescript trapdoor in the flagstoned pavement. It covers the only surviving part of the print shop with rented rooms upstairs where Mary stayed. It was demolished in the 19th century leaving only the cellar, now in use as an electricity substation. Frankenstein’s first edition of 500 copies was published anonymously in January 1818, soon followed by much longer print runs. Mrs Piozzi – formerly Hester Thrale, Dr Johnson’s best friend until she scandalised society by marrying her music teacher – lived minutes from Mary’s lodgings. She wrote to a friend: “Lord bless me! That hideous tale Frankenstein was done, it seems, by Miss Godwin.” However, the campaign to celebrate Mary’s time in Bath, backed by Hannon and members of the Bath Royal Literary and Scientific Institution – where curator Matt Williams believes the Shelleys, avid followers of scientific developments, must have attended lectures – has been a long one. The plaque will be unveiled by Christopher Frayling, an expert on horror films and author of a recent study of Frankenstein, who, with the late Angela Carter, tried and failed to get a plaque 20 years ago."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"info/2018/mar/19/how-to-tackle-uncertainty-with-design-thinking","type":"article","sectionId":"info","sectionName":"Info","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T11:37:00Z","webTitle":"How to tackle uncertainty with design","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2018/mar/19/how-to-tackle-uncertainty-with-design-thinking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/info/2018/mar/19/how-to-tackle-uncertainty-with-design-thinking","fields":{"headline":"How to tackle uncertainty with design","bodyText":"A product strategy discovery in practice A few months ago in the Guardian apps team, we realised we needed better information to make product decisions and move forward strategically. We want to feel confident that we are constantly delivering value to our users while ensuring business sustainability. Using fresh insights, we realised our current value proposition wasn’t fully aligned with user needs. This article presents our journey and what worked for us. 1. Defining objectives We started by reflecting on the questions we wanted to answer in light of our business objectives (OKRs). However, we also wanted to apply jobs theory in order to understand why users hire, or fire, our product, what are their current struggles and anxieties and are we helping them make progress in the context of their lives. Our goal was to define the role that our product plays for our users and for the business. We planned our work using the double diamond approach with its divergent and convergent phases of research, synthesis, ideation, and prototyping. Our core team was composed of one product manager, one designer and one researcher, but collaboration with other teams was intense to keep experiments and implementation evolving in parallel. 2. Communications strategy Since communication is key within large organisations, we spent some time creating a communications strategy. This included a stakeholder map, which allowed us to create alignment across all stakeholder via an effective bottom-up and top-down communication stream. The following diagram helped us to visualise the people and the teams that we wanted to keep constantly informed. It depicts how close the stakeholders are to the core team and the frequency of communications. We used existing stand-ups, recurring fortnightly demos and monthly huddles to optimise the time spent communicating. 3. Audit of current features Our product is available on two platforms and has different functionalities on each. Some of the features are free, others are available through a sign-in and others are subscription-only. In order to quickly analyse how distributed the features were, we created a visual map. This provided our team with a tangible sense of the current features. We questioned whether we had a balanced distribution of features and a fair pricing tier. Once we had all the pieces of our current product visually dissected, we were able to begin our formative research. 4. Exploration First, we listened to what different stakeholders inside the organisation had to say about our product. We did this by conducting several face-to-face individual interviews. This enabled our understanding of operational struggles and expectations from different areas of the business and also strengthened partnerships. Second, we unpacked existing user research and data insights to consolidate what we already had and make sure we plugged some knowledge gaps. In parallel, we did competitor and trend analysis to look at what other organisations are offering and what tech companies are developing, and to identify predictions for the future. We also started conducting user research, which primarily consisted of a week long diary study. Here we collected qualitative data about the role our product played in the lives of participants, their daily routines and the circumstances involved, including days and times that influenced their habits. Then we invited the participants to in-depth interviews with a focus on identifying the jobs to be done. During the interviews, it was possible to uncover the reasons why the participants used our product the way they do, and the reasons why they might hire our product for those jobs. Finally, in order to gain further insights around transactional and emotional behaviours, we implemented a live survey asking people why they decided to pay for our product. The answers provided insights about what users valued and how they perceived our brand compared to others. 5. Sensemaking After the data collection and analysis, it was time to make sense of it all. This synthesis process was one of the most challenging parts of the whole project. There were times when we felt overwhelmed with the huge amount of information to digest. Nonetheless, we were able to detect meaningful patterns that allowed us to prioritise and visualise our findings in a way that other people would easily understand and absorb. The collaboration was intense. Focus, flexibility and resilience were key to our process. It wasn’t easy to navigate between walls of stickies, drafts and a dense spreadsheet. Luckily, we found a couple of hours to draw storyboards that brought our data to life; it ended up being a relaxing moment when we were under so much pressure to move onto the next phase. Once we had defined the jobs to be done and written a list of “how might we …?” questions for each area of opportunity, we diverged our approach again. 6. Idea generation In this phase, we facilitated four ideation workshops with a diverse range of stakeholders. We structured the workshops with the main activities as follows: Icebreaker We started the workshop with an exercise to introduce people to the concepts of visual thinking, working memory, mental models and systems thinking. Research playback with intermittent brainstorming We presented findings, areas of opportunities and challenges with short breaks in between to write down ideas individually. Clustering of ideas Working in groups of three to four people, we asked for stakeholders to identify similarities and themes. Storyboards Still working in groups, we asked the stakeholders to draw out story narratives to illustrate how their ideas could help users to fulfil their jobs. After each workshop, we sent a survey to participants asking for feedback. Overall, the feedback was very positive and most importantly helped us tweak and improve the structure of the following sessions. 7. Prioritisation After diverging our process for the second time, we ended up with huge numbers of ideas and storyboards to analyse and decide what was worth investing time and effort to prototype and test. The criteria that we considered included users’ jobs to be done, business and editorial strategy, potential for acquisition and retention, competitive differentiation, platform uniqueness, the technology available, previous insights and data, among others. Given this wide range of criteria, we realised: Prioritising ideas is not a linear process; it is a complex matrix of criteria in the triad of people (desirability), business (viability) and technology (feasibility), with the sweet spot at its intersection. Once we had analysed the groups of ideas through the three lenses above, we defined what we believed would compose premium, satisfiers and basic arrangements of possible features, which naturally led us into the next phase. 8. Prototyping and testing Working from a list of assumptions, we transformed our ideas into prototypes to test with users. After two days of testing, we felt confident enough to filter our ideas again and decide which prototypes to refine and test once more. Following this convergence process, the ideas started to take the form of actual features, whereby we were able to assess effort of implementation versus impact to users, as the matrix below illustrates. Our next steps will be to revisit our value proposition and test configurations that are aligned with the users’ jobs. ... Hopefully, this article will help shed light on your projects and navigate through uncertainty. It is worth noting that the process described here is highly flexible and adaptable. According to the amount of existing research available to you, and the size of your team, this process can be stretched or squeezed (à la Google design sprints) with different design methods mixed and matched. We now not only have a much clearer direction for our value proposition, we have also managed to take our stakeholders on a collaborative journey of discovery. With everybody aligned we can continue to evolve our product in ways that users will love, while helping to sustain long-term business growth."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/feb/24/people-have-gone-chicken-crazy-what-the-kfc-crisis-means-for-the-brand","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-24T08:00:10Z","webTitle":"'People have gone chicken crazy': what the KFC crisis means for the brand","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/24/people-have-gone-chicken-crazy-what-the-kfc-crisis-means-for-the-brand","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/feb/24/people-have-gone-chicken-crazy-what-the-kfc-crisis-means-for-the-brand","fields":{"headline":"'People have gone chicken crazy': what the KFC crisis means for the brand","bodyText":"At lunchtime on Friday, George Cheah, or George Junior as he is known, doesn’t really have the time to talk. “Honestly we are so busy, it’s gone absolutely mad. People have gone chicken crazy,” he says over the phone, while people shout orders in the background. Cheah’s family-run fried chicken joint, Chicken George in Luton, won best takeaway at the British Takeaway Awards in 2016 so they are never short of custom, but since the great fried chicken crisis of 2018 began more than a week ago they have been inundated. “I reckon our business has doubled in the past week,” said Cheah. “We’ve been really, really busy, like packed. With KFC being shut, lots of people are tagging us on social media saying they’d rather have a George anyway.” Chicken George is not the only takeaway straining under the demand for fried chicken as customers attempt to get their fix following the closure of most of KFC’s UK outlets earlier this week. The hashtag #KFCCrisis trended on Twitter, and no fewer than three police forces issued statements asking the public not to contact them about the closures. Police in Tower Hamlets issued a terse tweet: KFC was brief and somewhat sheepish in the statement posted in its shops, saying there had been “a few hiccups with the delivery today”. The crisis soon spread, however, leading the company to point the finger at its new logistics partners. “We’ve brought a new delivery partner on board, but they’ve had a couple of teething problems,” it said in a statement. There were reports of desperate managers attempting to bulk-buy chicken from supermarkets, and of frustrated attempts to give away surplus chicken in a storage depot that the local council confirmed had not been registered. So where did it all go wrong? The “new delivery partner”, otherwise known as the behemoth DHL, took over the KFC logistics contract on Valentine’s Day, alongside Quick Service Logistics (QSL), which has supplied KFC in Europe since 2011. Problems began almost immediately. By 16 February, KFC had started to shut down locations after managers complained of delays to deliveries and by 18 February only 266 of 900 restaurants in the UK were open. “I’ve never heard of anything go down so quickly, it’s been absolutely shocking,” said Dr Jonathan Owens, an expert in operations management and the supply chain at the University of Salford business school. “I think they’ve been caught out by the speed and the limited amount of space there is for error with such a highly perishable product.” The logistics of fresh chicken are fiercely regimented, according to Owens. From egg to slaughter is around 35 days, with most chickens gassed, plucked, cut up into saleable pieces and distributed to temperature-controlled warehouses before being sent in refrigerated lorries to outlets. KFC sells around 676m pieces of chicken a year and buys 450,000 birds a week in the UK. An unspecified number are imported from other European countries, Brazil and Thailand, according to its website. Much of the speculation for the cause of the disruption has centred on the fact that DHL has one centralised warehouse, in contrast to the previous contractor, Bidvest, a specialised food distributor that operated from six. Malory Davies, the editor of Logistics Manager, said: “It’s not necessarily a bad choice to have one location, but the scale is the challenge. If you are serving 900 sites from one warehouse it’s difficult,” he says. “You would think if you team with a company you have worked with for years in Europe and pair it with the biggest logistics operator in the world it would be a safe bet. We are all agog to see what has actually gone wrong.” For the moment, DHL remains tight-lipped about the fiasco. It apologised for the “unforeseen interruption” and said: “Whilst we are not the only party responsible for the supply chain to KFC, we do apologise for the inconvenience and disappointment caused to KFC and their customers by this incident.” Richard Wilding , a professor of supply change management at the Cranfield School of Management, said the disruption revealed the extent to which companies have become compartmentalised. Henry Ford may have raised the cows used to produce the leather on his vehicles’ seats, but modern companies are more like football teams, with specialised players in individual roles. “Companies are no longer in competition with other companies. It’s the supply chains that are directly competing,” he says. KFC said 800 or 900 stores were open as of Saturday, and while neither KFC, DHL or QSL have given any indication of the financial damage the last week has caused, it’s likely to be significant. “Research suggests you get a big impact about 60 days after the event, and the drop in shareholder value can be in the region of 20%,” Wilding said. Experts disagree on the reasons for the chicken shortage, but most agree that the damage done will be significant, if not evenly distributed among the companies involved. KFC’s marketing team has been praised for its careful handling of the crisis, particularly the judicious use of humour in tweets, and a full-page newspaper advertisement on Friday rearranged the letters on a chicken bucket from KFC to FCK. When rivals Burger King offered a disappointed KFC fan free food for a year, the company tweeted: “Putting all your chips on the table … bold move BK. When our chips arrive we will match your stakes and too put all our chips on the table. Until then we have limited chips.” In increasing the demand for Colonel Sanders’ secret recipe, there was a strong chance that KFC – if not DHL or QSL – could actually benefit from the crisis, according to the media commentator Mark Borkowski. “Scarcity creates demand. It’s reminded people about KFC, even those who haven’t had one for years,” he said. “When they get everything back running again, you can expect a stampede.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/23/russian-athlete-nadezhda-sergeeva-filmed-in-i-dont-do-doping-shirt-fails-olympic-drug-test","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T16:49:42Z","webTitle":"Russian athlete filmed in 'I don’t do doping' shirt fails Olympic drug test","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/23/russian-athlete-nadezhda-sergeeva-filmed-in-i-dont-do-doping-shirt-fails-olympic-drug-test","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/feb/23/russian-athlete-nadezhda-sergeeva-filmed-in-i-dont-do-doping-shirt-fails-olympic-drug-test","fields":{"headline":"Russian athlete filmed in 'I don’t do doping' shirt fails Olympic drug test","bodyText":"A Russian athlete who has tested positive for a banned substance at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics had recently appeared in an Instagram video wearing an “I Don’t Do Doping” sweatshirt. Nadezhda Sergeeva was the pilot of the bobsleigh team that finished 12th in Pyeongchang, and her positive test result was announced on Friday morning. In a now deleted video posted to the social network on 15 February by filmmaker Roman Bibishev, Sergeeva features in several scenes wearing a sweatshirt emblazoned with: “I don’t do doping, I am ZASPORT.” Zasport is the official clothes supplier to the Russian Olympic Committee, and provided the neutral designs worn by Russian athletes at this year’s Games. Russia have been banned by the IOC from appearing as a team due to doping offences, and so athletes are not allowed to wear national symbols at the Games. The substance that triggered Sergeeva’s positive result at the Olympics was trimetazdine, a medication used for angina sufferers. Sergeeva has denied taking the drug, with the Russian Bobsled Federation president Alexander Zubkov stating: “She confirms she took no such medication and the team confirms she was not issued any medication.” Zubkov won gold medals in the two-man and four-man bobsleigh at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. Both medals were disqualified by the IOC in November 2017. The disclosure of another positive doping test result came 24 hours after Russian curler Alexander Krushelnitsky was stripped of an Olympic bronze medal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2018/mar/06/classroom-gender-pay-gap-teaching","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T07:15:04Z","webTitle":"Classroom pay: ‘My male colleague was paid £7,000 more than me’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/06/classroom-gender-pay-gap-teaching","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/mar/06/classroom-gender-pay-gap-teaching","fields":{"headline":"Classroom pay: ‘My male colleague was paid £7,000 more than me’","bodyText":"It was July 2017 and, with more than four years’ experience as a qualified primary teacher behind her, Megan Taylor was doing well. She had been promoted to a leadership post at her school, in the south-east of England. She was doing so well, in fact, that she was approached by another school about a new job. And that conversation led to a question: what was she paid? “To my shame, I didn’t know what pay scale I was on,” she says. A discussion with the school business manager revealed she was on just £28,700 a year – and that wasn’t all. Taylor – not her real name – had a male opposite number with whom she worked closely. They had similar experience and qualifications; they each did a very similar job. Although she had been at the school since qualifying, he had been headhunted in 2016. She decided to ask him what he was being paid. “I went into his room and said: ‘What pay scale are you on?’ He said: ‘I’m on M6’ – that’s the top of the pay scale. I was on M3 – that’s a £7,000 difference.” Taylor calculated her colleague was earning about £35,600. He told her he had jumped pay scales when he took the job. Taylor is calm and direct as she tells her story. But as she recalls that conversation, the emotion breaks through. “I was just filled with this … anger, and shock,” she says. “Oh my goodness – I felt I’d been completely used and taken for a ride.” Taylor is keen to speak out by talking to the Guardian. We have to conceal her identity, however, to protect that of her male colleague, who is still in his job. Taylor’s experience, it seems, is all too common. And with the gender pay gap high on the news agenda, women in education are becoming increasingly vocal on the subject. In less than three years, the WomenEd group, which campaigns on the issue, has garnered more than 17,000 followers on Twitter and is becoming a serious force. Vivienne Porritt, a former secondary head and a government adviser, and one of the group’s co-founders, says: “We’ve talked to 4,500 women teachers and leaders in the last three years, and just a handful knew they could argue for more pay. As a headteacher, it never occurred to me to ask about my pay, I was just grateful they were giving me a headship.” But, Porritt adds, that isn’t the whole story: “It isn’t only that women don’t ask – men are offered more, or there’s an assumption they will want more and so there’s a conversation about that.” Official statistics bear out the feeling that the gender pay gap is as live an issue in schools as it is elsewhere. Government figures show that although young female teachers earn slightly more than male colleagues, they slip back as their careers progress. A woman under 25 in a local authority secondary school, for instance, might on average expect to earn £24,500 – £500 more than a male colleague. But by age 55-59 she would find herself on £44,700, while a man would earn £47,900. Although two-thirds of secondary teachers are women, fewer than four out of 10 secondary heads are female. In primaries, one classroom teacher in seven is male, but more than a quarter of heads are men. The reasons for this are complex – women are more likely to take career breaks; they are more likely to go into part-time roles where promotion is less likely. But those aren’t the only reasons why women earn less in schools. As Taylor’s case demonstrates, women are often held back by a culture in which jobs are offered through personal connections and in which if you don’t ask, you don’t get. Natalie – who wants to remain anonymous – is a secondary teacher in the south-west of England. After 15 years she applied for and got a position as deputy principal, only to learn a few weeks later that a male colleague in a sister school, where she had until recently been a member of the leadership team, had been promoted to the same role without any formal process. “No advert, no application, no presentation, no interview. I was furious,” she says. “I honestly think he just went and asked for the job. “There were three other people who I know for a fact would have gone for that job if it had been advertised.” When schools compete with each other for staff, and when posts are often filled without advertisement, then those who are less forceful in their demands can lose out. There’s a belief, too, that academisation has played its part in deepening this gender divide. And there are figures that back up this view. Government statistics show female teachers in local authority primary schools earn on average £1,800 a year less than male colleagues, while those in primary academies earn £2,800 less. In local authority secondaries the gender gap is £2,600; in secondary academies it is £3,000. Under new legislation, organisations with more than 250 employees must report their gender gap for mean hourly pay by April this year. An analysis by the Guardian of the first 1,000 to report included 40 academy trusts – and their pay gap was much higher than average. While the average gap between men and women was 11.8%, academy trusts had an average pay gap of 19.5%. Experts say this is not surprising, as schools have large low-paid workforces of classroom assistants, lunchtime supervisors and cleaners, which are largely female. Kay Fuller, an associate professor at the University of Nottingham, has been interviewing WomenEd members for a research project. “There are also issues regarding the fragmentation of the education system,” she says. “Local authority links have been broken. If it is difficult to recruit staff or leaders to a school there is much more flexibility to decide pay awards. There are market forces. Traditionally there was space in that relationship for monitoring equal opportunities – who monitors these things now?” Some female teachers feel directly discriminated against on pay. An assistant principal in a secondary school – who wanted to remain anonymous – told the Guardian she felt her career stalled after she had a baby and asked to work four days a week. She was one of four in her role at the school. Within a year of her return from maternity leave, the other three had been promoted to senior assistant principal and given a pay rise. “I was furious,” she says. “Everyone who was promoted around me was male or childless. I had excellent results, far better than those who were offered more money. So I looked for another job and left. Two other assistant principals who had maternity leave before me also left within a year or so of returning to work, so it felt like a pattern to me.” The Home Office, which is responsible for government policy on women and equality, said in a statement that female classroom teachers – those who have remained in the classroom and not been promoted, as opposed to all female teachers – earned more on average than men in the same position. This is likely to be because a greater proportion of men are promoted out of those posts. “While acknowledging that there is always more to be done, the gender pay gap in teaching appears to be narrowing,” it said. Taylor’s former employer told the Guardian it had struggled to recruit into the male teacher’s role and that while it recognised there was a pay differential, this was due to material reasons that were not related to gender. “I kick myself for not asking for a pay rise,” says Taylor. “I thought I just wasn’t good enough. I thought: ‘When they think I’m good enough, they’ll give me more.’ If only I’d had the guts to ask – it’s your right to question your pay. I didn’t think I could.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/23/blackshirts-beakers-and-boiling-shellfish","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T16:31:37Z","webTitle":"Blackshirts, Beakers and boiling shellfish | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/23/blackshirts-beakers-and-boiling-shellfish","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/23/blackshirts-beakers-and-boiling-shellfish","fields":{"headline":"Blackshirts, Beakers and boiling shellfish","bodyText":"I really am very grateful indeed for the long read on the Italian blackshirt movement (22 February) that slithers around the CasaPound in Rome as it will enable me to refute those who, when I am visiting the Vatican, suggest that I may have some sympathy with the foul creed of fascism, when this Pound is actually an obscure politician from London whose sympathies arc far more towards Gramsci than to Mussolini.

Burnley’s long wait was extended by Southampton’s equaliser at Turf Moor. Right, that’s all from me this afternoon; plenty of goals this afternoon. If you want some more red-hot live action, Gregg Bakowski is MBM-ing Watford v Everton and Ben Fisher is doing the same for the Six Nations clash between Scotland and England. Scotland: report from Rangers’ 2-0 win over Hearts. What a game at the Stadium of Light, where Callum McManaman grabbed an equaliser deep in added time at the conclusion of a rumbustious local derby that finished 3-3 between Sunderland and Middlesbrough. Interesting stat there, that Liverpool face just two of the top eight in their remaining ten Premier League matches. Jurgen Klopp speaks, and he is very happy: “It was just nice to watch and a joy to watch. I saw a lot of things I wished to see at a football match.” Dwight Gayle’s double had Newcastle dreaming of an away win at Bournemouth, but they ended up hanging on. Read Paul MacInnes’ report. Another bad day for West Brom and Alan Pardew, as they lost 2-1 to Huddersfield to stay rock bottom. Stuart James was there. The afternoon Championship scores here. Fulham play Wolves this evening. Birmingham 0 Barnsley 2 Burton Albion 0 Millwall 1 Leeds 1 Brentford 0 Norwich 0 Bolton 0 Preston North End 0 Ipswich 1 QPR 2 Nottm Forest 5 Reading 3 Derby 3 Sheff Wed 2 Aston Villa 4 Sunderland 3 Middlesbrough 3 Andy Hunter was at Anfield to see Liverpool breeze to a 4-1 defeat of West Ham. Here’s Nick Miller’s report from Brighton’s 4-1 defeat of Swansea. That was Callum McManaman’s first goal in three and a half years. Sunderland equaliser! Callum McMananaman made it 3-3 with Middlesbrough. There is still a faint hope of survival. And that’s full-time, too. And Macclesfield Town won 1-0 with a last-gasp winner against Maidenhead. Scott Wilson, you beauty. Those big Championship matches ended with a late surge from Aston Villa leading to a 4-2 win at Sheffield Wednesday. Still playing at Sunderland who are losing 3-2 to Middlesbrough. Another defeat for West Brom, who are now ten points behind Huddersfield in the table and seven points behind Swansea. Sean Dyche’s wait for a win extended to 11 matches, after Gabbiadini’s equaliser. Saints get a relegation lifeline. Against the slowest defence in history, Liverpool eventually ran riot. Mo Salah scored his requisite goal. Very easy for Brighton, for whom two goals from Glenn Murray set them on their way,. Manolo Gabbiadini grabs an equaliser for Saints. Swansea fightback over. Locadia scores. Another player scores against his old club: Dan Gosling with the equaliser. Lewis Dunk put through his own net to give Swansea the sliver of a chance. David “The Boss” Moyes is on course for his 15th failure to win at Anfield. Adam Smith has made a game of it at the Vitality when previously Newcastle’s defending had been cast-iron. Liverpool’s margin of victory means Manchester United must beat Chelsea tomorrow to climb back to second. Jose Mourinho might curse a sincere lack of defending from West Ham for Mane’s strike. Sadio Mane all but secures Liverpool’s climb to second place in the table. Middlesbrough now 3-2 up on Sunderland after a goal from Patrick Bamford. Meanwhile at Burnley, Tom Heaton’s return has probably been delayed yet further by a brilliant save from Nick Pope from Josh Sims. Swansea’s unbeaten run is at its end, as Pascal Gross sets up the Knockaert blow....(apologies). There is dog in West Brom’s fight as they are piling on pressure against Huddersfield. Pity it took until going two goals down for it to appear. In the Championship, Glenn Whelan has scored for Aston Villa to make it 2-2 against old club Sheffield Wednesday. They are flying in now, and Glenn Murray has his second for Brighton. Ashley Barnes scores. Burnley may yet hold on to seventh place for tonight. They are on course for their first win since December. The Baggies to boing back? Craig Dawson nods in from a Chris Brunt cross. Equaliser for Sunderland: Jonny Williams makes it 2-2 with Middlesbrough. Meanwhile in the Women’s Soccer League. Word reaches us that Firmino’s goal was delivered with a “no look” finish after he outpaced West Ham’s slow-coach defence. Meanwhile, Sunderland are now 2-1 down to Middlesbrough. Grant Leadbitter grabbed that against his old club. Steve Mounie scores his fourth goal in six games and West Brom fans are either peeling for the exits or calling for Alan Pardew’s head. Both in some cases. Michail Antonio, on a sub, scored almost straight from the kick off for the Hammers. Firmino scores Liverpool’s third. On Bobby Moore, a Mr Does-It-Matter tweets: “You can bet more than a few kind words will be said about Bobby Moore down at the cottage by the Thames a bit later too. #fulhamlegend” Bobby captained Fulham to the 1975 FA Cup final. Where they lost to West Ham. Let’s descend back into West Brom’s mire: previous to today they had won just one match in 25, one home game in 12 and were seven points behind Huddersfield. The panic button surely has to be pressed for the second time this season. Mo Salah again. Set up by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to score his 31st of the season, his 23rd in the Premier League and in his sixth game in succession. Raj van la Parra capitalises after Captain not-so Marvel Jonny Evans can’t get the ball clear. Back underway in the Premier League.... On the subject of slow defences, Daniel Roy emails: “I will see your Zabaleta, Collins, Ogbonna, Cresswell and Evra, and raise you an Unsworth, Weir, Stubbs, and Hibbert from Everton circa 2002. I’m not making that up.” The game we barely mentioned there was Burnley v Southampton, which has been, by all accounts, truly awful. And goalless. Perhaps Sean Dyche needs to throw on Chris Wood, back from injury. If anyone’s interested, Macclesfield are drawing 0-0 with Maidenhead United in the dying embers before half-time. JR emails from Illinois. “To be fair to the Baggies Huddersfield are playing just about as badly. I mean I wasn’t expecting anything earth-shattering here but this game is truly woeful. Or, as the kids might say, it’s hella fugly. Definitely a candidate for worst game in the league this season. And I watch a lot of games, including every West Brom game, so I know a thing or two about games that are dire, gormless, reeking pants.” If JR watches a lot of West Brom then he knows what it’s like to suffer. Bournemouth 0-2 Newcastle, Brighton 1-0 Swansea, Burnley 0-0 Southampton, Liverpool 1-0 West Ham, West Brom 0-0 Huddersfield. Sheffield Wednesday back ahead against Aston Villa. Joao was the scorer. 2-1. Bournemouth, having won 3-0 at Chelsea the other week, have since lost 4-1 to Huddersfield and are struggling badly against Newcastle. Rafa Benitez’s team would be in the top half of the table if this stays the same. Dwight Gayle at the double. West Brom have missed a sitter. James McLean is the culprit. Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius has made a couple of decent saves today, with the latest coming from a Marko Arnautovic long-ranger. Feels like an extended job interview for the German at the moment, while Simon Mignolet is probably looking for other opportunities. Kicking off at Sunderland. Adama Traore sent off for Middlesbrough. That makes it ten men each. Sunderland still lead 1-0. Reader Adam Timmins on Pardew’s spirit of forgiveness: “As a WBA fan I’m inclined to say that we’d be better off appealing to Satan at this point (and I’m not talking about the Middlesborough manager - ZING!)“ No love for Pulis at the Hawthorns. More from Anfield: When Patrice Evra committed a foul, the home fans sang for Luis Suarez. That Liverpool goal was their 100th of the season. They could have made it 101 but Mo Salah has just missed a great headed chance. Emre Can nods in from a corner. Sixth of the season for the contract rebel and the best laid plans of Moyes and men go up in smoke. Joe from London emails in: “Name a slower defence than Zabaleta, Collins, Ogbonna, Cresswell and Evra. I dare you.” The challenge has been laid. And it’s a struggle to beat that. Evra might actually be the quickest of that quintet. The misery begins for Sunderland. Jake Clarke-Salter has been given a straight red card. Still 1-o at the Stadium of Light, though. The word from West Brom is that they are now playing very badly indeed. If Alan Pardew’s bags are really packed, they might be in the boot of his flash sports car in the near future. Sheffield Wednesday’s lead was brief. It’s 1-1 with Aston Villa now. A foul by Mike van der Hoorn on Glenn Murray means a penalty is awarded. Murray steps up himself to slot home. First goal in the 3pm Premier League matches, and it’s a neat backheel from Dwight Gayle that puts the visitors ahead. A great finish by Sean Clare put Sheffield Wednesday in the lead against Aston Villa. 1-0 It’s the hope they cannot stand: Sunderland lead 1-0 against Middlesbrough, with Joel Asoro the scorer. The word from West Brom is that the bad boy Baggies have started with gusto, but Alan Davis will take more than that to convince him. He emails to say: “Surely, if as Alan Pardew suggests, God can teach us to forgive, he could also teach West Brom players to pass to each other more than three times consecutively?” Liverpool go close. Mo Salah has struck a post. Against that dad’s army, he might fancy adding to his tally of 30 so far. Unhappy Hammer Ian Sargeant emails in. “Evra, Zabaleta and Collins? Are we going to swap ‘Bubbles’ for the theme tune to ‘Last of the Summer Wine’?” There’s a Compo gag in there somewhere. Carlos Carvalhal speaks and he doesn’t believe in miracles: “I was very clear. I am here because I believe we can stay in the Premier League. I said it is not a miracle. It belongs to the work, the strategy. So far, we have done the things.” Swansea are unbeaten in ten matches. Mike Griffiths tweets: “I assume you’ll be keeping an eye on today’s most important games too - hopefully the mighty Silkmen can be well clear of the chasing pack come 5pm.” Mike means Macc Town, a real team, who are playing Maidenhead United today at the Moss Rose, the jewel of East Cheshire, in the Conference Premier today. And Mike is right. In that North-East derby/non-derby with Middlesbrough, defender Lamine Kone starts for Sunderland, a first appearance since October. You may recall Kone wanted to leave Wearside in the summer of 2016. He probably still does. Read Paul Doyle’s match report from Leicester 1-1 Stoke, a game that Back Jutland will wish to forget. As expected, Jonny Evans has the West Brom armband back. That’s the Alan Pardew school of hard knocks for you. Playing for the Hammers today is Manuel Lanzini, a player linked with Liverpool last summer when it looked as if Philippe Coutinho would be sold. Now that Coutinho has gone, it doesn’t look like Liverpool actually need a replacement but Lanzini can do himself a few favours. Today marks 25 years since Bobby Moore passed away, and both West Ham and Liverpool will remember England’s 1966 World Cup captain today. Tom Heaton’s comeback for Burnley is kept waiting. Nick Pope is still between the sticks, and Anders Lindergaard sits on the bench. The club captain, recovered from a shoulder injury, can’t be far off giving Sean Dyche a selection headache to go with that sore throat of his. Full time at Leicester v Stoke. It’s finished 1-1, and the game will be remembered for a serious howler from Stoke goalie Jack Butland. His team stay second bottom of the Premier League. The headline team selection there is Patrice Evra making his first start for West Ham. At Anfield. That’s a brave one from David Moyes.

Not that either are much good, with Sunderland positively disastrous and Boro, Tony Pulis and all, lagging behind the playoff positions but these are two big clubs. Oddly, despite their relative proximity, certain fans of these clubs tend to affect indifference of the other. With Cardiff playing Bristol City on Sunday, Aston Villa can go within a point of Neil Warnock’s second-placed team if they manage to win at Sheffield Wednesday. Hello, good afternoon and welcome. Something from the top, middle and bottom in Saturday afternoon’s Premier League action. Liverpool can go second in the table if they beat West Ham, helmed by David Moyes, whose record as a manager at Anfield is cataclysmic. This will be his 15th visit and also his 15th attempt to actually win a game. A long association with Everton means he always receives a, er, warm reception from the Kop. The season for six pointers is upon us. West Brom v Huddersfield is one of those. Alan Pardew’s Las Ramblas-bothering Baggies just have to beat David Wagner’s team, seven points and three places above them in the table. Lose that, and it looks bad for Pardew, who this week cast himself as an unlikely purveyor of Christian moralism in forgiving Jonny Evans and restoring the captain’s armband to his bicep. He has also admitting to having his bags packed for when the call comes for his sacking. There is another relegation scrap between Swansea and Brighton, both above the bottom three but needing to maintain their momentum. Something may have to give there since both are on decent unbeaten runs - five and 10 matches respectively in all competitions. Carlos Carvalhal the philosopher poet takes on Chris Hughton, trademarked as the nicest man in football. Rafa Benitez takes his Toon Army way down south to Bournemouth, whose players have been sunning themselves in Portugal and behaving themselves rather better than West Brom’s senior players. Win here, and Newcastle could climb above Bournemouth, who began the day in tenth. And finally in the Premier League, can Burnley end their barren run? Winless since climbing to fourth on December 12, Sean Dyche’s boys might well relinquish seventh place if they lose to Southampton. Mauricio Pellegrino appears under a little less heat after a recent revival, though playing West Brom twice in three matches probably helped matters there. To the Championship now, where the big game of the mid-afternoon session is Sunderland v Middlesbrough. Not that either are much good, with Sunderland positively disastrous and Boro, Tony Pulis and all, lagging behind the playoff positions but these are two big clubs. Oddly, despite their relative proximity, certain fans of these clubs tend to affect indifference of the other. With Cardiff playing Bristol City on Sunday, Aston Villa can go within a point of Neil Warnock’s second-placed team if they manage to win at Sheffield Wednesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/23/north-korea-sanctions-trump-announces-largest-ever-package","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T20:52:13Z","webTitle":"North Korea sanctions: Donald Trump announces 'largest ever' package","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/23/north-korea-sanctions-trump-announces-largest-ever-package","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/feb/23/north-korea-sanctions-trump-announces-largest-ever-package","fields":{"headline":"North Korea sanctions: Donald Trump announces 'largest ever' package","bodyText":"Donald Trump announced on Friday a new package of measures against North Korea aimed at cutting off smuggling routes and warning that if sanctions fail, the next phase would be “very unfortunate for the world”. The new US sanctions are aimed at ships and trading companies around the world being used to smuggle oil into North Korea, and coal and other products out of the embattled nation, in defiance of a UN-imposed embargo. The US and its allies believe the smuggling allows the regime to continue to finance its nuclear weapon and missile programs. Asked what the US would do if the new measures fail to stop those programs, Trump replied: “We’ll have to see. If the sanctions don’t work we’ll have to go phase two. Phase two may be a very rough thing. It may be very, very unfortunate for the world.” “It really is a rogue nation,” the president told reporters at a joint appearance with the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull. “If we can make a deal it will be a great thing. If we can’t, something will have to happen.” Earlier in the day, Trump used a speech at a conservative conference to announce the package of new US measures which target more than 50 vessels, shipping and trading companies that the US says have been helping North Korea evade international sanctions. “Today I am announcing that we are launching the largest-ever set of new sanctions on the North Korean regime,” Trump was to say, according to excerpts of a speech released by the White House before his address to a conservative conference. He said the treasury department “will soon be taking action to further cut off sources of revenue and fuel that North Korea uses to fund its nuclear program and sustain its military”. The Trump administration scored its greatest diplomatic victory so far in September by persuading the UN security council to impose its strongest sanctions to date on the Pyongyang regime in response to its sixth nuclear test and a series of long-range missile tests. Those sanctions included a cap on North Korean oil imports. However, since then, western intelligence sources have reported a string of ship-to-ship transfers of fuel in international waters by sanctions-busting vessels. The new sanctions designate 28 ships and 27 entities located, registered or flagged in North Korea, China, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the Marshall Islands, Tanzania, Panama, and the Comoros. One individual was also sanctioned – the Taiwanese businessman Tsang Yung Yuan, who, the US treasury alleges, has been coordinating illicit North Korean coal exports with a Russian-based North Korean broker. However, no Russian ships or entities have been sanctioned in the new set of measures, despite reports in December that Russian ships had been involved in illegal ship-to-ship fuel transfers. Administration officials said Russian entities had been targeted on previous occasions for sanctions-busting over North Korea, and could be again. “We have been in very close discussions with the Russians about sanctions and sanctions implementation,” a senior administration official said. “It is an ongoing process.” “The treasury is aggressively targeting all illicit avenues used by North Korea to evade sanctions, including taking decisive action to block the vessels, shipping companies, and entities across the globe that work on North Korea’s behalf,” the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said. “The president has made it clear to companies worldwide that if they choose to help fund North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, they will not do business with the United States.” The new US measures include a worldwide shipping advisory to alert other governments and companies about the ruses the North Korean regime uses to disguise its identity when buying and selling materials, including false flags and painting over the names of ships. “Each vessel has an underlying support structure and our goal is to dismantle these structures,” a senior administration official said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/shortcuts/2018/feb/25/ed-sheeran-inspire-more-men-wear-engagement-rings-brits","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T15:30:13Z","webTitle":"Will Ed Sheeran inspire more men to wear engagement rings?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2018/feb/25/ed-sheeran-inspire-more-men-wear-engagement-rings-brits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/shortcuts/2018/feb/25/ed-sheeran-inspire-more-men-wear-engagement-rings-brits","fields":{"headline":"Will Ed Sheeran inspire more men to wear engagement rings?","bodyText":"Name: Ed Sheeran’s engagement ring. Age: Less than a month. Appearance: A simple silver band. So it’s official, he has bought her a ring. Yes, but that’s not what this is about. Sheeran’s fiancee, Cherry Seaborn, wears an engagement ring – a giant diamond knuckleduster of a thing – but so does Ed. Really? He wore it during his performance at the Brits, and everyone thought he had got married in secret. But he hadn’t. It’s just the engagement ring that he wears. But he’s a man. Yes, he’s a man with an engagement ring. It’s weird that men don’t wear engagement rings, when you think about it. No it isn’t. Yes, it is. Historically, engagement rings are a sign of ownership. Women have to wear this big public symbol to show everyone that they are off the market, but men just get to gallivant around willy-nilly. That hardly sounds equal. But engagement rings are so expensive. This is true. Men are supposed to spend between one and three months’ salary on a ring, although it is estimated that the average cost in 2018 is around £1,750. That is truly berserk. If rings went both ways, that would be £3,500 a couple. I know. Which equates to three months of national-average rent, or a month-long Caribbean cruise for two or – judging by recent wedding costs – about six seat covers and a DJ. Does this mean all men have to wear engagement rings now? Possibly. After all, Sheeran is hugely influential, wedding-wise. His music already accounts for a ton of first dances. Oh God. Relax. Jewellers have been trying to make male engagement rings a thing for years now, and it never catches on. They even tried called them “man-gagement rings” for a while and even that didn’t work. Can’t think why. But hooray for jewellers, boldly striking away at the shackles of gender equality like this. Sure, it’s definitely not because they would double their money if everyone wore engagement rings. Well, that too. So, basically Sheeran has an engagement ring because he wants to make the rest of us feel bad. Of course not. It’s because Cherry Seaborn made it for him. Oh, now it all makes sense. He’s wearing it out of awkward obligation. Or maybe he just really loves his fiancee, you massive miserable cynic. Do say: “Well done for being a truly equal partner.” Don’t say: “Haven’t you ruined enough weddings already?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/26/emma-bonino-italys-pro-europe-pro-immigrant-conscience","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T07:00:06Z","webTitle":"Emma Bonino: Italy's pro-Europe, pro-immigrant conscience","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/26/emma-bonino-italys-pro-europe-pro-immigrant-conscience","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/26/emma-bonino-italys-pro-europe-pro-immigrant-conscience","fields":{"headline":"Emma Bonino: Italy's pro-Europe, pro-immigrant conscience","bodyText":"Forty years ago, Emma Bonino fought to secure abortion rights in Italy in the shadow of the Vatican. Her campaign involved hunger strikes and a three-week stint in jail. These days, the former foreign minister, activist and candidate for parliament, is waging an equally difficult battle in support of migrants and in defence of Europe, two ideas that seem radical in today’s bitter political environment. There is, Bonino says, an invisible thread that connects the causes of her life. “You can look at the fights I have waged with this point of view: I support a democratic liberal order and believe in the centrality of the individual, his rights but also his responsibilities,” she says. Those ideas, she adds, are under threat. Bonino is an icon in Italy. Her supporters might call her the conscience of the country. While she is not realistically hoping to win next Sunday’s national election, if Bonino and her party – More Europe – do well, she will win 3% of the highly fractured Italian vote, a result that would give her control of her own parliamentary group. It would also grant her a fair amount of influence in the event that the election ends, as many expect, with the creation of a grand coalition government between the centre right and centre left parties headed by two former prime ministers, Silvio Berlusconi and Matteo Renzi. The 69-year-old has gained momentum over recent weeks, despite the fact that her ideas – including granting citizenship to immigrants – run contrary to the prevailing winds in Italy, where migrants are increasingly the target of political vitriol, and where Brussels has been blamed for the country’s economic woes. In an interview in her small rooftop apartment, which has a terrace overlooking St Peter’s Basilica, Bonino – a lung cancer survivor – admits she is frailer than she once was, but is driven by passion for her politics and concerns for the country. “If I look back 50 years ago, if you look at women’s rights, I cannot even recognise my country, the change has been enormous,” she says. “That doesn’t mean it is all done. On the contrary, rights are a process, and if you don’t care for them, you can lose them from morning to night.” She has been thinking about the “banality of evil”, the term coined by Hannah Arendt, the political theorist who examined the rise of Nazism, after she saw a viral video of an elderly Italian woman harassing a black man on a bus while other passengers looked on. “Arendt explains how one small sign happens after the other that no one cares about, and then you suddenly find yourself in hell,” she says. The signs that are worrying Bonino are escalating incidents of political intolerance on the left and the right, racist attacks that are not adequately challenged, the lack of resilience in institutions, and the mediocrity of leaders. She was disturbed by two recent incidents of violence against women, and how differently the murders were treated in the press based on the race of the suspected perpetrators: one, a migrant from Nigeria, and another, a white Italian. “There is no excuse for this kind of thing,” she says. “There are many things you can do to counter this phenomenon: public speeches, videos, talking in schools, exactly like the entrepreneurs of fear use. It is not true that we don’t have tools to react, we are simply not using them in an assertive way.” One of her top political priorities is giving legal status to hundreds of thousands of migrants who are in Italy illegally, much as Berlusconi did in 2000. She is convinced that Europe’s demographic challenges and low birthrates will, eventually, give European capitals a wake-up call about their need to welcome immigrants. “Sooner or later, we will recognise that we need them,” she says. “For the moment the political mood is so bad, so unhealthy, that there is no way to talk rationally.” While Bonino is not worried that Italy might leave the EU, she believes that the constant targeting of Brussels as the source of the country’s problems will have a long-term negative impact. “It’s very simple. On one side you have Putin and on the other side you have Trump. You have China and south of the Mediterranean is on fire. If this is the new landscape, if we go on as 27 small states, each on his own, where do we go?” she says. “If we continue with blaming Europe, we will never make it better. It will stay as it is, like a boat taking water. So in the end, the boat will sink out of inertia,” she adds. Bonino has her share of gripes with the EU, particularly in its handling of the Libya crisis. She condemns, as a stark violation of “every sort of international convention”, the manner in which Italy has sought to keep migrants from entering the continent. “We know that the ones who are saved [by the Libyan coastguard], that they are lost forever, and that no one knows what their life will be,” she says. “We know we are sending them back to hell, we know the conditions of the detention centres they keep. I don’t call that a success, I cannot call that a success.” In contrast to her fight with the Catholic church 40 years ago, Bonino can, these days, count on at least one ally: Pope Francis. The two, she says with a grin, are in touch. “We have some connections, so we pass messages quite often, through friends.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/feb/23/ejector-seat-maker-fined-11m-death-red-arrows-pilot-sean-cunningham","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T14:51:51Z","webTitle":"Ejector seat maker fined £1.1m over death of Red Arrows pilot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/23/ejector-seat-maker-fined-11m-death-red-arrows-pilot-sean-cunningham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/feb/23/ejector-seat-maker-fined-11m-death-red-arrows-pilot-sean-cunningham","fields":{"headline":"Ejector seat maker fined £1.1m over death of Red Arrows pilot","bodyText":"A leading ejector seat manufacturer has been fined £1.1m after the death of a Red Arrows pilot. Flt Lt Sean Cunningham fell 200ft after being ejected from his Hawk T1 aircraft while conducting pre-flight checks on the ground at RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire on 8 November 2011. The parachute on the Mark 10B seat did not deploy and the South African-born airman fell to his death in what a judge called “an entirely preventable tragedy”. Fellow pilots later described their horror as they saw the 35-year-old falling to the ground with the seat still strapped to his back. An investigation found a crucial bolt had been over-tightened. The Middlesex-based company Martin-Baker Aircraft admitted failing to ensure the safety of non-employees at a hearing in January into Cunningham’s death. At Lincoln crown court on Friday, the firm was fined £1.1m, having already agreed to pay £550,000 in prosecution costs. The judge, Mrs Justice Carr, said: “A significant number of pilots, and also potential passengers, were exposed to the risk of harm over a lengthy period. “Here the risk of harm was of the highest level, death. Martin-Baker Aircraft Company fell short of the appropriate standard. “This was, in the words of his father, an entirely preventable tragedy.” Opening the case in a two-day sentencing hearing in early February, the prosecutor, Rex Tedd, said the firm had put many pilots at risk. “If the pilot was ejected from the Hawk aircraft, two shackles would not release from one another and would jam together and the main parachute would not deploy,” he said. “The pilot would be several hundred feet in the air and there could only be one result of that, and that is the pilot’s death.” Reading a victim impact statement on behalf of Cunningham’s family, Carr said: “Sean’s two biggest fears in life were being ejected from an aircraft and the injuries that would be sustained, and dying at a young age. “He was to tragically experience both of these. He was the perfect son and brother and the pride in him from the family is justifiably immense.” Martin-Baker Aircraft describes itself as the “world’s leading manufacturer of ejection and crashworthy seats”. In a statement, the firm said: “Our thoughts remain foremost with the family and friends of Flt Lt Sean Cunningham, to whom the company conveys its sadness, regret and apology. “This tragic accident was the result of an inadvertent ejection and main parachute deployment failure due to the over-tightening of the drogue shackle bolt. In November 2017, the HSE confirmed that the inadvertent ejection was not caused by any fault attributable to the company.” Cunningham’s family criticised the Ministry of Defence and the RAF, and questioned why neither was represented in court. In a statement issued by Cunningham’s sister Nicolette, the family said: “Sean was so proud to be a member of the armed forces and to serve his country. He was the perfect ambassador for your organisation. He gave you his all and ultimately gave his life. “Sean’s death was not an accident. It was a preventable death waiting to happen and we don’t believe it was an isolated incident. We acknowledge the fine issued to Martin-Baker today, a tiny percentage of its profits. No amount of money will bring our son back or relieve our pain.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/24/fresh-row-over-mysterious-sickness-affecting-us-diplomats-in-cuba","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-24T12:00:15Z","webTitle":"Fresh row over mysterious sickness affecting US diplomats in Cuba","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/24/fresh-row-over-mysterious-sickness-affecting-us-diplomats-in-cuba","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/24/fresh-row-over-mysterious-sickness-affecting-us-diplomats-in-cuba","fields":{"headline":"Fresh row over mysterious sickness affecting US diplomats in Cuba","bodyText":"When a mystery illness rippled through the US embassy in Cuba in late 2016, the diplomatic fallout was rapid. The US slashed the number of people at its Havana mission and expelled 15 Cuban diplomats after at least 24 American staff and family reported a mix of headaches, dizziness, eyesight, hearing, sleep and concentration problems. Many of the affected diplomats said their illness came on after they heard strange noises in their homes or hotel rooms. Some reported that the sounds – which ranged from grinding to cicada-like to the buffeting caused by an open car window – appeared to be directed at them, and that their symptoms abated when they moved to another room. Now, the dispute over the cause of the episode has spread into the medical world, where some doctors and scientists are furious with a situation they believe is being spun for political gain. A study published last week by American doctors who examined 21 of the diplomats has been criticised for starting from a position that the diplomats had been exposed to some unknown “energy source”. Sceptics insist this remains conjecture at best, and is far from proven. In the immediate aftermath of the incidents, unnamed US officials claimed that the diplomats had been victims of “acoustic attacks”, from a device that operated outside the audible range of sound. Further anonymous briefings claimed that scientists had discovered abnormalities in white matter tracts in the diplomats’ brains. While US officials have begun to row back from claims of an acoustic attack – a scenario an FBI investigation found no evidence for – the use of some other kind of energy weapon which happens to make a sound is still under investigation. The US government asked doctors at the University of Pennsylvania to run tests on 21 of the diplomats. The results, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (Jama), found no evidence of white matter tract abnormalities, though more advanced scans are underway. “They were similar to what you might see in the same age control group,” said Douglas Smith, director of the Centre for Brain Injury and Repair, who led the medical assessments. But the study does describe a new syndrome in the diplomats that resembles persistent concussion. While some of those affected recovered swiftly, others have had symptoms last for months. The study concludes that the diplomats appear to have “sustained injury to widespread brain networks.” Robert Bartholomew, an expert in mass psychogenic illness (MPI) who teaches at Botany Downs Secondary College in Auckland, said he was “floored by the study” and claims that it reads like US government propaganda. In the article, the doctors state that their objective is to describe “neurological manifestations that followed exposure to an unknown energy source,” but Bartholomew points out that there is no proof that any kind of energy source affected the diplomats, or even that an attack took place. “It’s like the authors are trying to get us to believe an attack has occurred,” he told the Guardian. Mitchell Valdés-Sosa, director of the Cuban Centre for Neurosciences, who was part of a Cuban investigation into the incidents, said other explanations have been dismissed too soon. “When you look at the evidence, at what’s being presented, it doesn’t support the idea of widespread damage to brain networks.” He believes that a small number of diplomats had real medical problems, the causes of which are unknown, which then sparked fears over attacks when they were linked to unusual noises. As concern spread through the diplomatic community, others experienced similar symptoms, developing MPI. “There is no evidence of any kind of attack,” said Valdés-Sosa. “It would take a stretch of the imagination to explain the findings with this kind of, let’s say, novel technology. There are other explanations that have to be explored first.” An editorial, published alongside the Jama study, also urges caution and calls for more evidence to be rigorously evaluated before people reach definitive conclusions. But Valdés-Sosa points out that while the study is referenced on the US state department’s website, which calls on people to reconsider travel to Cuba in light of “health attacks”, the editorial which raises a long list of caveats is not. “This has been politicised,” Valdés-Sosa said. “I think people are using this to push for the rolling back of the relationships that had started to blossom during Obama’s presidency.” Obama essayed a thaw in relations with Cuba during his final years in the White House. But Donald Trump has reversed the detente. Smith conceded that the cause of the diplomats’ illnesses was still unknown. “The concept of this being an energy source is really our best guess, because we can’t think of anything else, but it’s absolutely not proven.” He added: “Whether there was an attack or not is not really in our purview.” Last month Todd Brown, diplomatic security assistant director at the state department, said US investigators were now considering whether people might have been deliberately exposed to a virus. Smith finds this unlikely: “This does seem like a directional phenomenon and I don’t know too many poisons or viruses or bacteria that come and go as you move from place to place.” Smith also believes that MPI is an unlikely explanation for the mysterious sickness because the diplomats were all highly motivated to get back to work, and some of them had symptoms that lasted for months. But Bartholomew argues that MPI has nothing to do with malingering and that it can be long-lasting. “The second most common type of MPI begins slowly and persists for months and years and is often characterised by neurological symptoms,” he said. “The number one suspect here is mass psychogenic illness.” In response to claims that the issue had become politicised, Smith said: “Nobody on our team works for the government or has any conflict with respect to government. In fact, I think most people on the team were sceptical at first and were not expecting to find much here, and yet one after another independently came up with a view that there is something here, that this does appear to be a new syndrome. “We have nothing to hide,” he added. We want to keep the privacy of the individuals intact, but we would be open to discussion about our findings, we’re not aligned with the government.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/feb/26/could-people-in-debt-receive-a-years-grace-to-get-back-on-track","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T12:56:26Z","webTitle":"Government urged to give those with debt problems a year's grace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/feb/26/could-people-in-debt-receive-a-years-grace-to-get-back-on-track","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/feb/26/could-people-in-debt-receive-a-years-grace-to-get-back-on-track","fields":{"headline":"Government urged to give those with debt problems a year's grace","bodyText":"The government has been called on to grant a “breathing space” of up to a year to people who are struggling under debt, so that they can get back on their feet and manage the money they owe. Debt campaigners want the Treasury to dramatically extend existing proposals for a six-week grace period in which debtors would be protected from enforcement proceedings and mounting interest charges. The Conservative manifesto last year committed to a six-week breathing space but many believe this is insufficient, with charities and commentators saying it can take up to a year for debts to be brought under control. The Treasury is expected to announce proposals on how to roll out the new measure later in the year, after a public consultation ended last month. The existing six-week proposal will fail to cover all but the most simple cases, according to Sara Williams, the author of Debt Camel, a blog advising people on money problems. She says people are increasingly getting into debt because they are getting behind on regular bills, not because of overspending. “For several years, debt advisers have been seeing more people [having] problems paying everyday bills such as council tax and utilities. These can be harder to deal with and more urgent than credit card and loan debts, which can take many years to go to court,” she says. “The breathing space needs to cover all types of debts. That includes local authority debts, overpayment of benefits, and debts which are already with a bailiff. They all need to be put on hold while the person’s full financial situation can be reviewed, including whether they are getting the correct benefits. Then arrangements need to be made for priority debts. “Only after that – which can take months – can consumer debts such as credit cards and loans be tackled.” It has been estimated that 2.9 million people are experiencing severe financial debt in the aftermath of the recession. A study by the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) last month found that economic insecurity has become the “new normal” in the UK, with at least 70% of the UK’s working population “chronically broke”. The RSA/Populus survey of more than 2,000 workers found that while about 30% of respondents said they lived comfortably, 40% said their finances were permanently precarious. The remaining 30% said they were not managing to get by. There is already a respite of sorts for those in serious debt. The Financial Conduct Authority’s rules covering consumer debts allow for 30 days of breathing space, which can be followed by another 30 days, if necessary, to get advice. However, the debt charity StepChange points out that while most larger lenders offer this facility, smaller lenders may not, and debts such as fines and rent arrears are not covered. Under the new proposals, a pause would become law and be extended to cover all debts. Alison Blackwood of StepChange says many people who approach them for help can have five or six different debts and be unaware of how much what they owe has gone up through interest and charges. Last year it took an average of 10 weeks for people to assess their position and draw up a repayment plan. In some cases – such as if there has been a serious illness – it can take between six months and a year before someone returns to work. “What we proposed [is] that, as long as people were seeking regulated debt advice, the breathing space should be more flexible, so people could have longer time to sort out the best solution for them, and to get debt advice, and to find out what all of their debts are,” she says. Many people are able to work out their problems given time, and if their debts do not have large interest repayments, says Blackwood. “If they are given that time to stabilise their finances, and that might mean getting a new job or working more hours or having time to recover from illness, they will be able to repay those debts.” Last week, a coalition of charities said a quarter of people admitted to hospital with mental health problems had financial problems and were likely to continue to receive calls from banks, local authorities and other bodies demanding payment for outstanding debts. The charities want people with mental health troubles to be allowed a breathing space. The Treasury held a consultation on the broader issue between October and January, hearing submissions from a number of interested groups. It is expected that proposals on the next steps will come in the summer. “We are committed to helping people overwhelmed by debt by giving them the time they need to seek advice and get their lives back on track,” a spokesman said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"money/2018/feb/24/lloyds-debit-card-blocked-us-holiday","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-24T09:15:34Z","webTitle":"‘Lloyds ruined my trip of a lifetime’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/feb/24/lloyds-debit-card-blocked-us-holiday","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/feb/24/lloyds-debit-card-blocked-us-holiday","fields":{"headline":"‘Lloyds ruined my trip of a lifetime’","bodyText":"Congratulations to Lloyds Bank for launching a timely mental health awareness campaign this month. In the Channel 4 adverts, famous people (including Jeremy Paxman and Victoria Pendleton) and members of the public, wear sticky notes on their heads featuring words and phrases such as bipolar disorder, agoraphobia, depression and anxiety. The voiceover tells us: “Mental health problems affect one in four of our customers, of our staff, of everyone. Let’s get it out in the open. Lloyds Bank – by your side.” Of course we should get it out in the open. So let’s start with Lloyds Bank, and how it has contributed to my mental health problems by relying too heavily on algorithms and too little on human staff. A week before this campaign was launched, I was in America with my autistic daughter. We had gone on a long-promised trip of a lifetime. I have depression, she has anxiety issues. It was never going to be entirely relaxed. I travelled, as I always do, with one card: a Lloyds debit card. At the hotel, I tried to pay my bill. The debit card was declined. I phoned Lloyds in a huff – I’d been here before. “I think you’ve blocked my card for no good reason and without warning,” I said. After the best part of an hour on the phone (at £2 a minute) trying to convince them it was me by answering questions such as “What did you spend £12.49 on?” it confirmed it had blocked me because it was not expecting me to be in America, and I had tried to pay for a taxi with my debit card. “But you have told us we no longer need to tell you when travelling abroad,” I argued, quoting what it says on the bank’s website: “You no longer have to tell us when you are travelling abroad.” Silence. “This is costing a huge amount of money,” I said. “Are you going to pay the phone bill?” Silence. By now, my daughter was having a full-blown panic attack. She thought we may end up in jail or sleeping on the streets. I explained to the bank why this was so stressful for us. They weren’t interested. My spending pattern was suspicious, they said. I pointed out that if Lloyds had done the most cursory investigation, it would have discovered I had booked a flight to arrive in San Francisco that day, I had paid the first night of the hotel, and I had booked trips in San Francisco. They simply repeated that their computer showed “irregular activity”. Eventually, I made them promise they would not stop my card again for the next 12 days while I was in America. They agreed. Four days later, I received a text in the middle of the night. “Dear Mr Hattenstone. Please contact us regarding an ongoing fraud investigation.” Had they blocked my card again? They wouldn’t tell me until I answered security questions. The more questions I answered correctly, the more I was asked. When they asked for my passport number, my daughter became convinced this was a scam. I said they sounded more like fraudsters than a bank, and asked if they could do anything to convince me they were genuine. “No,” they said. “Just ring the number on the back of your card if you don’t believe us.” So I did. By now, I’d been on the phone to Lloyds for the best part of three hours, which would come to well over £300. I was in America unable to pay my bills because an algorithm did not understand the concept of going away. The man in customer services told me the “fraud” investigation was because I had tried to pay for a taxi – something we had sorted out four days earlier. I exploded. I told him Lloyds was destroying my life, and I was tempted “to jump out of the fucking hotel window and leave a message saying it was their fault”. Not the most measured response, I admit. “If you swear again, sir, I shall terminate the conversation,” he said. By now, I felt ripe for a heart attack. I asked the man in customer care if he thought this was an appropriate way to respond to somebody talking about suicide. Silence. Eventually, it was sorted, but not before another lengthy phone call. In 30 years as a journalist, I have never phoned a press office about a personal experience. But I thought this was the only way I could get any answers. Lloyds investigated and concluded the service I received was unsatisfactory. However, it failed to answer why it did not check its algorithm with human intelligence, which would show, in seconds, I was in America. Is it just a form of penny-pinching that puts profit before people (and mental health)? No answer.The issue that bothered me most was the bank’s threat to terminate the conversation when I swore and said I felt suicidal. Yes, I was in a state of extreme anxiety, but surely many people who are being messed around unnecessarily by banks end up in a similar state. And doesn’t Lloyds have a duty of care to customers like us? A postscript. At the weekend my partner discovered her Halifax card for our joint account had been blocked and we were told we had to attend the Halifax with our passports. After an hour with incredibly helpful staff, we discovered what had happened: Lloyds, which owns the Halifax, had also decided to block our joint account because of the “suspicious” activity in America. Despite my call to the press office, my conversation with the head of fraud, my complaints that algorithms, rather than humans, were deciding when to stop me spending my own money, and the bank’s fulsome apology, Lloyds had not considered telling us it had blocked our Halifax account. • Lloyds Bank told Hattenstone: “We’re sorry you had issues with your debit card. Lloyds Bank declined a number of payments and placed a temporary block on your card – steps taken to protect your account from potential fraud. We do contact customers to check if the payments have been correctly authorised, and are investigating why you didn’t receive the text messages. We have also taken the opportunity to retrain colleagues in the correct procedures.” It is understood that on 13 January the bank’s fraud detection systems identified a “pattern of spending” which, it says, was similar to those it has seen in cases of fraud. As a result, it declined the six payments and blocked the card. When Hattenstone confirmed the transactions were his, Lloyds lifted the block. But the bank then claimed to have identified further activity which again were cause for concern. On this occasion, its systems did not decline any transactions or block his account, but it sent a text to ask him to get in touch. When he did, the bank acknowledges that the member of staff made “a number of errors”. Then, on 15, 16 and 21 January, eight further transactions which Hattenstone attempted to make were declined. “This was done because of the manner in which the merchant attempted to process the payments ... specifically, while the card terminal was enabled to verify the payments via chip and pin, they did not use this option. “In order to protect your account from fraud, our systems did not authorise these payments.” Lloyds says it will refund the cost of the calls he made. Blocked in the USA So why are UK banks often quick to block people’s cards when they are in the US? It’s largely due to the fact that America has long been at, or near, the top of the list of overseas card fraud hotspots. The eye-catching statistic is that 50% of the world’s credit and debit card fraud happens in the US, even though it is responsible for only 25% of the world’s card transactions. Fraudsters have been creating fake magnetic-stripe cards to be used in the US and other countries with less secure payment systems. The US is at last replacing them with so-called EMV chip cards. However, this switchover seems to be taking forever. If you are heading overseas, take more than one card, make sure companies have your up-to-date contact details, and that you have your card issuer’s 24-hour contact numbers. Should you tell your bank you are going abroad? Lloyds’ advice is that “you no longer have to tell us when travelling abroad”. But HSBC says: “By letting us know, we can update our records and it will reduce the chance of us declining a transaction.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"culture/2018/feb/23/bridget-christie-i-am-a-white-able-bodied-heterosexual-woman-do-i-have-a-right-to-be-angry-yes","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T16:56:09Z","webTitle":"Bridget Christie: ‘I am a white, able-bodied, heterosexual woman.

Do I have a right to be angry? Yes!’","bodyText":"In Bridget Christie’s first standup comedy routine about feminism, she appeared dressed as an ant. It was 2010. “At that time, it was really quite a hard sell, doing feminism on stage. I came on dressed as an ant, going: ‘Oh no, not another ant, going on about jam and the division of labour.’ And comics would understand what that was. But the audience were like: ‘What’s she going on about? There aren’t any ant comedians.’ And then I dropped the ant costume and went on as a woman, which was much more alienating.” If it’s no longer a hot-button issue that there’s a woman on stage, talking, there are still frames of perception that are peculiar to women: not unlike the early days of the female novelist, say, in which their work was assumed to be autobiographical. This week, the comedian Louise Reay was sued by her ex-husband for talking publicly about their relationship. This isn’t a women’s issue, for Christie. “A lot of comedians have absolutely no qualms whatsoever about divulging. I’m quite a private person. I might talk about how I’m feeling, but I wouldn’t tell anything that wasn’t my story to tell. I’d be constantly running things past people, if I wanted to do that. I make a lot of stuff up, though. And then people will come up and go: ‘I didn’t know your son did that,’ when he didn’t.” Confession has never been her schtick anyway: surrealism, physical comedy, dressing up as things; the “messing about on stage” started in 2004 when “strangely, it wasn’t financially viable at all, putting a black sheet over myself and pretending to be the plague”. Fiscally, she could have been derailed by a gust of wind. One of her early routines involved re-enacting the ascension of Christ with a tiny plastic Jesus and some fishing wire, of which the last item was nearly confiscated at security in Belfast. She persuaded them to let her keep it on the grounds that, without it, she would go bust. She begins a new tour next month. “I think of it as my Chris de Burgh show. I’ve tried to write something that lots of people might enjoy. I’ve never done that before.” Parking for a second how that would actually work, all the architecture of her stage self being prickly, spiky, elusive, a little bit She-Devil, a little bit Road Runner, dancing before your expectations, going “meep meep”, is the world anywhere near ready for a thing that everyone likes? “I did an anti-Brexit show and that was quite raw and angry. But it was exciting then, it was all in the air and everyone was talking about it. Now we’re 20 months in and it’s still dragging on, we’re trapped in it, and it’s just a boring, Kafkaesque nightmare, where nothing moves forward and the delusional people are in charge. But they’re not happy; nobody’s happy. “All the anxieties of the world,” she says cheerfully, “are bleeding into my personal life, into my friendships – well, I haven’t really got those any more.” Yup. This is sounding very Chris de Burgh. I saw one of her shows the day after the Conservative victory in the 2015 general election – in no mood for anything but the most radical politics yet miserably distrustful of spending an evening in a room of like minds – and that was funny for its vaudeville desperation (she spent the first five minutes going: “What the fuck just happened? I mean, fuck”). Nearly three years into this quagmire, she still talks about her “bafflement, I’m the Baffled Comedian”, but she has a very different timbre, much less playful, but more – and it sounds schmaltzy – loving. “There are all these things that are terrible, the Syrian crisis, poverty, terrible violations everywhere, and yet we are amazing, we are silly, funny, living, breathing things, we all just want to have a laugh, and we all want to be loved, and we all want to be taken care of, and none of us want to die alone; we all have the same needs. But obviously that’s not funny.” There’s one world in which it is, though: when nobody else is saying it. When reconciliation sounds like some kind of sly insult. So, you know, this could work. Christie took off in a specific feminist environment, in 2011 – no, that’s not quite true, she had won awards before that, bespoke ones for funny women. But paradoxically, if unsurprisingly, it was as a feminist that she broke out of the niche “female”, getting her own show on BBC Radio 4, winning a Rose d’Or international award for it, publishing a book (A Book for Her, 2015) and being the first British female to be given a Netflix special for her show Stand Up for Her. The #MeToo movement looks like the biggest shift since then, and it is, from the mainstream perspective. If someone had said, even immediately post-Weinstein, that whole careers would be capsized by garden-variety predatory male behaviour, you wouldn’t have believed it. You can see the significance of the sea-change by the lameness of the backlash, as Christie describes: “I don’t know if I’m allowed to compliment a woman now.” Yet within the feminist fold, it was never a vexed issue as to whether or not leveraging economic power for sex was a bad thing – we were just waiting for the rest of the world to catch up. The issues thrown up by the suffragette centenary were more complicated, broadly clustered around intersectionality. Was middle-class feminism advancing the rights of all women or just occupying the space where more structural economic questions should be thrashed out? Has white feminism managed, or even seriously tried, to describe the experience of women of colour? “I try and flag it up. I understand that what I look like is a white, financially comfortable, able-bodied, heterosexual woman. Do I have a right to be angry? Yes, I do. Everybody has a right to be angry.” In 2011, you could arguably have made quite a straightforward critique of the hijab, as Christie did then, that it oppressed women by making their bodies a source of shame, and by making male desire both their fault and a force against which they were powerless. But that has been weaponised by the right to turn the hijab wearers into an assault on British (or European) culture and to exert an equal and opposite control over what women wear (by banning the hijab, in case the wearers, I don’t know, rob banks). Christie is conflicted: “When culture and religion are involved, it is really a complex thing; it’s quite hard for people who are not in that community to understand. It’s not for me to say that it is obviously wrong. But maybe it can be for me to say a child has no reason to cover herself. If you follow the logic of why a child has to cover herself, it unravels very, very quickly.” No culture is entirely – or even at all – logical, and yet, without an appeal to the overarching logic of universalism, all equality arguments are lost. “There will be Muslim women who love their families and they’re devout. And they will be feminist as well. Talk to them about it, don’t bloody throw me to wolves.” It looks cranky, written down; it was anything but. She has funny bones. Similarly, not that long ago, we wouldn’t have had to confront a campaign such as period poverty, which distills this class issue for me – not the campaigners themselves, but the way politicians fall upon it as a safe way to talk about destitution. How can you have an early-day motion about tampons, when the person who couldn’t afford those most likely couldn’t afford a bus fare, either, or spinach? “Why are there girls and women who can’t afford Tampax and why are 130,000 British children homeless?” Still, Christie is upbeat about the campaign’s impact. If everybody has their own single-issue campaigns, “if there’s something you can sort in a relatively short period of time, that will help, that does have a cumulative effect. Everyone feels powerless, but everyone’s got something to bring to the table.” Even when comedy looks as if it’s pushing a line, it’s never that simple. “It’s all about your relationship to the audience and your status. For example, Dave Chapelle …” I have never seen a Chapelle show, but we established earlier on that he has “some great stuff on race, but a complete blindspot on women”, a 70s working men’s club strain of laughs, where you find some hot women in the audience and explore the heady comic territory of whether they will get drunk afterwards and have sex with you. “I don’t know how many millions of pounds he got for his Netflix special, but, to me, the character of Dave Chapelle hadn’t earned the right to say those things about women. If he was a loser and we knew that nothing was going right for him, and he lived with his mother, and he hadn’t been insightful about race, he’d been racist and transphobic and misogynist, and it was a consistent world, and the question was: ‘Am I laughing at this person’s bigotry, or am I laughing at his complete rejection of the world and everything in it?’ – that, to me, is funny.” There are no red lines or no-go areas. “People say you can’t talk about this and you can’t talk about that, but there is always a way of doing it. It’s the same with artists, writers, painters: we’ve got to be allowed to work stuff out. If we’re working in fear all the time, no one’s going to create anything that’s new. Nobody’s going to create anything.” None of that is to amp down the ambient political despair. “In the good old days, when I was growing up, I used to think: ‘I don’t agree with that politician, but they at least look like they’ve gone to school and know some things. They still have arguments and make sense and are quite eloquent.’ Now they all make Bush and Berlusconi look like geniuses. And the lying – the lying really stresses me out. We’ve just accepted it as something they do. There’s nobody I could get behind now.” But … your cat is called Jeremy Corbyn. (This is something her husband, Stewart Lee, wrote, although he did stress that their cat was named before Corbyn’s election to leader and not in anticipation of it.) She looks at me puzzled. “A lot of the stuff we say is just made up.” Not altogether surprisingly, she hates talking about her personal life. “I never like talking about him at all, I try and disassociate myself from him,” she says. “Because until very recently … it was very annoying being someone’s appendage. For years and years, the first sentence of anyone’s review of me was as his wife. But then the reader experiences me, has a perception of me, that they wouldn’t have had had that first sentence not been there. You want audiences to experience you as a comedian. I really care about my job, I want people to come out and think: ‘Who’s this? What does she think?’ Not: ‘I wonder who does the washing up.’ I’ve sort of fantasised about poisoning him and stuff, so I could be referred to as just Bridget Christie, but then I thought, no, I’d just be dead Stewart Lee’s wife. Dead Stewart Lee’s white, feminist wife.” Her atheism is no great anomaly in the comedy world, but it’s atheism with a twist: “My mother had very deep faith and I feel sad that I don’t have that. But you cannot manufacture faith; you’ve got it or you haven’t. But my first instinct in lots of different scenarios would be to pray, still. I feel something, when I’m in nature, when I’m in a field, or I see some bluebells …” But there is a Catholic kicker. “When the sky went orange, I genuinely thought that we were being punished for Brexit. Oh, you’ve really done it now. It’s over. You’ve upset him now, David Davis. Or her.” Bridget Christie: What Now? opens 16 March in Glasgow.

Some of Britain’s biggest airlines have lent their voices to a rival proposal to develop Heathrow for about £5bn less than the airport itself declares necessary, fuelling a row over costs and throwing fresh uncertainty on the scheme. A crucial vote on the government’s approval to expand the London hub is due this summer, but MPs were left confused after the airport’s main customers told them this week not to trust Heathrow with its £14.3bn budget for a new runway. Airline executives said the cost estimate could prove “grossly off target” and make the airport unaffordable as the overspends are passed on to carriers, and then passengers, via higher landing charges. Willie Walsh, the chief executive of IAG, the parent company of British Airways, which operates around half of all flights at Heathrow, told the transport select committee that a revised plan unveiled by the hotelier Surinder Arora was “a very credible alternative”. “He has more experience than anyone, including Heathrow probably, of building facilities at the airport, and at a fraction of the cost,” Walsh said. Questions are being asked about why, nearly three years after the independent Airport Commission made clear Heathrow was the right choice for British airport expansion, the budget is still in doubt. The answer comes in a tweak to the government’s national policy statement on aviation in the autumn. The assumption that Heathrow would run its own development was removed, and the policy did not “identify any statutory undertaker as the appropriate person to carry out the preferred scheme”. BA and its rival Virgin Atlantic led airlines in spotting a chance to cut costs, coalescing around Arora, who owns about 200 acres of land around the airport and buildings including Heathrow’s own corporate HQ, Compass House. Arora’s scheme would see that survive, along with 20% of the land earmarked for the expanded airport. Arora’s main prize would be to develop and operate a terminal, something both he and BA say could alter the whole basis on which Heathrow is run, providing internal competition with the airport’s five other terminals. He has a track record for achieving spectacular ambitions from a modest start, coming to Britain from India at the age of 13 and building a guesthouse on the fringes of the airport into a property business operating franchises for a range of international brands at Heathrow and Gatwick. Arora said: “We’re not here to spoil the party. The only thing we are saying is that we need to break the Heathrow monopoly. In the 21st century you can’t go ahead with this kind of project without any competition.” BA and Arora argue that the way Heathrow is regulated gives it no incentive to keep spending down. The landing charges the Civil Aviation Authority allows it to set are linked to the value of its infrastructure, measured by the money invested. Walsh calls it a “perverse incentive to overspend”, because the higher the investment, the higher the fees that can be imposed on carriers. For Heathrow, the idea of introducing competition is an unwelcome diversion. Its chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, is adamant that it would be a big mistake. ”It would set us back years. The French, Germans, Dutch are racing ahead – what the hell are we doing wasting time?” he said. He described Arora as a good friend, but added: “This is a complex project. This is not building a hotel. We might make it look easy, but it ain’t.” Walsh said: “I do strongly believe a third party could build another terminal, and operate it. It’s a model that works in other parts of the world.” Holland-Kaye said examples of terminals operated by another company, led by New York’s main airport, were not encouraging. “JFK? It’s a mess! Or Munich. Lufthansa protect their dominant position and the other airlines pay for it. [Walsh] might want it but it’s not in the interests of anyone else.” Walsh said Arora had “set a benchmark” for costs, his views on Heathrow’s accounting underlined by a £1bn dividend announced this week. He said: “The bottom line is that Heathrow wants free rein to spend as much they can and get more for it. They’ve been very handsomely rewarding their shareholders.” How strongly the airlines or Arora believe that they can wrest the development from Heathrow is debatable, but the plan increases pressure on the airport, which says it has revised its plans down to expanding terminals rather than building a new one, removing huge expenditure on underground transit systems for people and baggage. Arora said it was prepared to submit a rival planning application if the airport refuses to play along. Holland-Kaye suggested Arora could well end up winning contracts either way: “I’m sure we will all get something out of it.” If MPs back expansion formally, Heathrow will need to consult further on the details before submitting plans, with final approval not expected before 2021. A third runway is not expected to be operational before 2025 at the earliest. The row remains a curveball at a moment when Heathrow appeared to have won over some, if far from all, of its neighbours. Some, ground down by uncertainty that has lingered for a decade, see silver linings: improved compensation or house insulation , and sharing the pain of flight paths around London. Holland-Kaye said: “Even those who oppose us want certainty. It’s in all their interest to just crack on with it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/05/shami-chakrabarti-five-books-to-inspire-activism","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T06:00:09Z","webTitle":"Shami Chakrabarti on books to inspire activism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/05/shami-chakrabarti-five-books-to-inspire-activism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/05/shami-chakrabarti-five-books-to-inspire-activism","fields":{"headline":"Shami Chakrabarti on books to inspire activism","bodyText":"When I was young, reading allowed me to learn from previous generations. Now, it enables me to listen to and benefit from the wisdom and experience of the young. This was never more true than with Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race by Reni Eddo-Lodge. Her electrifying debut lays important foundations, reminding readers of the outline history of imperialism, post-colonial immigration and racist oppression in the UK. However, it is when she arrives in the present that the book really soars. The chapter The Feminism Question is particularly poignant, and should be chastening reading for some. Smug entitlement is not easily chastened, though, so even more importantly – whether you agree with all the author’s articulate analysis or not – her courage and resilience should empower anyone who has ever been belittled or “taken down” to reflect on their situation, seek solidarity and rise back up. Tom Bingham is perhaps the greatest jurist of my lifetime: his constitutional contribution includes a number of landmark decisions in our highest court. Yet his most publicly accessible gift to the nation is his book The Rule of Law. I had the privilege of chairing an event to celebrate its publication, as it turned out, only months before his death. His humble clarity in explaining the vital importance of a rule of law that incorporates accessibility, equality, human rights and internationalism energised a largely lay audience. His book has since done the same for students of law, politics and life. The law was but one tool employed by the heroes of Margot Lee Shetterly’s Hidden Figures, made into an inspiring film. It tells the story of the black female mathematicians, or “human computers”, who, while enduring enormous indignities and injustices because of their race and sex, played a pivotal part in the space race. This book should illuminate school reading lists, not just as a lesson in the civil rights struggle, but as an invitation to young women to throw themselves into science, technology, engineering and mathematics as an act of personal empowerment and political progress. Mary Shelley would have agreed with that aim, and the timeless truth-telling of her fiction, too, has the power to provoke political action. It’s 200 years since Frankenstein; or the Modern Prometheus was published, and in a year of so many politically significant anniversaries this one is in danger of being overshadowed. Shelley’s novel seems even more relevant today as we grapple with ethical debates about artificial intelligence and what it is to be human. Speaking of humanity, I write fresh from a demoralising visit to a place of indefinite incarceration, Yarl’s Wood detention centre. Refugee Tales, the book produced by the charity Gatwick Detainees Welfare Group, brings together the stories of individuals caught up in the refugee crisis, retold by poets and novelists. These are presented as modernday counterparts to the stories in Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, re‑humanising people our society so often vilifies. If ever there were a cause that demanded action, this is surely it.

On Saturday, the woman again requested her privacy be protected and released a statement in which she stressed that she never intended for the issue to become public. She said she had submitted the complaint directly to the federal executive of the National party to “prevent this type of inappropriate behaviour towards women in the future”. “This complaint was not made solely to address the incident against me – it is about speaking up against inappropriate behaviour by people in powerful positions.” On Saturday, the Australian newspaper published a front-page story identifying the woman by name, along with her picture and details of her career. Her sexual harassment complaint to the National party emerged on Thursday night and contributed to Joyce’s resignation as party leader and deputy prime minister. In his farewell speech on Friday, Joyce said the complaint had contributed to his decision to step down. “It’s quite evident that you can’t go to the dispatch box with issues like that surrounding you,” he said. Her identification came despite the woman’s lawyer telling news outlets before publication of Saturday’s report that the complaint itself becoming public was “the last thing my client wanted”. Her lawyer was quoted as saying by the Australian: “What prevents a lot of people in circumstances like this [from coming forward] is the repercussions of being dragged through a scandal.” According to the Australian press council’s general principles, journalists must “avoid intruding on a person’s reasonable expectations of privacy, unless doing so is sufficiently in the public interest”. The Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance’s journalist code of ethics also says reporters must “respect personal privacy”. On Friday, the ABC reported that the woman had raised the complaint directly with the National party and had intended to keep the complaint within the party’s procedures. She said the complaint was of a serious nature and that the woman was still prepared to stand by her claims. The lawyer told Guardian Australia the Australian’s identification of her client was against her wishes and that she had not given the authors permission to identify her. Subsequently, her name was also reported by the Australian Associated Press and other outlets. Helen Trinca, the Australian’s managing editor, said: “The Australian stands by its decision to report to the fullest extent that is reasonable in a matter involving the then deputy prime minister, and in which openness and transparency is overwhelmingly in the public interest.” News of the woman’s complaint was initially reported on Friday by Sydney’s Daily Telegraph. The Nationals federal president, Larry Anthony, confirmed that a formal complaint of sexual harassment had been received against Joyce earlier in the week. “All complaints are taken seriously and treated with strict confidentiality and given due process,” he said. Joyce said the claim was “spurious and defamatory” and said he had asked for it to be referred to the police."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/feb/23/facebook-cpac-vr-shooting-game-backlash-remove-florida","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T23:56:10Z","webTitle":"Facebook sees backlash after demoing VR shooter game at conservative event","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/23/facebook-cpac-vr-shooting-game-backlash-remove-florida","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/feb/23/facebook-cpac-vr-shooting-game-backlash-remove-florida","fields":{"headline":"Facebook sees backlash after demoing VR shooter game at conservative event","bodyText":"Facebook is facing backlash for bringing a virtual reality shooting game to a rightwing conference where the National Rifle Association (NRA) has promoted gun rights in the wake of a Florida school shooting. The social media company, which has since removed the demonstration game and expressed “regret”, was already facing scrutiny for attending the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), a high-profile event that featured speeches attacking gun control advocates and a renewed call from Donald Trump to arm school teachers. Hugo Barra, Facebook’s vice president of VR, said the company has a “standard set” of demos for events, including “action games” with “violence”. “In light of the recent events in Florida and out of respect for the victims and their families, we have removed them from this demo. We regret that we failed to do so in the first place,” he said in a statement to the Guardian. The conference in Maryland – which featured multiple NRA representatives and far-right French politician Marion Maréchal-Le Pen – came one week after a shooter with an AR-15 rifle killed 17 people in Florida, sparking a wave of student activism and renewed scrutiny of Republican politicians funded by the NRA. Facebook, which has been criticized by some for giving money to CPAC, faced backlash Friday when video emerged of its Oculus demo game that appeared to involve rapid-fire shooting. Some criticizing Facebook also pointed out that its platform has played a role in spreading false conspiracy theories about survivors of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school shooting. At CPAC, where Trump repeated his anti-immigrant rhetoric and attacks on Hillary Clinton, Facebook also set up a help desk and held a training for Facebook Groups. The groups feature has faced scrutiny over the last year for its role in helping neo-Nazis and rightwing extremists connect and organize. “Facebook routinely participates in events hosted by organizations across the political spectrum,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an email. “Our presence allows us to share information about our products as well as facilitate a dialogue ... Our involvement is not an endorsement of any particular position or platform.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/23/trump-australia-malcolm-turnbull-guns-teachers","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T21:24:20Z","webTitle":"Trump hosts Australian PM Turnbull and repeats plan to give teachers guns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/23/trump-australia-malcolm-turnbull-guns-teachers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/feb/23/trump-australia-malcolm-turnbull-guns-teachers","fields":{"headline":"Trump hosts Australian PM Turnbull and repeats plan to give teachers guns","bodyText":"Donald Trump said on Friday arming teachers would create “offensive capability as well as defensive capability within the schools” and help deter mass shootings such as that which took place in Florida last week, leaving 17 people dead. Trump spoke at a joint press conference with Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister of Australia, a country that banned automatic and semi-automatic weapons after a 1996 mass shooting in Tasmania and which has not seen such an incident since. Turnbull declined to advise his host on pursuing a similar ban, amid calls for new gun restrictions across the US since the shooting last week at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school. Asked what concrete action he would take to make American children safe at school, Trump said: “We are going to be very strong on background checks,” with particular reference to mental illness. He described the Parkland gunman as “a very sick person and someone who should have been nabbed”. “We’re going to get rid of the bump stocks and we are going to do certain other things,” the president said. “But it’s very, very important that we have offensive capability as well as defensive capability within the schools.” Trump added: “I want to have people in the building, and in many cases you have ex-marines and ex-army and navy and coast guard. “You can have them in the building and they can have concealed weapons and still be teachers or they can be in the building in a different capacity, but we have to have offensive capability to take these people out rapidly before they can do this kind of damage.” Trump said: “If the bad guy thinks that there is going to be someone inside the room with a gun pointed at him, with live bullets, he’s not even going into the school. “That’s the one way you’re going to solve it. You’re not going to solve it with gun-free spaces because they’ll get in there and they’ll be the only one with a gun.” Mass shooters, he said, were “innately … cowards”. Trump also criticised the armed deputy at the school in Florida, who did not enter the school while the shooting was happening and who has since resigned his post. “A security guard doesn’t know the children, doesn’t love the children,” Trump said. “This man standing outside of the school the other day doesn’t love the children, probably doesn’t know the children. The teachers love the children, they love their pupils, they love their students. “Now they have also to be very adept. I’m talking about a small percentage, but people with great ability with guns. Those are the people I’m talking about.” Turnbull said Australia’s “history with gun control and regulation is obviously very different to the US”. “There was a mass shooting in Tasmania in 1996,” he said, of the shooting in Port Arthur in which 35 people were killed and 23 wounded, “and my predecessor John Howard … undertook some very big reforms and basically semi-automatic, let alone automatic, weapons are essentially not available. “The range of firearms available to people who don’t have a specific professional need, people involved in pest control and so forth, are very, very limited. “But it is a completely different context, historically and legally and so forth. We are very satisfied with our laws, we maintain them … but we certainly don’t presume to provide policy or political advice on that matter here.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/feb/24/leicester-city-v-stoke-city-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-24T14:28:46Z","webTitle":"Leicester City 1-1 Stoke City: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/feb/24/leicester-city-v-stoke-city-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/feb/24/leicester-city-v-stoke-city-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Leicester City 1-1 Stoke City: Premier League – as it happened","bodyText":"Maguire clears the corner and that’s that. I’d say 1-1 is a fair result. Leicester had more chances but Stoke played much better in the second half and though a point means they stay in the relegation zone, the players look like they care and are giving everything for Paul Lambert and the club’s fans. Leicester move above Burnley and into seventh. Thanks for your emails. I’ll leave you with this thought: I wonder if Wes Morgan has played against both Kevin Campbell and his son Tyrese? Or maybe Kasper Schmeichel has. One to look up, if you’re an occasional nerd like me. Also, that was a much better second half. It had to be. Oh, that’s two thoughts. Bye. 90+3 min: Stoke win their first corner of the match! 90+2 min: Stoke have a go themselves with Bauer racing up the right touchline before cutting the ball back towards campbell at the back post. Chilwell just gets a touch on it and Leicester clear. 90 min: You know Leicester have the bit between their teeth when Wes Morgan strides out of defence like a latterday Beckenbauer. He sets up an attack on the right but Stoke snuff out the danger. 88 min: It’s the Charlie Adam show! He underclubs with a backwards header and sends Mahrez through on goal. The Algerian draws Butland out of goal and tries to dink it over him but the keeper gets something on it and slows the ball’s progress enough that Zouma can zoom back and clear for a corner. The corner is played short and the resulting cross is headed against the far post by Matty James and there then follows a brilliant goalmouth scramble that red-and-white striped desperate legs win. Somehow, Stoke are still level at 1-1. 87 min: Adam buys a foul off Ndidi 25 yards from goal in a central position. The big Scot dust himself off and blooters the ball straight into the wall. 86 min: Leicester are having a spell of possession. It ends when Mahrez tries to belt one home from 35 yards. It’s a hopeful effort that ends up somewhere near Oadby. 85 min: Choupo-Moting, who has worked hard and can be satisfied with his day’s work, is off, and Glen Johnson is on. I forgot Glen Johnson existed. 83 min: A rare counter-attack from Stoke. Choupo-Moting rides Albrighton’s challenge on the halfway line and slides the ball into Shaqiri in the inside-left channel. The little Swiss forward squirts the ball across the six-yard line looking for Campbell, but his cross is at least two yards in front of the young forward. 82 min: Wahey! Adam hauls back Iheanacho in midfield and there’s his booking. Well done Charlie! 81 min: Adam hasn’t fouled anyone in the past two minutes. What’s going on? 78 min: Albrighton aims at the back post with his delivery but Stoke clear to Mahrez. He drops his shoulder and whips a left-footed shot towards the far post that Butland does brilliantly to fling himself at and paw away. Instinctive, fine goalkeeping that helps make up for his earlier error. Leicester come back and the ball is worked to Maguire on the right side of teh penalty area. He somehow burst past his marker and thunders a shot into the near post. There’s an almighty clatter and Stoke survive. 77 min: Leicester win their ninth corner. 76 min: Adam is late on Iheanacho right on the edge of teh Leicester area. He gets none of the ball and a piece of the young striker’s shin. It’s a clear free-kick but Oliver, presumably, doesn’t see it. 74 min: Adam takes about 20 seconds to introduce a piece of Dundee to Morgan’s buttocks. He’s lucky to get away without a booking. His studs scraped down the big defenders cheeks. 73 min: Martins Indi, who has been brilliant for Stoke, is taken off. Adam is on in his place, which means Cameron will shift back to centre-half. That’s an odd substitution. I can only imagine Martins Indi is injured. Oh dear! Butland has made an absolute howler. Mahrez prods a clever little pass behind Stafylidis to Albrighton, who races to the byline and wallops a cross at the near post intended for Vardy’s outstretched studs. Butland, perhaps distracted by Vardy, watches the ball clatter into his midriff and into the net. He looks crestfallen. Stoke’s fine work has been undone. 67 min: Paul Lambert has just been asked to change his training top from a blue one to a white one on Kasper Schmeichel’s instructions. Apparently, the Leicester keeeper kept thinking he was Mahrez. I can’t imagine the Algerian will be happy to hear that. 66 min: The home fans are restless. Stoke are working harder than Leicester and giving them no time on the ball. The result is that Stoke are now the dominant force and are on top. 65 min: Meanwhile in Bundesliga 2. 64 min: Time for Paul Lambert to respond to Puel’s move. Diouf is off and 18-year-old Tyrese Campbell is on in his stead. He is the son of Kevin Campbell, which makes me feel incredibly old. The Stoke fans sing his name heartily. What must that feel like for a teenager. Bloody great, I imagine. 60 min: Gray, who I have barely seen since the 12th minute, is replaced by Fousseni Diabaté, a creative midfielder who, like Mahrez, was spotted in the French second division. And Simpson is replaced by Kelechi Iheanacho, which means Leicester are going to three at the back. 58 min: Mahrez runs into a Choupo-Moting-Cameron sandwich and wins a free-kick 40 yards out. It’s a decent position, just to the left of the D, but Leicester’s deliveries have been well below par today. Albrighton and Mahrez have both been culpable. 56 min: Schmeichel, whose passing has been brilliant today, gathers the ball at his feet outside the penalty area on the right and connects horribly with his attempted clearance, watching the ball bobble off the turf and barely make the halfway line. Allen beats Ndidi to the ball and feeds Shaqiri, who takes one touch and – with Schmeichel still racing back towards his goal – attempts to curl the ball into the far corner with his left foot. But his attempt is a foot wide. Schmeichel wouldn’t have got there. 54 min: Allen is late into a tackle. He needs to be careful. He’s on a yellow card. Stoke can’t afford to lose him and won’t want to substitute him, such is his quality. 52 min: I may be inviting trouble here, but it feels like Tony Pulis is in radio control of this Stoke defence today. They’ve won everything. To help make my point there’s half a whiff of danger in the Stoke box after another Leicester free-kick that is whipped into the box, but Martins Indi (again) hoofs clear under pressure from Morgan. 50 min: Shaqiri wrestles Albrighton to the ground about a year after the Leicester player has popped his pass away. It’s a stupid free-kick to concede. Thankfully, Mahrez underhits the ball into the box and Stoke clear easily. 47 min: Albrighton has had one of those games so far. He’s seen a lot of the ball but he’s been tuned into a different frequency to his team-mates. His passes have often been a tad overhit or not understood. Ah well, there’s time yet. 45 min: Leicester get off to a quick start, with Mahrez dancing into the box and then Albrighton watching a hefty strike at goal blocked by Martins Indi’s outstretched right leg. That’s more like it. Adam Timmins writes: “Although I have little sympathy for him, it’s still kind of sad to see what’s happened to Berahino. The turning point in his career as it stands was when Spurs first came in for him in January 2015 and WBA turned them down. It turned Berahino’s head, and his career has gone downhill ever since.” Yes, I’d love to know what would have happened to his career had he signed for Spurs. Could he be playing off Kane now? Or would he be out on loan at, um, Stoke? “I’ve seen better football,” says Sven. And he’s managed England. Honk. Having watched that goal back, Leicester’s defence may as well have written Shaqiri an invitation to score that goal. Maguire, in particular, backed off and gave Shaqiri the chance to dust off his right boot and curl that shot home. If ever a half needed a goal, it was that one. Thank you Xherdan. 45 min: It wouldn’t be fair to say Stoke deserve that goal but the fact that Leicester haven’t ever fully taken control of the game, and have been sloppy in possession, always made a Stoke goal a possibility. It’s made the second half more interesting anyway. The away fans are excited now. Ndidi (stupidly) tries to backheel the ball up the line only to be shoved off it by Allen. As sharp as you like, he feeds Shaqiri, who is 35 yards from goal. He burst forwards and shifts the ball on to his right foot then uses Maguire’s ample midriff as a guide to bend the ball around and into Schmeichel’s bottom left-hand corner. It’s a sumptuous finish and the forward’s fourth goal in four games. 41 min: You can hear the fidgeting of (possibly gloved) fingers at the King Power Stadium. There is nothing to get the home (or away) fans excited. 39 min: Leicester haven’t been able to win the midfield battle, so they’re unable to play football anywhere other than the flanks. Vardy could really do with a ball played in behind the centre-backs but Allen, Ndiaye and Cameron are keeping that supply line closed off. 37 min: Schmeichel does it again. A low and hard fizzing 30-yarder played out of his hands to Mahrez on the right. Stop it Kasper, you’re spoiling us. 35 min: Schmeichel clears the ball to Mahrez. It’s one of the game’s highlights. I’ve tried to be optimistic thus far but who am I kidding. This half has been awful. 32 min: Albrighton pings a glorious cross-field pass to Mahrez’s left boot. He races to the byline and whistles an inviting low ball across the six-yard box that is cleared out for a corner at the back post. The corner is whipped in to the near post but Butland wallops the ball clear with his right fist while connecting with Ndiaye’s noggin. He hits the turf but is ready to continue after a brief visit by the physio. 30 min: Stoke win a free-kick and Shaqiri fluffs his attempted delivery like a golfer topping his tee shot. The ball is walloped up to Mahrez on the right. His first touch, an outside-of-the-foot-trap-on-the-move, is a thing of beauty. He scuttles up to the edge of the box and drops his shoulder to create a yard for a left-footed shot at goal. But his execution is poor and the ball drifts a yard wide. 27 min: Allen snaps into a tackle on Mahrez and scrambles to his feet before showing great composure to swivel his hips and slide a little pass into Shaqiri to launch a counter-attack. The little Swiss muscle man floats a ball over the top of Leicester’s defence on to Diouf’s chest but the offside flag is raised. Fine play from Allen there but he’ll have to be careful given that he’s on a booking. 26 min: Leicester are well on top again but they’ve yet to create a chance of note. They win two corners but Stoke’s defence has been shepherded brilliantly so far by Martins Indi and Zouma. Are Stoke entering the post-Shawcross future? He’s injured today, by the way. 22 min: Diouf is booked for a lunge at Mahrez’s ankles. The pitch-side microphones pick up a dull thud and a scream from the Algerian. A clearer booking as you’ll ever see and a fine example of a striker’s challenge. Diouf tries to shake Mahrez’s hands but he’s having none of it. 19 min: Ndidi launches himself into a tackle on Cameron and wins possession easily. He then hoiks a ball into the air towards Vardy, who is lurking on Martins Indi’s shoulder. The ball drops and Vardy gives Martins Indi a shove but the big centre-back is having none of it and clatters the ball away. 17 min: Mahrez sends two Stoke players for an early lunch with a textbook Cruyff turn in midfield before launching an attack down the left. For all that Mahrez has seen plenty of the ball on the right, Gray and Albrighton have enjoyed a little more space in which to operate on the left. On this occasion, Bauer sticks to his task diligently and wins back possession off Albrighton. A moment later, Albrighton goes into the book for a late tackle on Shaqiri. 14 min: Gray angles a right-footed cross towards Mahrez, who drifts off Stafylidis at the back post, but the full-back does well to leap and head the ball out for a corner. Mahrez, plays it short and Albrighton clips it in to the box but to no avail. 12 min: Albrighton attempts to inject a few much-needed snappy short passes into the game. Two of them are decent but his third goes straight to Shaqiri and initiates a Stoke attack. It’s an attack that is easily snuffed out on the right as Chilwell blocks Bauer’s attempted cross, but the home team need to take better care of the ball than that - show it a little love, get to know it better why don’t you. 10 min: Maguire catches Shaqiri. It’s another free-kick near the halfway line. Shaqiri punts a hopeful ball to the back post. It’s easily defended. A bit of quality would help. Where’s Mahrez gone? 8 min: It’s very quickly descended into a bitty midfield battle. Joe Allen is booked for a mis-timed snap at Gray’s ankles near the halfway line. Albrighton flights the ball towards the penalty area, but it’s overhit and drifts out for a goal-kick. 6 min: Stoke win a free-kick 35 yards out over towards the left. Shaqiri whips it in towards Cameron on the back post but Maguire uses his considerable bulk to hold off the big Stoke midfielder and watch the ball go out for a goal-kick. 4 min: Mahrez is on the ball again over on the right. Stafylidis is making his full Stoke debut today and may be in for a torrid afternoon. One drop of the shoulder and Mahrez buys a yard to curl a low left-footed shot a yard wide of Butland’s right-hand post. 3 min: Stoke have barely had a touch. 2 min: Mahrez is immediately lively, wiggling his hips and winning a throw-in and a corner in quick succession. Stoke defend the first corner and concede a second one. Mahrez whips it in to the back post but Martins Indi heads it out for a third corner. It’s only half-cleared to James, on the edge of the box, who delays his shot – perhaps struggling to see the ball in the low winter sun – before thrashing it over the bar. Good start from Leicester. Peep! Leicester, in traditional royal blue, kick-off. They’re going from left to right. Stoke, in their home red and white stripes they’ve sported since 1908, are going the other way. The teams trot out of the tunnel on to the King Power Stadium pitch to the post horn gallop. It’s nippy out there, just 3C at kick-off. Hopefully, that will encourage a fast start and plenty of zippy passes and runs to warm the players up. Either that, or a hamstring will twang early on. Saido Berahino is not in the Stoke squad today, which means he’s about as likely to score as he would be had he been named in the starting lineup or on the bench. Poor Saido, he’s almost reached two years without a goal. He last scored on 27 February 2016. We’ll see two of the Premier League’s stockiest players collide this afternoon, Xherdan Shaqiri and Harry Maguire. Shaqiri reminds me of a chest of drawers on legs while Maguire has overtaken Wes Morgan as Leicester’s chunky wardrobe at the back. Stoke’s attackers will have to take the adventurous route to get round that brawny pairing. Claude Puel is asked if Riyad Mahrez is ready to return in the Premier League: “Yes, he played very well against Sheffield United and he came back quickly at a good level and with good feet. He enjoys his football and with his team-mates he has a good understanding and he will play a good game today.” Well, I think that what’s he said. Puel never breaks out of a whisper. How he gets his instructions across to his players is one of football’s great mysteries. Leicester’s Marc Albrighton has just been thrust in front of a microphone and asked for his thoughts on today’s game. Here they are: “We’ve got to keep improving on our position. The manager wants to finish first in that ‘second’ league. That’s our aim. We’ve had a couple of slip-ups in the league lately but we hope to get back to winning ways. We’ve had to add a lot to our play [under Claude Puel], our buildup play and a slightly different counter-attacking [style]. We’ll need to fight all over the pitch. Second balls will be a major part of the game today. They’ll be physical but they can play as well.” Yes, they can, and Joe Allen is such an important part of making Stoke tick. While he’s busying himself on the ball in midfield, Choupo-Moting, Diouf and Shaqiri can expect to see more clever passes popped into their feet. Also, isn’t the ‘second’ league the one below Manchester City down to Arsenal? Surely he means the ‘third’ league. Sven-Göran Eriksson is a pundit for Sky Sports at this game today. I assumed that in the winter months he was never more than two yards from a sun-lounger. Leicester: Schmeichel, Simpson, Morgan, Maguire, Chilwell, Mahrez, James, Ndidi, Albrighton, Gray, Vardy. Subs: Iheanacho, Adrien Silva, Dragovic, Jakupovic, Iborra, Fuchs, Diabate. Stoke: Butland, Bauer, Martins Indi, Zouma, Stafylidis, Allen, Cameron, Ndiaye, Shaqiri, Choupo-Moting, Diouf. Subs: Pieters, Johnson, Jese, Adam, Sobhi, Grant, Campbell. Referee: Michael Oliver (Northumberland) Afternoon. Both these sides have struggled for form in the past few games; two losses and a draw for Leicester – including that 5-1 hammering at Manchester City last time out – and two draws and a loss for Stoke. At least Paul Lambert has given Stoke a bit of backbone in their scrap for survival, though. “I’ve got that fight and commitment from them and you can’t ask for any more,” he roared in his pre-match press conference. “We’ve got 11 cup finals and that won’t change. At least I know we’ve got the confidence to go and win. We won’t set our stall out to defend because I know we’ve got players that can hurt them.” The problem for Stoke is that Leicester have a player returning to the starting lineup who can hurt them. It’s little surprise the Foxes’ form has dipped in Riyad Mahrez’s failed transfer-related absence. But a cosy meeting with his team-mates appears to have helped bring him back into the fold and if he plays to only 75% of his potential today, then Jamie Vardy can expect Leicester’s supply line to be fruitful. Still, I expect this to be a close contest, as it has been through history. The overall record reads: Leicester wins 29 Stoke wins 28 Draws 28. A win for second-bottom Stoke will take them up to 15th, seven points behind Leicester, in eighth. Well, it will until 4.45pm at least. A draw would leave them in the relegation zone. A win or a draw for Leicester would knock Burnley out of the seventh place that they have occupied since what seems like the dawn of time. My prediction: Leicester 2-2 Stoke"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/24/protest-mourning-florida-school-shooting","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-24T12:00:14Z","webTitle":"When injustice leads to death, protest is an appropriate way to mourn | Steven W Thrasher","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/24/protest-mourning-florida-school-shooting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/24/protest-mourning-florida-school-shooting","fields":{"headline":"When injustice leads to death, protest is an appropriate way to mourn","bodyText":"The powerful should never tell relatively powerless people who are protesting for their very lives how they should be behaving. That’s what was happening when a conservative pundit criticized Parkland students for organizing the March for Our Lives. It was, she said, “quite interesting that the children survivors haven’t even buried their friends, grieve, get over shock but have had the time to plan for a march, come up with a creative hashtag, get their story to all media outlets all in such a short amount time”. But memorializing the dead through protest doesn’t mean denigrating them – it means honoring their lives by making a better future. Mourning through militant protest has a long and noble history in the United States. It was young people protesting about the death of another Florida teenager who died from gun violence six years ago, Trayvon Martin, that led to the Black Lives Matter movement. Their love for that boy killed by George Zimmerman helped spark a movement honoring the value of black life. Similarly, Ferguson residents began mourning Mike Brown by protesting about the mass gun deaths due to racist policing. The protests might not have been considered appropriate etiquette by some, but their urgency was driven by the fact that his body was left to bleed out on the street for hours. This is not unlike how Mamie Till chose “to let the people see what they did to my boy” in an open casket, making his funeral into a protest to protect other black people. A few days after the Parkland shooting, a group of teens staged a “die-in” by lying down outside the White House. This was a painful new incarnation of a protest used by Act Up – the Aids Coalition to Unleash Power – which staged die-ins in the 1980s and 90s as many of the members themselves were dying. And in 1992, Act Up members heaved the ashes of their dead friends and lovers over the George HW Bush-occupied White House. To these gay men and their allies, mourning meant being militant about how the dead had been killed by homophobia and inaction – much as the teens staging a die-in outside the White House last week were protesting about the present federal government’s complicity via inaction on gun deaths. Black people have been making life better for everyone by mourning through protest for centuries in this country. On 28 July 1917, some 10,000 people gathered in New York City to march down Fifth Avenue in a silent parade organized by the NAACP. The march was a protest against the East St Louis riots earlier that year, in which rampaging white mobs had killed dozens of black people and burned the homes of thousands more. A century before that, during the German Coast Uprising of 1811, enslaved black people tried to mourn being raped, murdered, bought and sold by rebelling for their freedom. Policing the appropriateness of mourning is a way of saying “stay in your place”. Having lost my father, mother, stepmother and sister in the span of a decade, I know a thing or two about mourning and the many forms it can take. But to understand that protest is a humane response for grieving people, you have to first believe they are humans capable of feeling. (The black teens who have been protesting against police shootings have not been considered as valid as the Parkland teens because their humanity isn’t typically seen as valid in media and politics.) And if you’ve never had to fight for the lives of people you love – or felt that your own life is imminently in danger – then you may be inclined to do nothing and uphold the status quo. But when death has come through great injustice, mourning through a militancy aimed at stopping similarly unjust deaths is not just healthy, but righteous and ethical. Mourning through militancy is one of the more noble sides of America’s history."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/23/jose-mourinho-chelsea-antonio-conte-feud-manchester-united","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T22:30:23Z","webTitle":"Mourinho says Chelsea games mean ‘less and less’ as Conte feud cools","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/23/jose-mourinho-chelsea-antonio-conte-feud-manchester-united","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/23/jose-mourinho-chelsea-antonio-conte-feud-manchester-united","fields":{"headline":"Mourinho says Chelsea games mean ‘less and less’ as Conte feud cools","bodyText":"José Mourinho has admitted meetings with Chelsea mean “less and less” as his emotional ties with his former club steadily recede, with neither the Manchester United manager nor Antonio Conte prepared to reignite their feud before Sunday’s collision between their teams at Old Trafford. The pair clashed towards the end of last year when Conte interpreted Mourinho’s criticisms of managers who “behave as a clown” on the touchline as a personal attack. The Italian responded by suggesting his counterpart might be suffering from “demenza senile”, with their war of words escalating further after the United manager appeared to reference the Chelsea head coach’s four-month ban for failing to report alleged match-fixing while working in his native Italy. Conte went on to call his opposite number “a little man” and “fake”. There has been no attempt at reconciliation, with Conte still understood to be infuriated in particular by the mention of match-fixing, the Italian having been exonerated in May 2016. Yet an uneasy truce has broken out in the buildup to Sunday’s game, with neither coach risking distracting his players as they seek to secure a top‑four finish. Conte would not address his issues with Mourinho in his media briefing, indicating each had said his piece in the past and the time had come for silence. The Portuguese limited his input to: “I’m not going to speak about it, it’s not the point. [Conte is a] very good manager and they are a fantastic team, and that’s what is important for me. The real meaning [of this game] is two of the best teams in England, two of the biggest clubs, are playing a match.” He was more willing to address his longstanding ties with Chelsea. He claimed three Premier League titles, an FA Cup and three League Cups over two stints but was twice sacked. “To play against Chelsea will mean less and less and less with the years,” he said. “So of course I left already a couple of years ago, and next season [it will be] three years ago, so step by step that feeling of: ‘I was the Chelsea manager’ or ‘I was their manager’ for them I think disappears. “I have a good relation with the [Chelsea] board. I don’t forget how nice they were to me in a difficult period with the departure of my father [Félix, who died after a lengthy illness in the summer of 2017]. They show me in that moment they feel me as a friend that did his best for the club and always respects the club. “So the board know the relation with me is always good. With the players, I don’t have any problem, any regret, any stone on my shoes, no problem at all. And the fans are fans. With many of them in the street I feel that empathy and that relation that normally should be a connection and feeling forever. When I play at Stamford Bridge some reactions from the fans are just reactions.” Conte expects to confront his former midfielder Nemanja Matic – “one of the key players in winning the title last season but who is, unfortunately, now playing for Manchester United,” he said – but will be able to field the in-form Willian. The Brazilian thrived under Mourinho and has been linked previously with a move to Old Trafford to work under him again but, having played only two full games in the Premier League last season, his recent form has reinvigorated the champions. Willian scored and hit both posts in Tuesday’s encouraging draw with Barcelona, with Conte impressed by his energy and work-rate. The Italian was prickly when talk drifted back to the forward’s lack of game-time last term. “Do you think that I am stupid when I put Willy on the bench?” he asked. “Maybe last season we won the title, or did I forget something? Now he is playing because he deserves to play, not because there is some regret from the past. In the last match I made a fantastic choice [by picking him] and I want to take credit for that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/23/the-guardian-view-on-tackling-sexual-exploitation-listening-to-victims-is-not-enough","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T17:27:24Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on tackling sexual exploitation: listening to victims is not enough | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/23/the-guardian-view-on-tackling-sexual-exploitation-listening-to-victims-is-not-enough","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/23/the-guardian-view-on-tackling-sexual-exploitation-listening-to-victims-is-not-enough","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on tackling sexual exploitation: listening to victims is not enough","bodyText":"The 700 children and vulnerable women groomed and abused by gangs in north-east England were “harmed beyond imagination”, in the words of one victim. Some showed remarkable courage in giving evidence despite years of manipulation, threats and violence. Their bravery led to the conviction of 17 men and one woman last August; Northumbria police’s broader investigation of sexual exploitation continues. The serious case review compiled by the retired barrister David Spicer shows that victims were let down by authorities in Newcastle in the past. Incidents were treated independently, and victims felt that – while perpetrators were unaffected – they were punished, for example by placing them in secure accommodation. Though meant for their protection, it sent the wrong message, encouraging “an arrogant persistence” among abusers. But while the case has obvious parallels with other recent cases – notably the appalling abuse seen in Rotherham – authorities responded very differently overall. The review notes a dramatic improvement from 2014 onwards, as police and local authorities worked together to protect the vulnerable and bring offenders to justice. Thus, it tells us not only what can go wrong but also what works and must be built upon – and what is needed next. A first step is to recognise that while listening is essential, it is not sufficient, especially since the “calculated and malign” influence of perpetrators leads many victims to resent or fear intervention initially. A second is to recognise abuse. Mr Spicer warns that it is very likely that vulnerable adults are abused across the UK, and rightly calls for an urgent review of sex exploitation laws to tackle this difficult area. Authorities should also learn from Newcastle’s work in ensuring that abused children are supported into adulthood, in recognising that vulnerabilities are not always obvious, and in raising awareness among everyone from hotel staff to teachers. A third step is to review the treatment of victims in court; Mr Spicer reported that they had been “disgusted”. Failing to address this inflicts further trauma on those who have already suffered so much, and deters others from bringing abusers to justice. One change, already under way, is allowing the use of video recordings of complainants’ interviews with police and a videoed cross-examination for which only barristers and the judge are present. Finally, we must seek to understand the underlying causes, including by speaking to perpetrators – despite their frequent reluctance to engage, lack of repentance and keenness to blame and denigrate their victims. Much discussion has focused on the race of offenders and victims in grooming cases. Though the abusers in this case were mainly non-white, they came from diverse backgrounds, including Turkish and eastern European. Most of their victims were white, but were targeted “because they were young, impressionable, naïve, and vulnerable.” Nor did concerns about perceived racism affect the official response, as has been reported elsewhere. Mr Spicer places the potential relevance of cultural factors alongside questions about their profiles, motivations and background influences in his call for research into perpetrators. No factor should be left unconsidered; but nor should anyone lock on to a simplistic focus. His report shows just how complex the problem is. Listening to victims is crucial. But we also need to look for them, to support them, and to work to prevent such crimes in the first place."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/24/the-resistance-now-march-washington-gun-solutions","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-24T14:00:17Z","webTitle":"Hopes for half a million to march for 'commonsense' gun solutions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/24/the-resistance-now-march-washington-gun-solutions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/feb/24/the-resistance-now-march-washington-gun-solutions","fields":{"headline":"Hopes for half a million to march for 'commonsense' gun solutions","bodyText":"Marching for our lives Organizers believe up to 500,000 people could travel to Washington DC on 24 March to demand action on gun control. March for Our Lives, organized by the new #NeverAgain movement – founded by survivors of the Florida school shooting – has applied for a permit for half a million people in the capital, the Washington Post reported on Friday. Seventeen people – 14 students and three teachers – were killed in the shooting at the school. About 100 students attended a rally at the Florida state capitol in Tallahassee on Wednesday. The Washington march will be supported by more than 50 “sister marches” in cities across the US. So far 85,000 people have expressed interest in the DC event – and more than 40,000 in New York City. Sofie Whitney, one of the three founders of the #NeverAgain movement that on Sunday announced the march, said the students were simply seeking “commonsense” solutions to gun control. “We don’t need a full bill to be written overnight but we need some action, we need them to begin helping us make the change,” Whitney, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school, told the Guardian this week. The new activists from Stoneman Douglas who have spoken out broadly want a ban on assault weapons such as the one used in the attack, and fiercely oppose Donald Trump’s proposal to arm teachers. A mission statement on the March for Our Lives website sets out exactly why the mass rallies are necessary: School safety is not a political issue. There cannot be two sides to doing everything in our power to ensure the lives and futures of children who are at risk of dying when they should be learning, playing, and growing. The mission and focus of March For Our Lives is to demand that a comprehensive and effective bill be immediately brought before Congress to address these gun issues. No special interest group, no political agenda is more critical than timely passage of legislation to effectively address the gun violence issues that are rampant in our country. March for Our Lives has raised more than $2m as of Friday. The group have compiled a list of all the demonstrations here. What we’re reading At Newsweek, Ryan Sit explains why the NRA is so powerful – but also “why gun control advocates have reason for hope”. The NRA is adept at “mobilizing its base (it boasts a membership of 5 million) against candidates it deems a threat”, Sit writes. But the hope comes from a growing public support for stricter gun control, and the growing number of people who view the NRA unfavorably. While there are encouraging signs, “true change” on guns will be “a long haul”, says AJ Willingham at CNN. Willingham praises the work of the Stoneman Douglas students and others who have spoken about the need for stricter gun control, but she warns that what happens next will not be easy. Students and activists will be targets for abuse from the right, and it will take a lot of work to effect change. But Willingham says that the general response to students’ efforts so far shows that “for now the near future looks promising”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2018/feb/26/explosion-fatal-rubbish-landslide-mozambique-hulene-dump","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T11:50:29Z","webTitle":"Living and dying on a rubbish dump: the landfill collapse in Mozambique | Shaun Swingler","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/feb/26/explosion-fatal-rubbish-landslide-mozambique-hulene-dump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/feb/26/explosion-fatal-rubbish-landslide-mozambique-hulene-dump","fields":{"headline":"Living and dying on a rubbish dump: the landfill collapse in Mozambique","bodyText":"Last Monday at 3am, rain pummelled Mozambique’s capital. The country has a notorious wet season and in recent weeks many residents had complained of the high rainfall. In Hulene, an impoverished neighbourhood 10km from the city centre, lies the Hulene dump: a 17-hectare (42-acre) mountain of rubbish that towers 15 metres above the people who have made their homes on its fringes. “It was late and the rain was pouring down, but I was woken up by something that sounded like an explosion,” says Paulina Cosa, a resident of the settlement. The overnight downpour set off an avalanche of rubbish that consumed more than 10 houses on its periphery, killing 16 people and wounding six others. A mother and her newborn baby were among the casualties. “We came out and heard some people screaming, we didn’t know what was happening,” says Maria Jose, who lives less than 100 metres from the collapse. “When we went to investigate we found that the waste had come down to the houses and a lot of people were among it, trying to dig it up and rescue their families.” “A lot of people came out to help,” says Joao Mucavele, the city’s director of health and cemeteries. “People from the municipality, from all over the neighbourhood and from the Red Cross, gave a helping hand.” Recovery operations have now stopped and, three days after the collapse, earth-moving equipment pushes back the mounds of rubbish to reclaim the 100 or so metres of land that was swallowed up by the detritus. “We are now working to return the waste to where it came from,” says Mucavele. “The people who were living here will be given help, but no one can live here from now on.” In the interim, Mucavele says, all residents at the site of the collapse have been relocated to a temporary shelter in the Ferroviario neighbourhood, about 30 minutes south of the dump. Hulene rubbish dump is an assault on the senses. The smell of two decades of a city’s waste lingers long after you’ve left the site, and the vast pools of stagnant water mean the air is thick with mosquitoes. The swampy roads in and out are difficult to navigate. But the dump provides its residents with a source of income in one of the most impoverished areas of the city, in a country where almost half of the population lives below the poverty line. Peri-urban waste picking is a common livelihood across the continent, where people remain tied to informal economies and receive little social or economic protection. Cosa, who has lived at the dump since 1994, makes her living collecting recyclable items. She says she sells them to Chinese recycling buyers and earns around 6p a day. A lack of adequate housing to meet the high demand in Maputo, the country’s economic hub, has also driven people to set up homes around the dump. The Hulene neighbourhood underwent a population boom during the Mozambican civil war from 1977 to 1992. People fleeing the war in rural areas further north came to seek refuge in urban centres like Maputo. “The collapse speaks to issues of poverty and urban planning,” Matthew Cochrane, a Red Cross spokesman, told CNN. “Those affected are the poorest of the poor. They have no choice but to live there, and when there’s heavy rain, they’re the ones who find themselves on the front line.” Maria Jose’s house was not damaged in the landslide, so she has not yet been relocated. She was born in Hulene dump and has lived there most of her life. Since the collapse, she has decided to move away as the risk is too great for her and her one-year-old child. “The conditions are terrible with the diseases, the mosquitoes, and now this,” she says. “We can’t stay here any more, it’s too difficult to handle this situation.” A local environmental activism group, Livaningo, has been campaigning for 15 years for the closure of the dump because they say it is operating far above its capacity, creating dangerous living conditions. “What happened on Monday we’ve been telling the government would happen for years,” says Manuel Cardoso, an activist at Livaningo. “We don’t think they see solving this problem that’s been around since 2001 as a priority. They have to be held responsible for their inaction.” In 2013, after pressure from numerous groups, the city government agreed to close the Hulene rubbish dump and relocate it to Matlemele, in the neighbouring city of Matola. However, the relocation never happened. The city blamed budget constraints. Since the collapse at Hulene, the city has re-energised its efforts to relocate the dump. However, Mucavele says a number of people are illegally occupying the Matlemele site, halting progress. According to Mucavele it will cost $16m (£11.4m) to relocate these people, and an additional $15m to relocate Hulene dump. He says there has been a plan and fiscal timeline implemented for this relocation but was unable to answer how long the relocation will take. In the interim, local government has agreed to cover the victim’s funeral costs. At a state-sponsored funeral on Thursday, eight victims were buried at Santa Isabel cemetery, 45 minutes north of Maputo. There were about 500 people in attendance, and it rained intermittently throughout the service. Funeral goers sheltered under umbrellas and a gazebo, both from the rain and from the harsh sun that intermittently peaked through the clouds. In attendance was the governor of Maputo City, Iolanda Cintura. In her speech she apologised for the tragedy: “The people of Maputo are in mourning. On behalf of the government, in my own name we apologise to the Uamusse, Ngovene, Thousene, Mondlane and Bendene families for what happened. We expect everybody to help all these families to recover their hope.” In response to the loss of life, opposition parties have been quick to condemn the government. In a press conference on Wednesday, Augusto Mbazo, the deputy head of the Democratic Movement of Mozambique, called for the resignation of David Simango, Maputo’s mayor, suggesting he “no longer has the moral right to remain mayor”. One of Simango’s main promises during his 2013 re-election campaign was to close down Hulene dump. “What we are looking for now is how we can help these families find justice,” says Cardoso, an environmental activist. “Where is the responsibility of the government?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/feb/26/cannabis-marijuana-parties-legal-weed","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T08:01:07Z","webTitle":"Pot parties: how legalized weed is fueling new kinds of fun","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/26/cannabis-marijuana-parties-legal-weed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/feb/26/cannabis-marijuana-parties-legal-weed","fields":{"headline":"Pot parties: how legalized weed is fueling new kinds of fun","bodyText":"Coco Ono, wearing only hot pants and pot-leaf pasties, prepared an overstuffed and dripping peanut butter sandwich and suggestively ate it on stage. In front of a less supportive crowd, her cabaret performance would risk being unwatchable. But on this night, the crowd – and almost everyone on stage – was high. The show, part of a marijuana-themed comedy and burlesque night I recently attended in Los Angeles, took place in a jewel box performance space behind a bar. In keeping with the logistical hurdles these events still face, the “medicating room”, where sponsoring brands provided samples, was across a parking lot. A touch awkwardly, it was a few doors down from a busy Alcoholics Anonymous storefront. The novelty of a pot-centric night out can foment onstage pandering – see Coco Ono’s unusual act – while other performers clearly consider a stoned audience a chance to phone it in. Perhaps most of the pleasure was just the opportunity for cannabis users to gather in public. As one performer, Ashley Hayward, put it: “It feels good to not have to hide how stoned you are.” While nine US states and Washington DC have legalized recreational weed, none of them officially allow “social use” establishments – bars or cafes where a visitor can sit down and light a joint. Unofficially, they’re around, but tend to function more as social clubs for industry professionals than public venues. It’s hardly novel to sneak a spliff on a night out. But as cannabis consumption shifts from the alley around the corner to the center of the dancefloor, it’s fostering new kinds of grownup fun, where alcohol, which can drag on a high, is relegated to a supporting role, if it’s present at all. (Instead, many cannabis users prefer caffeine, which keeps you alert and produces a tingling in the hindbrain.) Alcohol and nightlife are practically synonymous, and have been, in much of the world, forever. Booze is versatile. It settles nerves on a first date, instills confidence and relieves the tedium at gala dinners. Marijuana is a more finicky psychoactive. It can amplify awkwardness and foster paranoia. Pot parties are most likely to fall short when organizers assume any activity which complements alcohol will work as well with cannabis. Alcohol dulls the senses, while cannabis enhances them, says Jane West, a cannabis lifestyle maven in Denver. Many of the best cannabis events are sensory-rich experiences. One of west’s early successes was “Classically Cannabis”, a 420-friendly concert by the Colorado Symphony. Similarly, Grassfed, the events company, has been successful with a virtual reality night, and with a listening party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Beatles’ Sgt Pepper. “With cannabis you have to create more of an experience,” says Crystal Bauer-Feldman, founder of the cannabis party company Arcane Revelry in Portland, Oregon. “You have to be more sensitive to people’s needs.” A recent Arcane Revelry event featured a chocolate fountain, a functional bong ice sculpture and a violinist who accompanied three dancers painted as Earth, Fire and Storm. In one area, brief, non-creepy rubdowns were on offer. Those on a more restrictive budget can achieve more or less the same effect with Legos and finger paint somewhere with a food truck in the vicinity. As a trend, cannabis-centric entertainment is still in its early days. But cannabis supercharged by modern marketing tactics probably represents the most significant threat to the alcohol business since there has been an alcohol business. While cannabis remains stigmatized in many communities, it possesses booze’s ability to transcend barriers of race and class. Last year, for the first time, dispensaries in the posh ski resort of Aspen, Colorado, outsold the town’s liquor stores. Alexandre Ricard, chairman of the liquor giant Pernod-Ricard, recently said the company had not noticed an impact of legalization on sales but that it was following the situation. Its smaller rival Constellation has moved more aggressively. Last fall it spent $191m to acquire a 9.9% stake in Canopy Growth, one of Canada’s largest pot growers. In an industry obsessed with its own respectability, a mini-fad has emerged in which hosts try to impress guests with formal cannabis-infused dinner parties prepared by restaurant chefs. At one dinner I attended in a posh LA neighborhood, servers passed trays of THC-infused ceviche before the diners, most of them investors ready for priming, sat down to a meal of tuna tataki and then steak. One of the courses – I forget which – came garnished with a THC-infused caperberry. A small drone hovered overhead for some reason. Everyone got really high, but at least some of it was owing to how much money they planned to make in the green rush."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/24/david-ospina-wembley-rene-higuita-scorpion-kick-colombia-carabao-cup-final","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-24T22:30:04Z","webTitle":"David Ospina relishes Wembley calling and memories of hero Higuita","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/24/david-ospina-wembley-rene-higuita-scorpion-kick-colombia-carabao-cup-final","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/24/david-ospina-wembley-rene-higuita-scorpion-kick-colombia-carabao-cup-final","fields":{"headline":"David Ospina relishes Wembley calling and memories of hero Higuita","bodyText":"It is fair to say that Colombian goalkeepers have form when it comes to making an impression at Wembley Stadium. None, naturally, could be any larger than life than René Higuita, the extrovert formerly known as El Loco – the Madman – whose extravagant flourish during a friendly game against England in 1995 became the stuff of legend. When Jamie Redknapp scooped a relatively tame ball towards goal, Higuita flipped acrobatically, flinging his legs behind him to clear with a mid-air scorpion flick. Just for the kick of the trick. Back home in Medellín, a seven-year-old David Ospina watched the broadcast and felt a surge of pride that his compatriot, a local hero of goalkeeping, pulled off something so audacious. Of course, he was inspired by what he observed on the television. “We were delighted,” he recalls. “We talked about it a lot. It was great he did it at Wembley, too. For us Colombians Higuita is a really important figure. He did so much for the national team and the country. I have always had great respect for him, and it’s nice that he is remembered here for something special.” Summoning the spirit of Higuita might not be Arsène Wenger’s dream scenario for his chosen goalkeeper during Arsenal’s Carabao Cup final rendezvous with Manchester City on Sunday in that he wants his man to have the quietest, calmest day possible. “The crazy keeper,” Wenger smiles at the scorpion memory. “But I wouldn’t really be happy [to see Ospina try it]. It shows that football has changed. These kind of characters have disappeared from the game. With the importance of every single result, there is less room for this kind of improvisation and more individual responsibility on the players. “Some people have given their name to some technical movements that you would not dare to think about the possibility today. Like a Panenka in a European Championship final. These kind of things, you don’t see them any more because of the risk. The balance between creativity and risk has become in favour of ‘let’s be cool’.” Selecting Ospina over Petr Cech, Arsenal’s first-choice keeper, has not come with the controversy that used to be routine when a manager favoured what has now become known as the cup keeper for a showpiece match. “What is happening is that in big clubs now you cannot have only one top goalkeeper. You need two,” Wenger explains. “You cannot rest keepers any more in training, they have to work so hard. If you have no good second goalkeeper you cannot win any trophy. If you want two top-class goalkeepers, you have to give them games or they don’t stay. So that’s why I think it is important. “In my head Ospina is not definitely a number two because he is in a fight with Cech. For me he is a world-class goalkeeper who is unfortunately at the moment my number two.” Ospina considers this his lot. The final against City will be his 12th start of the season, all in cup matches (he missed another three potential outings through injury). “You always want to be the number one,” Ospina stresses, “but you have to respect what the situation is at the club and I have huge respect for Petr.” Last season Cech looked on as Ospina relished the experience of winning the FA Cup final against Chelsea, so being the cup keeper does have its rewards. “Of course, everybody wants to play as regularly as they can but in my situation it’s a question of always being fully prepared and we will be for the final. I always love playing at Wembley. It’s the kind of atmosphere you want to experience. City are excellent, no doubt. They have an outstanding group of players who have done things very well through the season. But our focus will be on what we do well and how we can achieve what we want to.” It is a bizarre quirk of this cup run that Arsenal will have played against former or current Manchester City reserve keepers in every round of the competition: Doncaster’s Ian Lawlor, Norwich’s Angus Gunn, West Ham’s Joe Hart, Chelsea’s Willy Caballero and – finally in City colours – Ederson’s back-up man, Claudio Bravo. Ospina has played against Bravo several times. “We faced each other in a semi-final at the Copa América, and that time Chile came out on top. I hope this match will go my way, but otherwise I will always wish him the best,” he says. Not being the tallest goalkeeper, Ospina trusts in his shot-stopping and understands why some improvisation comes with the territory. “It is hard to generalise but some of us are aware that sometimes goalkeepers are judged on their stature, how tall they are, and if you are closer to an average height, you learn how to compensate with other strengths and make the most of those.” Like good footwork? “It’s something you work at, and look at how you can make it work for the way the team plays.” This is a notable game in Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s strange, embryonic Arsenal career, in which he has not found it too easy to gel with his new team recently as they played in the Europa League while he is ineligible. “It’s not ideal,” says Wenger. “We took advantage of the last two weeks to build him up physically. Our target on Sunday will be to find him two or three times each half in dangerous positions because he is sharp now.” Whether leading the line, in goal or anywhere in between, Arsenal will be looking for a cup hero."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/feb/26/uk-small-abattoirs-struggle-as-profit-margins-are-squeezed","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T06:00:05Z","webTitle":"UK's small abattoirs struggle as profit margins are squeezed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/26/uk-small-abattoirs-struggle-as-profit-margins-are-squeezed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/feb/26/uk-small-abattoirs-struggle-as-profit-margins-are-squeezed","fields":{"headline":"UK's small abattoirs struggle as profit margins are squeezed","bodyText":"Locally sourced meat, one of the cornerstones of modern sustainable eating, may soon be out of reach for consumers across the UK as large numbers of small suppliers are forced to close down. Seeking out local meat, vegetables and other food products is increasingly embraced as part of a healthier diet that reduces environmental impact, allows clear traceability and improves farm welfare. Independent shops and restaurants often pride themselves on stocking such items, while farmers’ markets, farm shops, food stalls and similar amenities used by tourists and locals alike rely on them. But a study has found that small abattoirs are struggling harder than ever to survive, leaving more of the country’s meat supply concentrated in the hands of a small number of mega-producers. More than a third of small abattoirs have closed in the past decade, leaving only 63 in England, down from 96 in 2007. In 1970 there were about 1,900 abattoirs in the UK. The reasons, according to the Sustainable Food Trust, are high costs and squeezed profit margins, despite healthy demand for the products. Transporting small numbers of farm animals to be slaughtered, and then back to the farm of origin for traceability purposes, is more expensive than sending them to a larger abattoir where they will be amalgamated with other carcases from around the country. The regulations governing smaller abattoirs are also onerous, because they were designed with large facilities in mind. Many struggle with the paperwork, and in an uncertain regulatory and economic environment are finding it hard to carry on. Bigger abattoirs are also often built or expanded with the aid of government grants or tax breaks, which smaller ones miss out on. This expansion can also create over-capacity, driving the smaller out of business. In its report, entitled A Good Life And A Good Death: Re-localising Farm Animal Slaughter, the trust calls on the government to put support mechanisms in place to preserve and build on what remains of the local abattoir sector, to capture the growing market for traceable, local and high-welfare meat. One of the measures suggested is allowing mobile abattoirs, which would remove the need for animals and carcases to be transported to and fro, and small static abattoirs sited on farms. Mobile units are already in use in other parts of the EU, showing they can be managed within a tight regulatory framework. The authors also call for a taskforce to be set up to examine the problem, and a clear statement of support from ministers that would require civil servants to incorporate the survival of small abattoirs into policy measures. Richard Young, policy director of the SFT and an organic farmer, said he had been forced to change abattoirs nine times in 30 years, meaning he now has to transport animals 40 miles for slaughter. He said: “Local abattoirs play a vital role in all rural communities where farm animals are kept. When they close, both animals and meat have to be transported much further [which] is bad for animal welfare and the environment, and threatens the ongoing renaissance of local food cultures.” The report’s authors also noted that UK taxpayers have provided the grants and investment for farmers to diversify into opening farm shops and supplying farmers’ markets, but this has not been accompanied by the investment in local slaughter without which locally sourced meat is often impossible. Last week, the government took the first legislative steps to put CCTV into all abattoirs, following a string of revelations of poor practice and hygiene breaches in some larger facilities. At the National Farmers’ Union conference the environment secretary, Michael Gove, also spoke strongly in favour of British farming post-Brexit, while the Labour party has also set out its rural and animal welfare strategy. However, as the Guardian revealed last year, mega-farms in the US style are on the rise across Britain, including facilities housing thousands of animals reared almost entirely indoors. British farmers may come under increasing pressure to move away from smaller family farms to huge animal-rearing facilities, in a future after Brexit. Tracy Worcester, of Farms Not Factories, urged the government to protect small and medium scale farms and slaughterhouses to help ensure UK food security. Richard Griffiths, chief executive of the British Poultry Council, said his sector was also seeing small facilities close and called for ministers to provide financial support in the form of tax allowances to help producers invest in new infrastructure . Phil Stocker, chief executive of the National Sheep Association, said the government should pay attention “before it is too late” for the diminishing network of local abattoirs. The Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs did not respond to a request for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/23/liverpool-west-ham-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T17:09:28Z","webTitle":"Liverpool v West Ham United: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/23/liverpool-west-ham-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/23/liverpool-west-ham-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Liverpool v West Ham United: match preview","bodyText":"David Moyes has never won in 14 visits to Anfield as manager, losing seven and drawing seven, and his prospects of guiding West Ham to back-to-back league victories for the first time since December 2016 appear slim given the sensational form of Liverpool’s forwards, fresh from a warm-weather training trip to Marbella.

The fine – which Chappell said he could not pay because he had “no funds” – comes on top of a demand from the Pensions Regulator (TPR) for £10m to help plug the hole in BHS’s pension fund. Thrice-bankrupt Chappell, 51, bought the high street chain from the billionaire Sir Philip Green for just £1 in March 2015. The company crashed just 13 months later with the loss of about 11,000 jobs and 164 stores. TPR, which has a responsibility to safeguard pensions, moved to protect the pensions of 19,000 members. Just days after the company collapsed, Chappell was ordered to hand over hundreds of documents in relation to the £571m pension blackhole at BHS. When he failed to comply, TPR charged Chappell with neglecting or refusing to respond to three section 72 notices to provide information and documents in April and May 2016 and in February 2017. In the first prosecution of its kind, Chappell of Blandford Forum, Dorset, was hauled before a court last month. He was found guilty of all three charges and faced a maximum sentence of an unlimited fine for failing to comply with the notices. Chappell appeared at Barkingside magistrates court where he was fined £15,000 each for the first two charges (£30,000) and £20,000 for the last charge, with £37,430.84 court costs. He had earlier told the court: “I have no funds as it stands.” He said there was a perception he had “made millions out of BHS” but he had actually been left almost penniless by the collapse. Alex Stein, prosecuting, said Chappell claimed he had no assets whatsoever other than a share in a property. Chappell was asked to give evidence in the witness box under oath over his wealth and assets. He told the court he had a monthly income of about £2,700-£3,000 acting as a consultant to a small cosmetics company. But he claimed he had extensive outgoings, of almost £9,000. This was made up of: £3,800 a month rent on his Dorset home; £2,666 a month leasing a 2017-plate Range Rover; and £2,500 a month school fees for his two children, aged eight and 12, on which he was in arrears. He told the court: “I’m an entrepreneur. It’s the nature of the business. There are boom times and slack times. This is a slack period where I have huge amounts of cash flooding out of the door in relation to legal fees. “I have no way of paying a large fine at the moment but I could speak to people to borrow a loan.” He said he had endeavoured to fully comply with the TPR requests for information and documents and had spent about £250,000 in legal fees in the wake of the BHS collapse. The fine comes just weeks after Chappell, a former racing driver, was handed a formal demand for £10m from TPR as it attempted to plug the failed retailer’s pension fund. The TPR has already agreed a deal with Sir Philip Green that he should pay £363m towards the pension deficit. District judge Gary Lucie said: “He is not being sentenced in any way for the collapse of BHS or the pension funds, just the failure of him to comply with demands over the pension funds.” He said the court must send a message “to those in positions of power” that a failure to comply with TPR demands would lead to a substantial penalty. He said: “There was a complete lack of remorse on Mr Chappell’s part. The fine should therefore reflect that. In my view there has not been full and frank disclosure of his means. I’m not impressed by the lack of detail.” The judge proposed he pay £2,500 per calendar month. If Chappell does not have the means to pay the fine, it could lead to him being declared bankrupt for the fourth time. Nicola Parish, of the TPR, said: “We prosecuted Dominic Chappell because, despite numerous requests, he failed to provide us with information we required in connection with our investigation into the sale and ultimate collapse of BHS. “Choosing not to comply with our section 72 notices has now left him with a criminal record and a bill of £50,000, both of which he could have avoided if he had simply done what was required of him.” After the case, Chappell’s lawyer, Michael Levy, said the businessman was appealing against his conviction on three charges of failing to provide documents to the TPR."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/shortcuts/2018/feb/23/i-added-a-few-queeny-touches-richard-quinn-the-designer-who-had-her-majesty-in-the-frow","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T18:04:30Z","webTitle":"‘I added a few Queeny touches’: Richard Quinn – the designer who had Her Majesty in the frow","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2018/feb/23/i-added-a-few-queeny-touches-richard-quinn-the-designer-who-had-her-majesty-in-the-frow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/shortcuts/2018/feb/23/i-added-a-few-queeny-touches-richard-quinn-the-designer-who-had-her-majesty-in-the-frow","fields":{"headline":"‘I added a few Queeny touches’: Richard Quinn – the designer who had Her Majesty in the frow","bodyText":"How often does the head of state attend London fashion week? Never, until last Wednesday, when the Queen made her first ever appearance on the front row, aged 91, at designer Richard Quinn’s autumn show – primarily to present the inaugural Queen Elizabeth II award for British design, based on “value to the community and/or strong sustainable policies”. Quinn, whose wearing of a baseball cap, grey T-shirt and plaid shirt at the event led to him being described as a “scruffy prick” on Twitter, says Her Majesty was “lovely, nice and friendly”. As front rows go, Quinn’s was quite the tableau: wearing a duck-egg blue suit (someone’s a fan of current season Loewe), HM sat on a special cushion placed on her Lucite chair in between Anna Wintour, editor of US Vogue, in sunglasses, Caroline Rush, chair of the British Fashion Council, and the Queen’s personal wardrobe advisor, Angela Kelly, all flanked by a small pool of security. Quinn was given the heads up and signed a non-disclosure agreement a few weeks before the show – enough time to “add a few Queeny touches”, he says, pointing towards the headscarves and excess of florals in a section known as the Balmoral segment. Having originally designed about 20 different looks, he added a further 10. Otherwise, the collection was pure Quinn, barrelling from floral bodysuits to oversized padded jackets plastered in florals, to plissé skirts and foil gowns, inspired by 1960s designer Paul Harris. The Queen was most amused by the bodysuits and ballgowns, although her reaction to the models who emerged in floral biker helmets was less readable. Quinn was a plum choice for the award. A print-maker and 2016 MA graduate of Central Saint Martins’, last spring he opened a textile print space in Peckham, south London, near his father’s scaffolding company. His work visits the idea of “transforming a woman into a textile” by covering her in prints. But printing digital textiles requires facilities, so the designer, horrified by the cost, decided to create an open-access, cost-effective studio where students and fellow designers could do this. Impressively, fame has yet to change Quinn. To celebrate the show, he planned a trip to the fast food chain Five Guys and, in the days that followed, stuck to his routine of visiting the bakery above his studio – although he admits a slight sense of disappointment that he did “not get a free coffee”. Concerning the baseball cap, he says: “Obviously, I care about meeting the Queen, but I think it’s more endearing to wear what you feel comfortable in.” As for the burning question of designing Meghan Markle’s wedding dress? “No,” he says. “You saw the helmets.” • This article was amended on 26 February 2018.

Directed by Adina Pintilie, Touch Me Not was picked ahead of 18 other films, including Wes Anderson’s Isle of Dogs and Utoya July 22, by a jury headed by German director Tom Tykwer, best known for Run Lola Run. Based around an English woman’s attempt to overcome her intimacy issues, and ranging across everything from disability to sex clubs, Touch Me Not blends fiction and documentary and is Pintilie’s first feature film. The runner-up grand jury prize went to Mug (AKA Twarz), from Polish director Małgorzata Szumowska, about a building worker who needs a face transplant after a gruesome accident. Guardian critic Peter Bradshaw described it as “a strange, engaging film – well and potently acted and directed”, delving as it does in questions of national identity that are currently convulsing Poland. Isle of Dogs was not completely ignored by the jury however: Anderson was given a Silver Bear for best director for his stop-motion animation about a pack of dogs living in a dystopian near-future Japan, which the Guardian’s Jonathan Romney said “shows an indefatigably fertile imagination letting rip in inimitable style” in a four-star review. Bill Murray, who voices one of the dogs, accepted the award on Anderson’s behalf. The two Silver Bears for acting went to Ana Brun, star of The Heiresses, a Paraguayan film directed by Marcelo Martinessi about two apparently-prosperous women in a lesbian relationship who run into financial troubles, and Anthony Bajon as a junkie trying to beat his addiction in a priest-run retreat in the Cédric Kahn-directed drama The Prayer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"science/2018/mar/04/starwatch-spectacular-line-up-of-three-bright-planets","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T21:30:16Z","webTitle":"Starwatch: spectacular line-up of three bright planets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/04/starwatch-spectacular-line-up-of-three-bright-planets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/mar/04/starwatch-spectacular-line-up-of-three-bright-planets","fields":{"headline":"Starwatch: spectacular line-up of three bright planets","bodyText":"Early risers may have already noticed the beautiful planetary alignment taking place in the south-east before dawn. The bright planets of Saturn, Mars and Jupiter are strung out in a line. Saturn sits in Sagittarius, Mars in Ophiuchus and Jupiter in Libra. The colours of the planets are particularly notable. Jupiter’s bright clouds give it a brilliant white light, whereas Mars is distinctly red to the eye. Completing the trio, Saturn is a pale yellow that betrays the more muted tones found in its atmosphere.

Theresa May summoned her senior ministers for a well-publicised eight-hour meeting at Chequers where they supposedly thrashed out an agreed position on Brexit. There was definitely a lot of thrashing about; I’m not persuaded that they have actually come to a sustainable agreement. To rather less fanfare, Jeremy Corbyn sequestered the shadow cabinet at an officially undisclosed location for their own Brexit summit. Of the two meetings, it is the one that has attracted much less media attention – the Labour gathering on Monday – which looks to be much the more significant. The undisclosed location of Labour’s gathering was, in fact, a room with a table in parliament. The “awayday” was not really away and it did not take a day. The meeting was important because, after weeks of tortuous internal debate, the official opposition is finally moving towards a new and much less ambiguous position. This is to commit to Britain remaining within a customs union with the EU after Brexit. It is a development with potentially huge consequences for the future of Brexit and the rather less important matter of the future of Mrs May. In combination with Tory rebels, the opposition will now threaten a major defeat on the government. If the government loses, that Chequers meeting will be made redundant. If defeat triggers a leadership crisis, Mrs May might also be made redundant. There has always been a natural majority in the Commons for remaining within some form of customs union. The bulk of MPs understand this is the only plausible way of achieving the continuation of “frictionless” trade the government claims to aspire to. Most MPs also believe a customs union would do a lot to mitigate the economic damage of Brexit; the government’s own impact analysis agrees. The idea is popular with businesses, trades unionists and, polls suggest, voters. The people who hate it are the Brexit ultras, the 62 Tory MPs in Jacob Rees-Mogg’s gang. They generate a lot of noise and attract an inordinate amount of attention – as when they sent their menacing “ransom note” to the prime minister – but they are wildly unrepresentative of opinion in parliament. The majority in favour of a customs union has struggled to find a way to express itself. Mrs May set her face against it, not least because she was too frightened of confronting the ultras and not smart enough to reach across the aisle to Labour MPs. Mr Corbyn, a career-long Eurosceptic, has had a watery position, much to the anguish of colleagues on the Labour backbenches and in the shadow cabinet who have been yearning for him to lead opposition to hard Brexit. What has happened to change the mind of the Labour leader? Or to “evolve” his position, as the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, likes to put it? Things have been brought to a head by gathering backbench support for amendments to the Brexit legislation, tabled by the Tory MP Anna Soubry, which instruct the government to negotiate a customs union. When I first drew your attention to the potential for the government to be defeated on this issue, I remarked that it would look mighty strange if Mr Corbyn were to try to whip his MPs to vote with the hard Brexiters against the wishes of most of his own party. He has clearly come to the same conclusion. Remaining within a customs union is popular with Labour members and voters. Labour supporters would also prefer to stay within the single market by a margin of more than four to one. The Labour leader may distrust opinion polls, but he can see that the numbers on this one are too large to be ignored. The issue of the Irish border has played an increasingly prominent part in Labour’s internal debates and the more so since Brextremists started their reckless talk about ripping up the Good Friday agreement. Members of the shadow cabinet tell me this has been particularly influential on Mr Corbyn. Hard Brexit means the return of a hard border. A customs union goes a very long way to resolving that otherwise intractable problem. On top of which, the Labour leader has been presented with a chance to defeat the government, an opportunity that is just too tempting to squander. It is significant that he is taking full ownership of Labour’s shift – sorry, “evolution” – by announcing it himself. Last summer, when Labour took its first step in this direction, he left the announcement to Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary. This raised doubts about how truly committed the leader was to the tilt towards a softer Brexit. Unless there is some last-minute change of heart, he will be stamping his name on it this time. Labour is now putting down amendments to the Brexit legislation that parallel the amendments backed by Tory rebels. Though the wording is slightly different, the central thrust is the same. Both sets of amendments tell the government to remain within a customs union. So if the opposition frontbench doesn’t get its amendments selected, then the ground is prepared for Labour to mobilise its MPs in support of the Soubry versions. Something similar happened before Christmas. The opposition parties came in behind the amendment by Dominic Grieve, the former Tory attorney general, which successfully insisted that parliament be given a meaningful vote on the ultimate Brexit deal. That was a good evening for parliamentary sovereignty and a blow for Mrs May. The Tory whips are frightened that they are now facing an even more serious defeat. Consider the arithmetic. When Mrs May can get all Tory MPs into the same voting lobby and the DUP joins them, she has an effective majority of 13 over the combined opposition parties. So it can take just seven Tory MPs to vote with the opposition to defeat the government. There is a tiny minority of Labour MPs, among them the strange bedfellows of Kate Hoey and Dennis Skinner, who are hard Brexiters. More Tory rebels are needed to counterbalance them. A dozen Tory MPs voted with the opposition in that pre-Christmas defeat of the government. As things look, the Tory rebels have at least that number. Five former ministers and two of the party’s select committee chairs have already signed up and the rebels are predicting the support of at least 20 Conservative MPs. The Tory whips have done the maths and they don’t like the result. I can say that because I can smell that the government’s business managers are in a panic. To swerve an imminent vote, the report stages of the trade and customs legislation have been kicked back until after Easter. The thinking must be that this gives the Tory whips additional time to try to beg and bludgeon potential rebels to fall into line. We can also expect a bullying barrage from the Brexit press against “mutineers” and “saboteurs”, though when that was attempted last time it had the effect of strengthening the conviction of the Tory rebels and cementing their comradeship. There is even talk that the government is running so scared that it will seek to delay the critical votes until after the local council elections in May. That would be designed to avoid the scenario in which Mrs May goes down to a humiliating parliamentary defeat and is then plunged into a leadership crisis in the run-up to those polls. But there is no certainty that the landscape will look more promising for the prime minister after the spring elections. Tories are already adopting the brace position in expectation that they are going to be routed in Remain-supporting metropolitan areas, especially London, where some polling has suggested that they could lose “flagship” councils, even Wandsworth, which has been blue for 40 years. If the Conservatives are smashed in the coming elections, it will strengthen the pro-European Tories in their conviction that it is fatally misguided for their party as well as for the country to pursue a hard Brexit. So forget Chequers. Mrs May’s “awayday” will likely struggle to be even a footnote in the histories of this saga. The big Brexit crunch is going to be in parliament. Which is exactly where it should be. •Andrew Rawnsley is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/feb/25/lake-district-zip-wire-glorified-theme-park","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T00:04:07Z","webTitle":"Lake District Notebook: ‘There’ll be no zip wire across the icy waters, no screams from on high’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/25/lake-district-zip-wire-glorified-theme-park","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/feb/25/lake-district-zip-wire-glorified-theme-park","fields":{"headline":"Lake District Notebook: ‘There’ll be no zip wire across the icy waters, no screams from on high’","bodyText":"On a crowded island like Britain, encountering absolute silence is rare. But one place where true tranquility can be guaranteed for the foreseeable future is in Cumbria’s north lakes, on the shores of Thirlmere. Plans to stretch eight of the longest zip wire rides in the country across its icy waters, highlighted in the Observer, were abandoned last week to the unbridled delight of many locals. Zip wire advocates had argued the landscape should be opened up for everyone and not “preserved in aspic”. The Lakes, said opponents, should offer a place of escape and peace. The small-C conservatives won the day. On Friday afternoon, close to Thirlmere’s south shore, a relieved Susi Wood, the valley’s 68-year-old lay minister, said the threat of “sound violence” had left locals absolutely horrified. Wood arrived in the Thirlmere valley four months ago from Teeside and said her new workplace epitomised the humble earthiness of its congregration. Her tiny church, perched close to the lake, has no electricity or heating. In the candlelight, with the wind howling off Wythburn Fell, you can almost touch the silence. Wood has decided to host a celebration of mountains and their serene, silent majesty next month. Away from the thrum of the A591, the valley has long taken pride in being removed from the tourist hubs of Grasmere, Ambleside and Windermere. “Thirlmere is remarkably unspoilt, there [are not] many places left in the Lakes so quiet. The zip wire would have demolished it permanently,” she said . At the lakeside Swirls car park, where the zip wire landing platform was to be sited, a scattering of walkers were busy preparing for their rambles. Retired couple June Slater, 70, and Stephen Jenkinson, 60, paused briefly to gaze across the black waters above which the zip wires would have swung. “This place shouldn’t be turned into a glorified theme park,” said Slater. She claimed to have good reason to cherish the view. Born in London’s east end she had never witnessed first-hand the wild outdoors until she was nearly an adult. “I was 17 when I saw my first mountain, it was incredible.” Tying his bootlaces close by was retired 60-year-old police officer, Nick Southern, who has made a monthly pilgrimage to the Lakes for the past 45 years. Gesticulating to the snow-streaked hump of Helvellyn towering above, Southern said that the Lake District’s world heritage status – granted only last year – had been awarded for obvious reasons. “I’ve been to the Alps, Himalayas, Andes and while I wouldn’t say they are as good as the Andes, they’re not bad.” But some at Swirls were disappointed. Dave Hatter, 47, and his son Hayden, 13, had driven 190 miles from Redditch, West Midlands, and both were “gutted” the zip wire wouldn’t be happening. “It would be another reason to come here. I know some people say it would take away from its beauty. But we would have loved it,” said Dave. Budding photographer Hayden, a hunky Nikon dangling from his neck, nodded enthusiastically. Beside A BT van parked nearby, Chan Singh was taking selfies as a low sun burst from behind black clouds. The 32-year-old from Preston said the car park offered one of his favourite views but was ambivalent about the zip wire. “Personally, I can’t see what was wrong with it,” he grinned, before embarking on another round of selfies. On the lower slopes of Helvellyn, England’s third highest mountain, data analyst Keith Bland was keen to point to a quirk of the Lakes. Sometimes walkers can hear the slightest noise in the valley hundreds of metres below. On still days, said Bland, you could even hear the laugh of people the size of dots sharing a joke. The 37-year-old shook his head: “Can you imagine being up here, hearing the screams of nutters flying across the lake?” Bland headed up the mountain and soon the only noise was the rustle of dead bracken. A lonely white truck raced along the A591 below. Then the wind picked up, whipping up waves across the lake, and all sound of human activity was lost on the breeze."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/feb/25/caresse-crosby-paris-society-1920s-hemingway-heart-is-a-burial-ground","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T07:00:14Z","webTitle":"The lost, wild world of Caresse Crosby, notorious queen of 1920s Paris society","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/25/caresse-crosby-paris-society-1920s-hemingway-heart-is-a-burial-ground","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/feb/25/caresse-crosby-paris-society-1920s-hemingway-heart-is-a-burial-ground","fields":{"headline":"The lost, wild world of Caresse Crosby, notorious queen of 1920s Paris society","bodyText":"She is credited with inventing the modern bra, launched Salvador Dali on the international arts scene and founded a publishing house for writers including Hemingway, Joyce and Faulkner. But the extraordinary life of Caresse Crosby, a notorious figure in 1920s bohemian Paris, has been largely forgotten. Now her remarkable story is being told, and in parts re-imagined, in a book written by her great-granddaughter, Tamara Colchester. “Caresse was someone I wanted to try to get to know beyond the myth – she was my great-grandmother, she’s alive in me,” says Colchester, who lives in West Sussex. The Heart is a Burial Ground, which has been eight years in the making, begins with a suicide. Caresse’s maverick husband Harry Crosby, a poet (and a banker) famously shot himself – and his mistress – at the Hotel des Artistes in New York. It was 1929 and he was 31. The book describes how “tattooed suns on the soles of his long, gentle feet gave the police cause to raise their eyebrows, but it was his ochre-painted toenails that really got them talking”. A wide-eyed, wild-spirited Bostonian (more Jim Morrison than Jay Gatsby) Crosby had chased and coveted Caresse, transforming her life, and much of Colchester’s book explores that emotional legacy. “There was always something incendiary about Harry. He had an otherworldly charisma, which had fascinated me growing up,” Colchester says. The book was intended as a biography, but when Colchester’s laptop was stolen, a year’s work was lost and she was forced to start again. That setback gave her an opportunity, she says, to turn the book into something that “it seemed to want to become”. “The voices were so alive, it really didn’t feel like me. It was like the characters were there, having it out with each other and I was just writing it down. It was quite a strange experience,” she recalls. The final version of The Heart is a Burial Ground shifts back and forth in time, weaving fact with fiction. Colchester, used the writings and recordings of Caresse as a starting point, but wanted to dig deeper into “what was not said, what we don’t know, what’s been too painful to talk about. I wanted to look at what happens when you live your life like Caresse. What’s the fallout?” Aged 21, Caresse kicked up a storm in high society Boston by ditching a rib-crushing corset for two handkerchiefs and a pink ribbon, sewn together. She secured a patent for the “backless brassiere” a year later and set up a business manufacturing them. (She later sold the design for $1,500 to Warner Brothers Corset Company, who are believed to have made millions from it.) “Even then, there was something in her essence that knew she wanted to be free,” says Colchester. “The bra was perfectly symbolic. Her breaking away from the restricted life that she’d been born into.” A one-time actress, Caresse met Harry in Boston while still married to her first husband, Richard Peabody, a first world war veteran with an obsession for fire engines. “He had a fire bell and a pole installed in his house,” says Colchester. The couple had two children together, but Caresse took them both to Paris to pursue a new life with Harry. “Imagine what it must have been like for a child growing up underneath this insane show,” says Colchester. Caresse and Harry’s Parisian exploits, usually involving parties, drugs and gambling were notorious. Black Sun Press, a small publishing house set up by the couple in 1927 (initially to print Harry’s own poems), was at the heart of a wild world of struggling expat writers and artists – the so-called lost generation. Print runs were small, but Black Sun printed works by, Anaïs Nin, DH Lawrence, James Joyce, Ernest Hemingway, Max Ernst, Salvador Dali, and many others. The publishing house printed extracts of Joyce’s Finnegans Wake. Joyce even, so the story goes, had to add a few extra lines to pad out the last page and make it look more beautiful. Yet Black Sun has been largely overlooked, forgotten even, by the modern literary world. “It’s a strange thing. It seems to have been bypassed by the cultural mainstream,” says Colchester. “It’s strange because Harry and Caresse are so rich as characters.” The Heart is a Burial Ground, by Tamara Colchester, is published by Simon &amp; Schuster on 8 March at £14.99.

He gestured towards the western end of Queens Crescent, the entrance of Weedington Road, prime turf for the gang that controls this corner of Camden, north London. There was, until quite recently, a police station nearby that functioned as a community hub. Officers would routinely patrol the neighbourhood, offering reassurance and a reliable stream of intelligence. But the station closed 18 months ago according to locals and since then the surrounding streets have been commandeered by gangs. Violence, said Ali, had spiralled during the ensuing period. “Now they are killing each other – it’s been made worse because they’ve started supplying heroin. They don’t even bother with cannabis any more,” said the 32-year-old, who works at his uncle’s grocery store, Banadir Gate. Ali belongs to the area’s sizeable Somali community, still traumatised by the violent scenes last week that saw two of its younger members killed on Camden’s streets. Sadiq Adan Mohamed, 20, was stabbed to death on Tuesday evening, 300 metres from Banadir Gate. Less than two hours earlier, Abdikarim Hassan, 17, was found fatally wounded in a nearby street. That followed the stabbing of a 16-year-old, who remains in hospital. Although an 18-year-old man has been arrested in Camden on suspicion of two counts of murder, a section 60 order remains in place across the borough, allowing officers to stop and search people “with good reason”. Already police have intercepted a number of young men carrying weapons. The police measure, under continual review, remains in place amid fear of reprisal attacks. Weedington Road had recently become bitterly contested “turf”, according to Ali, with youngsters from Queens Crescent clashing with those from nearby Agar Grove, Chalk Farm and Camden. Congolese teenagers had, he said, teamed up with Irish youngsters to take on the Somalis. “But the police just drive down here, look around and drive on. Since the police left us it’s been terrible,” said Ali, whose family fled Mogadishu and the country’s civil war in 2003. Other Somalis describe a “security vacuum” that has left them effectively abandoned by the police and, more broadly, the state. “Kids around here don’t feel safe, the police aren’t doing enough,” said Abshir Mohamed, whose parents also fled the Somali civil war for London in 1988. “There’s lots of money for Prevent [the government’s counter-radicalisation strategy] and for counter-terrorism which can target the Somali community, but then you have younger members of our community being targeted by knife crime. There’s a sense that Somalis are not being protected.” Mohamed, who is a youth volunteer for the Kentish Town Community Centre, and meets many of the area’s young Somalis, said trust in the police among youngsters had ebbed away. “If a young man gets threatened and he’s told: ‘The next time I see you I’ll stab you’, they don’t tell the police. They just carry a knife. They are not safe.” Mohamed said that Camden borough’s police commander had held a meeting in the community centre in the aftermath of Tuesday’s stabbings to address security concerns. “He said they had collected a lot of knives in the area through section 60, but when we asked them why didn’t they do more, he just said [there had been] funding cuts. Every time we ask why they don’t do more patrols around here, they just respond by saying cutbacks [were to blame].” Ismail Einashe, a journalist born in Somalia who used to live in Camden, said that such distrust was compounded by the sense that not only had the state failed to protect them, but that many felt the justice system too easily criminalised them. “And then you add austerity – cuts in youth services and police numbers – to the mix and you create a really toxic environment.” Mohamed, who also works as a primary school teacher in the area, said when he was growing up he looked forward to five-a-side football and adventure trips that were arranged to occupy them. “They were the good old days, now they’ve got nothing. There’s nothing for them to do anymore,” he said. A fear of being stabbed had also prevented many of the neighbourhood’s adults from confronting the youngsters who congregated in the area. Mohamed, 33, said many felt powerless. “If an adult tries to engage with a youth, they just pull out a knife. I’ve seen that with 10-year-olds. You can’t touch them,” said Mohamed. A young mother waiting at a local bus stop agreed. “We’ve ended up in a place where the kids have nowhere to go, they end up on the streets and that’s where the problems start,” she said, requesting anonymity as she gripped her young son’s hand. For Mohamed, a daily witness to the alienation facing many of London’s young British Somalis, there is, however, one silver lining. “Thank God we don’t have [many] guns in the UK.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/24/cheltenham-gold-cup-cue-card-colin-tizzard-ryanair-chase-festival-horse-racing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-24T16:44:08Z","webTitle":"No third Cheltenham Gold Cup tilt for Colin Tizzard’s Cue Card","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/24/cheltenham-gold-cup-cue-card-colin-tizzard-ryanair-chase-festival-horse-racing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/feb/24/cheltenham-gold-cup-cue-card-colin-tizzard-ryanair-chase-festival-horse-racing","fields":{"headline":"No third Cheltenham Gold Cup tilt for Colin Tizzard’s Cue Card","bodyText":"There will be no more attempts on the Cheltenham Gold Cup for Cue Card, who will now be aimed at the Ryanair Chase at next month’s Festival. The veteran’s owner and trainer, Jean Bishop and Colin Tizzard respectively, finally reached an agreement on the matter during racing here on Saturday and decided against a third tilt at the Gold Cup, where he has taken crashing falls for the past two years. “It’s what’s best for the horse,” said Bishop, about an hour after watching Kings Walk become the first winner in her colours this season. She and Tizzard had spent that time chewing over the right target for Cue Card in a racecourse bar and it appears that while Bishop was interested in another charge at jump racing’s most prestigious prize the trainer has talked her around to his way of thinking. Tizzard said: “We weighed it up and he was very good last week over the same distance as the Ryanair. Basically, we thought he has a better chance of winning a Ryanair than a Gold Cup.” One of the most popular horses in training after a long and highly successful career, Cue Card won his first Festival race eight years ago, in the Champion Bumper. He hacked up in the 2013 Ryanair but has shocked his followers with falls at the third-last in the Gold Cup for the last two years. Bookmakers reacted by slashing Cue Card’s odds for the Ryanair, where he will face Un De Sceaux, Fox Norton and perhaps Waiting Patiently, who beat him at Ascot last week. Having been available at 25-1 on Saturday morning, he was a general 10-1 shot within an hour of the news breaking. Cue Card’s fans were divided in their response on social media, though the majority expressed relief that he would not be risked in a highly competitive Gold Cup for what may very well be his last season before retirement. Some, however, agreed with the sentiment expressed by Bishop this week, that the horse had “unfinished business” with the Gold Cup. Buveur D’Air was described as being in very good form by a happy Barry Geraghty after working for two miles round Kempton after racing. The reigning champion hurdler finished upsides with Might Bite, the Gold Cup favourite, and their lead horse, Theinval. “I’ve got three happy jockeys plus three happy horses, so that gives you one happy trainer,” said Nicky Henderson, grateful for the opportunity of getting some exercise in raceday conditions into his most high-profile Festival contenders. “They were very fresh. Barry said he was full of horse at the end of it. We’ll see how long they blow for. That was perfect.” Henderson reports his gallops in full working order despite recent frosts but would much prefer not to have the disruption of dealing with snow at any point over the next fortnight."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/24/sunderland-middlesbrough-championship-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-24T17:29:29Z","webTitle":"Sunderland snatch draw against Middlesbrough at end of wild derby","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/24/sunderland-middlesbrough-championship-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/24/sunderland-middlesbrough-championship-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Sunderland snatch draw against Middlesbrough at end of wild derby","bodyText":"An arctic afternoon featuring two brilliant goals from Patrick Bamford, two straight red cards and a flock of seagulls persistently swooping low across the pitch concluded with Callum McManaman volleying a dramatic late equaliser for Sunderland. Bamford’s class in Tony Pulis’s frontline seemed to have settled things in Middlesbrough’s favour when McManaman dented Teesside play-off hopes by earning Chris Coleman’s side a potentially vital point in their relegation fight. The winger celebrated by pointedly racing towards Pulis and provocatively mock-saluting Boro’s manager. During their West Brom days, McManaman had been exiled from the first team and told he was “not good enough” by his old boss. Revenge seemed sweet. “No I’m not really angry with Callum,” said Pulis. “We had a bit of banter. I understand his frustration. I wasn’t picking him at West Brom and now Chris isn’t starting him here.” Despite McManaman’s intervention, Sunderland remain bottom of the Championship and could really have done with winning this one. Particularly on a day when Josh Maja flicked Adam Matthews’ long throw in Joel Asoro’s direction and the young Swedish striker gave them an early, close-range lead. Unfortunately for Coleman, Jake Clarke-Salter possibly interpreted his manager’s call for increased aggression rather too literally and was soon shown a straight red card for an awful challenge on Adama Traoré. The Chelsea loanee had struggled to subdue Traoré’s right-sided advances and lunged in recklessly, hacking the winger down after missing the ball completely. “The referee got both red cards right,” said Coleman. “As I’ve told Jake, if you lose your head on the pitch you’re off.” Shortly afterwards, Traoré turned self-destructive, being shown a red card of his own after smashing a forearm into Bryan Oviedo’s chest in an off-the‑ball altercation at a corner. The referee consulted one of his assistants before marching orders were issued and an aggrieved Traoré was ushered down the tunnel following a confrontation with the fourth official. It was his second sending-off this season but Pulis believes the winger should not be in hot water with the Football Association after claiming Oviedo had first poked him in an eye. “We’ve seen it on replays,” he said. “Adama’s not pushed him for no reason. It’s a reaction. I’ve told Adama he can’t react but he’s had a finger in his eye.” Bamford raised the tone with a high-calibre equaliser. It involved the former Chelsea striker swivelling adroitly and switching the ball from his right to his left foot after connecting with George Friend’s knockdown from Stewart Downing’s cross. With Lamine Koné wrong-footed, Bamford shot low into the bottom corner. Boro took the lead after Lee Camp felled Britt Assombalonga in the area. Grant Leadbitter stepped forward to send Camp the wrong way from the penalty spot before raising his eyes to the heavens. A few years ago the now Boro captain was a Sunderland midfielder and he helped bury his father’s ashes near the halfway line here. Declining to celebrate, he simply touched the evocative piece of turf. Refusing to surrender, Sunderland levelled when Jonny Williams drove Oviedo’s cutback beyond Darren Randolph, with Pulis’s defence dozing. Not to be upstaged Bamford, who between his goals missed a sitter, collected Muhamed Besic’s superb pass, dodged John O’Shea and rounded Camp with a clever flick, before finishing crisply. “Patrick’s played really well,” said Pulis. “He’s got two good goals but I’m really disappointed with the chance he missed, nine times out of 10 he’d score.” As the seagulls swooped it seemed Boro’s day but, in volleying Oviedo’s stoppage-time corner home, McManaman changed the narrative. “I thought Callum was running to me,” said Coleman. “But I was blanked. He had a few words with Tony instead.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/24/ireland-wales-six-nations-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-24T16:34:36Z","webTitle":"Jacob Stockdale surges past Wales to keep Ireland’s grand slam hopes alive","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/24/ireland-wales-six-nations-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/feb/24/ireland-wales-six-nations-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Jacob Stockdale surges past Wales to keep Ireland’s grand slam hopes alive","bodyText":"Another fabulous match between these two, who so love to spar with each other and invariably raise us from their seats when they do. It took Ireland until the very death to put Wales away, but the manner in which the visitors hung in there despite overwhelming pressure from their hosts was a marvel in itself. Nevertheless, it is a third win from three for Ireland and talk of grand slams may now swell. With each round they have shown us more. Putting four tries past this tenacious outfit, albeit on a dry day, was a higher return than England managed at home against the same opponents. Ireland will scratch their heads over how they did not manage more. They hogged two-thirds of possession and were hardly witless with their use of it. Wales are simply a skilful outfit, albeit now doomed to mid-table after these two thankless away assignments. Ireland turned round at the break with a two-point lead. That they were not out of sight by then with the possession they had – and the quality thereof – might have infuriated a less patient side. Wales were not just tackling but sending in a second man to target the ball. They did so with considerable success, ripping ball from unsuspecting Irish carriers on several occasions. In the first half Ireland enjoyed three-quarters of the possession and it is not as if they were not using it well. Theirs were the ball-carriers – practically everyone in green took a turn – and theirs the pattern-weavers in midfield. They came at Wales from all angles, just as England had a fortnight ago. Yet Wales led for almost the entirety of the second quarter, their lead out to 13-5 at one point. Johnny Sexton, so masterful with ball in hand, missed two penalties and a conversion in the first 25 minutes, which did not help Ireland’s cause, but they did at least bookend the half with a pair of tries for that narrow lead. Both were sweetly worked in different ways by Sexton. His glorious flat pass to Jacob Stockdale put the winger over in the corner for the first of his two tries. Then, as half-time approached, Ireland came at Wales for the umpteenth time, wave after wave of them. Sexton went close off Chris Farrell, but Bundee Aki’s ferocious carry proved one too many. Sexton’s conversion on the stroke of half-time earned them that slender lead at last. It was so long in coming because of the 10 unanswered points Wales registered between the two tries. Leigh Halfpenny had given Wales the lead with a penalty in the second minute, and more points were to follow. Steff Evans was ripper-in-chief at the end of the first quarter and a neat kick had Wales down the other end in a flash, where they worked a lineout and a few carries, from which Gareth Davies gathered loose ball and beat Stockdale for the nimblest of tries. Halfpenny and Sexton exchanged penalties in the build-up to half-time, before Ireland struck, their policy of relentlessness finally paying off. They did not let up in the second half. By the end of the third quarter, they had the bonus point and a 27-13 lead. Both tries were scored by heavy-duty carriers, the first by the excellent Dan Leavy, the second by Cian Healy. Ireland seemed set for take-off. Wales’s tackle count was off the scale, but they proved effective again when next they won some ball. Dan Biggar took an up-and-under in characteristic fashion, Evans and Liam Williams stretched Ireland down the left and Aaron Shingler was worked over on the right. Halfpenny’s touchline conversion pulled Wales, somehow, back to within seven. With Sexton hobbling off, Conor Murray stepped up to secure Ireland some breathing space with a penalty four minutes from time, but Wales were not done. Steff Evans won the restart and moments later was away for Wales’s third, Halfpenny’s conversion pulled Wales to within three. Now the fitness they are so proud of had a chance to showcase itself, Wales off in search of a fourth try and the unlikeliest of victories. Alas, Gareth Anscombe’s ambitious pass was picked off by Stockdale and the game was put to bed in the cruellest fashion. Ireland will wonder how it came to be so close, but on they march, looking stronger by the round."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/24/bournemouth-newcastle-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-24T17:20:25Z","webTitle":"Dwight Gayle’s Newcastle double cancelled out by late Bournemouth rally","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/24/bournemouth-newcastle-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/24/bournemouth-newcastle-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Dwight Gayle’s Newcastle double cancelled out by late Bournemouth rally","bodyText":"In this compressed Premier League, where everyone in the bottom half of the table might yet be subjected to the trial of relegation anxiety, these two teams made arguments for both the prosecution and the defence in a lively draw. Newcastle, quite simply, should have won after taking a two-goal half-time lead with a double from Dwight Gayle. Only after Jonjo Shelvey missed a chance to wrap up victory, with 10 minutes remaining, did Bournemouth begin to threaten, but two goals followed in a final blitz that left Rafael Benítez apoplectic on the touchline. Bournemouth did not perform well enough in this match, and hardly for the first time this term. But neither did they lose their belief or willingness for the fight. Which of these two factors prove to be the more telling come season’s end will be a subject that lingers on Eddie Howe’s mind. “My heart is being tested to the max this season‚” the Bournemouth manager said. “Today was tough. We weren’t good enough for 70 minutes, to be honest, but once again I have to praise the character, the spirit and the attitude in the team to come back. It’s not easy in this division to do that. “We played a team that’s in and around us and it’s very important you don’t get beat. It was a massive 20 minutes for us. The substitutes made a big difference, we changed system, and suddenly we were able to turn the screw and pen them in their own half, which is what we had wanted to do earlier but couldn’t.” Newcastle opened the scoring after 17 minutes and Shelvey started it with a perfect pass from the halfway line. Matt Ritchie latched on to the ball on the dash and, as the ball reached the byline, hit a first-time cross low towards the penalty spot where Gayle backheeled it home at the second time of asking. The lead was doubled in injury time. Again Ritchie was involved, the former Bournemouth favourite returning a Paul Dummett delivery low across goal. Asmir Begovic misjudged the ball and let it pass through him. Gayle, in roughly the same place as before, this time scored decisively. Benítez was in full micromanagement mode throughout the first half, snapping instructions at his defence even when they were in no position to hear them. After his team also controlled the first 25 minutes of the second half, Benítez looked to close the game down, withdrawing Gayle for the midfielder Isaac Hayden with 20 minutes to go. This plan did not work as the home side pushed on and a previously resolute Newcastle buckled. The game had entered the final 10 minutes when Shelvey had his fateful moment, spooning the ball over the bar from six yards on the counterattack. Bournemouth pushed back up the other end and, after Josh King created space on the left, a cute flick from Lewis Cook teed up substitute Adam Smith, who curled the ball calmly in off the underside of the bar. Benítez reinforced his strategy to the players again but Bournemouth kept coming. In the 89th minute another cross went all the way across the box and was turned back by Simon Francis to Nathan Aké. The Dutchman found Dan Gosling in far too much room and the midfielder rifled home. After a dominant performance was undermined by momentary weakness, Benítez, too, has his dichotomies to resolve. “We miss a chance, we concede a goal and we lose control in the match‚” he said. “We didn’t switch off but there was a lack of concentration. It’s not easy to do everything perfect and sometimes you have to credit an opponent but we need to learn quickly to manage that situation in a different way.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"global-development/2018/feb/24/un-former-employee-call-for-inquiry-sexism-bullying-harassment","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T09:16:29Z","webTitle":"'A boys' club': UN agency accused over sexual harassment claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/feb/24/un-former-employee-call-for-inquiry-sexism-bullying-harassment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/feb/24/un-former-employee-call-for-inquiry-sexism-bullying-harassment","fields":{"headline":"'A boys' club': UN agency accused over sexual harassment claims","bodyText":"The head of a leading women’s rights movement has called for an independent investigation into what she calls pervasive bullying and sexism within a UN agency, alleging that she was harassed and sexually assaulted while working for the organisation. Malayah Harper, now general secretary of the World YWCA, one of the world’s oldest women’s rights organisations, said the agency UNAids must urgently review how sexual harassment allegations are handled. Her call for an inquiry is supported by testimonies from six current or former UNAids employees. The women, who spoke on condition of anonymity, described a culture where senior male staff offer career progression in exchange for sexual relationships, and harass women with seeming impunity. “It’s a boys’ club environment,” said one employee. “They just see it as almost part of their due.” Harper, who worked for UNAids for more than 10 years, alleges she was sexually harassed for years and sexually assaulted in 2013 by Luiz Loures, the agency’s deputy executive director. She did not report the incidents at the time because she believed no action would be taken. A previous complaint she had made, against a different member of staff which related to bullying and intimidation, had not been handled adequately, she said. The investigation report was not shared with her, no counselling was offered and the alleged perpetrator was moved on through a promotion, she added. “I’m a feminist, I was the lead in the organisation on gender – and I had been bullied quite seriously, and then sexually harassed for years. The irony of it did not escape me,” said Harper. A bigger irony, she added, was that this was happening at the UN: “The UN is the custodian and standard setter for the human rights of women and girls.” She also said that UNAids’ policies for tackling sexual harassment were “based on reporting, on weakly enforced punitive measures – not on prevention or providing support to employees”. Harper said she had decided to speak publicly because she believed that UNAids is failing many female members of staff and the people the UN serves. “A manager has a responsibility to ensure staff are in a safe place of work. If you do nothing, you are accountable. The environment becomes corrosive and pernicious,” she said. UNAids said it has zero tolerance for sexual harassment and abuse, and that it had clear procedures to address complaints. Two women told the Observer they had warned the agency’s executive director, Michel Sidibé, about Loures’s alleged behaviour. One former employee, who left in 2015, said: “I had an exit interview with Michel when I left and the first words out of my mouth were, ‘your deputy director is a sexual predator and everybody knows it. I’m telling you because you really have to do something about it.’” UNAids said Sidibé always took complaints seriously and always acted in line with required procedures. On Friday, UNAids said that Loures, who is also an assistant secretary-general of the UN, would not seek to renew his contract when it expires at the end of March. Loures has recently been investigated over separate claims that he assaulted a current staff member in a lift while on work travel. An inquiry, which was criticised by campaigners, found the allegations to be unsubstantiated. The agency said Loures’s decision to stand down was not related to sexual misconduct claims. The announcement of Loures’s departure follows news that Justin Forsyth has stepped down as deputy executive director of Unicef, the UN’s children’s agency, after accusations of inappropriate behaviour toward female staff while working for Save the Children. He said his resignation was not related to past mistakes made while working for the charity. On Saturday, a number of charities, including Plan International and the International Committee of the Red Cross, disclosed the number of recent allegations of sexual misconduct or sexual abuse by staff members. Harper said the departure of high-profile officials did not exonerate the UN of responsibility, and that it had allowed a culture of sexual harassment to fester for years. She says she was repeatedly invited to drinks by Loures, who once told her she was “a very naughty girl” because she had declined an offer in South Africa to meet him one night in his hotel room. In addition, following a work conference, Loures assaulted her in a lift, she said. “We left the conference and shared a lift together and he attempted to kiss me. In the process of me moving away, he bruised my lip. On exiting the lift he tried to get me into his hotel room and ripped a button off my shirt.” A second woman, who wished to remain anonymous, also alleged she had been assaulted by Loures, after a work meeting. She did not file a complaint. “He grabbed me, pushed me against himself, stuck his tongue in my mouth and touched me all over. I was so shell shocked,” she claimed. “I can’t say he was extremely aggressive but he was constantly all over me putting his hands on me. I said I can’t, I don’t want this, let me go. He tried several times and then he let me go.” A further two women alleged that Loures had pursued or sexually harassed them. “When I would talk to him he had this way of backing me up against the wall and putting his arm so you’re literally trapped, pulling me in for a hug, really insisting that we needed to go out for dinner,” said one woman. Some women said they believed work had been taken away from them, or that their career progression was slow, because they did not comply or engage in sexual relationships. They did not report what had happened because they did not trust the complaints system, or because they had also experienced sexual harassment at the hands of the senior personnel to whom they turned for support. UNAids said staff were regularly informed of the channels available to raise a complaint, including a 24-hour hotline, and were offered protection when they did so, such as reassignment to another team. In recent years it has taken extra steps to prevent harassment at the workplace, it said, adding that it encourages current or former staff who have a complaint to report it. UNAids has been criticised for its handling of a recent investigation into Loures. An internal investigation report said Sidibé had attempted to settle the assault allegation informally, despite the matter being under official investigation by the World Health Organisation’s investigations team, Internal Oversight Services. UNAids later told the Observer that Sidibé had no role in the decision-making process of the case and that the investigation could not have been stopped through an informal resolution. “Any formal complaint received by UNAids is always acted upon in accordance with due process,” it added. This month, the Labour MP Gareth Thomas wrote a letter to Penny Mordaunt urging that the UK, as chair of the UNAids governing body, should immediately establish an external investigation into abuses of power, harassment, assault and bullying. “This is not just one individual, it’s more than that,” said one of the women who says she was harassed by Loures. “It’s about how you establish a system that creates perks for the chosen ones, which is a group of senior men.” Loures did not respond to a request for comment. UNAids added in a statement that, other than the investigation recently concluded that found the allegations to be unsubstantiated, it had received one other complaint of sexual harassment in 2009. Those allegations were also found to be unsubstantiated and both parties accepted the decision, it said. “Informal channels of reporting and resolution require that the person making such an informal complaint expressly authorises that the matter be formally addressed,” the statement said. “Individuals who are not satisfied with the outcome of a formal resolution process may appeal to the administrative tribunal of the International Labour Organization. They also have recourse to local national jurisdiction.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/feb/25/national-maritime-museum-superyachts-art-conservation","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T00:04:07Z","webTitle":"Maritime museum in choppy waters for offering superyacht owners art advice","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/feb/25/national-maritime-museum-superyachts-art-conservation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/feb/25/national-maritime-museum-superyachts-art-conservation","fields":{"headline":"Maritime museum in choppy waters for offering superyacht owners art advice","bodyText":"Art conservators and historians, among them the veteran cultural historian Sir Roy Strong, have raised concerns about a symposium aimed at the billionaire owners of superyachts who display valuable art on board their craft. On Thursday, the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich will hold an event to advise yacht owners on how to insure and protect their floating collections. Speakers will also offer tax tips to around 45 guests, who have paid £395 for a ticket. “I have got no objection to people having large yachts, but the museum is wading into dubious waters here,” said Strong, a former director of the Victoria and Albert Museum. “As a publicly funded institution, I don’t think they come out of it too well.” The museum argues the exclusive event, the first of its kind to be held there, is designed to “promote best practice” and will not make a profit. The rest of the museum will remain open. Yet other conservators echo Strong’s worry that it is not appropriate to encourage important art to be used to decorate superyachts. “What are you going to have eventually? One of the world’s few Leonardos floating about on the waves?” Strong asked. Alison Richmond, chief executive of the Institute of Conservation, the professional body that runs a register of qualified conservators, said keeping art on yachts was a growing trend. “The real value of art is not money, of course, it is sentiment, aesthetic value and historic value. This tends to gets lost now, when it is all about the dollar,” she said. She added that the stability of the onboard atmosphere is crucial. “The real question is what the conditions are, and not whether the art is at sea or not. Advice on considerations such as fluctuations in light, humidity and heat is vital. Superyachts, of course, have air conditioning, but a quick change from damp to dry air causes dangerous expansion and contraction.” Helen Robertson, conservator at Royal Museums Greenwich and curator of the symposium, told the Observer she hopes to offer guidance, “protecting what is already there”, rather than “promoting the carriage of art on board vessels”. The interior of a superyacht is often a safe environment, she added: “Owners tend to be identified with art collecting and philanthropy. So, whether we like it or not, art is carried on board certain superyachts.” Robertson said the subject was “close to her heart” because she was a former seagoing chief steward. “I have seen wonderful examples of how art can be successfully carried within a yacht interior, but also tales of tragic ignorance resulting in loss of art and artefacts. Our aim is to take a holistic look at the subject, which of course means considering the legal/tax/insurance implications of internationally transiting art.” The chosen speakers come from the worlds of art and yachting, she said, and understand the need for debate. “One of the questions we want to raise is: who should be responsible? The subject, as a whole, has very much been overlooked by the industry even though, from damage to seizure, the potential risks are significant.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/24/syria-death-toll-nears-500-as-eastern-ghouta-bombing-continues","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-24T13:23:43Z","webTitle":"Syria death toll over 500 as eastern Ghouta bombing continues","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/24/syria-death-toll-nears-500-as-eastern-ghouta-bombing-continues","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/24/syria-death-toll-nears-500-as-eastern-ghouta-bombing-continues","fields":{"headline":"Syria death toll over 500 as eastern Ghouta bombing continues","bodyText":"Bombing raids have killed more Syrians in the besieged enclave of eastern Ghouta before a delayed UN vote on a ceasefire to allow medical and food aid to reach civilians. Nearly a week into one of the most fierce assaults of Syria’s long civil war, over 520 people were dead and thousands more injured, Médecins Sans Frontières said. Many of the bombing raids have targeted medical buildings, and doctors in the remaining facilities are struggling to keep up with the stream of severely injured patients. The scale of the attacks from barrel bombs and other missiles was making it hard to find and count the dead, rescuers said. The civil defence rescue service, known as the White Helmets, said it had documented at least 350 deaths in the first four days of the attacks. “Maybe there are many more,” Siraj Mahmoud, a spokesman for the group told Reuters. “We weren’t able to count the martyrs yesterday or the day before because the warplanes are touring the skies.” Most people who had escaped death or injury were hiding in underground bunkers with little or no electricity, and low food supplies. “The situation is disastrous, kids didn’t eat for two days in a row,” one activist said. “Local councils cannot even provide meals for children. The adults might be able to endure but the kids can’t. “We have large numbers of babies under the age of six months lacking formula, whose mothers [don’t have milk] to breastfeed them. Generally we have large numbers of kids aged between six months and five years with nothing to eat.” Doctors and medical activists from around the world called for an end to the violence, protection for civilians, and greater action from the UN, in a joint appeal published in the Lancet. The group represented medical centres from Harvard to Britain’s Royal Free hospital, Panzi hospital in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Syrian American Medical Society. “Inaction in the face of unrelenting attacks on civilians represents an epic failure of world leaders,” the appeal said. It condemned “patterns of attacks, which predominantly target civilian areas, and demonstrate a position that all civilians in opposition-held areas are legitimate targets”. On Friday, the UN security council failed to agree on a proposed 30-day ceasefire across Syria, to allow for emergency humanitarian deliveries and medical evacuations, because of Russian objections. Intense talks at the UN headquarters in New York followed a direct appeal by French and German leaders to Vladimir Putin for Russia to support a ceasefire, but a vote was pushed back several times as talks stalled. In an apparent attempt to win Moscow’s support, Kuwait and Sweden, who are sponsors of the draft resolution, dropped a demand for the ceasefire to take effect 72 hours after the resolution passed. Russia’s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, has said an immediate ceasefire is unrealistic. A new text only demands that all parties halt fighting “without delay”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/27/hud-ben-carson-office-redecoration-trump-appointee","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T10:00:00Z","webTitle":"US official: I was demoted for rejecting Ben Carson's costly office revamp","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/27/hud-ben-carson-office-redecoration-trump-appointee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/feb/27/hud-ben-carson-office-redecoration-trump-appointee","fields":{"headline":"US official: I was demoted for rejecting Ben Carson's costly office revamp","bodyText":"A senior career official in the US Department of Housing and Urban Development has alleged that she was demoted and replaced with a Donald Trump appointee after refusing to break the law by funding an expensive redecoration of Ben Carson’s office. Helen Foster said she was told “$5,000 will not even buy a decent chair” after informing her bosses this was the legal price limit for improvements to the HUD secretary’s suite at the department’s Washington headquarters. Foster, 47, claimed that she also faced retaliation for exposing a $10m budget shortfall, and for protesting when she was barred from handling a pair of sensitive freedom of information act (FOIA) requests relating to Trump apparently because she was perceived to be a Democrat. A copy of a complaint letter filed by Foster to a watchdog for federal employees was obtained by the Guardian. It alleges that HUD violated laws protecting whistleblowers from reprisals. Foster is seeking a public apology, compensatory damages and reinstatement as HUD’s chief administrative officer. Trump last September nominated Suzanne Israel Tufts, a veteran Republican operative from his home county of Queens, New York, as HUD’s assistant secretary for administration, a position that Foster said subsumed her job. Foster was moved to the role of chief privacy and FOIA officer. Tufts was confirmed by the US Senate. “This is a long-time public servant who did well at her job, and now her reputation has been ruined,” said Foster’s attorney, Joseph Kaplan, who filed the complaint to the office of special counsel (OSC) last November. The OSC investigates allegations from civil servants of improper treatment and can prosecute or seek to settle complaints. It is not related to the justice department’s special counsel, Robert Mueller. Foster’s complaint said that shortly before the contentious incidents, her performance had been rated “excellent” in an annual review, and that she received bonus pay worth 12% of her salary as a reward. She declined to comment for this article. Raffi Williams, a spokesman for HUD, said in an email: “We don’t comment on pending matters of the type.” Williams referred inquiries to the OSC. OSC communications director Jill Gerber said in an email: “We don’t comment on or confirm any pending cases.” The complaint letter said that the day before Trump’s inauguration in January last year, Foster was asked by acting HUD director Craig Clemmensen to help Carson’s wife, Candy, obtain funds for the redecoration of her husband’s office suite. When Foster replied that there was a statutory limit of $5,000, Clemmensen allegedly told her that administrations had “always found ways around that in the past”. When she had not relented by 10 February, Foster was repeatedly told by Clemmensen “to ‘find money’ for Mrs Carson”, according to the complaint, and that “$5,000 will not even buy a decent chair”. Foster said she complained to HUD’s budget director about being asked to break the spending limit. Clemmensen did not respond to an email seeking comment. A spokesman for the Carsons declined to comment. At that time, Foster oversaw HUD’s FOIA office as well as being chief administrative officer. Her complaint alleged that around 16 February, she became aware of a pair of newly received FOIA requests and was contacted by Kevin Simpson, an attorney in HUD’s office of general counsel – the department’s in-house lawyers. Simpson told her the office of general counsel had “been asked to discreetly handle these two FOIA requests outside of the normal FOIA processes”, according to the complaint, and that this had been decided by Maren Kasper, then HUD’s liaison to the White House. The requests apparently related to Lynne Patton, a former event planner for the Trump family, who controversially was given a job at HUD. “The information responsive to the FOIA requests reveal that Ms Patton wanted Ms Kasper fired because she was critical of President Trump,” according to Foster’s complaint. Foster said she was told by Deena Jih, another HUD attorney, that Jih had heard Foster was being sidelined because she was thought to be a Democrat. Kaplan declined to comment on Foster’s current political identification. Public records show that she was registered as a Republican in 2003. Simpson and Jih declined to comment. Kasper did not respond to an email seeking comment. Foster said her being sidelined was a possible attempt to break federal law, which gave her responsibility for the appropriate release of information. She said she reported the FOIA incident internally to Clemmensen, acting deputy secretary Janet Golrick and to the department’s inspector general. She added in her complaint that after protesting, she was eventually allowed to handle the sensitive FOIA requests, but that a later department-wide FOIA training session she arranged was cancelled by Sheila Greenwood, Carson’s chief of staff. Foster further alleged that in May last year she raised concerns to senior officials about a $10.8m hole in her department’s budget that her team had discovered, due to apparent “accounting irregularities” during 2016. She said she reported the shortfall to David Eagles, HUD’s chief operating officer, but was told in June that “agency leadership is unwilling to report the $10.8m funding deficit” to appropriations staff, who deal with congressional approval for the department’s funding. Foster said she warned HUD’s budget staff this would be illegal. Eagles did not respond to an email seeking comment. Following all these clashes, according to Foster’s complaint, she was told that an assistant secretary for administration was to be inserted above her in the HUD hierarchy. The position had existed under George W Bush but was left unfilled during Barack Obama’s administration. Foster was eventually reassigned in July 2017, but was not sent a job description for her new role until October. That document, she said, stated her job title, pay grade, and nothing else."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/25/time-to-divide-eu-migration-fact-from-brexit-fantasy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T00:03:07Z","webTitle":"It’s time to separate EU migration fact from Brexit fantasy | Kenan Malik","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/25/time-to-divide-eu-migration-fact-from-brexit-fantasy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/25/time-to-divide-eu-migration-fact-from-brexit-fantasy","fields":{"headline":"It’s time to separate EU migration fact from Brexit fantasy","bodyText":"The net number of EU migrants coming to Britain has fallen to 90,000. That of non-EU migrants has risen to 205,000. These are the main takeaways from the latest set of immigration figures. The number of EU citizens who left Britain was up to 130,000, the highest level since the 2008 crash. This has led many to talk of “Brexodus”, though it is unlikely to be just Brexit that is leading to the outflow of EU citizens. Stronger economic growth in the eurozone, for instance, may also be playing a part. Equally significant is the figure for non-EU immigration to Britain. One of the arguments of many Brexit leaders has been that leaving the EU and getting control of Britain’s borders would allow for a drastic reduction in numbers and enable the government to meet its stated aim of capping immigration at “tens of thousands”. This, suggested Boris Johnson at the time, in the wake of the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox, was the only way to “spike the guns of the extremists and the people who are genuinely anti-immigrant”. But it wasn’t and it won’t be. Throughout this century, immigration to Britain from outside the EU has been higher than that from the EU. Being unable to limit EU migrants, the government has striven particularly hard to reduce non-EU numbers. So the failure to reduce these numbers is telling, revealing the limitation in its control of migration. Even so, the idiocy of the government’s arbitrary immigration cap is clear. Britain has hit the limit on visas for skilled non-European workers for three months in a row, deepening the staffing crisis in the NHS and elsewhere. Promising to limit immigration and failing to do so will only aggravate, not alleviate, hostility to immigration. If we really want to “spike the guns of the extremists”, we need not to make false claims about what “taking back control” will achieve, but to challenge the myths about the impact of immigration."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/commentisfree/2018/feb/24/brexit-uk-business-training-skills-gap-theresa-may-cbi","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-24T21:31:29Z","webTitle":"Clarify Brexit now, Mrs May, so that the UK can get back to business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2018/feb/24/brexit-uk-business-training-skills-gap-theresa-may-cbi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/commentisfree/2018/feb/24/brexit-uk-business-training-skills-gap-theresa-may-cbi","fields":{"headline":"Clarify Brexit now, Mrs May, so that the UK can get back to business","bodyText":"This Friday business will hopefully get more clarity on the government’s vision for the UK’s future trade relationship with the EU, when Theresa May reveals her plans. Evidence strongly suggests that a comprehensive customs union with the EU, alongside a deep relationship with the single market, is best for jobs, investment and living standards. But it is equally urgent to get clarity about people. Firms and their employees need to know who can live and work in the UK, now and in the future. This is as important as trade. Firms recognise that freedom of movement as we know it will end. But what happens next matters greatly. A lack of access to skills and labour is affecting firms now, gnawing away at confidence already shaken by Brexit uncertainty. At a time of record employment rates, throttling access to EU workers would leave companies unable to find the staff they need to grow. And if employers can’t find staff, they can’t create jobs in their local communities. The economy and public services suffer. Lower tax receipts mean less money for schools, roads and yes, for our NHS. The way forward is to do two things in parallel: invest more in the skills of our own young people, while also staying open to skills and labour from overseas. Both are essential, a stark choice between them is false. The building blocks of a successful skills system are in place. Employer-led apprenticeships, T-levels and the new National Retraining Schemecorrect will help give people skills they need for the future. But shortages are harming firms today. The government can take three steps now to build a stairway to certainty. First, guaranteeing the rights of EU citizens already here – even in the event of a no-deal scenario – is vital. Second, firms must know that there will be enough time to adjust to new rules. A transition period to a new migration system is a must-have, irrespective of the wider deal with Brussels. And third, any idea of copying and pasting the non-EU visa system for EU nationals should be ruled out. It would be disastrous for the economy, hitting smaller companies hardest. The UK is a great place to do business. But to continue competing globally, it must remain open to the world. To protect jobs and prosperity for future generations, we will need to take an open approach to migration.

Trump watched snowboarding events in Pyeongchang with South Korea’s first lady, Kim Jung-sook, and foreign minister Kang Kyung-wha. Wearing a Team USA hat and red snowsuit, she captured the attention of local media. Her trip comes less than two weeks after Kim Yo-jong, Kim Jong-un’s younger sister, visited the South and largely overshadowed US vice president Mike Pence. “We cannot have a better, or smarter, person representing our country,” Donald Trump said in an early morning tweet. At a dinner on Friday, Ivanka Trump’s message of “maximum pressure” seemed to clash with South Korean president Moon Jae-in’s strategy of denuclearisation through dialogue. Experts have said the North’s recent diplomatic overtures are aimed at driving a wedge between Washington and Seoul, and the mixed messages suggested there may be tension between the allies. “Active dialogue is being held between the South and the North amid the North’s participation in the Olympics,” Moon said, according to the Yonhap news agency. “This is greatly contributing to easing tension on the Korean Peninsula and improving the South-North relationship.” Friday’s meal featured “Korean food designed to be palatable for foreigners” including bibimbap, a rice dish topped with various vegetables and meat “that mixes different ingredients evenly and symbolises harmony”, according to the presidential Blue House. Moon has rolled out the red carpet for Trump, who is an adviser to her father. “I thank you for hosting us all here tonight as we reaffirm our bonds of friendship, of cooperation, of partnership and reaffirm our commitment to our maximum pressure campaign to ensure that the Korean Peninsula is denuclearised,” she said. As Trump landed in Seoul, the US announced a new round of sanctions against Pyongyang in an effort to curb the country’s nuclear and missile programs. The measures targeted 27 shipping and trading companies, 28 vessels and one person, all suspected of helping North Korea circumvent current sanctions. Washington’s hard line emerged as the dominant theme of Trump’s trip, with White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders telling reporters: “We are going to continue a campaign of maximum pressure, the latest sanctions are the strongest that we have had on North Korea. We are going to continue in that form.” The US is “going to ask all of our allies and partners to step up and do more as well and join us in that effort,” she added. Trump’s visit will coincide with a high level delegation from North Korea, with both attending the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics. US and South Korean officials have said there is no meeting planned between the two sides, but the possibility of direct talks had led to intense speculation. Pence was set to meet with officials from the North during his trip, but it was cancelled at the last minute."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/25/thanks-to-land-rover-new-phone-never-lost-in-waitrose-car-park-ever-again","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T00:04:07Z","webTitle":"Thanks to Land Rover, you’ll never get lost in a Waitrose car park again | Barbara Ellen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/25/thanks-to-land-rover-new-phone-never-lost-in-waitrose-car-park-ever-again","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/25/thanks-to-land-rover-new-phone-never-lost-in-waitrose-car-park-ever-again","fields":{"headline":"Thanks to Land Rover, you’ll never get lost in a Waitrose car park again","bodyText":"The imminent Land Rover smartphone, Explore (£599), sounds exciting.

It was Valentine’s Day when the Dutch second-tier club announced he had been put on “non-active duties” – suspended, in effect – for “unacceptable actions [that] have made cooperation between many people within the organisation impossible”; a case is now pending to the Dutch FA’s arbitration committee to determine whether his contract can be terminated. It completed the rapid change in appearance of a story that, when the Observer first arranged to interview Oliseh, appeared to bring little but good feeling. When Oliseh, the former Ajax, Borussia Dortmund and Cologne midfielder, took charge of Fortuna in December 2016 they were placed 18th in a 20-team division and freefalling to the point of oblivion; at the midway point of this season they were top of the pile and had won the second of the league’s four “period titles”. They won seven league games in a row between November and January, before which they had broken a club record by winning eight consecutive home fixtures. The team was young, the goals raining in, the football free-flowing: at the turn of the year it was, unreservedly, a tale of success. Yet rumours began to surface of trouble behind the scenes and Oliseh had a practice run for what followed when, a fortnight prior to his suspension, he was greeted by bemused faces upon arriving at work. “I opened the door of the dressing room and my assistant said ‘Have you read the newspaper? You’ve been sacked.’ He showed me on his phone and I thought ‘Oh, that’s nice, a nice way to hear that. Then, 10 minutes later, the club put out a statement saying that they hadn’t sacked me.’” That is a broadly accurate version of events but the feeling, upon meeting Oliseh in that brief spell between dismissals real and imagined, was that the die had been cast. His team’s form had dipped and they had just lost three consecutive matches. “It’s been a strange week, stressful,” he admitted of the reports. “It’s weighed on the team and how to get it out of them now is something I don’t really know. It’s really sad when you look at the job God has blessed me to. But I really don’t have anything to fault myself on. Everything I’ve done is in the interests of getting the team to be good, working like hell.” Something was rankling and it surfaced, to a point, via an extraordinary tweet written by Oliseh within hours of his suspension. He said the club’s decision was “due to my refusal to participate in illegal actions at Fortuna Sittard and violate the law” and pointedly referenced Fortuna’s “foreign owners”. Their majority shareholder has, since July 2016, been the Turkish entrepreneur Isitan Gun; the club responded fiercely to the allegations with a statement that described them as “unfounded” and confirmed it will be taking legal action. In a follow-up conversation with the Observer, Oliseh said he could not elaborate on the remarks for legal reasons but that his departure was “a relief, after all”. Explanations will presumably materialise in good time; local media had, even during Fortuna’s blistering early-season run, cast doubt on Oliseh’s relationships with various figures at the club, describing his style as autocratic and dictatorial. He has certainly never been a shrinking violet but contends there was a “vendetta” and, while admitting he is an “intense coach”, points to the huge improvement in results and style his methods wrought. The timing of the split is unfortunate. Oliseh had been blazing a trail: a relative managerial novice beyond short spells in charge of his national team and two lower-league clubs in Belgium, the 1996 Olympic gold medal winner with Nigeria had been set fair to become the only African manager in charge of a top-flight team in Europe. “I receive tons of emails from African coaches who ask me what I did to get this far and if I have any ideas for how to do their coaching badges,” he said. “Many of them tell me my success may help their own progress. There’s some form of pressure in that, but it’s inspiring.” That is a tale that will have to be revisited in his next employment, and enough suitors have shown their hand to suggest a new chapter will be forthcoming. For now, though, Oliseh must disentangle himself from a decidedly strange situation in the far south-east of the Netherlands that degenerated at an alarming rate of knots."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/11/is-being-first-lady-really-such-a-good-gig-ask-julie-gayet","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T06:05:22Z","webTitle":"Is being first lady really such a good gig?

Gayet has a point, doesn’t she? And it’s equally true, whether a woman is a great first lady (see Michelle Obama, in the news for doing a Netflix deal alongside her husband) or perhaps struggling a little. There was evidence of the latter last week, when Melania Trump dealt with a survivor of the Florida shooting as though, never mind first lady, she was the world’s least engaging Avon lady, reluctantly trying to flog some stale bubble-bath out of a suitcase in a pub. It simply isn’t true that men get the same deal when they have world leaders for wives. “Mr May”, for one, is rarely seen, nothing much is asked of him and he’s rarely commented on. By contrast, first ladies are supposed to be coiffed, groomed and articulate, while also remaining reassuringly bland, permitted to be truly animated only when staring with admiration at their man, in the manner of gasping Barbie dolls, with their own alpha-impulses temporarily placed on mute. Nor is this pressure confined to official first ladies – Kate Middleton is a bit of a first lady, as may be Meghan Markle. The former has played ball, but if the latter gets too uppity and opinionated, she will be punished as briskly and surely as Hillary Clinton, back at the time when she was supporting Bill, and looked less than enthralled at the thought of producing a cookie recipe to charm the voting masses. While it’s great that women such as Michelle Obama find a dignified way through, Ms Gayet is correct – the first lady is primarily a thankless Miss Congeniality type of gig. • Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/11/actu-launches-biggest-campaign-since","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T01:48:31Z","webTitle":"Unions launch biggest ad blitz since WorkChoices as wage crisis bites","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/11/actu-launches-biggest-campaign-since","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/11/actu-launches-biggest-campaign-since","fields":{"headline":"Unions launch biggest ad blitz since WorkChoices as wage crisis bites","bodyText":"The union movement has launched its largest nationwide advertising campaign since the anti-WorkChoices “your rights at work” campaign that contributed to the downfall of the Howard government in 2007. The Australian Council of Trade Unions said its advertising blitz would run for the next eight weeks, as part of a larger campaign to try to overhaul Australia’s workplace relations system. Its television ads begin airing on Sunday with the tagline: “It’s time to change the rules.” The ads, reminiscent of those that targeted the WorkChoices legislation in 2005-07, focus on families struggling with insecure work, with declining wages and conditions, while the companies they work for bank larger and larger profits. “Big business has too much power,” the ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, said. “Profits are up but working people are struggling to get a pay rise and 40% of the workforce is in insecure work.” McManus is scheduled to address the National Press Club on 21 March, where she will outline the ACTU’s demands for reform of industrial relations law. It is understood McManus will call for a shift away from enterprise bargaining – which forces unions to negotiate separate pay deals with every employer in an industry – in favour of bargaining across an entire industry, and up the supply chain. Wages have stagnated for four years in Australia despite continued economic growth and record jobs growth last year. McManus said working Australians wanted the imbalance of workplace relations to change. “They’re sick of one-third of big businesses not paying tax,” she said. “They’re sick of watching CEO bonuses are going up, company profits going up while their own pay falls behind basic living costs. “This campaign is about changing the rules for working people so Australians have more secure jobs and a fair pay rises.” The ACTU has already called for the minimum wage to become a “living wage” targeted at 60% of average weekly earnings. The union movement’s language around enterprise bargaining has also hardened in recent months. A recent paper by the former ACTU assistant secretary Tim Lyons, Organising Ourselves: Rebuilding Australia’s Union, argued for a more militant unionism. Lyons told the Guardian that unions “absolutely” should be prepared to take industrial actions that are unlawful under the current enterprise bargaining system, such as walkouts. “If the formal system for getting a pay rise doesn’t work, we’re entitled to ignore it,” he said. “The alternative is to concede we’re not going to get a pay rise and that’s not acceptable.” The Labor party’s policy on wages is still being formulated but the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, has foreshadowed a harder line on the minimum wage, telling the press club in January that enterprise bargaining was on “life support”. “Our goal should be a real, living wage – effectively raising the pay of all Australians, particularly the 2.3 million in the award system. Yes we must always be mindful of the capacity of industry to pay. But let me make it clear: we need to fix the disconnect between wages and productivity.” The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, accused Shorten of being a “craven populist” and said the opposition leader had suspended “the laws of economic common sense”. The government, while conceding wages growth has been “modest” despite strong jobs figures, is campaigning for company tax cuts it argues will create wages growth in the long-term: so-called trickle-down economics. “We need to bring down our tax rates on business because when you increase the return on investment you get more investment, you get more jobs and you get better-paid jobs because you get better productivity,” Turnbull said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/mar/14/biofuels-can-help-solve-climate-change-especially-with-a-carbon-tax","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T10:00:09Z","webTitle":"Biofuels can help solve climate change, especially with a carbon tax | John Abraham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/mar/14/biofuels-can-help-solve-climate-change-especially-with-a-carbon-tax","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/mar/14/biofuels-can-help-solve-climate-change-especially-with-a-carbon-tax","fields":{"headline":"Biofuels can help solve climate change, especially with a carbon tax","bodyText":"Facing the reality of human-caused warming, we now look for ways to reduce the problem so that future generations will not inherit a disaster. So, what can we do now to help the future? The easiest answer is to use energy more wisely and quit wasting our precious resources. Second, we can increase our use of clean energy, particularly wind and solar power. These are great starts but we will still need some liquid fuels and for those, we can make decisions about the best fuels for the environment. There has been extensive conversation recently about biofuels and how they may help solve the climate problem. The term “biofuels” has many meanings, but basically they are grown fuels (like corn ethanol) that we can use instead of fossil fuels (like petroleum). While biofuels can be any fuel produced from plant material, historically they have been produced from food crops such as corn and soy. But, new technologies are enabling biofuel production from non-edible gases, wood, and other plant waste material. The beauty of biofuels is that they suck carbon dioxide out of the air as they grow. When we burn them in our automobiles, we release carbon dioxide, but it is the same carbon that the plants absorbed while growing. Just on that basis, biofuels appear to be zero net emitters. But this view is too simplistic. It takes energy to grow biofuels; it takes fertilizer, tractors, transportation, and energy to convert the plants to liquid fuels. Planting and growing these crops can also change how much carbon is stored in the soil. And using existing food crops or arable land for biofuel production might lead to deforestation if farms are expanded elsewhere to make up for lost food production. So, if you want to accurately assess the impact of biofuels, you need to look at what’s called a “life cycle analysis,” which basically means the effort it takes to grow the crops, harvest them, convert them to fuel, transport them to distribution sites, and combust them. I have done some research in this area. Back in 2009, I did a study with my former student Fushcia-Ann Hoover, and we compared different feedstocks for ethanol. You can have corn, soybeans, sugarcane, switchgrass, poplar trees, and others. What is the best crop? Which is easiest to grow? Which is best for the environment? What we found, way back in 2009, is that if non-commercial crops were grown, you could actually end up with fuel that was significantly cleaner than petroleum. The trick was finding clean crops that don’t need a lot of fertilizer, water, and other inputs. Corn ethanol for instance is not the best choice. You need so much water, fertilizer, and other costs, that it almost doesn’t make it worthwhile. But other crops such as switchgrass, grown on marginal lands, have real a potential. Marginal lands are farmlands that are not optimal for growing crops. Our conclusion in 2009 was straightforward. Don’t use good cropland for biofuels. Rather, use marginal croplands, with minimal water and fertilizer, to create plants that can be converted to biofuels. But our conclusion wasn’t the end of the story. There are other details that researchers should consider. For instance, how far from the croplands to the refinery? How much energy is needed to transport the fuels? All these issues matter and they were the focus of a recent research paper just published in Nature Energy. This study used an actual biofuel refinery located in Kansas for the basis of the study. And the authors counted all the emissions that occur during the lifecycle analysis of these biofuels. They realized that marginal croplands give lower yields, so there are competing issues of productivity and greenhouse gas reduction. Then there’s the complicating factor of economics. The price of biofuels and the price of greenhouse gases matter. If society is willing to pay a small pollution charge like a carbon tax, it supports the producers of clean energy. But if society doesn’t put a premium on clean energy, it’s harder for clean industry companies to thrive. In the new study, the authors discovered something fascinating. The found that the choices a farmer may make regarding what land to use for biofuels and how much fertilizer to use depend strongly on the price of clean fuels and the cost of greenhouse gases. Simply put, it we put a reasonable price on carbon pollution, farmers will be able to grow switchgrass, poplars, and other species, reduce greenhouse gases, and make money. But, if there is no cost to carbon pollution, farmers will be motivated to spend more money on fertilizer and that, in the end, will lead to more emissions. While all the scenarios resulted in large emissions reductions compared to gasoline, the reductions were especially large for the scenarios that included a carbon price. So, there is a delicate balance. The balance is made more clear when we realize that farming location matters. If biofuels are grown close to refineries, less pollution is created in transporting the fuels to the refinery. However, this limits cropland choices to those nearer to refineries. With this balance of competing factors, the authors find room for improvement; currently we are not optimizing the performance in terms of both economic and environmental factors. In order to do this right, we have to balance all these mentioned issues. We can’t just focus on transportation costs, fertilizer costs, and land quality costs; we have to consider these costs all together as a system. I spoke to the lead author of the paper, Dr. John Field, from Colorado State University and asked him about the significance of this work. Agriculture is being challenged by increasing food demand, and changes to regional climate. On top of this, most plans to combat climate change rely on the agricultural sector to increase carbon storage in soils, and to produce raw materials for the large-scale production of biofuels and power. Modeling studies like ours attempt to predict on a farm-by-farm basis where the best opportunities for biofuel crop production and soil carbon storage lie, how much they might cost, and how those two goals trade off. Our results suggest that biofuels can have a wide range of environmental outcomes depending on exactly where and how those crops are grown, but climate benefits can be increased at relatively low cost. This is another great example of clean energy technologies that will help us solve the climate problem while continuing our use of fuels that drive the economy. It’s a win-win situation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/10/dennis-rodman-on-trump-kim-meeting-i-said-doors-would-open","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T03:32:54Z","webTitle":"Dennis Rodman on Trump-Kim meeting: I said doors would open","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/10/dennis-rodman-on-trump-kim-meeting-i-said-doors-would-open","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/10/dennis-rodman-on-trump-kim-meeting-i-said-doors-would-open","fields":{"headline":"Dennis Rodman on Trump-Kim meeting: I said doors would open","bodyText":"The former NBA star Dennis Rodman – the only prominent American who has met Kim Jong-un – has said he knew the doors between North Korea and the United States would open one day. “Much respect to President Trump and Marshall Kim Jong-un for their upcoming historic meeting,” Rodman wrote on Twitter. “I said it back in 2014 that doors will open. \u001dPeace \u001dlove \u001dnot war.” The comment came after late Thursday’s stunning announcement that Donald Trump would meet Kim soon in a landmark summit aimed at ratcheting down threats of nuclear destruction from both sides.

In an election campaign full of clashes between the state’s premier, Jay Weatherill, the Liberal leader, Steven Marshall, and Xenophon, a leaders’ debate on the environment last month offered Parnell the rare opportunity to share the spotlight. When he flicked through the Adelaide Advertiser the next morning, Parnell tells Guardian Australia the local paper acknowledged the former environmental lawyer had “of course” won on his pet topic, but that was where coverage of him ended. “What struck me was on this double page election spread, they’d cropped me out of all the photos, and had seven pictures of Nick,” he said. “I don’t want to be sour grapes, but that sums up how difficult it is.” Rob Manwaring, a senior lecturer in politics at Flinders University, notes that the December Newspoll that sensationally pegged Xenophon as the clear preferred premier also saw support for the Greens shaved from 9% down to 6%. That’s enough to threaten the legislative council re-election campaign of the Greens MLC Tammy Franks, who Manwaring expects to fight it out with Robert Brokenshire of Cory Bernardi’s Australian Conservatives for the last spot left after SA-Best gobbles up the seats usually contested by the minor parties. It is a familiar feeling for the Greens in SA, where they have always struggled to be the main protest vote outlet they represent in the rest of the country. According to Parnell, the problem is a local soft spot for centrist parties – the state is the former heartland of the Democrats, who he remembers used to outpoll the Greens by 10 to one. Now the oxygen is being consumed by the media-savvy Xenophon and his knack for making the papers with his visual gags and one-liners. Manwaring thinks there is more to it than that, saying the Greens failed to capitalise on the decline of the Democrats and have struggled to compete with Xenophon because of unexciting campaigns and a lack of charisma among their ranks. “Parnell is an extremely effective parliamentarian, but he perhaps hasn’t been so effervescent,” he said. Tired of being sidelined, the Greens have had enough. In an act of political judo, their campaign launch turned the headline-grabbing power of Xenophon’s name against him, declaring themselves the only true no-pokies party by pledging to ban them outright, and blaming Xenophon for the continued presence of pokies since he first ran as the No-Pokies MP in 1997. Parnell said Xenophon had become the “some pokies MP”, although he noted the gambling lobby had targeted SA-Best rather than the Greens. “Perhaps they don’t consider us a real threat,” he laughed. Greens preferences deals have put SA-Best below Labor in all seats bar one, and even behind the Liberals in several key seats, including Hartley, which Xenophon himself is contesting. It is a deal that could very well stop his election even if his party picks up seats in the upper and lower house. Xenophon has questioned the Greens preference deal, pointing to his three-star environmental rating from the Australian Conservation Foundation compared with the Liberal party’s one-and-a-half stars and Labor’s two. Franks defended the move by declaring that “blue Liberals and orange Liberals were exactly the same”, referencing the party colour of SA-Best. Parnell echoed her position, noting Xenophon’s history of wind-farm scepticism, and adding that preference deals considered more than environmental policy. He said Franks had advised him that Xenophon’s party did not return phone calls when the party determined preferences. To Parnell, this reflects a broader sense of chaos within SA-Best, and he points to Xenophon’s history of being abandoned by politicians who join his team. “It is not a grassroots movement with any kind of structure, whether in policy or administrative, everyone has to abide by what Nick wants,” he said. “This experiment in personality-based populist politics, I don’t see them staying together as a cohesive unit. Nick’s got one shot at this, with all the mainstream media rooting for him. “The Democrats are nowhere to be seen these days, but we’re still here, and we’re not going anywhere.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/12/trump-california-visit-border-wall-san-diego","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T11:00:13Z","webTitle":"Trump's California border wall visit puts state's Republicans in a bind","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/12/trump-california-visit-border-wall-san-diego","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/12/trump-california-visit-border-wall-san-diego","fields":{"headline":"Trump's California border wall visit puts state's Republicans in a bind","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s visit to California will generate a memorable image: the president inspecting prototypes of his planned border wall. Four years after he first proposed a wall, an idea that helped vault him to the White House, he will on Tuesday finally be able to touch solid concrete on some of the eight barriers, 30ft tall and 30ft wide, arrayed in the desert outside San Diego. Congress may yet stymie construction of a wall along the frontier with Mexico but Trump will at least have a photo-op to accompany vows to deter and expel undocumented migrants, rhetoric which electrifies his base across the United States. California’s Republican leaders, however, may view this political theatre very differently: as the equivalent of a man sawing a tree branch on which they – and he – all sit. Bashing immigrants elicits nativist GOP cheers outside the state but in California it could doom GOP candidates in November’s midterm elections – and hand Congress to the Democrats. “He’s gaining cheap applause outside California at the cost of real seats in California. It’s not a good trade,” said Jack Pitney, a Claremont McKenna University political scientist and former GOP congressional aide. “California is a convenient Republican punching bag. But punching bags don’t like getting punched. Trump’s presence [here] will remind voters in swing districts about what they have come to loathe in the Republican party. His visit will motivate turnout among Hispanic voters and anger progressive white voters. There’s no way his presence will be a plus to candidates in difficult races.” The blowback would be especially costly if a blue wave in California helps Democrats regain control of the House and leaves Trump more vulnerable to impeachment. Regardless, the White House has ratcheted up a feud with the US’s most diverse, populous state. Last week, the justice department sued California over so-called sanctuary policies that try to protect undocumented migrants from deportation. During a visit to Sacramento, the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, accused Democratic officials of obstructing federal immigration enforcement efforts. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents have sowed panic and anger recently by sweeping up farm workers and 7-Eleven employees. Video of agents dragging a mother from her screaming children near San Diego drew more denunciation and millions of views on Facebook. Such tactics please Trump supporters – including some in California – who voted for him on the promise of curbing illegal immigration. But analysts say the crackdown will further marginalise California’s beleaguered GOP. Republican voter registration has slumped to 25%, on par with the number expressing no party preference. Democrats monopolise statewide offices and dominate the legislature. California is a big reason Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton in 2016 and now once solid Republican redoubts, especially in Orange county, may topple in the midterms. Two incumbents, Darrell Issa and Ed Royce, have decided to not run. Trump’s immigration policies are repeating a cycle California saw in the mid 1990s when Republicans cracked down on undocumented migrants only for courts to push back and Latinos to rise up, turning the state of Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon into a Democratic bastion. GOP candidates, however, cannot renounce Trump without alienating Trump-adoring activists and donors. The president’s visit will oblige them to do a delicate dance, close but not too close. “All Republicans incumbents face this as a challenge. They cannot run against the president and need the financial resources that the Republican base can provide,” said Louis DeSipio, a politics professor at the University of California, Irvine. When the Orange County Register asked 11 GOP candidates to rank Trump’s performance only four agreed, the rest declining to respond or saying it was too early in his tenure."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/mar/11/anthony-howard-award-young-journalists-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T00:05:14Z","webTitle":"Win £25,000 and work at three of Britain’s top newspapers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/11/anthony-howard-award-young-journalists-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/mar/11/anthony-howard-award-young-journalists-2018","fields":{"headline":"Win £25,000 and work at three of Britain’s top newspapers","bodyText":"Anthony Howard, who died in 2010, was a superb political journalist with an exceptional ability to encourage young writers.

The brazen nature and public execution of the plot to kill Skripal is disturbing for many reasons. It suggests respect for Britain, its values and its law enforcement capabilities is so diminished that it is seen as an easy venue for score-settling. Or was the plot intended, at least in part, to deliberately discredit and humiliate the British government? A handful of countries might have cause to do that. But only one or two possess the rare nerve agent, the sheer malice and the ruthless audacity evident in this case. In 1850 Lord Palmerston, then foreign secretary, stood before the House of Commons and enunciated the principle of universal protection for British citizens everywhere, in the teeth of continental and Ottoman absolutism. “As the Roman, in days of old, held himself free from indignity, when he could say civis Romanus sum [I am a Roman citizen]; so also a British subject, in whatever land he may be, shall feel confident that the watchful eye and the strong arm of England will protect him against injustice and wrong,” he said. Nowadays not only is Britain incapable of protecting its citizens abroad – just look at the shameful case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, unjustly jailed in Tehran – it also struggles to protect British citizens on home soil, including foreign nationals taking refuge here. One cause of vulnerability is the widely held perception that Britain is little more than a US satrapy, faithfully following Washington’s lead. When politicians extol the “special relationship”, they compound the damage to Britain’s reputation as an independent actor. Even so, don’t look for help from Donald Trump. In dealing with modern-day authoritarian regimes, Britain is at an even greater disadvantage. At least the US broadly shares its democratic values. Chinese and Russian leaders suffer no such constraints. Today Xi Jinping will be consecrated de facto president for life. Vladimir Putin, in effect, already holds that position in Russia. Such unchecked power affords enormous freedom of action that British politicians lack. Past British bluster and prevarication weaken this country’s hand. After Alexander Litvinenko, a Russian defector, was murdered in London in 2006, politicians such as Theresa May, home secretary from 2010 to 2016, failed forcefully to pursue the state-sponsored Russian perpetrators, even after their identity was known. The people who attacked Skripal may calculate the response now will be similarly weak-kneed. They may also assume that, as with Litvinenko, Britain will again feebly shy away from open confrontation and hope the problem fades from view. May says that if Russia is proved culpable in Salisbury, “full-spectrum” counter-measures will be applied. But she is badly short of ammo. Diplomatic expulsions are a two-edged sword. Sanctions are already being applied, related to Ukraine, without much effect. Further action of that kind can only happen via the EU, where May is busy burning bridges. To pretend that bad feeling caused by Brexit will have no impact on future European cooperation in such cases is delusional. May could appeal to the UN. But there she faces a Russian veto. Targeting financial dealings, including alleged money laundering, might be a more promising avenue. But if the Kremlin really is to blame for this latest outrage, the best response is also the simplest: charge Putin with attempted murder. • This article was amended on 13 March 2018 to clarify Theresa May’s term as home secretary."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/11/naples-italy-election-five-star-movement","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T05:00:20Z","webTitle":"How Ferrante’s neighbourhood tells a story of Italy’s transformed politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/11/naples-italy-election-five-star-movement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/11/naples-italy-election-five-star-movement","fields":{"headline":"How Ferrante’s neighbourhood tells a story of Italy’s transformed politics","bodyText":"Few people in Rione Luzzatti are aware of how intriguing they and their rundown neighbourhood have become thanks to the phenomenal success of Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan novels. Located to the east of the Naples train station, the district is believed to have been the setting for the childhood home of the two protagonists, Elena and Lina. “People around here don’t really read books,” says Pascale Edoardo. Plagued by crime and high unemployment, his fellow Neapolitans dismiss Rione Luzzati as a hostile no-go zone. Ferrante fans are more likely to flock to the more salubrious areas of this complex yet fascinating southern Italian city that feature in the novels. “We’re a dormitory of Naples. Nobody comes here, there is nothing,” Edoardo adds. “Only the centre has been made attractive for tourists.” Book culture may have passed them by, but Edoardo and his friend Sergio Amato are tuned in politically. Sitting outside a shop selling pet food, a rottweiler lounging on a cushion beside them, they explain why they voted for the insurgent Five Star Movement (M5S) in last Sunday’s national election. They were far from alone. In what has been depicted as one of the most striking political shifts in the history of the Italian republic, M5S became the biggest single party after taking 32% of the vote. Led by 31-year-old Luigi Di Maio, the party was founded less than a decade ago, but its strong performance was not unexpected. What did surprise was the far-right League’s victory within a coalition that included Silvio Berlusconi’s centre-right Forza Italia and the smaller far-right Brothers of Italy. The group won the largest share of the vote – 37% – although on a personal level it was a dismal result for Berlusconi, who at 81 is desperate to stay in the game. Still, it was even more destructive for the centre-left Democratic party, which had its worst ever performance. The election, which produced a hung parliament, exposed the country’s cavernous economic divisions as much as its political ones: M5S triumphed in the impoverished south, while the rightwing coalition dominated in the wealthier north. But in Naples, considered the heart of southern protest movements, the anti-establishment shift began much earlier. Naples was among the first cities to embrace M5S when it was founded in 2009. That was partly because two of its young activists were local: Di Maio was born in Avellino but grew up in nearby Pomigliano d’Arco, while parliamentarian Roberto Fico is a Neapolitan. However, the first major rejection of traditional parties came in 2011, when Luigi de Magistris, a former prosecutor from populist group Italy of Values, became mayor after more than a decade of centre-left administrations. “In a way, de Magistris pre-empted this protest vote,” said Mauro Calise, a politics professor at the University of Naples Federico II. Di Maio’s meteoric rise to leader undoubtedly enhanced M5S’s popularity in the city, where it scooped more than 50% of last week’s vote. In second place, with around 23%, was the centre-right alliance, with the Democratic party, led by former prime minister Matteo Renzi, in third. A message daubed on walls across the city laid bare the widespread sentiment: “No Renzi government”. “Two years ago you could not write about Italian politics without mentioning Renzi’s absolute rule within the party and government,” added Calise. “Now it is all about his definite demise. Once the old party system collapses, and this has been the case all over Europe with the exception of Germany, everything is up for a big change.” Naples’ residents are hoping they will be among the first to benefit from that sweeping change. “The Democratic party robbed us,” said Amato. “Berlusconi is a convicted criminal – how could we have voted for him? I support Di Maio because he seems honest. I’m not so sure he can change much, there are huge problems and he isn’t that well educated. We will have to wait and see.” Horse-trading is now under way between parties to reach the requisite 40% required to form a government. But if Di Maio, a former waiter who did not complete university, becomes prime minister, he faces a mammoth task in tackling his home region’s deeply entrenched problems, including extreme poverty, organised crime and the mafia’s toxic waste dumps, which have been linked to the high cancer rate. During one of his final rallies in the town of Caserta, he said the only way to confront the mafia was to send corrupt politicians home. Di Maio has been quick to deal with those he called “bad apples” in his own party, having expelled 10 parliamentarians who were exposed for defaulting on an obligation to put half of their wages into a fund for small businesses in the weeks before the vote. Amato said the move proves that M5S “kicks the crooks out”. Pasquale Giordano, who owns a butcher’s shop in Naples’ densely populated Spanish quarter, believes M5S and its fund will be the answer to his woes. “We small business owners keep Italy together; if it wasn’t for us the country would fall apart,” he says. Young Neapolitans also have high expectations of Di Maio. “He is young and seems closer to the people than the others,” said Giovanni Portoghese, a 20-year-old art student who voted for the first time last week. “Renzi is young too but he had his chance and failed.” Portoghese is one of a group of students who set up “Heart of Naples”, an initiative aimed partly at bringing the local community and the large foreign population closer together. In the election, the city defiantly snubbed the xenophobic League, whose leader, Matteo Salvini, has dismissed southern Italians as “parasites”. Along with its far-right ally, Brothers of Italy, it took less than 3% of the Naples vote. Di Maio is celebrating what he called the beginning of Italy’s Third Republic, or a “republic for citizens”. He was referring to the dominant political orders since Benito Mussolini’s fascist regime was overthrown at the end of the second world war. The so-called First Republic, which was led by the Christian Democrats or Socialists, fell in the early 1990s amid a series of scandals that exposed widespread corruption and mafia influence. In 1994, Berlusconi seized power, thus ushering in the Second Republic. Citizens are certainly taking Di Maio at his word, with supporters in Puglia already queuing up in job centres, earlier this week seeking the promised basic income. But pundits are starting to question whether he and his team will be capable of running such a hugely indebted and complicated country. Calise pointed to the poor track record and dwindling support in administrations already managed by M5S. In the northern city of Turin, led by mayor Chiara Appendino since June 2016, the Democratic party came out on top. Support for M5S also fell in Rome and Livorno, a city in Tuscany. “We’re talking about a protest vote, and one that came from a disadvantaged social structure,” said Calise. “It’s a way of saying ‘OK, let’s just get rid of this’. But it’s unstable. The big question now is, are they going to be able to respond to this protest? I suspect, once the euphoria dims, there will be volatility in both the party’s leadership and the electorate.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2018/mar/10/damian-hinds-school-leaders-conference-funding","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T15:33:39Z","webTitle":"Damian Hinds blames staff turnover for school funding pressure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/10/damian-hinds-school-leaders-conference-funding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/mar/10/damian-hinds-school-leaders-conference-funding","fields":{"headline":"Damian Hinds blames staff turnover for school funding pressure","bodyText":"The education secretary faced discontent from headteachers in England over school funding as he sought to win over the profession by promising to reduce their workload and avoid introducing new exams or major reforms. In his first major speech since taking over the role in January, Damian Hinds acknowledged to the Association of School and College Leaders annual conference on Saturday that funding was tight for schools, but his efforts to blame staff turnover were met with rumbles of disbelief. “I understand why, for everyone in this room, the funding of our schools and colleges is such an important topic,” Hinds said, in response to a question from Geoff Barton, ASCL’s general secretary. “It has been tough, funding is tight, I don’t deny that at all. I know there have been particular funding and cost pressures as well over the last couple of years. But one of those cost pressures, of course, comes from staff turnover, where you’re having to replace members of staff who have left. That incurs recruitment costs as well as the general upheaval that comes with that for the school or college.” Hinds’ answer was greeted by calls to answer the question, to which Barton, a former headteacher, replied: “We know there is no magic wand to find funding, we know the Department for Education is in a bind.” He urged the audience not to make the focus “headteachers shouting things out”. ASCL was among the teaching unions that issued a blunt analysis last week blaming funding pressures for a rise in secondary class sizes, which DfE officials said was fundamentally misleading. Hinds had earlier earned applause when he said there would be no new tests imposed on primary schools and no overhauls of the national curriculum, GCSE or A-levels for the remainder of the current parliament, beyond those already announced. Most of his address concerned the workload imposed on state school teachers, which he conceded was partly the result of government policies. “I do want to acknowledge the government’s part in this – because the pace of change has been fast these past eight years, as indeed, to be fair, it was pretty quick in many of the preceding years as well,” Hinds said. “Too many of our teachers and our school leaders are working simply too long hours – and too often on tasks that the evidence shows are not helping children to learn.” Amanda Spielman, the head of Ofsted, said school improvements could be jeopardised if the pressure on teachers was not reduced. “The record number of good and outstanding schools won’t be sustained if the people who make them run so well are burning out and leaving the profession,” Spielman told the conference. She said it was “an utter travesty” that young teachers had their enthusiasm crushed by the pressures of the job, “especially when so many of those pressures are entirely unnecessary”. The chief inspector picked out mock Ofsted inspections, data collection, triple-marking of pupils’ work and lengthy lesson plans as “a distraction from the core purpose of education. And a costly distraction at that.” Spielman said: “It really doesn’t matter what an inspectorate thinks if we can’t attract good people into teaching.” The DfE published research on teacher workload in advance of Hinds’ speech, with more than half of teachers interviewed for one study saying their workload pressures were “driven by high expectations set by members of their senior leadership team”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/15/pollutionwatch-cold-snap-worsens-particle-load-of-air","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T21:30:00Z","webTitle":"Pollutionwatch: Cold snap worsens air quality","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/15/pollutionwatch-cold-snap-worsens-particle-load-of-air","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/15/pollutionwatch-cold-snap-worsens-particle-load-of-air","fields":{"headline":"Pollutionwatch: Cold snap worsens air quality","bodyText":"The last days of the “beast from the east” cold spell caused air pollution problems across large parts of the UK, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. Within the UK particle pollution reached between five and 10 on the UK government’s 10-point scale over parts of south Wales and areas of England south of a Merseyside to Tyneside line, except the far south-west. Pollution from industry, traffic and home wood and coal burning can stay in the air for a week or up to 10 days. This means that pollution emitted in one part of Europe can cause problems hundreds of miles away. If the wind slows down then particle pollution can build up over a whole region. The particle pollution itself has been coming from many sources, including from coal burning in eastern Europe (Poland) and domestic heating in the UK and in other parts of western Europe. We have also been breathing particles arising from diesel exhaust and the burning of natural gas. Particles from heating were likely to have dominated in the cold spell; National Grid issued a gas supply warning. Normally wood smoke is measured during the evenings, but many people choose to keep warm in that cold period in front of a wood fire at home during the day. Wood smoke particles were measured throughout day-time hours across southern England from 1 March into the weekend. Over a timescale of hours and days wood smoke can undergo chemical reactions and produce more particle pollution. There is evidence that this added to the air pollution over England.

I was among those whose views he asked for. At the time Brailsford was going through something of a crisis over quite how to implement the team’s zero tolerance of past doping offences and the connections with those in the milieu who had a doping past. I forwarded Brailsford some ideas and I am sure the mere fact I did this will be cited by some as a classic example of a journalist getting far too close to his subject. I did not see it that way and I still don’t: it was an interesting academic exercise, which made me think around the whole area, and Brailsford had a perfect right to ignore what I said. I do not think it coloured my reporting of Team Sky, Chris Froome and Sir Bradley Wiggins. Those ideas were pretty obvious and centred on building trust: they included an independent audit of the entire team, beefed up internal anti-doping tests and bio passport monitoring, independently scrutinised by someone totally detached from the team. I cited a couple of names as examples of the kind of people who might be good for the independent auditor role, one from within business, one from anti-doping. I underlined the need for consistency and transparency. Which leads naturally to a burning question of today: what can Brailsford and Team Sky do to restore their collective reputation after last Monday’s devastating DCMS report? How can they rebuild their credibility from ground zero? There have been calls aplenty for Brailsford to resign: that should be the first step as I – and others – wrote 12 months ago. The reason is simple: Team Sky is his watch and the buck stops with him. Precisely what the buck is might depend on your view of the DCMS report but the loss of credibility cannot be denied. He should go, shouldering responsibility for what has happened, because he is the guy at the top. Clean break, new start, that kind of thing. Second, I would propose what I suggested six years ago: an independent audit of the team’s entire personnel, anti-doping policies plus, now, compliance policies and health policies, with recommendations to be published. Given that any individual called on by the team to do this would be accused of being inside the tent, one answer might be for the team to request that the UCI’s independent anti-doping body makes the appointment. They could be clear that this is not to suggest that their current policies are lacking – there is no evidence that they are – but as a measure to rebuild confidence after 18 months of revelation and innuendo. Third, join the MPCC, Movement for Credible Cycling. It has always seemed an anomaly that Team Sky were not part of this voluntary body which campaigns against corticosteroid and Tramadol use; their argument was that their internal procedures made it unnecessary. It would be an easy step to take now to restore trust. Again, it is not necessarily to suggest they have weak policies at present but it is part of regaining public confidence. Having Brailsford resign would make it easier to reverse past policy in this way. Clean break, new start… Fourth, with the riders’ agreement, undertake to publish all Therapeutic Use Exemptions applied for in future as long as privacy is not infringed, ie, they do not relate to issues of mental or sexual health. There will not be many TUEs to make public but it is about being transparent and being seen to be so. Fifth, gain the riders’ agreement to carry out an annual audit of Tramadol use – which rider, what race, what injury necessitated it, quantity taken – and publish the findings. There may be a medical confidentiality argument here but given that in most instances these will be crash victims whose injuries will be made public at the time, it might not hold much water. Sixth, publish the study into Team Sky’s Colombian rider Sergio Henao’s blood values. The quest for maximum transparency means that it should not be possible to accuse Team Sky of keeping anything away from public scrutiny. Seventh, go public with more riders’ power values more often. Sky’s argument against doing this was always that it would cause debate, create space for speculation about what the figures meant and so on. Given the epic amounts of white noise in recent months, that hardly carries weight. Remember how grudgingly Froome’s figures were published, and recall how distant and barely relevant that appears in today’s turmoil. Finally, stand down Froome from racing until his Salbutamol adverse analytical finding is resolved. Joining the MPCC would mean this would have to happen as it is part of its guidelines. The public relations benefits are blindingly obvious, whether the eventual decision goes Froome’s way or not. Post-DCMS, it would demonstrate a clear change in philosophy: winning is important but there are bigger things in sport than a place in the record books. How you are perceived matters as much. Otherwise Froome races on in the face of public opinion and against the wishes of many in the sport."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/10/edwulf-gold-cup-cheltenham","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T12:47:28Z","webTitle":"Edwulf chasing Gold Cup a year after Cheltenham feared the worst","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/10/edwulf-gold-cup-cheltenham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/10/edwulf-gold-cup-cheltenham","fields":{"headline":"Edwulf chasing Gold Cup a year after Cheltenham feared the worst","bodyText":"One of the oddest sights at the last Cheltenham Festival was the talented novice chaser Edwulf doing a fair impression of a gazelle in the late stages of the National Hunt Chase, his powerful stride suddenly becoming a most unnatural lope. “Odd” is how it looks now, in the comforting knowledge that he made a full recovery; at the time it was a cause for alarm and then despair. Having been in second place after the last of 25 fences, Edwulf slowed to a stop in a matter of yards. As the cameras averted their gaze, one TV pundit mourned “what seems to have happened to him”, perhaps knowing, as viewers did not, that Edwulf had then collapsed and was being tended by vets behind green screens. Sometimes, a horse rises from behind those screens to relieved appreciation from the grandstands, having got its breath back after 10 minutes or so. Edwulf was still on the ground 40 minutes later, having been slid off to the side of the track so the last race could be run. There was no reason for hope and in the press room that evening there was an undercurrent of irritation at what seemed an unjustifiable delay by racecourse staff in confirming the inevitable bad news. It was most surprising to learn the next morning that Edwulf was, in fact, still breathing. It was amazing when he showed no lasting effects just a fortnight later as he returned to his Kilkenny stable, and nothing short of flabbergasting when he won the Irish Gold Cup last month as a 33-1 chance on only his second run since the day he appeared to be on his way out. “I never had a horse do what he did,” said his jockey, Derek O’Connor, after that wildly unlikely moment of glory. “He ran himself into the ground for me at Cheltenham. We thought his career was over but he’s after coming back to his best.” On Friday Edwulf gets a chance to take his story into the realm of Hollywood wish fulfilment when he lines up in jump racing’s most prestigious contest, the Cheltenham Gold Cup. He is once more unfancied and can be backed at 25-1 but somehow this is not off‑putting in the case of a horse who has so thoroughly beaten the odds in the past year. “It was an amazing recovery,” recalls Liam Kearns, Cheltenham’s head vet. There were several low points, including when Edwulf went into a fit as he lay on the track and later that night when it was discovered he had gone blind. But Kearns was sustained by the knowledge that the horse had not suffered any bone break or spinal injury, no trauma that would naturally lead to sudden death, so he and his team steadily nursed Edwulf to a point the next day when, at a nearby equine hospital, he was standing and eating and had recovered his vision. As for what caused Edwulf to suffer such distress, Kearns says: “He didn’t fit in with the typical signs we would see with heat stress. The neurological signs he showed would be more consistent with an acute oxygen deficit to the brain. You sometimes see it in triathletes, where, as well as showing fatigue, they show incoordination.” Kearns cannot recall a case like it in his 30 years working at racecourses and sees no reason why Edwulf should suffer a repeat or be troubled by any memory of it when he returns to Cheltenham. “I would say not. He recovered well, he’s been back in training, doing what he was bred to do, galloping with other horses, the natural thing for the horse to do. So I wouldn’t see any after-effects from that point of view.” At all events, if something does go wrong this week, Kearns and his team are well placed to support any possible recovery. “There is a very experienced team at Cheltenham and we are afforded any facilities we want for the care of the horses. We have people on foot as well as people in mobile vehicles to cover the track. These horses are well looked after at home, veterinary-wise and otherwise, and our job is to maintain that high level of care at the racecourse.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/11/observer-view-on-trump-blunder-kim-jong-un-north-korea-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T06:07:21Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on talks between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/11/observer-view-on-trump-blunder-kim-jong-un-north-korea-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/11/observer-view-on-trump-blunder-kim-jong-un-north-korea-talks","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on talks between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un","bodyText":"Will Donald Trump ever meet Kim Jong-un? It is a reasonable question, given the US leader’s changeable moods and the fact that the North Korean dictator has yet to issue an official invitation. Trump could barely contain his excitement last week after a South Korean delegation passed on Kim’s suggestion of a meeting by May. He appeared unannounced in the White House briefing room to tip off reporters that big news was about to break. But Trump’s exhilaration was not about averting the nuclear Armageddon he himself so recently threatened. It was about his chance of securing a place in history as the man who “solved” the 70-year-old Korean conundrum. Trump saw a golden chance to posture as peacemaker before an admiring world. So without consulting his closest and better-informed advisers, he took Kim’s bait. It would be wonderful if North Korea were to give up its nuclear weapons. It would be wonderful if the US did so, too. Neither occurrence is remotely likely in the foreseeable future. According to the South Koreans, Kim expressed commitment to denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. But this is nothing new for Pyongyang. It made similar offers in 1985, 1992, 1994, 2005 and 2010. On each occasion, for a variety of reasons, the promises came to nothing. Trump does not study history; indeed, he apparently does not read much at all. He does not understand that when North Korea talks about denuclearisation, it means, primarily, the removal from the region of the US nuclear weapons the regime finds so threatening. Washington has never given such an undertaking and there is zero sign it will do so in future. It demands nothing less than North Korea’s unilateral disarmament. The deal offered to North Korea under the defunct six-party talks process, before it attained its current nuclear capabilities, involved the lifting of UN sanctions, security guarantees, economic aid and assistance with developing peaceful nuclear energy. These “normalisation” carrots will again be dangled if talks resume – but not the withdrawal of the American nuclear umbrella that ostensibly shields South Korea and Japan. Yet the moment for such a deal has passed. It passed when Kim declared in November that North Korea had become a fully fledged nuclear weapons state with long-range missiles capable of hitting anywhere in the US. The game has fundamentally changed, a fact the Americans find hard to accept. It is fanciful to believe that Kim, after years of national striving and sacrifice, is suddenly prepared to surrender his newly perfected weapons in the absence of equivalent US actions. What he wants now is the recognition and security that possession of such weapons brings. By luring the impulsive Trump into a high-profile summit, Kim has everything to gain. He will boost his prestige within North Korea’s ruling party and among the populace at large. The domestic propaganda dividend will be enormous. By dealing with a US president on equal terms, Kim will dishearten all those who hope for a progressive, democratic future in North Korea. Most concerning of all, perhaps, a Trump-Kim summit, even if only symbolic, will legitimise North Korea’s status as a nuclear weapons state that the world’s most powerful nation must court and woo. The fateful lesson that Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi failed to learn, namely, that possession of nuclear weapons equals personal and regime survival, will be reinforced. For all these reasons, more sensible people in the Trump administration are already rowing back. The White House now says North Korea must first make unspecified “concrete steps” before any summit takes place. The risk is that in compensating for Trump’s foolishness, US officials may go too far the other way and wreck the opening for dialogue painstakingly won by South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, through his Olympics diplomacy. It is vitally important to talk to North Korea. More Trump grandstanding is not the way to do it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/10/nhs-falsely-accuses-thousands-patients-prescription-fraud","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T11:54:00Z","webTitle":"NHS agency falsely accuses more than 340,000 of prescription fraud","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/10/nhs-falsely-accuses-thousands-patients-prescription-fraud","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/10/nhs-falsely-accuses-thousands-patients-prescription-fraud","fields":{"headline":"NHS agency falsely accuses more than 340,000 of prescription fraud","bodyText":"Hundreds of thousands of NHS patients are being wrongly accused of fraudulently claiming free prescriptions and are being threatened with fines. Data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows that 1,052,430 penalty notices were issued to patients in England in 2017 – about double the level in the previous year. The fines, which carry a maximum penalty of £100 and are issued to those who wrongly claim free medication, are issued after an NHS exemption certificate has expired. But the data confirms that 342,882 penalty notices were subsequently withdrawn because the patient was entitled to the free prescription. “These Freedom of Information requests appear to show a penalty system that is dysfunctional,” said Lucy Watson, chair of the Patients Association. “Any organisation issuing penalty notices and then having to withdraw nearly one in three because they were issued in error is not operating as it should. This compounds the unjust and haphazard nature of prescription charging in England, with some patients facing substantial costs to manage their conditions, and others being entitled to free prescriptions.” Part of the problem stems from patients moving home and failing to update their records. The NHS Business Services Authority, the agency in charge of issuing the fines, said it was continually reviewing its data-matching process and making improvements to ensure eligible patients were not wrongly pursued. It said it was also trying to educate patients on the importance of keeping the details on both their GP records and their exemption or prescription prepayment certificates up to date. “The NHS loses millions each year through fraudulent and incorrect claims for free prescriptions,” said Alison O’Brien, head of loss recovery services at the authority. “On behalf of NHS England, and in discussion with the Department of Health and Social Care, the NHS Business Services Authority checks claims randomly and retrospectively to appropriately recover funds and return them to NHS services.” Peter Burt, a patient who was wrongly issued with one of the penalty notices, said he worried about how certain patients would react to receiving one. “Some of the people who received these notices will certainly be in vulnerable situations and some will be receiving prescription medication for anxiety and mental health issues,” Burt said. “They should not be receiving letters threatening court action just because the NHS can’t be bothered to check the records to see whether they have a prepayment card – especially if there is no intention of carrying out the threat. It’s hugely disappointing that, at a time when clinical services are clearly facing financial strains, the NHS bureaucracy is wasting money by sending out hundreds of thousands of inaccurate demands every year.” Watson said more problems lay ahead if further planned changes to the way medicines were prescribed were introduced. “The bureaucracy around prescriptions is unfit for purpose, and will only get worse if NHS England introduces its planned restrictions on prescribing over the counter medicines,” she said. “Serving notice of penalties for free prescriptions on patients who may be vulnerable and unwell and are then required to demonstrate their right to a free prescription cannot be a compassionate and caring way to manage this system.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/10/jonny-bairstow-blasts-england-to-odi-series-triumph-in-new-zealand","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T08:26:11Z","webTitle":"Jonny Bairstow blasts England to ODI series triumph in New Zealand","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/10/jonny-bairstow-blasts-england-to-odi-series-triumph-in-new-zealand","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/10/jonny-bairstow-blasts-england-to-odi-series-triumph-in-new-zealand","fields":{"headline":"Jonny Bairstow blasts England to ODI series triumph in New Zealand","bodyText":"They came for a classic but Jonny Bairstow gave them a blowout. England made it six ODI series wins in a row with an emphatic seven-wicket triumph at a rammed Hagley Oval thanks to Bairstow’s remarkable 58-ball hundred. His fourth in the format and second in four days secured a 3-2 win, also putting him on the podium as third fastest scored by an Englishman in ODIs. Not for the first time, it was the bowlers who put England in contention, restricting New Zealand to 223 all out. The absence of Ross Taylor, who aggravated his quadriceps injury during his match-winning, unbeaten 180 in the fourth ODI, took the punch out of their middle order. But exemplary new ball work from Mark Wood and Chris Woakes – named man of the series for his 10 wickets at 20.30 – reduced the Blackcaps to 26 for two, before Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali combined, bowling their full allocations through unhindered, to inflict a collapse of four wickets for 33 runs. Yet, even though the hosts were able to cobble together a target of 224, Bairstow’s 10-over display, in which he smashed eight fours, six sixes and even his own stumps, made the other 72.3 overs of play academic. “I’m really happy,” said Bairstow, whose face said it all. “After being in and out of the side for a couple of years, getting the odd game here and there, to come in and contribute in a role I’ve not necessarily done a huge amount previously for England, you’re still kind of learning – it’s really pleasing for me to go out and score hundreds.” It’s worth noting that all four of those hundreds have come since his ascension as opener. “That’s your job, to make chases like that – ones that shouldn’t be difficult but can be very tricky.” A fine dab – boundary No 14 – and a single took him to three figures, just 20 balls needed for his second 50. The most brutal part, which took the result beyond doubt, was a period in which five of eight deliveries he faced from Ish Sodhi were blazed for six. The first brought up the century opening stand from 15.3 overs with Alex Hales, returning to the side for the first time since signing a white-ball only contract with Nottinghamshire, after Jason Roy pulled out with a back spasm. Dropped at the start of the series, with head coach Trevor Bayliss worried a lack of red ball cricket could be detrimental to his game, his measured 61 offers others reassurance and him credit in the bank. When Bairstow hit his own wicket going back to lace Trent Boult at the start of the 21st over, the game was as good as done. Officially, a four and six from Ben Stokes saw England home by 108 balls. Eoin Morgan, in his 200th ODI, won a crucial toss and backed his bowlers in the field. Woakes removed Colin Munro for his second duck in a row before Mark Wood’s patented leap across and angled delivery into the right-hander did for Blackcaps skipper Kane Williamson. Rashid, given the luxury of one on each side of the wicket, took his best haul of the series with three wickets of equal importance. The in-form Tom Latham and Martin Guptill, the only top five batsman to get the measure of this pitch, both found Stokes, at midwicket and cover, respectively. Colin de Grandhomme then picked out Tom Curran at long on to reduce New Zealand to 93 for six. That would be Curran’s only involvement till the 40th over, by which point New Zealand had turned around their position to 151 for six. Henry Nicholls ended a barren series with his sixth ODI half-century, the guts of which came in an 84-run stand with Mitchell Santner, himself going on to his second 50 in three innings. After two not out scores and a run out at the non-striker’s end, Santner was finally dismissed by a bowler, falling in Woakes’s final over to the first of two stunning catches. Hales’s tumbling effort at deep square leg set the standard, only for Bairstow to better it two balls later: a one-handed grab after scarpering along the boundary, within a whisker of the sponge, accounting for Tim Southee. “It’s been a good day,” smirked Bairstow. Victory with hours to spare left the 9,012 who flooded the banks with plans to make. Bairstow’s brilliance not only scuppered bowling plans, but social ones, too. But for England, it was about righting the wrongs of the fourth ODI in Dunedin, when a commanding position was spurned to allow New Zealand to scrape back to 2-2. A winner-takes-all tie was not to go the same way. “That wasn’t good enough from us,” stated Bairstow. “We know we needed to put in a clinical and ruthless performance here and that’s exactly what we did.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/10/west-virginia-teachers-strike-resistance","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T15:34:56Z","webTitle":"The West Virginia teachers' strike is what real resistance looks like | Jeff Biggers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/10/west-virginia-teachers-strike-resistance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/10/west-virginia-teachers-strike-resistance","fields":{"headline":"The West Virginia teachers' strike is what real resistance looks like","bodyText":"The victorious strike by teachers in West Virginia did not only result in a long overdue pay raise. With the exuberance of a nine-day teach-in, the teachers and their supporters have taught the nation a compelling lesson on the historical role of a true resistance. Taking to the streets, picketing on the sidewalks, and charging into the Capitol itself, the strike turned the public commons into a counter space for “we the people.” One by one, the roughly 20,000 teachers in West Virginia essentially forced lawmakers – and the nation – to stop our daily routine and address the growing education crisis on the terms of those most devoted to ensuring the best outcomes for our children: our teachers. This is why strikes, more than one-day protests, often bring lasting victories. It took an uncompromising walk-out to get West Virginia lawmakers to recognize that our inability to commit to a living wage and decent health benefits for our teachers mirrors our negligence in investing in classrooms for our children. Instead of a fleeting protest, the hardship of the open-ended West Virginia strike reflected the urgency of our times and the long-haul commitment of the teachers for an enduring resolution, not a compromise or some sort of fleeting gain. With an estimated 10% of the American workforce reportedly in a union, the legacy of striking might have become a lost tactic to some. As the son of a union teacher and the grandson of a union coal miner, I believe the West Virginia teachers have renewed a strategic call for other movements engaged in what we have called a “resistance” against the onslaught of policies decisions and regulatory rollbacks by the Trump administration. The time has come to employ strikes in other areas. When it comes to dealing with the inexorable grip of the National Rifle Association lobby on our gun policies or the undue influence of the oil, gas and coal lobbies on our energy and climate plans, for example, wide-scale strikes by students, teachers and all concerned citizens may be our last best hope for policy changes today. Imagine how quickly we could begin to deal with gun control, if all pre-school employees, teachers and staff walked out and went on an indefinite strike – and the large majority of supporters, according to most polls, joined them. Imagine how swiftly we could start the process of transitioning to renewable energy alternatives, low-carbon transportation designs, local food and regenerative agricultural policies, if all school employees, teachers and students refused to teach and study in schools powered by carbon emission-spewing fossil fuels that are destabilizing our planet. The strike in West Virginia has powerfully revived this historic tactic for the rest of the nation. Addressing the same egregious combination of low wages and underfunded schools in bottom-rung states like Arizona and Oklahoma, teachers are wearing red in solidarity this week and negotiating the terms of their own possible walk-outs to raise attention to the instability of school districts that have been gutted by disastrous funding policies. This is a tactical lesson of resistance that reminds us that our schools have always served as the front lines of the challenges of inequality facing our communities. This kind of resistance does not allow onlookers to look away, especially in an age of social media. It brings the story to those who have refused to read it. It forces everyone to take part in the national discussion, and engage in the still small possibility of justice.

Swan said on Saturday he had entered the field “because I want to make a contribution to winning the battle of ideas with the radical right that have taken over the Liberal party of Australia”. The right faction’s candidate was expected to be the union official Tony Sheldon, but Swan has been prevailed upon by colleagues to run because he is likely to attract support from left-leaning rank and file party members. Swan, from the backbench, has pushed Labor to adopt a more assertively progressive and redistributive position on economic policy and tax, periodically tweaking the nose of his successor in the treasury portfolio, Chris Bowen. “Millions of Australians rely on us to be an effective political force, they want us to fight inequality and restrict the power of vested interests, and I want to work with you to make our Labor party bigger, better, and more effective,” Swan said on Saturday. Butler, who confirmed at the beginning of the month that he would seek the presidency for a second term to push a democratisation agenda before the party’s mid-year national conference – has infuriated the right faction with his front-running. The opposition spokesman for shadow climate change went on the offensive at the opening of the political year, delivering two significant speeches warning that Labor needed to do more to empower rank and file members and diminish the relative power of factional and union leaders. He said that despite repeated calls by many for the ALP to democratise and allow party members a vote in processes such as the selection of Senate candidates, “not enough reform has happened since then”. “Still, too many important decisions are taken by a few factional power brokers, rather than by our many members,” Butler said when confirming his candidacy. Historically, within Labor culture, rightwingers resist proposals for democratisation because such moves could boost the internal power of the left in party forums. Left candidates generally prevail in open party ballots because rank-and-file membership skews left in big inner-city branches. Butler’s public provocations triggered the push to get Swan to run, and there were reports that officials could also seek a rule change banning Labor frontbenchers from contesting the party’s presidency – an apparent response to Butler’s positioning. The internal view was Butler would have prevailed easily in a vote where Sheldon was his opponent, but Swan’s decision to step forward makes the party presidency a contest. Swan’s pitch to party members will draw on his public campaigning on inequality since leaving the Labor front bench. On Saturday he said: “Over the years I’ve stared in the eyes of the plutocrats who run the Liberal party, I know we need a united effort to beat them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/mar/11/tim-berners-lee-tech-companies-regulations","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T00:05:02Z","webTitle":"Tim Berners-Lee: we must regulate tech firms to prevent 'weaponised' web","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/11/tim-berners-lee-tech-companies-regulations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/mar/11/tim-berners-lee-tech-companies-regulations","fields":{"headline":"Tim Berners-Lee: we must regulate tech firms to prevent 'weaponised' web","bodyText":"Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, has called for large technology firms to be regulated to prevent the web from being “weaponised at scale”. Berners-Lee, in an open letter to mark the 29th anniversary of his invention, said: “In recent years, we’ve seen conspiracy theories trend on social media platforms, fake Twitter and Facebook accounts stoke social tensions, external actors interfere in elections, and criminals steal troves of personal data.” These problems have proliferated because of the concentration of power in the hands of a few platforms – including Facebook, Google, and Twitter – which “control which ideas and opinions are seen and shared”. “What was once a rich selection of blogs and websites has been compressed under the powerful weight of a few dominant platforms,” said the 62-year-old British computer scientist. These online gatekeepers can lock in their power by acquiring smaller rivals, buying up new innovations and hiring the industry’s top talent, making it harder for others to compete, he said. Google now accounts for about 87% of online searches worldwide. Facebook has more than 2.2 billion monthly active users – more than 20 times more than MySpace at its peak. Together, the two companies (including their subsidiaries Instagram and YouTube) slurp up more than 60% of digital advertising spend worldwide. Although the companies are aware of the problems and have made efforts to fix them – developing systems to tackle fake news, bots and influence operations – they have been built to “maximise profit more than maximise social good”. “A legal or regulatory framework that accounts for social objectives may help ease those tensions,” he said. Aligning the incentives of the technology sector with those of users and society at large, he argued, will require consulting a diverse group of people from business, government, civil society, academia and the arts. Berners-Lee warned of “two myths” that “limit our collective imagination” when looking for solutions to the problems facing the web: “The myth that advertising is the only possible business model for online companies, and the myth that it’s too late to change the way platforms operate. On both points we need to be a little more creative,” he said. “I want the web to reflect our hopes and fulfil our dreams, rather than magnify our fears and deepen our divisions,” he said. The open letter coincides with a significant milestone: 2018 is the first year that more than half of the world’s population will be online. This still leaves a gaping “digital divide” that exacerbates existing inequalities: you are more likely to be offline if you are female, poor, or live in a rural area or a low-income country. “To be offline today is to be excluded from opportunities to learn and earn, to access valuable services, and to participate in democratic debate,” Berners-Lee said. “If we do not invest seriously in closing this gap, the last billion will not be connected until 2042. That’s an entire generation left behind.” Two years ago, the UN declared internet access to be a basic human right on par with clean water, shelter, food and electricity. However, in many places, getting online is prohibitively expensive – the cost of 1GB of mobile broadband in Malawi is more than 20% of the average monthly income. In Zimbabwe, it is nearly 45%. The open letter comes a year after Berners-Lee called for tighter regulation of online political advertising, which he said was being used in “unethical ways”. Since then, representatives from Facebook, Twitter and Google have been hauled in front of Congress to answer questions over the extent to which their platforms were used in a multi-pronged Russian operation to influence the 2016 presidential election. All three admitted that Russian entities bought ads on their sites in an attempt to skew the vote. Russians posed as Americans to buy ads on Facebook pushing divisive messages focusing on swing states. They also spent tens of thousands of dollars on ads to spread disinformation across YouTube and Google. On Twitter, swarms of bots helped promote fake news stories. All three companies have since announced measures to improve transparency over who is buying political ads on their platforms and what messages they are promoting. Berners-Lee has always maintained that his creation was a reflection of humanity – the good, the bad and the ugly. However, his vision to create an “open platform that allows anyone to share information, access opportunities and collaborate across geographical boundaries” has been challenged as the web has become more centralised. “I’m still an optimist, but an optimist standing at the top of the hill with a nasty storm blowing in my face, hanging on to a fence,” he told the Guardian in November. “We have to grit our teeth and hang on to the fence and not take it for granted that the web will lead us to wonderful things.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/11/jfk-kennedys-photography-exhibition-mark-shaw","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T00:05:15Z","webTitle":"Life with the Kennedys revealed in photography show","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/11/jfk-kennedys-photography-exhibition-mark-shaw","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/11/jfk-kennedys-photography-exhibition-mark-shaw","fields":{"headline":"Life with the Kennedys revealed in photography show","bodyText":"New York photographer Mark Shaw began his career capturing the images of stars such Elizabeth Taylor and Audrey Hepburn for Life magazine, but the back catalogue he left on his death in 1969 at the age of 47 is best known for the candid glimpse it offers into the home life of the Kennedys. Now Shaw’s photographs of President John F Kennedy’s family, taken both at the White House and at their summer retreat at Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, are to go on show at the Proud Central gallery near the Strand in London. Chronicling the charismatic couple at the heart of a presidential court that became known as Camelot, Shaw’s historic shots were taken over the period in which Kennedy ascended from the role of senator to president. Among the key photographs on show will be JFK’s favourite portrait of himself, as well as shots of Jackie playing with her children. One of the most striking images shows Jackie leaning out of the family sailing boat clutching Shaw’s camera. The photographer became a close friend of the family after he was commissioned to take a series of casual studies of Jacqueline during the presidential campaign of 1959. Following Kennedy’s assassination in 1963, Shaw was so affected he distanced himself from photography. On Shaw’s death his photos were put in storage and unseen for more than 40 years until Shaw’s son and his wife founded The Mark Shaw Photographic Archive in 1996 and his pictures were republished in a book.

Some of this expelled waste has been causing a major stink 900 miles away, in Alabama. Residents in and near Birmingham have been in uproar over sewage that is transported by train and truck from New York and New Jersey to be dumped in the southern state. The treated sewage – euphemistically known in the industry as “biosolids” – has plagued residents with a terrible stench, flies and concerns that spilled sludge has leaked into waterways. “On a hot day, the odor and flies are horrific,” said Charles Nix, mayor of West Jefferson, a town near the landfill that accepts the waste. “It’s better in winter time but if the wind blows in the wrong direction you get the smell. It’s like dead, rotting animals. “If you get close to the trucks the liquid would blow off on to your windshield and fill your car with a stink. It spilled out on to the road. Some people were saying they just wanted to move away, they were so miserable.” Last year, Big Sky Environmental, a landfill west of Birmingham, got permission from Alabama authorities to accept sewage waste, despite objections from residents. Initially, the waste was taken down from New York and New Jersey to a rail spur near West Jefferson, where it was loaded on to trucks that rumbled through the town toward the landfill. Jefferson county, where West Jefferson sits, decided the use of the rail spur was a violation of zoning laws, so the transport operation shifted the the nearby town of Parrish, which in turn sought to eject the malodorous cargo. Amid the squabble, the sewage sludge backed up in railcars in Birmingham, causing the mayor’s office to complain about the “death smell”. “It greatly reduces the quality of life of anybody that this is around,” said Heather Hall, mayor of Parrish. “You cannot go outside, you can’t sit on your porch, and this stuff, it’s here in our town. It’s not like it’s an industrial area.” The outsourcing of New York and New Jersey’s waste to Alabama revived memories of the “poop train” that ferried New York’s waste to farmers in Colorado until 2012. Since the Environmental Protection Agency decided in 1988 that it was not a great idea to simply pump it into the ocean, where to put New York’s fecal matter has become a constant challenge – the city creates around 1,200 tons of sewage every day. Billions of gallons of raw sewage still spills into New York harbor each year but the waters around the largest US cities are significantly cleaner than in the 1980s and the metropolis has touted its water treatment processes. Last year, it quietly decided Alabama should be the resting point for some of its waste. “I guess we are not even as good as the fish, down here in Alabama,” said Nix. “Every state should be responsible for its own waste. We don’t want it dumped here.” Stung by the outcry, New York has severed its links to Big Sky Environmental, although city officials failed to answer questions on how much sewage was still being transported to other states. Around 7% of New York City’s treated sewage went to the Alabama landfill, according to a city spokesman, adding that a recent inspection by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management found “no odor or leaks”. “However, as a precaution and to better understand local concern, we have discontinued utilizing this facility,” the spokesman added. In Alabama, the avalanche of northern poo is part of a wider concern over the environmental risks faced by residents, particularly the impoverished and people of colour. The Big Sky Environmental site can take 25,000 tons of waste a day from all 48 contiguous states. Further south, a landfill abutting the majority African American settlement of Uniontown contains around 4m tons of toxic coal ash and welcomes other debris from 33 states. “We have a major problem in Alabama in that we are the dumping ground for the nation,” said Nelson Brooke, of environmental group Black Warrior Riverkeeper. “We don’t have a good regulatory system and we have a lot of landfills. We should start setting our sights on protecting communities and our natural resources.” A spokeswoman for the Alabama Department of Environmental Management said it was undertaking an “in-depth review” of the concerns raised by residents while deciding whether to renew the landfill’s permit. She added that the department “understands and empathizes with the residents of the nearby communities”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/14/cancun-tourist-paradise-mexico-drug-violence","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"Cancún: from tourist beach paradise to hotbed of Mexico's drug violence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/14/cancun-tourist-paradise-mexico-drug-violence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/14/cancun-tourist-paradise-mexico-drug-violence","fields":{"headline":"Cancún: from tourist beach paradise to hotbed of Mexico's drug violence","bodyText":"The Playamed hospital is an unremarkable two-storey building on a quiet street lined with red-blossomed flame trees, just a few minutes’ drive from the white-sand beaches and all-inclusive resorts of Cancún’s hotel zone. Recently, however, it was the setting for an incident underlining the relentless spread of Mexico’s drug war to cities previously best known as beach holiday destinations. Four gunmen burst into a private room at the clinic last week, where they shot dead Alfonso Contreras Espinoza and his wife. Known as “El Poncho”, the murdered man was reputed to be the local boss for the Gulf cartel, and had been released from a local prison to receive treatment for a leg problem. Investigators discovered a bag of white powder under his leg and a scale, suggesting that Contreras had been dealing from his sickbed. On a recent morning, hospital officials declined to comment on the brazen attack. Paramedics standing in the shade outside looked away or stared into their smartphones when asked about the incident. Not so long ago, Cancún sparkled as the crown jewel of Mexico’s Mayan Riviera. But rampant corruption, chaotic development and a string of murders have all tarnished the resort city’s reputation. Other tourist hotspots have also been caught in Mexico’s red tide: Acapulco, once the country’s most glamorous beach spot, is now the setting for relentless gang violence; late last year, the bodies of six men were left hanging from bridges near Los Cabos on the Baja California peninsula. Earlier this month, a Mexican thinktank named Los Cabos the world’s most dangerous city outside a war zone. The problems of Mexico’s resort cities mirror those of the country, which last year suffered its most murderous year in memory. But violence here threatens a key industry: Mexico welcomed nearly 40 million visitors in 2017. Tourism accounts for about 8% of Mexico’s GDP and has long been a ready source of employment for the country’s poor. Thanks to their strategic locations and transitory populations, Mexico’s tourist destinations have also been prime territory for the country’s criminal groups. Meanwhile, the government’s strategy of targeting “kingpins” has exacerbated the conflict, as crime groups fracture into rival factions competing for territory and trade. In Cancún, at least four cartels are thought to be contesting routes to smuggle cocaine in from South America and a local drug market targeting tourists and locals. Over the past year the upstart Jalisco New Generation cartel (CJNG) has been moving into the resort city, pushing out other groups such as the Gulf cartel. “[The CJNG] shoot first and ask questions later,” said a source who works on public security issues in Cancún. “These are their methods and they’re now here.” Political corruption and collusion between politicians and criminal groups is also believed to have exacerbated the problem. One former governor of the surrounding state of Quintana Roo, Roberto Borge, awaits trial on accusations of graft after being extradited from Panama. During his 2010-2016 administration, hotel and land owners in Tulum were forced to hand over their properties in complex schemes involving notaries and judges. Journalists who investigated allegations of official wrongdoing were arrested on trumped-up charges. Mauricio Góngora, the former mayor of Playa del Carmen, just south of Cancún, was arrested after an unsuccessful election campaign to succeed Borge as state governor, and stands accused of misappropriating £9.5m ($13.3m). “Corruption was escalating and the [Borge] government’s excesses became unsustainable,” said Vicente Carrera, publisher of Noticaribe, an online news outlet in Playa del Carmen. “When the new state government arrived [in late 2016] everything was on its head.” Amid political turmoil in the state, violence has increasingly encroached on tourist areas, including Playa del Carmen’s fabled Quinta Avenida. Last week, the US government issued a security warning for Playa del Carmen, and temporarily closed its consulate after receiving information about a “security threat”. The warning followed an explosion on a tourist ferry, which injured 19 Mexicans and at least five US citizens in Playa del Carmen. Local authorities said the blast was caused by engine failure, but later investigators said it was caused by explosives. Another device was found on a second ferry, but officials discounted any connection with cartel violence and said tourists had nothing to worry about, although the federal government deployed black-uniformed police and bomb-sniffing dogs to patrol the wharfs and the beach areas. “The government always wants to downplay the violence,” said Daniel Pérez Villaseñor, a labour lawyer and activist in Cancún. “The [state] governor doesn’t have a plan for fighting the violence,” he said. “They just want to put some makeup on Cancún to give it a good image.” Much is riding on that image. According to Roberto Cintrón, the president of the local hotel association, Cancún airport is receiving a record number of arrivals. Hotel occupancy hovers at 83%. Cancún was little more than a fishing town when the federal government first bet big on tourism in the early 1970s. The original plan called for a hotel zone and separate residential area. But as tourism grew, it drew an unexpected influx of migrants from Mexico’s impoverished southern states seeking employment. They settled on the fringes of the city, where the ramshackle homes and rutted roads feel a world away from the manicured lawns and pricey shops of the hotel zone. That contrast raises uncomfortable questions about the benefits of tourism. Wages for workers in the tourism industry are low and benefits scant, while hotel owners pay few taxes and often hire through outsourcing to avoid paying social security contributions, said Pérez. And while tourists have so far been largely insulated from the violence, the same is not true of residents: a survey in December showed that 84.9% of Cancún’s inhabitants consider the city “unsafe”. Many outlying neighbourhoods lack basic services. Such neglect has been symbolised by a huge pothole which opened in a busy street 15 years ago and still has not been repaired. Local residents recently celebrated the anniversary by throwing a birthday party for the flooded hole and installing a 100-meter zip line over the muddy water. “This is a first world city with third world services,” said José Pech, an electrician who built the zip line. “The governments we have are the worst. They’re worse than the criminals,” he said. “If they had paid proper attention to the people, if there wasn’t such corruption, organised crime wouldn’t exist as it does now.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/10/the-resistance-now-indivisible-midterms","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T14:00:02Z","webTitle":"Indivisible founders anticipate 'a lot of good surprises' in November's midterms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/10/the-resistance-now-indivisible-midterms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/10/the-resistance-now-indivisible-midterms","fields":{"headline":"Indivisible founders anticipate 'a lot of good surprises' in November's midterms","bodyText":"The Resistance Now is a weekly update on the people, action and ideas driving the protest movement in the US. If you’re not already receiving it by email, subscribe. If Democrats take back the House, Senate or both in the 2018 midterm elections, it will have been with the help of Indivisible, a leading resistance movement organization that was formed after the 2016 election by husband and wife Ezra Levin and Leah Greenberg. On the sidelines of the annual Progressive Caucus Center Strategy Summit in Baltimore, Levin sat down with the Guardian to talk about student activism, the midterms and why contentious primaries are not a bad thing. (This interview has been edited and condensed for brevity.) The Guardian: Progressives are pretty excited ahead of 2018, especially after the Democratic primaries in Texas. What was your takeaway? Ezra Levin: What we saw in Texas is what we’re seeing across the country in all of the special elections that have occurred so far: folks are jazzed up. When we started, we got a lot of questions like, “You’re advocating; you’re doing town halls; you’re calling members of Congress; you’re holding die-ins, but can you actually electoralize this? Can you actually win elections?” I think that question has been answered pretty definitively, again and again and again, in Alabama, in Virginia. The story is that a lot of folks who were never really involved in politics before are suddenly getting involved, and that changes the game because politics is a participatory support so suddenly when you have more people participating you get different outcomes. Guardian: Democratic primaries are crowded and, in some races, contentious. What is Indivisible’s strategy? Levin: Indivisible national is a network of 6,000 groups. At the national level, we will try to coordinate and support that network. But we won’t, for example, go into Houston or Austin and say: “This is the Indivisible candidate and you’ve got to get behind them.” What we will do is say: “Tell us who you are behind and we’ll try to elevate them. We’ll try to help you push them forward.” Philosophically, we don’t want national [organizations] coming in and telling us what we should do with our vote. We want control over it. That dynamic of local control is really important. That means trusting your local groups and organizations on the ground and allowing them to choose the direction of that primary. And can be challenging for existing power structures. I really do hope the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the rest of the infrastructure are learning that we should defer to the judgement of local groups. That’s where we’ll have the most success. After the primary, we think that it is incredibly important that progressives get behind whoever wins. Virginia was a model of that. Not everyone was aligned over who should win the gubernatorial primary but once there was a winner, everybody got behind him. We think that should happen everywhere. Guardian: How does student activism over gun control fit into the resistance movement and can activists channel that energy into the midterms? Levin: What you’re seeing is high school students awakened to the power that they have. And seeing students stand up for their own values really engages our network. They are so jazzed about finding ways to support these students so that it’s not just one march, or one action, but something that can achieve the change that they want to see. Guardian: Congress failed to enact protections for Dreamers by the 5 March deadline. What do you see as the next real opportunity to push for immigration reform? Levin: There have been a series of opportunities to apply pressure, legislatively. Debt ceiling. Disaster relief. CR, the short-term budget. As we move forward into an election year, then there’s the opportunity to apply pressure through the electoral system and to ask candidates: Will you vote against a budget that fails to include a clean Dream Act? Will you vote if elected against funding a mass deportation force and continuing to carry out a fascist agenda? Guardian: Which races are you watching as we head into the 2018 midterms? Levin: The thing I’m most excited about is more unexpected victories like we experienced in 2017. More Alabamas. More rural Virginias. The reason why we think that’s possible is not just because there’s energy out there but because we’re actually contesting. We’re running candidates in these places and I think there are going to be a lot of surprises come November – a lot of good surprises. What we’re reading This year’s International Women’s Day came five months after the first revelations about Harvey Weinstein. The resultant #TimesUp/#MeToo movement has finally “brought recognition that each act of gender violence is part of an epidemic”, writes Rebecca Solnit in the Guardian. But this new movement did not just spring out of nowhere, Solnit says: “It is a revolt for which we have been preparing for decades”. The Guardian live-blogged International Women’s Day across three continents. “Senate Republicans spent the end of Barack Obama’s term running out the clock on his picks for federal judges,” writes Kate Harloe at Mother Jones. “So when Donald Trump took office, he faced a nearly unprecedented number of vacant judgeships.” Trump has used that opportunity to nominate 69 judges – “more than any president since Reagan”, Harloe writes – and 71% of those are white men."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/10/owen-watkin-warren-gatland-wales-reboot","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T22:00:12Z","webTitle":"Owen Watkin swaggers into Warren Gatland’s free-running Wales reboot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/10/owen-watkin-warren-gatland-wales-reboot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/10/owen-watkin-warren-gatland-wales-reboot","fields":{"headline":"Owen Watkin swaggers into Warren Gatland’s free-running Wales reboot","bodyText":"Mum has not been the word in the Wales camp in the build-up to Sunday’s Mother’s Day match against Italy at the Principality Stadium, a sideshow involving the also-rans or, in the case of the Azzurri so far, nonstarters. “I would like to think we could win quite comfortably,” says the Wales centre Owen Watkin, who will make his first start in the Six Nations, one of 10 personnel changes from the last-round defeat in Dublin. When Wales have taken a scalpel to selection in the past its edge has been blunt and they have not taken comfort in the performances, such as against Georgia last November or Japan a year before. “You are damned if you do and damned if you don’t,” says the Wales attack coach, Robert Howley, when asked if making so many changes to a side already without Sam Warburton, Jonathan Davies and Rhys Webb was disrespecting the opposition. If you cannot have a stocktake against a side that have lost their last 15 matches in the Six Nations, when can you? The Italy head coach, Conor O’Shea, does not take Wales’s remodelling as an insult. He should feel relieved as he scours for his first victory in the Six Nations since taking charge two summers ago and, if Italy either win or come close to doing so for the first time in Cardiff, he may have a different take. In his playing days he was capped by his opposite number, Warren Gatland, who was in charge of Ireland between 1998 and 2001, and he has a deep respect for the New Zealander. Gatland confidently predicted at the Six Nations launch that Wales would win the title for the first time since 2013 but, with two rounds to go, they are playing for the consolation prizes after defeats away to England and Ireland in matches that were in the balance in the closing seconds. In political terms they were only a small swing away from going into this weekend on top. There is a sense of Gatland asserting his authority in selection. He publicly questioned the wisdom of selecting Dan Biggar at fly-half against Ireland after he had missed the first two matches through injury. He has often deferred to his specialist coaches in his 10 years in charge but the way he went out of his way to reveal he had told Biggar’s replacement, Gareth Anscombe, before the Ireland match that he was not sure they had made the right call at 10, suggested that he would have preferred Anscombe in the position at the start of the tournament ahead of Rhys Patchell. The Wales team are a rugby world away from the brawny lineups they fielded when they were at their peak, like a fen to a mountain: Watkin may be raw but he has the footballing instincts of the players the country produced a couple of generations ago. Gatland has picked a team to run and keep running: he has opted for two openside flankers in Justin Tipuric and the uncapped James Davies, has left out his three best goal-kickers and has omitted his captain, Alun Wyn Jones, a player who can hold the team together when they are in danger of falling apart. Davies and Tipuric are both ancillary three-quarters, revelling in open spaces. Wales will need to guard rucks, with Sergio Parisse past his best but still influential, and Sebastian Negri blessed with an eye for an opportunity and the power to exploit it. Italy may not have won in the Six Nations since Jacques Brunel was in charge but they had their moments against England, crafting two tries, and went one better in Dublin, albeit after trailing by 28 points at the break. The defeat in Marseille in the last round showcased their vulnerability. They lost concentration at vital moments in defence and attack in losing 34-17 against France but O’Shea has blooded players, such as the full-back Matteo Minozzi and the flanker Negri, who have made an impact. O’Shea’s problem is that Italy’s strength has been individual rather than collective. It may be the same for Wales who, while picking a side to play fast and wide, have included only four players from the region who have patented the approach in Wales, the Scarlets, although Liam Williams and George North are both alumni. Victory is not a given against a side who matched them for 50 minutes last season. O’Shea, who confined himself to one change from Marseille, will use Wales’s selection as a spur for his players but they will need to control possession and snare their opponents between desire and reality. Two years ago Wales recorded the mother of all victories over the Azzurri, piling up 67 points in the match before O’Shea’s takeover. It is unlikely to be so easy this time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/10/dont-look-to-len-mccluskey-and-his-sorry-ilk-to-defend-workers-interests","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T18:01:24Z","webTitle":"Don’t look to Len McCluskey and his sorry ilk to defend workers’ interests | Nick Cohen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/10/dont-look-to-len-mccluskey-and-his-sorry-ilk-to-defend-workers-interests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/10/dont-look-to-len-mccluskey-and-his-sorry-ilk-to-defend-workers-interests","fields":{"headline":"Don’t look to Len McCluskey and his sorry ilk to defend workers’ interests","bodyText":"We ought to be living in a stirring age of worker resistance. About four-fifths of the population think stronger trade unions are needed to shift the balance of power in the workplace. The settled opinion of the nation is that managers and rentiers are pocketing undeserved riches while millions live on low pay and at the mercy of their whims. All politics is underlaid by the hard fact that we are living through the worst period of wage stagnation since the “long depression” of 1873 to 1896 began 145 years ago. It sparked phenomena that echo today. Bismarck fought a culture war against German Catholics in the conquered territories of the Prussian empire. The Putinesque figure of Tsar Alexander III established the Okhrana, the forerunner of the FSB, to harry Russian liberals and socialists. Every great power except Britain joined the trade wars with which we will soon be reacquainting ourselves. Yet one development from the stagnation of the 19th century finds no echo in the stagnation of the 21st. Falling real wages led to an explosion of trade unionism among previously unrepresented workers. The 1880s was the decade of union leaders whose names still resonate: Annie Besant who led the matchgirls’ strike of 1888; Ben Tillett who led the London dock strike of 1889. They organised ignored men and women, who, in their dependence on precarious employment, were the ancestors of today’s Deliveroo riders and Amazon warehouse labourers. I doubt you can name one modern trade union leader who is a charismatic and persuasive presence in the media; one who can talk a language the young understand and recruit from the new workforce of women and migrant minorities while emphasising their solidarity with white working-class men. Who leads Unison? Who leads the GMB? Don’t be embarrassed if you don’t know: they have given you no reason to notice them. The only leader you will have heard of is Len McCluskey of Unite. He’s not familiar because he has led the way in unionising the marginalised and the exploited but because Unite is playing the vanguard role, to adopt the language of Leninism, in consolidating the far left’s control of the Labour party. McCluskey supported the old Revolutionary Socialist League when it called itself Militant and tried to take over Labour. The Scottish aristocrat Andrew Murray (he’s descended from the earls of Perth and the kings of Navarre on his father’s side and the dukes of Norfolk on his mother’s) not only offers apologies for Lenin but Stalin too. He’s moved from Unite and the Communist Party of Britain to join Seumas Milne, another apologist for Uncle Joe, in Jeremy Corbyn’s office. Unite is trying to force through the appointment of its official Jennie Formby as Labour’s new general secretary on the grounds that she is the feminist candidate who will challenge the patriarchy. Its egalitarian argument would carry greater force were she not McCluskey’s former mistress. Was it for this that Emily Davison died? The Trump White House and the leader of the opposition’s office have much in common. The foul smell of racism hangs over both enterprises, but Republican and Labour politicians and journalists hold their noses and bite their tongues for fear of enraging the leader’s base. Both live in a world of second-rate soap opera. Can Steve Bannon find a way back into favour? Is it over for Jon Lansman now he’s dared to contradict “Jeremy”? In both instances, the nepotism matches the cronyism. Trump employs his daughter and son-in-law. John McDonnell employs Corbyn’s son. I could go on. But discussions of court politics miss the lost opportunity to offer relief to millions of workers. While Unite intrigues, the union movement is dying. Membership has fallen from 13m in 1979 to 6.5m today. Unions are concentrated in the public sector, whose managers feel obliged to talk to them. In the private sector, where fighting for union recognition is a harder and hence more urgent task, a mere 14% of workers are trade unionists. Union members are more likely to be well paid than poorly paid, white collar than blue collar, old than young. Far away from the Labour party’s factionalism, activists the old Labour movement would have recognised are winning small victories that stand out because they are so rare. The entertainment industry union Bectu managed against the odds to organise isolated freelance camera crews and force film and TV producers to stop undercutting their rates. The shop workers’ union Usdaw fights equally necessary and difficult struggles to stop cut-price supermarkets cutting pay and conditions, while the new Independent Workers Union broke away from the stale Unite and Unison bureaucracies, recruited Spanish-speaking activists and sent them to organise the South American cleaners at the University of London. Successful activists have little in common with the old far-left-dominated unions. One Bectu officer explained that his colleagues placed an absolute priority on building a consensus among members rather than ordering them around. They refused to let the union be used for political purposes but concentrated on workers’ pay and conditions. Lenin, whose work you must understand to understand the Labour leadership, despised trade unions precisely because pay and conditions were their sole concern. A vanguard of professional revolutionaries, led by himself, naturally, needed to take them over and direct the muddle-headed and faintly contemptible proletariat to socialism. That note of contempt can still be heard. The majority of British unions, with their complicated structures and tiny turnouts in union elections, suit the far left. It would struggle to retain control if union membership reflected the workforce and strategies were built on consensus rather than diktats of whatever Stalinist or Trotskyist faction could stay awake the longest in the interminable meetings. There are many reasons why workers are enduring the worst wage stagnation in 145 years – anti-union laws, the decline of heavy industry. One deserves more attention than it receives: workers have the most stagnant leaders in 145 years. • Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/12/conservative-liberal-meeting-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"I'm taking my Trump-loving cousin, age 93, to meet him – will you help?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/12/conservative-liberal-meeting-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/12/conservative-liberal-meeting-trump","fields":{"headline":"I'm taking my Trump-loving cousin, age 93, to meet him – will you help?","bodyText":"My cousin Frances once said she’d “drive clear across the country to shake Donald Trump’s hand”, so I’ve offered to drive her myself.

We vowed never to let toxic politics divide us again. And now that it’s tearing apart families and neighbors across our country, it worries us both. That’s why on 18 March, we’re renting a car and driving 1,700 miles from Big Spring, Texas (our hometown), to the White House to try and meet President Trump. We’re stopping at many places along the way, talking with a broad spectrum of people who make up this country. We’ll stop at truck stops, bars, and ice cream parlors. We’re set to talk to reporters, local activists, and clergy. We’re calling it the #AcrossTheGreatDivideTour – and we also need your recommendations. We want to meet rightwing radio hosts, imams, evangelicals, gun lovers, activists, teachers, and anyone else who can challenge our respective ideologies and spark conversation. (We’ll go through Oklahoma City, St Louis, Ferguson, Indianapolis, Columbus, down into West Virginia, and onward to DC.) More importantly, we need you to help us get into the White House, where Frances and I hope to share with President Trump the story of our friendship and adventure and what we learned from a nation that wants to mend and heal. For Frances, the trip is a fitting hurrah to an already dizzying political life. Back in the 1960s, she was a foot soldier in the swelling conservative movement, working for Senator Barry Goldwater and later befriending Phyllis Schlafly to help defeat the Equal Rights Amendment. I only found out about her three years ago while researching my book, The Kings of Big Spring. No one in my family knew she was still alive. When we finally met, she sniffed out my political leanings right away. I’m the only Democrat in my family, so I’ve long grown accustomed to defending my beliefs around a dinner table. But Frances was ruthless. “You mean you’re one of those liberals?” she asked, shocked that someone in her family could be like the dummies depicted on Fox News, which is on every time I call her. In fact, I’m pretty sure I’m the only liberal she knows. To me, Frances was just another Republican undeterred by the facts. When I told friends about our budding friendship, many were shocked that I even had the stomach to tolerate her. But she was my family, and I only have one. Plus, I do love her company, even if we argue constantly. Most coastal liberals have never had a real encounter with a conservative, and the opposite applies in flyover country. We seethe in our airtight silos and turn our fellow Americans into monsters while our children listen. We’re angry all the damn time, and for many good reasons. But frankly, I’m tired of being angry. When Frances said she’d like to meet Trump, I bit my tongue and saw a chance to address this anger and division in our country while having some fun. “We’ll go together,” I said. “I’ll drive.” Can you help Frances meet her hero Donald Trump? Can you offer suggestions for their trip, and guide their wheels as they go?

Mark Walker, the head of the West Ham United Independent Supporters’ Association (WHUISA), has said he plans to stay away from games for the foreseeable future. He questioned why senior figures at West Ham had not offered more backing after he became the target of an online campaign orchestrated by a rival fan organisation, some of whose founders are former hooligans and which has links with an unrelated group condemned by anti-racism campaigners. “It was quite scary,” Walker told the Guardian. “Some of the things that were written and sent made me fearful for my safety. After showing West Ham so much loyalty for so long, it would have been nice to have something to show it was recognised that it was a difficult situation. They could have done and said something. I can understand not wanting to get into the weeds of it but they could have made it clear we’re a football family and these sort of things can’t be tolerated. “There’s a lot of upset about what’s happened and the failure of the board to condemn the kind of comments that have gone around to a lot of people. A lot of supporters now want to stay away and unfortunately I seem to have become the focal point for a lot of that.” Walker, who says he has endured sleepless nights, expressed particular disappointment with Karren Brady for not speaking out on his behalf. The abuse has gone on for a week and has seen the 35-year-old has received threatening text messages from unknown numbers and attacks on Facebook from members of the Real West Ham Fans Group (RWHFG), which was set up this season by Andy Swallow and Micky Morgan, founder members of the infamous unofficial Inter City Firm. Although Walker has not made an allegation of any wrongdoing to West Ham, he insists the club is aware of it and that it has offered only to move his four season tickets to another part of the stadium. “It would help relations massively if the club would issue some form of words and I especially expect that of Brady because she is in the House of Lords, so is held to a much higher degree than everyone else,” Walker said. “For her to not condemn what’s happened is particularly disappointing for me.” The march had initially been called for by the RWHFG, which was known as the Real West Ham Fans Action Group until last week, amid rising dissatisfaction with West Ham’s struggles. The prospect of a major protest through Stratford grabbed West Ham’s attention and on 19 February a meeting was arranged between the board and representatives from a coalition of 15 fan groups, including Morgan, Swallow and Walker. Although the club’s owners, David Gold and David Sullivan, were not there, Brady, the vice-chairman, was present. Brady later sent a nine-page open letter to the groups, outlining the various issues discussed and thanking the attendees for a “highly constructive” meeting. WHUISA was surprised the letter revealed that Sullivan, by far the most influential figure at West Ham, held a three-and-a-half-hour meeting with “the lead representatives coordinating these groups” a week earlier. West Ham have not denied that Swallow, who has links with the controversial Football Lads Alliance, visited Sullivan’s house. “He wanted to know what the march was about and I met him to tell him,” Swallow said . “He asked us if we could stop it. We said ‘no’. He asked what it would take to stop it. I said for the groups to meet the board. Then we set up the meeting.” A day after Brady held a second meeting with supporter groups on 28 February, the RWHFG announced that the march was off, arguing that it was satisfied the club were listening to its concerns. However, that caused anger and surprise among many supporters. WHUISA stepped up at the behest of its 1,500 members, only for the RWHFG to focus on Walker’s past work for the Labour party and his support for Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London. “ICF ain’t having it you will not march to our ground,” Swallow posted on Facebook. The toxic mood raised questions about why West Ham’s board was willing to meet the RWHFG’s leaders. The club’s argument is that their hand was forced because they were organising the march and were part of a broader fan coalition that included Walker. Swallow repeatedly turned down opportunities to express sympathy for Walker during an interview with the Guardian and denied claims he received any incentives from West Ham to cancel the march. He said the club would not deal with him any more and were reluctant in the first place because of his ICF past. It is understood the club will not deal with the RWHFG again. Minutes from the second meeting suggest that a question from Swallow led Brady to say that the club would seek to reimburse those who had made arrangements to travel for the march and “look at providing match tickets”. Swallow, who said the FLA is “against all forms of extremism” and insisted he has no far-right leanings, will be handing out 40 complimentary tickets for Saturday’s game to RWHFG members at a bar before kick-off. However, he told the Guardian that the club had not given him the tickets. West Ham declined to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"science/2018/mar/12/weatherwatch-over-southern-ocean-clouds-are-made-to-a-different-recipe","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T21:30:21Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: Clean air over Southern Ocean alters cloud recipe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/12/weatherwatch-over-southern-ocean-clouds-are-made-to-a-different-recipe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/mar/12/weatherwatch-over-southern-ocean-clouds-are-made-to-a-different-recipe","fields":{"headline":"Weatherwatch: Over Southern Ocean, clouds are made to a different recipe","bodyText":"What is the recipe for a cloud? This is like asking for the recipe for curry. There are many different types of curry, and the result depends upon which spices are used and how they are combined. For a long time, clouds over the Southern Ocean have puzzled meteorologists; there are more of them and they hang around for longer than climate models predict. Benjamin Murray and his colleagues from the University of Leeds have shown this is because of the delicate ingredients that goes into Southern Ocean clouds. Writing in the journal PNAS, they show that the ultra-clean air in this region means there is a paucity of particles to encourage the growth of ice. So, instead of progressing through the usual cloud cycle, where particles help ice crystals to grow and fall out, Southern Ocean clouds persist as a mist of miniscule droplets, struggling to gain weight and fall from the sky. Currently, climate models don’t include the right type of particles in their recipe for clouds and, consequently, they fail to reproduce massive areas of Southern Ocean cloud – some as big as the entire UK. This means they miscalculate the amount of heat reflected, with knock-on consequences for predicting weather and climate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/09/civil-rights-pioneer-viola-desmond-is-first-woman-on-canadian-currency","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T20:42:22Z","webTitle":"Civil rights pioneer Viola Desmond is first Canadian woman on currency","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/09/civil-rights-pioneer-viola-desmond-is-first-woman-on-canadian-currency","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/09/civil-rights-pioneer-viola-desmond-is-first-woman-on-canadian-currency","fields":{"headline":"Civil rights pioneer Viola Desmond is first Canadian woman on currency","bodyText":"A black woman who refused to leave the whites-only section of a Canadian movie theatre in 1946 – nearly a decade before Rosa Parks’s act of defiance – has been honoured on the country’s newest $10 bill. Civil rights pioneer Viola Desmond was selected from the more than 26,000 submissions that rolled in after the Bank of Canada announced plans to put a Canadian woman on the country’s regularly circulating currency for the first time. Born in 1914, Desmond rose to prominence as an entrepreneur, selling her own line of hair and skin products at a time when few local beauty schools accepted black students. After being forced to travel to Montreal, Atlantic City and New York for training, she returned to Halifax and opened a beauty school aimed at offering black people a local option for training. The incident that would propel her into Canada’s history books took place in 1946 after her car broke down in New Glasgow, some 100 miles north-east of Halifax, while on a business trip. Looking to kill time while her car was being repaired, she stopped by a local movie theatre. It was a segregated space – floor seats were for white people while black people were relegated to the balcony. Desmond, who was shortsighted, tried to buy a floor seat but was refused. So she bought a ticket for the balcony, where tax on the seats was one-cent cheaper, and sat in the floor area anyway. She remained there until police arrived. Desmond was dragged out of the theatre and arrested, ultimately spending 12 hours in jail. The price difference between the floor and balcony seats would later come back to haunt her; Desmond was charged with tax evasion over the single penny. Despite the fact that the theatre had refused to sell her the more expensive floor seat, she was convicted and ordered to pay fines amounting to C$26. Later attempts to fight the conviction in court proved fruitless. Desmond died in 1965 and her act of defiance – which helped ignite Canada’s civil rights movement as well as usher in Nova Scotia’s legal end to segregation in 1954 – was overlooked for decades by many in Canada. In 2010, more than six decades after she was arrested, Nova Scotia apologised to Desmond and pardoned her – a posthumous pardon signed into law by Mayann Francis, the province’s first African Nova Scotian lieutenant-governor. “Here I am, 64 years later – a black woman giving freedom to another black woman,” Francis later told Maclean’s Magazine. On Thursday, Desmond’s sister Wanda Robson, now in her 90s, was on hand to unveil Canada’s first banknote featuring a black person. “It’s beyond what I ever thought. It’s beautiful,” she told an audience in Halifax. The note – which is also the first in Canada to feature a vertical orientation – is expected to enter into circulation at the end of the year. “I say thank you, thank you, thank you,” said Robson. “Our family will go down in history – in history, imagine that.” This article was amended on 10 March 2018 to make clear that Viola Desmond is the first Canadian woman to appear on one of the country’s regularly circulating bank notes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/12/garden-bird-feeders-help-spread-disease-among-wild-birds","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T06:01:03Z","webTitle":"Garden bird feeders help spread disease among wild birds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/12/garden-bird-feeders-help-spread-disease-among-wild-birds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/12/garden-bird-feeders-help-spread-disease-among-wild-birds","fields":{"headline":"Garden bird feeders help spread disease among wild birds","bodyText":"Garden bird feeders are contributing to the spread of serious diseases among wild birds, scientists have warned, causing previously rare illnesses to become epidemics in some populations. Poor garden feeder hygiene, droppings accumulations and stale food are promoting the transmission of illnesses between garden birds as the animals repeatedly congregate in the same location, coming into contact with species they would not usually interact with in the wild. A study by the Zoological Society of London, the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and Fera Science analysed more than 25 years of wild bird health data, including the RSPB’s Big Garden Birdwatch, and found dramatic changes in some British bird populations, which scientists believe could have been caused by disease spread at bird feeding sites. “We’re calling on everyone who feeds wild birds to be aware of their responsibilities for preventing disease. Simple steps we’d recommend include offering a variety of food from accredited sources; feeding in moderation, so that feeders are typically emptied every one to two days; the regular cleaning of bird feeders; and rotation of feeding sites to avoid accumulation of waste food or bird droppings,” said Kate Risely, from BTO. The study analysed data on the protozoan parasite responsible for finch trichomonosis, which has caused a 35% drop in the population of breeding greenfinches in the British Isles, falling from 4.3m to 2.8m birds since the disease emerged in 2005. Gardeners can combat the disease by regularly disinfecting feeders and feeding sites, and rotating the position of feeders in the garden. Paridae pox and passerine salmonellosis were also analysed by scientists. The study’s lead author, Becki Lawson from ZSL’s Institute of Zoology, said: “Our study shows how three of the most common diseases that affect British garden birds have changed both dramatically and unpredictably over the past decade, both in terms of the species they affect and their patterns of occurrence. “Both finch trichomonosis and Paridae pox have emerged recently, causing disease epidemics affecting large numbers of birds, while passerine salmonellosis – previously a common condition – appears to have reduced to a very low level. These conditions have different means of transmission – so deepening our understanding of disease dynamics will help us develop best practice advice to ensure that feeding garden birds also helps to safeguard their health.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/09/levon-aronian-favourite-face-magnus-carlsen","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T19:21:28Z","webTitle":"Chess: Levon Aronian  favourite to secure right to challenge Magnus Carlsen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/09/levon-aronian-favourite-face-magnus-carlsen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/09/levon-aronian-favourite-face-magnus-carlsen","fields":{"headline":"Chess: Levon Aronian favourite to secure right to challenge Carlsen","bodyText":"The world championship candidates tournament opens at the Kulhaus, Berlin on Saturday afternoon, continues until 28 March and will decide who among eight qualifiers becomes the challenger to Magnus Carlsen for the Norwegian’s world crown in London in November. All the games can be viewed live and free online (2pm start) as three Russians, two Americans and one each from Armenia, Azerbaijan and China start their marathon double-round all-play-all, a total of 14 games each. Who will win? Levon Aronian is a popular choice and the betting favourite, after the Yerevan 35-year-old scored major successes in 2017. He has a fluent tactical style, is cultured and outgoing and has held his own with Carlsen in their mutual classical games of the last three years. Aronian is favourite but he represents poor value after five previous failures at this level in the past decade. In none was he a threat at the business end. For a player in his mid-30s that is considerable psychological baggage. Vlad Kramnik is a former world champion and has long cherished his ambition to regain the crown but at 42 his game is more uneven than in his best years. Of the two Americans Fabiano Caruana missed becoming the 2016 candidate only in the final round and has prepared seriously but his recent form, a failure at Wijk 2018, is less than convincing. Wesley So, at 24, is the youngest candidate and may need more experience. Shak Mamedyarov is the current world No 2 and a fine tactician and competitor, yet there is an impression that his style lacks soundness at the highest level. Alex Grischuk, like Aronian, has played in several previous candidates without winning. Ding Liren is the first ever candidate from China and is reckoned the outsider, though Beijing is hungry for global success, and Ding will have been prepared in depth for his big chance. All the other candidates have played in tournaments leading up to Berlin, but Ding has conspicuously stayed away. Historically, those who are proven winners at the world title candidates stage have a significant chance of a repeat. Vassily Smyslov won at Zurich 1953, was held to a draw in the championship match by Mikhail Botvinnik who retained the crown, and again won the candidates in 1956 before capturing the world title a year later. Smyslov kept his ambitions alive even as a veteran, and at age 63 again reached the candidates final against Garry Kasparov. Boris Spassky won two candidates events, in 1965 and 1968, while Anatoly Karpov and Viktor Korchnoi later also achieved doubles. In 2007 there was a match tournament for the title. Vishy Anand won that, and after losing his crown to Carlsen six years later the Indian still had the energy to become the challenger in 2014. Sergey Karjakin won the 2016 candidates, had a real opportunity at one moment in the championship match in New York to take Carlsen’s crown, and drew the main series 6-6 before losing in speed tie-breaks. It is clear that all his play in the last two years has been geared towards this second attempt. His defensive skills, stable and strategic style, and improved speed technique are formidable weapons. Karjakin has taken advice from the legendary Anatoly Karpov, a master of subtle positional play, and used it to effect when winning last week’s Tal Memorial blitz in Moscow. Here he exploits the Israel No 1’s small errors in Karpov style. Black should prefer 11…Ne7! with the idea of a later c6 and d5, while next turn 12…h5 backs up the f5 bishop. The fatal error was 20…Be4? (better Qh4) which allowed a forced winning sequence. Black resigned because 25...Nb4 26 Rxa8 Rxa8 27 Nxc5 wins the b4 knight or the d7 bishop.

They face Wales in Cardiff on Sunday looking to end a 15-match losing streak in the championship, a sequence that stretches back to before the 2015 World Cup. Seven of the 12 victories they have accumulated in their 19 seasons in the tournament have come against Scotland, whose revival in the last couple of seasons has left the wooden spoon barely contested. O’Shea is still looking for his first Six Nations win in his second campaign as Italy’s coach: they are improving, but not at the rate of their rivals. “I am happy we are seeing progress but I am desperate to win because that is what you are judged on,” he said. “We are doing a lot of the right things, blooding young players, putting systems in place and building for the future, but we want to win games. “It’s hard because this is the very highest level and we are having to make changes that should have been made a long time ago.” Italy have won only twice away in the championship, at Murrayfield in 2007 and 2015, although they drew in Cardiff 12 years ago when Wales were going through one of the interregnums which were common before Warren Gatland took over. O’Shea, who played for Ireland under Gatland, is trying to do the same but by building from the bottom up rather than the top down. Gatland has given Italy half a chance by making 10 changes from the team who lost in Dublin. The second-row Cory Hill is the only survivor in the pack as Wales look to gauge their strength before next year’s World Cup as well as rest players with the final match against France following six days later. Wales have tended to struggle when making mass changes when they play a second-tier nation in the autumn with new players slow to adapt but the players have been in camp for six weeks and the starting lineup are geared for a fast, open game. Two openside flankers are in the back row, where James Davies makes his Test debut having wondered if his chance had gone after the 27-year-old’s form for the Scarlets was previously unrewarded. Italy have scored the same number of tries as Wales, seven, but they have conceded 18 compared with eight, and are especially vulnerable to set-piece moves and the parts coaching cannot reach. “We know we are dangerous if we have the ball,” O’Shea said. “Our goal is to increase our possession. That means making sure our set pieces are solid. Our mindset will be the same as it has been, which is to hold on to the ball. “Our mindset from the word go has been to hold the ball and that is the mindset we will go out with against Wales. We are moving in the right direction but it is about getting victories.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/11/us-steelworkers-donald-trump-tariffs","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T11:34:29Z","webTitle":"US steelworkers say Trump tariff plan has appeal – 'but about 40 years too late'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/11/us-steelworkers-donald-trump-tariffs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/11/us-steelworkers-donald-trump-tariffs","fields":{"headline":"US steelworkers say Trump tariff plan has appeal – 'but about 40 years too late'","bodyText":"To say former steelworkers in Pennsylvania’s Lehigh Valley are conflicted about Donald Trump’s 25% tariff on steel imports is not quite to capture the mood. Those who voted for the president see the tariff as a fulfilment of a campaign promise, proof he is a man of the people and, what’s more, his word. Those who never supported Trump do not see it that way. Here is a man who used foreign steel to build his own buildings, they think. Who hires foreign workers and relies on foreign money. Someone who does not have to worry what a car costs – or a can of soup, for that matter. A politician who is just trying to win the special election next week in Pittsburgh. Who might not even follow up. But at the same time, they admit the potential appeal of the tariff announcement. They wonder what would have happened if the government had acted more aggressively to defend the steel industry 40 or 50 years ago. And they concede that the president got the rollout right. “The president was so smart about how he did this, and it breaks my heart to ever say those words,” said Frank Behum, who worked for 32 years at Bethlehem Steel, which once employed thousands of people regionally but closed in the mid-1990s. “This was all a set-up for the US representative’s race in the 18th district, a little south-west of Pittsburgh. This is what our president will do to muddy the waters, and I don’t think the steel workers are going to fall for it. “But they’re not so dumb as they’re not going to accept it, either.” Pittsburgh is home to US Steel, the country’s second-largest producer. Democrats have a chance to grab the 18th district in a special election on Tuesday, in a race in which steelworkers, unions and other groups paying close attention to the tariffs issue could play a pivotal role. Trump’s focus on the congressional race was underscored by his appearance at a raucous campaign-style rally outside Pittsburgh on Saturday night, in support of Republican Rick Saccone. “Your steel is coming back,” he said. “It’s all coming back.” “They’re opening a lot of the steel mills up because of what I did,” he claimed. “Steel is back and aluminium is back too.” That was a message that resonated with Trump supporters such as Bruce Haines, a former US Steel executive who called the tariff “long overdue”. “Steel and aluminum tariffs are necessary to protect from unfair dumped steel,” Haines wrote in an email. “Like the tax cuts, only Trump has the balls to pull this off. In this case he is fulfilling his campaign promise to Pennsylvania, Indiana, Ohio, Illinois and Missouri, while also helping West Virginia and Kentucky reopen coal mines needed for steel, as well as getting the Minnesota iron ore mines back up and running – all employing the forgotten American worker that crossed the aisle to vote for Trump.” Multiple former steelworkers, though, pointed out that the US steel industry is a long way from being able to meet US demand, no matter how high the president’s barriers to entry. Frank Hawkey worked 31 years at Bethlehem steel. “These tariffs here are such a joke,” he said. “Every time you open up a can of vegetables, it’s either aluminum or steel. And they’re not getting that from the United States. “The mills that have been shut down in the USA are now brownfields. There’s nothing left there. You could just survey Pittsburgh, Ohio – there’s a few plants going, like in Indiana, but they can’t supply everything.” Larry Neff worked at Bethlehem Steel for 25 years. “Many of my brothers think it’s about 30 to 40 years too late,” he said. But he warned that the picture was no longer so simple. “These tariffs will just start a trade war which will cost the American consumer more to purchase items,” he said. “None of the older plants could be started up again, and many of the mills producing steel now are owned by other countries.” In a response to Trump’s tariffs on Friday, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker fueled fears of a trade war, declaring: “We can also do stupid.” Haines said those fears were overblown. “This will be fun to watch play out,” he said. “Trump is too smart to get in a trade war which would jeopardize our economy, in my opinion.” In another begrudging point for the president, Behum pointed out that many former Bethlehem Steel employees in the Lehigh Valley have health and other benefits that are currently paid for, thanks to industry consolidation, by Luxembourg steelmaker ArcelorMittal, which produces steel in the US and could stand to gain from the tariff. Neff doubted that Trump cared about steelworkers, pointing out that Chinese steel had been used in Las Vegas and Chicago to build Trump hotels. “Don’t stay there if you go,” said Neff, the author of the entertaining steel memoir Rigger. “You may go to sleep on the eighth floor and wake up on the third floor.

At 39, she became pregnant with Barnaby unexpectedly after failing to conceive for several years. “We had given up trying because the strain was taking its toll on us. I stopped taking drugs that made me ovulate and was trying to accept that it might not happen. And then I got pregnant. I’m still pinching myself.” A hundred miles north in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, Lisa Bucknall, also 43, is watching comedies on Netflix, eating chocolate and locking herself away from the world today. “I dread Mother’s Day. I always loved children and thought one day I’d be a mum. But I didn’t meet anyone I wanted to settle down with until I was 35.” She and her new partner started trying for a baby right away. “We thought it would be really easy. It came as a shock that it wasn’t.” Three IVF attempts, with both her own and a donor’s eggs, ended in failure, miscarriage and separation. “It feels like something has been snatched away from me.” The different experiences of Harrop and Bucknall will strike a chord for many women in their late 30s and early 40s on Sunday. Many – especially those who are celebrating Mother’s Day with a newborn for the first time – are mothers because they had options their own mothers didn’t have. But at the same time the rate of childlessness among British women over 45 has rocketed to a level not seen since the aftermath of the first world war. About one in five (18%) of British women aged 45 are childless, the Office for National Statistics revealed last year, and Britain has one of the world’s highest rates of childlessness among women aged 40-44. According to a global survey by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), UK women aged 15-39 said they would personally like to have 2.3 children on average. Asked what they thought the ideal family size was generally, just 0.67% of UK women surveyed said zero children. Fewer women today start a family in their 20s – the average age for a British woman to give birth for the first time now is 30, compared with 26 in 1971, and the ONS reports 54% of women are over 30 when they have a baby. That figure is even higher for men becoming fathers: 68%. A whole host of financial reasons lie behind this shift. As well as being the most debt-laden generation and the first expected to pay significant fees for university, 25-to-34-year-olds are far less likely to own their own home than in the past, with almost half living in rented accommodation, compared with almost a third only 20 years ago. While the average age of a first-time buyer in the early 1970s was 27, today it is 33. This often impossible battle to secure enough money to buy a home of their own means a quarter of millennials aged 20 to 34 still live with their parents. Changes in women’s working lives have also had an impact on men’s attitudes to family life, argues social gerontologist Dr Robin Hadley. “Some men today feel more ambivalence about when to settle down.” Often, he says, this is not because men don’t want children, but because they want to be able to play more of a nurturing role in their children’s lives than their own fathers did. In 1974, men were twice as likely to have a child in their 20s as their modern counterparts, who also get married almost 10 years later. Women who have children when they are younger often struggle to cope financially. Childcare costs in England have risen up to seven times faster than wages since 2008 and it now costs £6,300 on average for a part-time nursery place for a child under two, with a quarter of mothers under 25 reporting they had left a job because they could not afford care. “Often, women over 40 are childless because they have made sensible, honourable decisions,” says Jody Day, 53, founder of the Gateway Women support group and author of Living the Life Unexpected, a self-help book for childless women. “We used birth control so we didn’t get pregnant by accident, we held out for the right partner and we waited until we had a secure home environment to bring up our children in. We thought we had plenty of time in our 30s because of IVF. But then it became a race against the clock – and time ran out.” This rings true for Bucknall, who says she took it for granted she would be a mother one day, but never had unprotected sex before the age of 35. “I left school thinking you could get pregnant at the drop of a hat. Taking precautions was ingrained in me.” Similarly, Jessica Hepburn, 47, organiser of Fertility Fest (the world’s first fertility arts festival), started trying for a baby at 34. In her book The Pursuit of Motherhood, she chronicles her 11 private rounds of unsuccessful IVF (at a cost of more than £70,000) and multiple miscarriages. She was eventually diagnosed with “unexplained infertility”. In her opinion, the disconnection between the number of children that women under 40 want to have and the number of children that women over 40 actually end up having is due to misunderstandings about fertility. She believes this is partly caused by messages about how easy it is to get pregnant that were drummed into her generation at school, along with widespread myths about IVF. Earlier this month, she helped the newly established Fertility Education Initiative lobby the government to start educating children about fertility as part of the national curriculum: “We’re focusing on 16-to-18-year-olds, but age-appropriate conversations with children about fertility should be happening from year dot. The viability of a woman’s eggs as she ages and the science of IVF is not well understood by the young. We should be celebrating what IVF can do and how it can create modern families for women with fertility issues, but also acknowledging its limits.” Infertility is not, of course, the only cause of involuntary childlessness. It is estimated that the vast majority (80%) of childless older women are childless due to circumstances, rather than choice or infertility. The experience of Lauren de Vere, 54, who wanted to start trying for a baby when she was 32, is common. “My partner at the time, who was 10 years older and had two children already, kept saying: not yet, not yet. Finally, when I was 35, he told me maybe he didn’t want more kids after all.” They split up and she did not meet anyone else she wanted to raise a child with until she was 42. “We decided to try to adopt. During the process, I explained I had a difficult relationship with my mother, who has mental health issues. Nine months later, we were turned down and, sadly, that was the reason they gave.” Even for women who are happy they are childfree, Mothering Sunday can be frustrating because of the inference that achieving the status of mother deserves a special day in the calendar each year. “Possibly the worst thing you can do on Mother’s Day is to presume that every woman is a mother, or wants to be a mother, or will be a mother one day,” says Day. “Another painful aspect of the day for many of us is the idea that we are not kind or nurturing because we are childless. This strikes at the very core of feminine identity. Today, childless women can feel both intensely visible – because we don’t ‘fit’ – and invisible, because where is the space for our grief?” This an experience recognised by Bucknall. “I’m the only one in my circle of friends who doesn’t have kids. You can feel like something’s wrong with you, like you’re not a complete woman.” From a biological perspective, a woman’s fertility typically drops quite dramatically after her 40th birthday. Despite this, the attractions of older motherhood mean more women over the age of 35 now give birth each year than women under 25. “Bringing up a young child in your early 40s is absolutely exhaustingly brilliant,” says Harrop. “You may have less energy than younger mums, but you’re economically more sound and you have more maturity. I can afford wraparound childcare, I’ve seen a lot of the world and I have many things to share with my son. I find spending time with him so rewarding.” Professor Elizabeth Gregory, author of Ready: Why Women Are Embracing the New Later Motherhood, says women who start a family when they are over 35 are likely to enjoy many benefits younger mothers don’t. “They are more likely to have seen something of the world and invested in their education and are less likely to resent staying in at night with a small child. They are more established in their careers, which means they are more likely to earn enough to carry on in their profession after birth.” Women over 35 are also more likely to have found mature long-term partners, who see them as an equal and are equally ready to settle down, she says. “All these economic and emotional benefits for mothers are also felt by their children.” She thinks more women are making more informed decisions about when they want children and, as a result, attitudes towards women who don’t want children at all have improved. “There’s greater understanding of the challenges mothers often face at work and the costs of having children, both in terms of money and time. Fewer people are likely to tell you that you should have a child nowadays.” Julia Bernard-Thompson, 40, a business consultant from Ashford, Kent, is one of the many women for whom childlessness has been an active choice. “It first hit me that I didn’t want kids when I was 13. Later, I would always tell potential partners as soon as the topic came up, even if it was the first date,” she says. “I met my husband when I was 29, 11 years ago. When I told him how I felt about having children, he audibly exhaled and said he felt the same way, and it was so rare for him to meet a woman who didn’t want kids. That was the moment we knew we were going to be together.” She says the couple enjoy their freedom and independence, and spending long, lazy days together. They also like being able to spend their money on themselves. “Personally, I don’t want to suppress what I want to do for a child. When a woman says these things, other people say she is selfish – and maybe it is selfish. But I’m a very nurturing person. I love deeply, I’m the best auntie and I’ll drop everything for my friends. I don’t feel I need to be a mother to be happy or satisfied and I don’t feel like I’m missing out. For me, there isn’t any downside to being childfree.” Harrop feels equally happy with her lot. “I feel incredibly lucky. I know the 5am starts aren’t going to last forever and I think my 40s are going to be brilliant. The people in my family have a history of longevity and I’m hoping that one day I’ll be an incredibly fit and attractive grandmother, like my own mum.” • This article was amended on 13 March 2018: to clarify the distinction in the cited OECD survey between respondents’ views of ideal family size for them personally, and their views of family size generally; and to change from 35 to 40 a reference to the age at which fertility typically drops quite dramatically."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/07/a-letter-to-my-estranged-adult-children","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-07T05:45:52Z","webTitle":"A letter to... my estranged adult children","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/07/a-letter-to-my-estranged-adult-children","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/07/a-letter-to-my-estranged-adult-children","fields":{"headline":"A letter to… my estranged adult children","bodyText":"I miss you both terribly, and my heart swells and aches when I think of you – and I do think of you, daily. I wish there was a way to make everything right and that we could get back to how we used to be. I believe I was closer to you than your mum. But I know that even if we did manage to salvage the relationship, it would never be the same. It has been 10 years since I walked out on your mother. It is totally my fault that the marriage failed and that I met someone else. I had never had an affair before, and never wanted or looked for one, but somehow got caught in the headlights. Everyone blamed me, and I took the blame with shoulders square. You were both obviously very hurt by it all, and just at a time when you were at university. Although I take the blame, I still don’t understand why you won’t have any contact with me. Many people divorce and still have contact with their children. Some people commit murder, yet still have contact with their children. I have written to you countless times without reply. A hard task, really, because, without any replies, the letters can be only about me and my life. I don’t even know if you read them, but I shall continue to write. I don’t think either of you understand what happened in the relationship between your mum and me. On the surface, it all looked cosy – love and roses. That was not the case. We didn’t share any interests, and once you two had grown up, that became even more evident. Your mum wanted someone different from me. She wanted the exciting bad lad many teenage girls are attracted to, even though she was in her 40s. And she was still smitten with her first love – which wasn’t me. I also wanted something different; someone different. I felt stifled, unloved, there only to provide an income. Eventually, I just had to leave. Ten years on, and I am married to the lady I had an affair with; I’m poorer financially, but happy. I hope you are both happy as well. I know you have partners, have bought your own homes, and have children and careers. I hope my grandchildren will not grow up thinking I am a bad person, not to be spoken of. I hope that one day that you will understand. My love to you both, for ever. • We will pay £25 for every A letter to... that we publish. Email family@theguardian.com.

By the time I caught up with “Mother’s Day with Carole Middleton”, it was too late to plan a festive brunch, working to a rose gold colour palette, where we would celebrate “being thankful for motherhood and all the things the amazing women in your life do every single day”. Likewise, I refuse to see it as a commentary on my own attempts at mothering that my daughter will not, as Carole proposes, be transforming the dining table (NB, it’s not too late!) “into an Instagram-worthy setting with an abundance of spring flowers and foliage, an oversized balloon, a decorative table cloth and runner, and tea lights”. At least we’ll be able to sit together, mother and daughter, lovingly picturing the scene in Kensington Palace. At this moment, the Duchess of Cambridge reclines beneath a bespoke banner from Party Pieces, inscribed with “We love you, Mum”, while George approaches with one of their rose gold “Love” balloons. And suddenly, incidentally, it’s clear where the younger Middleton daughter, Pippa, acquired the entertaining expertise that once won her a £400,000 advance from Penguin books. “Paper plates,” Carole writes, “make a great alternative to breakable china if you’re hosting younger guests”. Anyone with non-breakable china should proceed as planned. For those, however, who messed up the brunch gathering, my Mother’s Day tip would be for an outing to see, or re-see, I, Tonya. Or failing that, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Or, failing that, Lady Bird. The first on the list is especially recommended as a bonding event for mothers with an accompanying older child, given (multiple spoilers ahead) the very low chance that you will have ever been amazing enough to hurl a knife at your teen – as Tonya Harding’s mother, LaVona, is alleged to have done – and with such accuracy that it embedded itself in junior’s arm. In the event that there was occasional bloodshed, the youngster will appreciate that you never shrugged, like flinty LaVona: “Oh, please, show me a family that doesn’t have ups and downs.” It must be a rare mother who does not come out of I, Tonya feeling, well, all things considered, it could have gone worse. We’re not ideal; we’re not up there with Gary Oldman’s mum, cited at the Oscars for her exemplary contribution to future Churchill impersonations, but at least we didn’t make our unfortunate daughters wet themselves on a public ice rink. Then again, our daughters can’t do triple axels. As for children who approach this Mother’s Day with a lengthy charge-sheet, ask yourselves: as unsatisfactory, and non-amazing as she was, did your mother ever, like Frances McDormand’s character in Three Billboards, kick your schoolfriends in the crotch? Did she insult the vicar? Shout that she hoped you’d get raped? Or deform your entire character, like the wicked, pickled racist, old Mrs Dixon, in the same film? Then you’re already ahead. Thanks Mum, on this special day, for never setting fire to a police station. There’s another point in it for Mum if she never, like the mother in Greta Gerwig’s Lady Bird, fat-shamed you in a dress shop. The arresting rejection of social norms by older female characters, in these recent films, has elicited a cathartic audience response whose intensity surely derives from the characters being, technically, nurturers. From whom better things are expected. For stepmothers, adoptive ones, or single women without children (“spinsters”, as the Daily Mail still likes to call them), Hollywood has always devised LaVona-like manifestations of bitterness, weirdness or lip-pursing, a tradition to which Lesley Manville’s neat tyrant in Phantom Thread is just the latest, cherishable, addition. But where screen mothers are concerned, madness or some hopeless, hippyish, semi-disarming version of maternal inadequacy have generally been the maximum on offer to real-life nurturers seeking reassuringly dreadful comparators. Donald Winnicott’s fallible “good enough mother” was never likely to catch on, outside therapeutic circles, given the commercial energy promoting aproned paragons, with their enduring appeal to male beneficiaries of the status quo. Of all the gendered expectations inculcated in little girls, has any been as precious, in protecting male dominance, as the fallacy that child rearing is as reverenced in reality as it so often is on screen? Just in time for Mother’s Day, a study reported that parents of “boomerang” children perceive their refilled nests as a decline in “feelings of control, autonomy, pleasure and self-realisation in everyday life”. For some mothers, such as the Conservative Andrea Leadsom, or Labour’s Sarah Champion, the suggestion, cinematic and otherwise, that motherhood can be less than perfect will be yet more inconvenient. Is it possible that regular childbearing is not, after all, equivalent to an MA in political compassion and foresight? What childless Theresa May lacked, Leadsom argued, speaking “as a mum”, was her own, biologically superior, “very real stake in the future of our country”. She had, presumably with that in mind, voted Brexit. More recently, Champion disparagingly contrasted stakeless May’s policy on child abuse with her predecessor’s: “David Cameron got it and I think he got it because I went to him as a dad rather than going to him as a politician.” In their way, in fact, mums Leadsom and Champion join Alison Janney’s superb LaVona in demonstrating that motherhood is no guarantee of emotional health and may even be compatible with astonishingly insulting behaviour – in their case, to the one in five women who will not have a child. To say nothing of the glaring omission of what everybody knows: that a job and motherhood remains, for many women, a combination as gruelling, as it can be, with luck, fulfilling – and one unlikely to get any easier while prominent mothers rehearse pieties about its sacrificial specialness. • Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/09/soembie-soe-gschwind-penski-overwatch-league","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T20:13:38Z","webTitle":"eSports analyst receives death threats after thanking men on women's day","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/09/soembie-soe-gschwind-penski-overwatch-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/09/soembie-soe-gschwind-penski-overwatch-league","fields":{"headline":"eSports analyst receives death threats after thanking men on women's day","bodyText":"A prominent eSports commentator revealed on Thursday that she received “death threats and hundreds of hate messages” in response to a tweet expressing gratitude to men for their support on International Women’s Day. Soe Gschwind-Penski, the Overwatch League host and analyst known as Soembie, had sent a tweet earlier on Thursday offering “a special shoutout to all the men in our lives who have supported us, gave us a voice when we had none, fought for our cause and treated us the way we all ought to treat each other...like a fellow human being - no race, no gender”. But shortly after, the 29-year-old from Switzerland described the heaps of abuse prompted by her initial remark by way of responding to a user who wrote: “Lady you have some internal misogyny to deal with”. “Ive gotten death threats and hundreds of hate messages the past 20 minutes because I thanked men for treating me as their equal, on a day which is all about womens struggle for equality,” Gschwind-Penski posted. “Hate, because I am grateful for the men in our lives who fight alongside us for our rights.” She added: “[D]id I offend you by treating ALL genders equal and thank humans for treating each other the way they should? Believe it or not but women are not the only ones fighting for equality.” The professional scene around Overwatch, a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter from World of Warcraft developer Blizzard featuring a diverse cast of heroes spanning genders and ethnicities, has at times struggled to reflect the game’s inclusive values. The two-year-old OWL did make headlines last month when South Korean teenager Kim Se-yeon signed with the Shanghai Dragons to become the league’s first female player. But high-profile eSports competitions remain a male-dominated space: Gschwind-Penski is the only female member of OWL’s full-time commentary team."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/09/russian-spy-attack-focus-falls-on-salisbury-cemetery","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T10:50:30Z","webTitle":"Russian spy attack: Rudd calls emergency Cobra meeting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/09/russian-spy-attack-focus-falls-on-salisbury-cemetery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/09/russian-spy-attack-focus-falls-on-salisbury-cemetery","fields":{"headline":"Russian spy attack: Rudd calls emergency Cobra meeting","bodyText":"Investigators have been summoned for emergency talks on the inquiry in Salisbury, where the repercussions of a suspected nerve agent attack continue to grow. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, will chair a meeting of the government’s Cobra committee at 3pm on Saturday to receive updates on the police inquiry, Downing Street said. The Russian double agent Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, remain in critical condition in hospital after being exposed to a toxic substance in the Wiltshire city last Sunday. DS Nick Bailey, who was part of the initial response by authorities, is also in a serious condition. Almost 200 members of the armed forces arrived on the streets of Salisbury on Friday to support police investigating the nerve agent attack on the Skripals. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said armed forces personnel would return to Salisbury in similar numbers on Saturday as the investigation and cleanup operation continued. On Friday attention focused on the cemetery, with experts in hazmat suits setting up tents over the grave of Skripal’s wife, Liudmila, and the memorial to his son Alexander, who both died in recent years. Soldiers, bomb disposal specialists, marines and RAF personnel were called in to help secure vehicles and scenes that may have been contaminated and to take the pressure off the police. The deployment included experts in chemical warfare. The Metropolitan police dismissed reports that an exhumation took place on Friday and said there were no plans to carry one out. Liudmila’s death certificate said she died of cancer in 2012, aged 59, while Alexander died in March last year in St Petersburg, aged 43, in unknown circumstances. He was cremated. Most attention seemed to be being paid to the site of his memorial stone, which is topped by a model of a St Bernard dog. Earlier, a convoy of military lorries accompanied by police escorts, incident response units and an ambulance arrived at Salisbury district hospital to remove a police car believed to have been used in the response to the attack. It has emerged that DS Bailey visited the Salisbury home of Skripal after he and Yulia were found slumped on a bench in the city centre. Investigators want to know if he was contaminated during that visit, or whether he visited the scene where they were found and was poisoned there or by items there. Sources say that it is believed to be more likely that Bailey became contaminated at the home. The Met commissioner, Cressida Dick, paid tribute to Bailey, his colleagues and other emergency services: “It’s a very challenging investigation. It’s obviously a very challenging environment to work in. And I guess these very vivid images that people are seeing just reminds people of what our first responders, what our forensics people, what our investigators do and may find themselves doing, and the professionalism and courage that takes.” Dick declined to comment when asked about the former Met commissioner Ian Blair backing calls for 14 other deaths to be re-examined after the Salisbury incident. The Cobra meeting, to be attended by the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, and the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, among others, will be updated on the police investigation, which government sources described as “moving quite quickly”. However, Downing Street stressed that the committee, which coordinates the government’s handling of emergencies, was not the forum for considering potential diplomatic responses. With suspicion falling on the Russian state, Theresa May is said to be determined to be tougher than the UK was after the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko in 2006. The government is understood to have several options, including expelling diplomats, revising sanctions, not officially sending a minister to the football World Cup, designating Russia as a state sponsor of terror – and even, though this is believed to be unlikely, declassifying intelligence implicating President Vladimir Putin. Westminster is understood to think that the UK gains few benefits from good relations with Putin and Johnson’s visit to Moscow was not deemed a success. The Salisbury MP, John Glen, said constituents were demanding “decisive action” be taken against whoever is responsible. The economic secretary to the Treasury said: “A whole range of tools are at our disposal depending on who has perpetrated this act, including a number of financial and economic levers.” Glen said he suspected shock over the attack would give way to “genuine anger at the audacity of what has taken place”. But the government would not be “acting precipitously”, he said. “Now is the time for cool heads and a rational examination of the facts. Once these are established, then, and only then, will an appropriate and proportionate course of action be taken.” During a visit to Salisbury, Rudd said she understood people wanted answers to the “outrageous” attack. “But the best way to get to them is to make sure we give the police the space they need to really go through the area carefully, to do their investigation and to make sure that they have all the support that they need in order to get that.” Among the troops in Salisbury were experts in surveillance from the Royal Tank Regiment, Royal Marines from 40 Commando and members of the RAF Regiment. Chemical warfare instructors were on the ground as well as bomb disposal experts from 29 Explosive Ordnance Disposal and Search Group. The use of a nerve toxin is seen as a key indicator of possible Kremlin involvement, with such substances usually held only in state military stockpiles. Moscow has repeatedly denied any involvement, the same line used when Litvinenko was poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 in his cup of tea. A public inquiry a decade later concluded that the Kremlin had ordered the killing. Meanwhile, the Russian embassy tweeted: “Investigation of Sergei Skripal case follows the Litvinenko script: most info to be classified, Russia to get no access to investigation files and no opportunity to assess its credibility.” Additional reporting: Ewen MacAskill, Luke Harding and Patrick Wintour"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/18/sparkling-red-wine-david-williams","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T06:00:08Z","webTitle":"Sparking reds: a fizz with a difference","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/18/sparkling-red-wine-david-williams","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/18/sparkling-red-wine-david-williams","fields":{"headline":"Sparking reds: a fizz with a difference","bodyText":"Jean-Paul Thévenet On Pète la Soif France 2016, £19, Roberson Wine Before the wine growers of Champagne worked out how to get bubbles into their wine around 400 years ago, their stock in trade was red wines. These unfizzy reds are still made in the region – pale, high-acid pinot noirs that come across like a brisker, more piercing version of burgundy – but the champenois never got into making sparkling reds. This curious historical anomaly helps explain why the style isn’t more popular elsewhere: after all, Champagne is the place that set the clear, crystalline template that all others have tended to follow. But, once you’ve got over the initial feeling that fizzy red wine is some strange gastronomic experiment, they can be wonderful – the spritzy fizz On Pète la Soif, for example, only adding to the thirst-quenching nature of its vivid red fruit.

It’s a name that may cause involuntary shudders of shameful recognition for those of you who, like me, started off their wine-drinking lives with the sweetly industrial concoctions. At best, however, Lambrusco is among the very best things you can have with antipasti. Marks &amp; Spencer Lambrusco 2016 (£9) is all bountiful fresh dark berries; Monte delle Vigne Lambrusco Classico NV (from £11.50, Lea &amp; Sandeman) is even more vivacious with its fruit and adds a little more tannic grip to the mix; while the Villa Cialdini is superbly tangy and succulent. Leconfield Syn Rouge Sparkling Shiraz Coonawarra, Australia, £13.96, Hard to Find Wines The masters of modern sparkling reds can be found in Australia, where winemakers tend to use shiraz grapes as the base for wines that can be wonderfully rich and indulgent. The apotheosis of this Australian original is Barossa growers Rockford’s Black Shiraz (around £60, Noel Young Wines), an extraordinary wine that mixes intensely concentrated, creamy, aniseed spice-seasoned dark fruit and a rip-tide of fresh acidity, tannin and silky bubbles. At a rather more human price, Peter Lehmann Black Queen Sparkling Shiraz, McLaren Vale, Australia 2012 (£17.95, Just in Cases) is deep, dark and wonderfully supple, while Leconfield’s Syn Rouge has a dollop of port-style sweet fortified wine added at the end of the winemaking process to give it extra chocolate-dipped cherry fun.

Now Tracy is back, in a new illustrated book set on a rough housing estate in modern-day London – and this time Tracy is a mother with a challenging nine-year-old daughter of her own. In her first interview about the forthcoming book, My Mum Tracy Beaker, Wilson told the Observer she came up with the idea after seeing mothers clutching copies of The Story of Tracy Beaker they had read as 10-year-olds, and now encouraging their own daughters to read it. “It’s stimulating to think about how people develop as they get older,” she said. “Tracy has been a character that’s haunted me. She’s the sort of person who sticks in your mind. “When I realised just how long ago it was since I wrote the first Tracy Beaker book, I thought: if we were in real time, Tracy herself would be in her 30s. And I’ve always thought that, even though Tracy had lots of problems in her life and a pretty rubbish mum who was never there for her, Tracy herself would be a good mum, no matter what.” The book is narrated from the perspective of Tracy’s daughter, Jess, and is aimed at both 7-11-year-olds and, in a new move for Wilson, adults and teenagers who enjoyed the Tracy Beaker series as children. “A knowing teenager or an adult will read something and understand it, while it will go straight over Jess’s head.” Tracy, who in the 1991 bestseller chronicled her childhood in a care home nicknamed “the dumping ground”, is now trying her best to raise a child on a low income in an expensive city and a materialistic world. As a single mother who is in and out of work, she struggles to make ends meet and lives in a housing association flat, similar to the one Wilson herself grew up in Kingston upon Thames, south-west London. “It’s a setting I feel really comfortable in.” She wanted the sequel to be realistic: “How many young women without much education earn enough, with a daughter, to be able to buy their own home in London today? Being Tracy, she wants to be independent, but with a child, how can she be? So she’s having to scratch around.” Like the original Tracy Beaker book, which spawned a hugely successful TV series, it is a story that simultaneously highlights the damage that was done to Tracy as a child and her resilience and ability to overcome her misfortunes. The fact that Jess has never suffered the rejection and heartbreak that Tracy came across as a child is a key theme of the book. “With Tracy, you get all this mouthiness, all this cheek, all this rushing around seemingly not being scared – but inside, even as an adult, there are a lot of insecurities. Jess herself is much quieter, more timid and worried about what other people think of her. But, inside, she’s more confident, and I think more of an adult than Tracy is.” Wilson has never forgotten the stigma that was attached to children in care in the 1990s, and says there were a lot of problems with the books initially because they dealt with this subject matter. It was difficult to sell merchandise and the rights to the books because Beaker was not seen as aspirational, she says. “It was very much felt that she wasn’t pretty, she wasn’t good. But that was then.” The new book is due to be published in October, and Wilson, 72, is still in the middle of writing it – or possibly near the end. “I don’t really know how much I’ve got left. I think I’m getting to the end but sometimes things take me by surprise. “It’s certainly a chunky, meaty book.” It will be her 108th. “Nick is waiting to illustrate it, and the editors at Puffin are saying: let’s poke the old girl a bit.” She laughs. “It will get done in time. It’s been great fun.” Sharratt has naturally been begging her to tell him what will happen to Tracy. “I said no, not yet, because I don’t know for certain myself. And he said: but I do hope you’re giving Tracy a happy ending and that everything’s going to work out well for her.” Is it? She wriggles. “I don’t want an ‘absolutely everything is quite wonderful’ ending – after all, at the start of the first book Tracy herself says life isn’t a fairy story where everyone lives happily ever after. I’m dealing with adults leading adult lives, and I want to be truthful to all that.” She pauses dramatically. “But she is my lucky character … and I have a soft spot for her too.” The next thing she says is: “She’s going to get her happy ending.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/18/allotment-fever-and-seed-obsession-allan-jenkins","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T06:00:07Z","webTitle":"Allotment fever and seed obsession","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/18/allotment-fever-and-seed-obsession-allan-jenkins","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/18/allotment-fever-and-seed-obsession-allan-jenkins","fields":{"headline":"Allotment fever and seed obsession","bodyText":"My name is Allan. I am an addict. I can’t stop scoring seed. It’s as if the joy is in the collecting not the sowing and growing (though I love to do that, too). Every spring, around now, I sort seed, gather the packets into groups, into leafy crops and flowers, assorted fruits and roots. There will be multiple versions of the same packets, many from the same supplier. I also suffer from seed amnesia, groundhog days of growing. I tell myself it’s about supporting small producers, though I will always save seed, too. I divide leaf crops into four families: salads, herbs, bitter chicories, leaves for cooking: pak chois, spinaches, chards and kales. The fruit collection will include climbing beans, peas, corn, courgettes and summer squash. Roots are more restrained: mostly radishes, beetroots and a new obsession with turnips (to be eaten raw and wafer-thin, the leaves lightly steamed and dressed with olive oil). Flowers are always old-school: pot marigolds and nasturtiums for colour and companion planting, plus grandiflora sweetpeas for scent. By mid-March, the manure has been spread, the plot soil well hoed, the broad beans have come through. Some early calendula are already sown. Next in line: speedy rockets and radish. I will consult the Maria Thun biodynamic planting calendar (it’s easy now it’s an app, though the booklet’s best if it’s new to you). I’ll pack my pockets with appropriate seed and string. Then I’ll water the baby plants and watch over them. I’ll weed and thin out the leaves (I always over-sow). I will feast on home-grown salads, summer beets and beans, eat peas from the pod.

Time to stop pretending","bodyText":"Warnings that Calais could prove to be Brexit’s hidden fireball should not come as a great surprise. While Ireland has, for political reasons, long proved to be the focus of anxiety about the UK/EU goods trade after we leave the bloc, far more traffic crosses the Channel, and, in the worst-case scenario, blocked ports at Calais or Dover could strangle Britain’s economy, manufacturing and food supply. The manager of the port of Calais and the region’s president were not doom-mongering for their own amusement when they privately warned MEPs about the oncoming dangers. Calais’s boss, Jean-Marc Puissesseau, is entirely correct that compulsory tariff checks (as a result of leaving the customs union) and phytosanitary checks (as a result of leaving the single market) will simply be unavoidable legal realities if the government insists on putting us outside key economic instruments. His predictions of 30-mile tailbacks and rotting food – not to mention the businesses that will be crippled by the disruption to just-in-time manufacturing – must be treated with the utmost seriousness. Except the government still has its fingers in its ears. Despite her reasonable tone at her Mansion House speech this month, the prime minister has settled in her bunker, refuses to heed warnings, and continues to offer solutions she knows the EU cannot accept. The UK’s only concrete proposals so far – a “customs partnership” and unprecedented technological solutions – have been dismissed outright in Brussels. If we do not secure a soft Brexit at the end of the transition, we will either have a hard Brexit or no deal at all. A hard Brexit – which is the EU’s expectation if we sign a Canada-style free trade agreement – means compulsory border controls. Outside the customs union, all goods must face rules-of-origin checks at either Dover or Calais to ensure that goods from the rest of the world pay the correct EU tariffs. This will be the case even if UK goods face no tariffs. Outside the single market, the UK may not implement future EU standards, and could, for example, import currently forbidden US foodstuffs as part of a new trade deal. All agricultural goods crossing the Channel must consequently be inspected in order to guarantee the security and integrity of the EU’s standards and supply chains. If we leave the EU without any deal at all – which the government still insists is a possibility – there will be no agreements whatsoever to facilitate trade or give preferential access to UK goods arriving in Calais. We will also not have the luxury of a two-year transition to prepare the new infrastructure. In the event of either a no-deal or hard Brexit – the latter of which is, of course, the government’s declared choice – the infrastructure at our ports will be placed under unprecedented strain. Even if the government chooses not to implement new controls on incoming goods, the French and Belgian authorities will be compelled to do so, which could hold up lorries on the British side before they even board the ferry. Although a new customs system for British ports is being planned, it is not close to being ready, and there is little evidence of the new lorry parks – or thousands of extra customs officials – that will be required the day the transition ends. Puissesseau stressed that goods from the UK would be treated the same as those from anywhere else in the world – causing potential disaster to British exporters who depend on participating in complex supply chains with roll-on, roll-off traffic. As ever with Brexit, the solution is staring us in the face. The EU has made clear that the only way of keeping the Irish border invisible is to keep Northern Ireland in a “common regulatory area” with the EU – that is, a full customs union with the EU’s common external tariff, and a single market in goods. If that is the only way to keep the Irish border open and seamless, without any checks, the same is also true of Britain’s borders with France and Belgium. Brussels insists that a seamless border requires both a customs union and a single market. No other kind of frictionless border exists anywhere on Earth. The entire UK must stay in both. May no longer pretends that we will retain the “exact same benefits” of the EU, as David Davis used to. But last week at Mansion House she did promise five tests for Brexit. One was to protect jobs and security; another was to keep Britain outward-looking. A broken border and rotting food at Calais do not qualify. Nor do they remotely meet any democratic mandate. If this is the best the government can think of, it must think again. So, ultimately, might we. • Jonathan Lis is deputy director of the thinktank British Influence"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/16/out-nothing-daniel-locke-david-blandy-graphic-novel-creation-universe","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T12:00:04Z","webTitle":"Out of Nothing review – a breezy trip from the big bang to the end of days\r\n","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/16/out-nothing-daniel-locke-david-blandy-graphic-novel-creation-universe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/16/out-nothing-daniel-locke-david-blandy-graphic-novel-creation-universe","fields":{"headline":"Out of Nothing review – a breezy trip from the big bang to the end of days\r\n","bodyText":"This bright, imaginative graphic novel moves from the universe’s creation to its destruction, taking in clay tablets, the Gutenberg Bible, the birth of hip-hop and DNA sequencing.

Her account celebrates humanity’s attempts to explore the world around it and the great beyond, from cave paintings and lion totems to scientists and astronauts. Darkness (whether the Manhattan Project or existential nihilism) lingers around the edges, but this is a mostly breezy account, fuelled by the good stuff – campfire companionship, creative leaps and symbols that talk to us across the centuries. The book looks great, mixing human drama with deep-green forests, magnified cells, vibrant stars and wine that seems to hover in the glass.

Lately, I have come to identify as the Duke of Edinburgh, a man famous for barging around the world insulting the locals. I also say the wrong things, although I try to avoid out-and-out racism. To a visually impaired woman with a guide dog, the Duke once said: “Do you know they’re now producing eating dogs for the anorexics?” He is lauded as the don of the Clarkson-Littlejohn truthtelling variety rather than a rude git. Can I say “git”? I love the word git. As I live with a social justice warrior (a teenager) I feel increasingly Dukey. I am in constant trouble for the things I say. When referring to somone as gay the other day, she yelled that I was “biphobic”. It all ended badly, with me informing her that the difference between a straight man and a gay man was half a lager. I shouldn’t have said that. I should have said craft beer. We made up with a takeway. She ordered a potato curry with her masala dosa. When I said: “That’s a lot of potatoes,” she called me racist, because she is half Irish. This is not a rant about political correctness, which to me is basically good manners. Its fine to ask people what they want to be called and correct to call them that, but language is changing very fast. The divide now is not merely between generations, but through tertiary education. Checking one’s privilege means checking one’s vocab. If I make a remark about what my daughters are wearing, I am informed that I am the worst feminist of all time. This is hardly the first time this accusation has been levelled at me. However, the fragmentation of identity politics into shards of language that always seem to hurt someone else troubles me. This is not about snowflakes versus gamey old gals. Words matter. Words connect the ideas that make up the unequal status quo. Language is self-seeding. Of course disabled people are right to challenge the words that have been used to describe them. I used to call Donald Trump a “gimp”, but I was informed that this is a disablist term, rather than something from BDSM practice. I am not sure if I should continue to use “div”, which derives from prison slang; the least intelligent inmates were employed to put dividers into cardboard boxes. Please don’t take my favourite word, pranny, away from me. We need to connect the words to the lived experience of their concepts. I think LGBTQIPO is too long to get on a badge and I don’t see what omnisexual can bring to the party that the other initials can’t. There has been so much focus on the correct word for sexual identities, but political correctness is needed around the language of politics. Refugees/migrants/asylum seekers: these words matter. One of the things I hate most about Brexit is its wilful destruction of the language. I hate the words Brexit, remain, remoaner, remaniac. I maintain that remain would have won if it had not chosen such an idiotic, passive, emotionless word for its stance. I look at the new language of the Corbyn crew – “melts”, “slugs”, “gammon” – and see a discourse of contempt. I wonder then about what inclusiveness might look like. Or even solidarity. Words can include or exclude us. Many of us are a bit bewildered and we don’t know the words. But that doesn’t mean we can’t hum the tune. Matthew Parris’s mistake? Telling women how to do feminism One can still feel the waves of the #MeToo backlash lapping against one’s feet. The moment any woman anywhere speaks her truth, you can guarantee that a man somewhere will accuse her of wallowing in victimhood. Of course, victim-blaming is not a gendered issue. A lot of women would like a lot of other women to shut up, because they have “just got on with it” or put things to the back of their memory and don’t want to be reminded. Still, it was galling, to say the least, to see the brilliant Matthew Parris tell women to stop being victims. He has been stalked and is now just hunky-dory so … you know, what is the problem? Now that stories of abuse, from Rotherham to Haiti to Weinstein and Westminster, are finally being told, a “pull your socks up, chaps” attitude is absolutely tone deaf. Parris wrote that feminism is about empowerment, not pity. Yes, I agree: feminists should not look like victims. So, read the accounts of girls who have been drugged and raped by grooming gangs. Read the stories of powerful women who were attacked by Weinstein; of women who tried to blow the whistle at Oxfam. Parris writes: “If someone gropes you, kick him in the balls. That’s what feminism looks like.” But, the thing is, chaps, you don’t get to tell women how to do feminism. I suggest, in fact, that you cover your groin. Ray of Light still shimmers, even after 20 years Twenty years on, Ray of Light still sounds wonderful, doesn’t it? I remember having to review it and feeling a bit worried. Madonna had had a dodgy few years and a baby. Would she be even more of a control freak? But she was not just surfing the zeitgeist – she went deep. She sang of trading fame for love, of being diminished in relationships, of being selfish, of her dead mother. Her voice was deeper. In William Orbit, she found someone who could give her music space and depth. She could breathe. Her friend, the late designer David Collins, told me she was delighted with what I had said: that she had let herself go. I danced around my kitchen to that news. She remains a marvel and Ray of Light, which I am listening to now, still shimmers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2018/feb/28/qs-world-university-rankings-2018-chemical-engineering","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T13:30:22Z","webTitle":"QS world university rankings 2018: chemical engineering","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/feb/28/qs-world-university-rankings-2018-chemical-engineering","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2018/feb/28/qs-world-university-rankings-2018-chemical-engineering","fields":{"headline":"QS world university rankings 2018: chemical engineering","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/04/britain-brexit-boris-johnson-six-former-foreign-secretaries-speak","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T08:00:41Z","webTitle":"Six former foreign secretaries on Brexit, Britain… and Boris","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/04/britain-brexit-boris-johnson-six-former-foreign-secretaries-speak","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/04/britain-brexit-boris-johnson-six-former-foreign-secretaries-speak","fields":{"headline":"Six former foreign secretaries on Brexit, Britain… and Boris","bodyText":"Amid the prosaic setting of British politics, with its fusty civil servants and turgid party meetings, the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs stands out as the most glamorous of cabinet appointments. There’s the exotic travel, the hobnobbing with dignitaries, the adrenalin rush of serious global events – who cares about the campaign to stop the local post office closing down when you’ve got a vote at the UN security council to deal with. And there’s the sense, bolstered by your Foreign Office staff and the never less than precarious condition of international relations, that what you say and do actually matters. Still, behind all the photocalls, the joint accords and bland diplomatic statements, what does a foreign secretary really do? After all, when it comes to the most critical foreign policy – military intervention – it’s the prime minister who’s in the hot seat. Although foreign secretary is one of the three great offices of state beneath that of the PM, it doesn’t enjoy the autonomy of chancellor or the isolation of home secretary – a ministry from which prime ministers are often all too keen to distance themselves. At the key moments, foreign policy is the preserve of No 10. Furthermore, at this present juncture, the job description of foreign secretary seems more amorphous than ever. Britain stands at an uncertain crossroads. The world order is shifting, and our traditional ally, the United States, is run by a maverick reality TV star who wants to pull back from international commitments while conducting global policy via his Twitter account. Then, of course, there is Brexit. The nation seems stuck at the door, neither ready to face the harsh world outside nor prepared to return to the embittered marital home. For all the talk of getting our country back, there is a growing fear that we will return to being what John Updike once called “a soggy little island huffing and puffing to keep up with western Europe”. And where in all this trepidation is the current foreign secretary, Boris Johnson? He appears to have been more vocal about the plight of the National Health Service – not traditionally seen as part of the Foreign Office’s remit – than he has been involved in the most momentous change in foreign policy since the second world war. And when he does intervene, as shown by his recent comparison of the Irish border to the line between the London boroughs of Camden and Islington, he tends to make more headlines than headway. In an age of American unpredictability, Russian subversion, Chinese expansionism and European divorce, what should British foreign policy be, and what does or should a British foreign secretary do? To get an answer to these questions, I set out to speak to as many former foreign secretaries as possible. There are 10 of them still living. Philip Hammond, who was in the role from 2014-2016, is still in the cabinet, and therefore not forthcoming enough for our purposes. John Major only did the job for three months, barely enough time to unpack the family photos. Douglas Hurd, who retired from politics two years ago, is 87 and has recently been unwell, and Peter Carrington, the last hereditary peer to hold the post, is 98, and a little out of circulation. That left six who were keen to talk, some of them very keen, so much so that it required all my powers of diplomacy to extract myself from their loquacious company. There aren’t many places to go when you’ve been foreign secretary. Either you become prime minister or it’s down or out. In theory, you could get shifted sideways to chancellor, as happened with Hammond, but in the case of the six I spoke to, foreign secretary was the highest political office they were to hold. So I couldn’t help but detect a melancholy hankering for grander times enshrouding some of the reminiscences. Even David Owen – who at 79 still displays the intellectual confidence that intimidated many political opponents, not to mention allies – betrayed a certain nostalgia for his globetrotting days in office. He speaks in forensic detail of meetings and conversations that took place over 40 years ago, suggesting they still occupied a treasured place in his thoughts. I spoke to Owen at his home, the location in 1981 for the “Limehouse Declaration” that launched the Social Democratic party, with its commanding view of the Thames. Owen became foreign secretary at the age of 38, one of the youngest in history. He served James Callaghan’s government between 1977 and 1979. Was he daunted by the size of the job at such a young age? “I was always accused of either being abrasive or arrogant. Which in part was true,” he says in a tone that does not convey regret. “But, you know, you have the confidence of youth. One of the things about being appointed young is that you can absorb a huge amount of information quickly. And it isn’t long before you have to keep up to date with the constant flow of telegrams.” Owen believes that he was the last but one of what he calls “the historic foreign secretaries”, those who ran foreign policy themselves rather than meekly deferring to the prime minister of the day. “I think the job changed hugely after [his successor] Carrington’s resignation [at the start of the Falklands war],” he says. Thereafter, he believes an emboldened Margaret Thatcher took ever more control of foreign policy. This trend, according to Owen, slackened a little under John Major but was redoubled by the time of Tony Blair. “I mean, [Blair] didn’t really like Robin Cook. He didn’t like any of his foreign secretaries.” He says Labour’s most successful prime minister subsumed much of the foreign secretary’s remit “into the No 10 machinery” in what he describes as “an unbelievable constitutional power grab”. Unsurprisingly, the other five foreign secretaries I spoke to didn’t agree that they were their PMs’ ventriloquist dummies. All acknowledged Owen’s general point but in one way or another saw themselves as exceptions to that rule. Perhaps the most confusing case is the current foreign secretary. He appears to have more political liberty than any cabinet member in a generation… except, it seems, in matters of foreign policy. What is Owen’s opinion of the man? “I’m not going to answer this question,” he replies, uncharacteristically coy. “I joke and say that it’s a trade union of foreign secretaries. It’s a hard enough bloody task without being sniped at by your fellow foreign secretaries.” Later on he says he thinks Johnson is a “big figure” and “perfectly competent”. So I ask about the gaffe involving Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the Anglo-Iranian woman imprisoned in Tehran on charges of “plotting to topple the Iranian regime”. In evidence to the foreign affairs committee, Johnson controversially described Zaghari-Ratcliffe as someone who was “teaching people journalism”, a phrase that was jumped on by the Iranians as confirmation of her supposed treason. “I don’t believe he made a mistake on this because he’d forgotten,” says Owen. “Now, either he is not devoting enough time to reading and keeping up to date in this huge field, or the selection of telegrams for him is not good enough from his own private office.” I ask a few more Johnson-related questions, and the fiercely pro-Brexit Owen concludes with a firm warning: “All I’m telling you is that there are ominous signs that the real lessons of the failures of British foreign policy over the last 20 years or so have not been learnt: the prime minister has got to appoint somebody as foreign secretary they trust. The foreign secretary has to have a dominant relationship over the secretary of state for defence, but a close one. But ultimately those two need to work together, and there must be a readiness of the prime minister to support them in battles with the chancellor wherever humanly possible.” Malcolm Rifkind, who served under John Major’s premiership, largely endorses Owen’s stark appraisal. I meet him in his London flat a few hundred yards from Westminster. The place is thick with photos of Rifkind with major figures like Margaret Thatcher and Mikhail Gorbachev, and the wistful air of bygone glories. Rifkind’s career came to an ignominious end after a “cash for access” sting operation by the Daily Telegraph and Channel 4 led him to step down as chairman of the intelligence and security committee and give up his safe Kensington seat. A parliamentary investigation later exonerated him. He became foreign secretary in July 1995, almost exactly in the middle of that misleading lull between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Twin Towers, when history was alleged to have ended. But history was stubbornly continuing in the Balkans. A week after Rifkind got the job, the massacre of more than 8,000 Muslim Bosnians took place at Srebrenica. Rifkind’s predecessor, Hurd, pursued a policy of neutrality, supported by Rifkind, that was criticised for leaving the Bosnian Muslims at the mercy of well-armed Serb nationalism. Srebrenica stung Nato into action, and the air strikes that followed brought the Bosnian war to a swift end. After the failure of the non-interventionist line to impede the war, the belated bombing seemed to herald the new paradigm of progressive military engagement that Tony Blair would later adopt. Rifkind demurs. “I think that the road to Baghdad began in Kosovo,” he says sternly. Back in the 90s, such was the sense of optimism that even the Israel/Palestine conflict seemed soluble. Rifkind believed that peace was within reach until Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by an Israeli rightwing extremist in November 1995. The day after Rabin’s funeral, Rifkind visited the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, in Gaza. “He said, ‘I’m sorry, this is going to be a shorter meeting than I would’ve liked because I’m being driven up to see Leah Rabin (Rabin’s widow), to pay my condolences privately.’ The chemistry was of a totally different order to what we have now, and Mahmoud Abbas [the current Palestinian leader] is a much more moderate guy than Arafat ever was.” Rifkind tells the story to demonstrate how critical personal relations are to international relations. “Where people are looking for solutions, they find solutions. When they’re looking for problems, they find problems. You can make a difference by your own personal involvement, the relationship you have with the foreign ministers of other countries, even if they don’t always agree with you.” In Boris Johnson’s case this task has been made more challenging by his track record of insulting foreign leaders. Just two months before he became foreign secretary, he wrote a poem about President Erdoğan of Turkey having sex with a goat. Four months later he was in Ankara meeting Turkey’s EU minister, Ömer Çelik, and promising, now that Britain was leaving, to support Turkey’s bid to join the EU. Notwithstanding these lyrical contributions, Rifkind believes Johnson is able to build good personal relationships but suggests he’s undermined because he lacks the backing of Theresa May. “I’d have made David Davis [secretary of state for exiting the European Union] part of the foreign office structure – but then I would have been more confident in the choice of foreign secretary that I had.” Before I leave him, I ask Rifkind what he thinks of his successors. He runs through them in chronological order. Robin Cook, he says, was intensely disliked within the foreign office because of his chaotic style of working, but was held in high regard by foreign ministers. Cook notably declared his aim to have an “ethical dimension” to policy, a statement on which Rifkind took issue. “Not because there shouldn’t be an ethical dimension, but to imply somehow you can only have as your diplomatic allies people who share your political values just doesn’t make sense in this sad, imperfect world, and ultimately he agreed with that.” Jack Straw, who followed Cook, he describes as a “highly able guy” who “was perhaps unfortunate having Blair as his boss”. Straw lives in a quiet square a few minutes walk from the Oval cricket ground in Kennington. He fell foul of the same sting operation as Rifkind and stood down from parliament before the last election. He too was exonerated by parliament’s commissioner for standards. He’s a genial character who, despite having been home secretary and foreign secretary for a combined total of nine years, displays none of the sense of entitlement that politicians of a similar standing tend to exude. Straw believes foreign secretary is a job apart because, unusually in British politics, foreign policy is “broadly bipartisan”. He was by his own account quite surprised to be given the job by Tony Blair, with whom, he says, contrary to Owen’s claim, he had a good relationship. “The first thing you’ve got to accept if you become foreign secretary is that the lead on foreign policy is going to be taken by the head of government. It was ever thus.” I mention that Owen said it was different in his day. “Oh, I enjoyed significant autonomy as well on some stuff, most notably about Iran. I’m not trying to diminish David’s role, but I think it’s more true with Peter Carrington over Zimbabwe, where he just ploughed on when Margaret Thatcher was in a relatively weak position in the early stages of her premiership.” He says the point is that while diplomacy is about resolving international disputes without resorting to war, the “moment that the issue of military action appears on the horizon, the centre of gravity is bound to move to No 10. That’s been true at all times.” He started at the Foreign Office in June 2001. The Balkans had settled down, and the first three months were almost becalmed. His priority was to curb the excesses taking place in Zimbabwe by helping financially with the land transfers from white farmers to black “war veterans”. Straw says he barely consulted Blair over this. “And then,” he says drily, “9/11 happened and everything changed.” During the course of the following 18 months, the UK, in support of the US, would enter two far-reaching wars, first in Afghanistan and next in Iraq. There would be mass anti-war protests, disputes about legality, allegations of British involvement in torture and renditions, British citizens held in Guantanamo, the spread of radicalisation across the Muslim world, the war on terror and instability throughout the Middle East. Short of a world war, no British foreign secretary is likely to experience that kind of succession of events for the foreseeable future. The policy of intervention that had secured peace and stability in Kosovo and Sierra Leone had, by the end of Straw’s stint in office, begun to look deeply suspect. It was Blair who made the decisions to go to war, but Straw was in agreement. “In practice, we had no option with Afghanistan, unless you wanted to leave it to the venal forces of the Taliban and their readiness to allow al-Qaida to carry on with its training camps and to commit atrocities around the world.” About Iraq he was much more sceptical. His wife and children were against the war and would have joined the protest march had he not been foreign secretary. He knew that soldiers and civilians would be killed in significant numbers, although he never expected the scale of bloodshed that was to follow. “That’s a responsibility you’ve got to bear,” he says, “and if you don’t, you shouldn’t take on these jobs.” Right up until the last moment, he was considering telling Blair that they should offer “moral support to the Americans, help with reconstruction”, but not put troops on the ground. In the end, he was persuaded by Saddam’s intransigence with weapons inspectors. “I thought they must have [WMD], otherwise why are they dicking about refusing to let the inspectors in.” The Iraq war remains his biggest regret in office. With hindsight, he says, “it would have been better that we’d not started”. In reality, Straw’s influence was limited. He had good relations with his American counterpart, secretary of state Colin Powell, but Powell was himself sidelined by others in the Bush administration. The only effective power Straw had was to resign, and by the time he realised that a civil war was brewing, his resignation would have had no impact on policy. Which brings us to the much vaunted, “special relationship” with America. Owen had told me that in his opinion it operated only in military and intelligence terms. But if the British military was subordinate to woeful American planning – the disbanding of the Iraqi army and dismissal of all Ba’ath party members was, says Straw, a disaster – then how special was that arrangement? “The special relationship was a phrase I sought to avoid,” he says, “because I thought it was patronising of the Americans and a piece of conceit by us.” Even after two wars and an unrelenting workload, Straw was disappointed to be removed from the job by Blair. “It was very odd the day after,” he says. “Enoch Powell famously said that all political lives end in failure. He was wrong. The thing is, all political lives end – and they end rather abruptly.” But what of that political life that, like a cat, appears to have multiple extensions? What does he think of Johnson? “He’s got a good grasp of history,” he says evenly. “He understands about political diplomatic forces, which is one of the most important qualifications for being foreign secretary. But sometimes he lets his persona as a showman get the better of him. I personally don’t think that works very well.” Straw was replaced by Margaret Beckett, the first ever female foreign secretary. I visit her at her capacious office in the bowels of parliament, where she still sits as MP for Derby South, 35 years after first being elected. Rifkind described Beckett as “a bright, intelligent lady” who didn’t have “much impact during the short period that she was there”. “It wasn’t,” he felt, “her scene.” It seems that Beckett wasn’t welcomed by some in the rather clubby atmosphere of the Foreign Office. She was told by a female Foreign Office veteran soon after she arrived: “I hope you realise there are people here who don’t think a woman should be foreign secretary.” She was taken aback by this news, coming as it did six years into the 21st century. Her approach to the job was to establish what the priorities were for foreign policy, but in this task she found the Foreign Office reluctant to help. “In the end,” she says, “basically I and my special adviser did it together.” She believes her task wasn’t helped by her refusal to cultivate the media, and therefore, she believes, she was saddled with a difficult image. “Going around the gossip circuit, telling spiteful stories against my colleagues has never been something I thought was part of the job,” she says with a knowing smile. Instead she focused on developing good working relationships with her foreign counterparts. And in this, she did believe in the “special relationship”. “It was real, it was important, and it wasn’t particularly a problem for me. I mean, I had a good relationship with Condi [secretary of state Condoleezza Rice), and it wasn’t one where I just did what she thought I ought to do. We had a genuine dialogue.” She never had to contend with the protests her predecessor witnessed but did receive flak for not calling for an immediate ceasefire when Israel went into Lebanon. She was even collared in a supermarket over Israel’s response to Hamas rocket attacks. “I remember someone shouted out, ‘Shopping while Gaza burns!’. And I thought, well, you know, we do have to eat.” A cool head and resilience, she says, are the main qualities required for the job, and the “recognition that you will be blamed”. How would she have dealt with building a relationship with Rex Tillerson, Donald Trump’s secretary of state? “It must be very difficult because you sometimes get the impression the president doesn’t know where he stands from one day to the next.” Like most of the former foreign secretaries I speak to, she believes that the current one should be playing a “much more major role” in the Brexit negotiations, and would be if it was anyone else but Johnson. It sounds, I say, like she’s not a fan. “When I was told that some of them in the Foreign Office didn’t think there ought to be a woman in the job, I thought to myself, I know exactly what sort of person they think should be foreign secretary. It should be somebody who went to the right school, who went to the right university, who is regarded as an intellectual and has wide knowledge of the world. And that’s what they’ve got.” She deliberates before putting these thoughts on record because she thinks it’s a bit “bitchy”, but then goes on to call Johnson a “walking embarrassment” for his pronouncements on Brexit. Beckett was in the job for only a year before she was replaced by the man everyone was expecting to take over, the man Rifkind described to me as “very, very good” with a “natural empathy” for the job: David Miliband. Now based in New York, where he runs the International Rescue Committee, Miliband spoke to me by phone. Foreign secretary in Gordon Brown’s government for three years from 2007, he says he had a clear vision of Britain’s role in the world when he got the job. “I talked about Britain as a global hub, connected to all the alliances that matter,” he says, and – once again contrary to Owen’s assertion – he insists he was his own man. “Gordon Brown was avowedly a prime minister who wanted to spend less time on foreign affairs than his predecessor. And that was symbolised in the toe-curling day when he didn’t come to sign the Lisbon treaty – I beg your pardon, he arrived much later in the day than everyone else. When all the prime ministers and presidents were called upon to sign the treaty in a very large cathedral in Lisbon, I trotted up there on my own.” He retains an engaged interest in global diplomacy, and it’s his assessment that there is now profound uncertainty afoot about Britain’s international role. “The abdication of American leadership on one hand, Brexit on the other, and all the causes and consequences of both those phenomena mean that it is legitimate to say there is an unprecedented questioning of Britain’s foreign policy.” People look to Britain to be “pragmatic, sensible, stable”, he says, but that’s not the impression the world currently has. “It’s hard to know what British foreign policy doctrine is at the moment. The government is consumed by dealing with Brexit, even if the Foreign Office has been banned from negotiating it – and that’s a remarkable situation. There’s also the reality that Boris Johnson has done a better job of undermining himself than any attack from me or anyone else could do.” But isn’t the post-Brexit vision supposed to be all about forming relationships with countries beyond Europe, reaching out to parts of the world to whom we’d previously undersold ourselves? “Obviously you can say there’s a global Britain under Brexit, which is the government’s argument, but there’s no question among the people I talk to in foreign policy circles and more widely that Britain has taken a turn towards isolation.” So what should a foreign secretary be seeking to achieve in a post-Brexit world? “The job of the foreign secretary will be to try to recreate some of the structures and relationships that existed within the EU,” he gloomily concludes, “except with the very difficult fact that he or she is excluded from all the key meetings.” Now in the Lords, William Hague, foreign secretary between David Miliband and Philip Hammond, paints a different picture of Johnson and Brexit. His pristine office is in Millbank, just along from parliament. He wants the UK to retain close links with the EU but argues that Johnson’s main job lies elsewhere. “I think he’s a brilliant guy,” he says, measuring his words. “He sees his job is to make sure Britain is engaged with the rest of the world while Brexit is going on. That’s critically important, not only in being innovative in finding new ways to cooperate with the EU when we’ve left, but also to show we’re not becoming less active in the world.” By Rifkind’s estimation, Hague will not be remembered “in terms of policy”, but rather as someone who attempted to revive the Foreign Office, reverse the closure of embassies and restore foreign language training. But Hague will also be remembered for the Libyan intervention – David Cameron’s call – and the failed House of Commons vote for intervention in Syria, following its use of chemical weapons. He describes this defeat as his “worst point” as foreign secretary, an “abrogation of this country’s responsibilities that made things in Syria worse and emboldened Russia to inflict more horrors on Syria than would otherwise have been the case”. He doesn’t regret the removal of Colonel Gaddafi in Libya, even though that country is now divided among warlords. But he says, a little ruefully: “One of the things we’ve learned in the last 10 years is how difficult it is to create democracy in other cultures, and that doing that quickly can actually set things back.” To return to Cook’s “ethical dimension”, I ask about the responsibilities of dealing with countries with bad human rights records. Do we not overlook such problems with, for example, Saudi Arabia, simply because we have lucrative trade deals? “We do have commercial and myriad of other links with countries whose system of government we don’t agree with, but that does not mean we cut them all off, and, indeed, we would be in a terrible situation if we did.” His policy, he says, was always to raise human rights at senior level meetings. “I think part of the necessary skills of foreign secretaries is to be frank and civil at the same time.” Yes, but should we be arming Saudi Arabia? He gives the kind of answer that can only be described as diplomatically evasive. “It’s clearly in the interest of our national security for Saudi Arabia to be a strong and successful nation and for its leadership to be successful, and it’s definitely in the interest of British industry for it to be able to buy from British industry. But it is also engaging in conflicts that raise questions about the use of what we sell to them.” It was John Kenneth Galbraith who said that the one reliable rule of diplomacy is that when an official says that talks were useful, you can safely conclude that nothing was accomplished. And in the end, the job of foreign secretary, for all its superficial glamour, is something of a thankless task. You spend most of your time and effort working behind the scenes for trade, peace, better relations, ideally making the right noises on human rights, and no one takes much notice until you make a mistake or your prime minister decides to send the air force in. And yet, although Boris Johnson once called being mayor of London “the best job in British politics”, most of his predecessors as foreign secretary would say that title belongs to the one he has now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/26/gun-control-laws-nra-congress-return-recess","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T07:04:26Z","webTitle":"Trump renews attack on Florida deputy: 'I’d run in there even if I didn’t have a weapon'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/26/gun-control-laws-nra-congress-return-recess","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/feb/26/gun-control-laws-nra-congress-return-recess","fields":{"headline":"Trump renews attack on Florida deputy: 'I’d run in there even if I didn’t have a weapon'","bodyText":"Donald Trump has renewed his criticism of an armed sheriff’s deputy who failed to enter a high school in Parkland, Florida, during a mass shooting this month, saying he would have run into the building even if he did not possess a weapon. Addressing a gathering of 39 state governors at the White House, Trump said officers who were outside the school at the time of the shooting “weren’t exactly medal of honor winners”. “The way they performed was really a disgrace,” he added. “I really believe I’d run in there even if I didn’t have a weapon.” The president spoke as lawmakers returned to Washington following a week-long recess and amid intensifying debate over gun laws. The 14 February massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school, in which 17 people were killed, has forced Congress to contend yet again with one of the most politically controversial issues. Trump has pushed for arming teachers – a proposal that has been pilloried by educators. In doing so he has repeatedly criticised Scot Peterson, the armed school resource deputy who waited outside Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school as the shooting transpired. Peterson resigned, after being suspended without pay. Trump has publicly attacked Peterson as a “coward” who he said “doesn’t love the children, probably doesn’t know the children”. Peterson denied the allegation in a written statement released through his lawyer on Monday, saying he had not entered the building because he believed the gunfire was coming from outside. “Mr Peterson wishes that he could have prevented the untimely passing of the 17 victims,” the attorney, Joseph DiRuzzo, wrote. “However, the allegations that Mr Peterson was a coward and that his performance, under the circumstances, failed to meet the standards of police officers, are patently untrue.” On Sunday, the Broward County sheriff, Scott Israel, told CNN he was investigating the behavior of three other deputies, who the network reported had been at the campus but had not entered the school. On Monday, Trump continued to call on Congress to take action on gun law – a departure from his response to previous shootings under his watch. The president has signaled support for tightening background checks and instructed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to work on a memorandum to outlaw bump stocks – the attachments that enable semiautomatic rifles and other devices to fire faster. Lawmakers are likely, however, to face familiar obstacles in passing even modest legislation, as midterm elections loom. The National Rifle Association has also come out aggressively against any new restrictions, even as public support for stricter gun laws has risen to its highest level since the early 1990s, according to a CNN poll released on Sunday. Trump told the group of governors on Monday he believed the NRA was open to at least some changes to gun laws, noting he had had dinner with the group’s leaders Wayne LaPierre and Chris Cox over the weekend. “Don’t worry about the NRA, they’re on our side,” Trump said. “Half of you are so afraid of the NRA. There’s nothing to be afraid of.” Although mass shootings had become almost routine in the US, drawing little reaction in Washington, events in Florida have spawned a rare grassroots backlash, led by students. The national outcry in the wake of Parkland could tee up the first major debate over gun laws since the 2012 massacre at the Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, in which 20 young children and six adults were killed. The Senate failed to expand background checks in the aftermath of Sandy Hook, due to a Republican-led filibuster of a bipartisan bill joined by a handful of Democrats. But several Democrat and Republican senators who were in office then said on Monday that the ground “has shifted”, owing in large part to the vocal activism of Parkland student survivors. Several pieces of legislation are under consideration. But only incremental measures appear to have any chance of passing, including a bipartisan proposal aimed at ensuring that states and federal agencies comply with and accurately report criminal and mental health records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (Nics). The White House has said Trump supports the bill, known as Fix Nics, but may seek some revisions to its language. A pair of senators are also poised to introduce bipartisan legislation that would raise the age for buying assault weapons, including the AR-15 used by the gunman in Parkland, from 18 to 21. Trump was supportive of the idea in the initial days after the Parkland shooting but has been less vocal since the NRA came out against the proposal last week. Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Monday that Trump was “still supportive of the concept” and denied the president had been influenced by the NRA. The president has nonetheless sent mixed signals on the issue of guns, most often returning to the controversial suggestion that the way to prevent school shootings such as that in Florida is to arm teachers. The proposal, which is backed by the NRA, is unlikely to garner support on Capitol Hill – but is indicative of Trump’s allegiance to gun rights activists and his base. Trump signaled on Monday he was open to taking on the NRA if necessary, stating: “If they’re not with you, we have to fight them every once in a while. “They’re doing what they think is right,” he added. “But sometimes we’re gonna have to be very tough and we’re gonna have to fight them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/feb/26/energy-storage-supercapacitors-electric-car-batteries-charging-times","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T17:32:00Z","webTitle":"Energy storage leap could slash electric car charging times","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/26/energy-storage-supercapacitors-electric-car-batteries-charging-times","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/feb/26/energy-storage-supercapacitors-electric-car-batteries-charging-times","fields":{"headline":"Energy storage leap could slash electric car charging times","bodyText":"Researchers have claimed a breakthrough in energy storage technology that could enable electric cars to be driven as far as petrol and diesel vehicles, and recharge in minutes rather than hours. Teams from Bristol University and Surrey University developed a next-generation material for supercapacitors, which store electric charge and can be replenished faster than normal batteries. This could allow cars to recharge in 10 minutes, rather than the eight hours it can take to replenish the lithium-ion batteries in current electric vehicles. The technology has sufficient energy density to comfortably surpass the 200 to 350-mile ranges of leading battery-powered cars such as Teslas, according to its backers. Dr Donald Highgate, the director of research at Superdielectrics – a company that worked with the universities on the research, said: “It could have a seismic effect on energy, but it’s not a done deal.” Supercapacitors have existed for decades and can store and release power rapidly. Tesla’s Elon Musk has said a breakthrough in transportation is more likely to come from supercaps than batteries. Superdielectrics was originally developing a polymer that could be transparent and hold electronic circuits for potential use in Google Glass-style applications. But after realising the energy storage capabilities of the material, it changed tack in 2014 and has produced 10cm² demonstrations that can power a tiny fan or LED bulb. There are drawbacks to the technology, however. If you left a supercap car for a month at an airport car park, it would have lost much of its charge by the time you returned, the researchers admitted. For this reason, they expect the first such cars to also have a small conventional battery. The Bristol-Surrey teams believe the polymer they are using could be more energy-dense than lithium ion, holding 180 watt-hours per kilogram compared with 100W⋅h/kg-120W⋅h/kg for commercial lithium ion. Dr Thomas Miller, an expert on supercapacitors at University College London, who was not involved in the work, said the technology would have to scale up to compete. “If a significant leap has been made in energy density, it would be an important achievement,” he said. “One major consideration that is yet to be proven is the scalability, cost and sustainability of the new technology.” Highgate said he was confident that prototype production of his supercaps could be under way within two years, initially for specialist use, such as by the military."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
