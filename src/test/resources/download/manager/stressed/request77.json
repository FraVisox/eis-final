Noel is now having a ball, Steven, like all Hollywood villains has proved himself more deadly now his weakness has been exposed, and Julia has established herself as a plucky Jedi with a double-sided dong for a lightsaber. I’m fully into this series thanks to this week, the first superb episode in the new run. Many, many thanks for your scandalous additions BTL, plus insult-y lookalikes. See you again next time, and tell your friends! Much more fun when it’s a party. Until next week, come say hello on Twitter, Instagram or Facebook, or just file charges against me in a small claims court. It’s all attention, isn’t it. Ciao! YES, dappy JULIA and her snowy cocks. Highly deserved and almost un-broadcastable. Don’t put your head in that oven, Steven! As we suspected, Flo to go. In the final equation, Vera just was not Duckworthy enough. Back to her boys she goes. Meanwhile, who’s going home? Liam has stayed bold, whereas Flo has turned her teeth to the wall. I think she’s going. How about you? So – a lot to think about. Can cottage pornographer Julia take the crown? Please god yes. Or will Steven stay sitting pretty? If so, what does it say about the format – that the previous rounds are essentially meaningless? Prude and Paul clearly have differences of opinion on the matter... That Miss Dior advert with Natalie Portman is the worst thing I’ve ever seen. Doesn’t she have an Oscar? Oh no here’s the sassy cupcake to retake the crown. Prue telling Paul to pull himself together, without a wink of humour on her face, is my new favourite thing. He’s much more lovable cast as a little boy than the cartoon Nazi. Prude Leith is a genius addition to this lineup. Julia has created and arranged a collection of phalluses, and Paul struggles to compose himself under their one-eyed gaze. Prue looks thoroughly disapproving, like a matron clutching a stash of contraband Buntys. Amazing. Flo’s hands over Tom Jones’ lunchbox, but has basically given up. Krake’s Caken – sorry Kate’s Kraken – is genuinely terrifying. Sophie, the great white hope, lets herself down with underdone fruit pieces. How’d you like those apples? Enough. Show me the cock and balls. Steven’s Savoury Clutch (headlining the Dublin Castle this Friday, tickets on the door) is a work of art, with chain link breadsticks and manchego flavouring. Paul has him replace him on the judges’ side of the table. Wow. Judging time! Liam’s flavours are strong- saving himself?- while Yan’s are too strong. James’ brown owl is brilliantly designed, as is Stacey’s hat, but they don’t taste right. Let’s get into the Stevens and Sophies. Glad I’m not alone in the Tracey Emin thing. These already look amazing. This lot are an incredibly strong bunch o’ bakers. Please Since you’re here...we have a small favour to ask. Please stop playing those terrifying feisty cupcake promo spots. Liam has taken his tipped over bread bolas situation quite badly. “I couldn’t boil an egg at your age,” says Noel in a genuinely lovely moment of support. Plus Hitchcock James and his owl breastplate! I’m extraordinarily moved Yan as Gregg Wallace! Gwrenn you have absolutely latched onto the unflattering celeb comparison theme. “Mine’s a disgrace,” I love how viscerally Flo hates baking, even though she’s pretty good at it. My mother just said “Flo speaks like Mrs Brown”. MumLOL Yesterday was quite painful? Get a grip man you’ve been star baker twice. Steven is making a handbag, just to engineer another Lady Bracknell moment from Prue. She doesn’t disappoint, though she knows not what she does. Glorious. Noel is certain Yan’s vegetarian dragon cannot be beaten unless someone comes up with “a gluten-intolerant unicorn.” He’s arrived! I’d say this is the winner Oh. Okay can someone please talk about what Julia’s paprika snail looks like, because … I cannot. I’m pretty sure there are guidelines about me saying it resembles a flaccid wang, namely that I can’t. Innocent Liam’s never made a bread sculpture because he’s 19, and relatively normal. Sophie is attacking this task, and probably makes bread sculptures every month, for some ex-army reason. She definitely spies a chance now Steven has disgraced himself. Her Italian fruit basket sounds like a winner. I’ve no idea what Flo just said. Judging by their reactions – generic laughter and “well done, Flo” – Prue and Paul didn’t either. That’s how I talk to kids. I’m terrible with kids. They’ve probably got enough leftover footage of Berry from the previous gazillion series that they could splice together new reactions and slot them in to the new show without legally hiring her. I mean Prue even sounds like Mary Berry, doesn’t she? Close your eyes. Using natural ingredients. I like whoever’s coming up with these. Any other look-a-like nominations? I have Will Young for Steven, and Vera Duckworth for Kate. I mean Flo. TRACEY EMIN. That’s who Julia reminds me of, in a weird sort of way. I know celebrity look-a-likes are usually flattering, but I think I’ve invented a new genre. We love a chancer. (When I say we I mean an intern-staffed, disingenuously corporate Twitter account.) Who was talking about Selasi down below? (Apart from all women ever.) Did I ever tell you that Selasi, the spiritual – though very much not the actual – winner of the last series came to my house for a piece and made a cake, and left me a whisk that he’d only partially broken? He then promised we’d meet up and he’d take me for a ride on his bike, a meet up WHICH NEVER HAPPENED. I got taken for a ride, alright. Kate and James bring up the rear with their soggy bottoms – sorry, middles, stand down – while Liam comes in fifth. Steven only manages third, Julia comes second while anxious Stacey is a heartening winner! You can see how much it means to her. I’m very moved. Steven has quietly been working on something pretty good. He’s not out of this yet – we know what he can do with showstoppers. Yan is flat, James is wet, Sophie’s under-baked. Judging time! Prue likes Julia’s nice rounded bottom, while, unlike the Lord, Flo is not risen. Liam needs to earn a crust, while Kate’s lopsided golem of a loaf is quickly dismissed. James’ loaves have collapsed into cowpat, while the bottom of Kate’s crown has overthrown the top, like a revolution in yeast. “I’m crying inside,” he says, while she tops him, with the hyperbole of youth. “I’m dying inside.” Noel and Sandi stack their heads like a cottage loaf, for their “bit”. I can live with that. Bald banker James sitting on a stool, watching septuagenarian Flo fingering her own balls was one of the most British things I think I’ve ever seen on a screen, up there with that time the queen parachuted into the Olympic opening ceremony. I was very moved. “I just know how Paul does it,” whispers Stacey, fingering her bread balls and making uncomfortably unbroken eye contact with a camera operator. Surely the Mail won’t stand for this filth? “No one had electric scales in a cottage.” I love it when Kate gets all surly and aggressive. So this is basically a sort of snowman bread, or doughy crown jewels, where they have to balance and slash the sides, right? Definite signs Noel is really starting to relax, and play around with the guests more. *Laurence Fishburne voice* He’s beginning to believe. Was that the filthiest judges’ sidebar we’ve ever seen? Paul describes how to bond his tight balls, by inserting two digits. Prue asks if he flours his fingers. “I could oil them,” he ripostes. Down with (more of) this sort of thing! Are beaks a bird’s lips? I love how when Julia listens to challenges she wears that look of fierce purpose, like she doesn’t want to disappoint the Party Secretary. I suppose you didn’t. Hand mixed bread, or something. Noel and Sandi land the Prue-Paul Drag Race pun of the year. Still, I sense a skit coming up. Balancing a cup of tea on top of a cake, or somesuch bobbins. Still, makes the most of having a colour telly I suppose. Not like those Scandi-noir dramas. The clothes on this lot. When the four presenters were standing in a row just then, it was like a book of haberdasher’s swatches, opened to the nursery section. Prue’s got weird Mondrian levels going on, Sandi’s got butterflies on her tummy, and Noel is far too muumuu for meemee. Or does it? While Steven’s underproved buns are a flop, Prue doesn’t give a tea-cake, diving straight into the vodka cocktail. It’s very nice, she judges, unconsciously channeling Yan and her special dough. Very nice. Oh god CHILL OUT Stacey. Although milk was a mistake. Scooter-bashed Yan has provided a spicy chutney, but chutney don’t amount to a hill o’ beans. Judging time. Noel praises Kate’s nice, even buns and gives James a meaningless handshake for his well-textured Nordic baps. Liam underperforms as he feared, while Decorative Tom’s assault on the mystery tea cake is fruitless, but he aces the consistency. Surprisingly strong. Adults on scooters are a bit ‘the-breakdown-is-in-the-post’ aren’t they. I still like Yan though. At least she has the temerity to fall off. Wow, McDonald’s tackling the whole Beaky McNugget mythos head on. Or beak-on. Ol’ Blue Eyes has had quite a week, hasn’t he? Good to see Paul adding to Downfall and Inglourious Basterds in the canon of Hollywood’s most controversial Nazis. But I don’t wanna stick Das Boot in. I find tea cakes quite meh. What else shall we talk about? RUH ROH. Steven’s oven-proofed cakes have sunk. Surely that third star baker crown is now puddled on the floor too. He’s not the only unhappy baker – Liam is an another little stress-head, but way more adorable than the Stace, n’est-ce pas? Apparently I ruined Le Gosling last week for some, so here’s a GIF to say sorry. Paul does one of his faces when he hears about Stressy Stacey’s patented milk wash. We’ll see how this turns out. She does make bread every week, so this should be a strong week for her? Yes Lola, Stacey’s a stress-head, isn’t she? Infectiously so. And YES TOM. Tea cakes are mallow things with chocolate, by Tunnocks, brought from the shop. Much nicer. Doesn’t matter that Mary’s not here, Steven is pairing a tea cake with vodka anyway. Attaboy. Noel’s shirt watch: he appears to be wearing an acid-face etched muumuu? Sorry Sophie! I like you and I’m fairly scared of you. Sophie is making some sort of middle class buzzword Boggle of a dish, a tea cake inspired by a tagine she ate on a gap year. I have to agree with James, tea cakes are the poor cousin to the hot cross bun. Come at me, why not? I love Yan describing her own dough, orgasmically, as very nice. Very nice. She’s also excellent. Julia meanwhile looks adorable, wailing I LOVE YOU into her dough. She is properly mad. I have to say, his stout and ginger and cinnamon buns sound delicious. Go on, son. Liam bantering with Paul is my favourite thing about this series. It’s almost at Selasi-levels of backchat. He doesn’t know what he’s doing, so predicts the texture of his offering will be “tea cake texture.” “Which is …?” presses Paul. “Very nice.” Kate bakes cakes for a local homeless charity! The witch. Why, she’s no better than “Professional Cake-Maker” Steven. Who I love. Oh, I’ve perplexed myself. “I don’t think I should have a closed mind”, says Prue, who was born in South Africa. I found that very moving. Tea cakes are made from an enriched dough, which is maybe why banker James is feeling confident. It’s likely bakers will try to get noticed this round by deviating from classic flavour profile, but it’s a risky strategy with classicist judges. “This is my chance to show them, that I can bake … bread.” Yes Stacey, that is literally the point of bread week. She’s the Jamie Redknapp of baking commentary. “What’s for tea? Cake.” A negligent parent’s manual. Why does Sophie dread bread? Did she have a baguette-sperience? Ah, Northernism, the last acceptable -ism. Lovely to have a bit of sepia onscreen, in the show’s introduction, and Noel and Sandi are very into their silly voices. Relatively charming. Here we go! Everyone eat your syrup and have your psychotic break sponsored by Dr Oetker. Even weathermen have Twitters now. What a world. How are we all tonight? To make things extra much hard, shall we declare this bread week a no “rising to the occasion” pun zone? Unless the context is erectile in nature. We’re not made of stone. Paul being, ah … a bit less strict this week. Noel having an allergic reaction to containing his own madness. Sandi dying behind the eyes as she performs a weak skit. Prue describing anything as “not much fun”. Flo’s teeth getting a spin-off show. (Although if anyone else is drinking on a school night you either have a problem, or are an actual teacher.) Tinyismynewt, you have permission to gin yourself silly. In fact, shall we do a drinking bingo? Yes. ‘Allo ‘Allo. If you’re looking for the best Great British Bake Off blog that’s live, and on the Guardian, you’ve found her. (I hope.) Each week I’m here gossiping about the contestants, making unfounded assertions about the ease of the challenges, and dusting off rye quips. This week the contestants are all taking on bread-based tasks. It’s a week where any baker can prove themselves, but expectations can be dashed. Remember that incredible bread lion from an earlier series who didn’t win star baker? He was more impressive than Aslan, and twice as wronged. A court of public opinion is nothing without a jury; I hope you’ll join me at 8pm and get involved. Jokes, withering dismissals and rampant hero-worship all welcomed. Plus, there are ad breaks now, so it’s nice to chat through those. Let’s get double screening!"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/17/steve-buscemi-not-fulfilled-true-potential-interview-death-of-stalin-electric-dreams","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T07:00:34Z","webTitle":"Steve Buscemi: ‘In some ways I feel I haven’t fulfilled my true potential'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/17/steve-buscemi-not-fulfilled-true-potential-interview-death-of-stalin-electric-dreams","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/17/steve-buscemi-not-fulfilled-true-potential-interview-death-of-stalin-electric-dreams","fields":{"headline":"Steve Buscemi: ‘In some ways I feel I haven’t fulfilled my true potential'","bodyText":"Like Tommy, the aimless barfly he plays in Trees Lounge, the melancholic 1996 indie film he also wrote and directed, Steve Buscemi found himself in a spiral of hopelessness after leaving school, jumping from one part-time job to another: cinema usher, ice-cream seller, petrol station attendant. There were many long nights in bars. “I really had difficulty there [on Long Island] in my last couple of years because I felt like I didn’t know what I was doing,” he says. “I felt my life was going nowhere.” His father had pushed all four of his sons to take a civil service exam, in Buscemi’s case as an avenue to a career with the fire service, where he would work for four years. Although he knew he wanted to be an actor, he had only a dim notion of how to realise his dream. It was also his father who suggested he apply for drama school, ostensibly as an interlude until the fire department came calling. At his interview for the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute in New York, Buscemi was asked why he wanted to be an actor. He casually parroted his dad’s well-meaning advice that acting classes would stand him in good stead for whatever path he chose in life. “I remember her telling me: ‘Well, we really want people who want to be actors,’” he recalls. “In that moment, I felt I really blew it.” He didn’t, as it happens, but it taught him not to be so cavalier about the thing he was most passionate about. Buscemi told the story of his Lee Strasberg interview as we sat in a quiet neighbourhood bar in Park Slope, Brooklyn, not far from the brownstone he shares with the artist and filmmaker Jo Andres, his wife of 30 years. The couple have a 27-year-old son, Lucian, who played for the indie band, Fiasco. Buscemi was seated in a wooden booth when I arrived, baseball cap pulled down over his head, a pint of beer at his hand. Like the bar itself, his demeanour was low-key, and unassuming. He talked quietly, the way someone might talk if they were nursing a hangover, but grew more animated as he spoke about his early days as one half of comedy duo Steve &amp; Mark, with Mark Boone Junior (best known for his role in the outlaw cycle gang drama Sons of Anarchy.) Their shtick was a kind of stream-of-consciousness situation comedy that introduced them to New York’s then-vibrant performance art scene. Often, they could be found at rinky-dink East Side clubs such as Darinka, where They Might Be Giants was the de facto house band, and no one much cared about fire codes. Downtown legend Rockets Redglare, famously the first person to enter Sid Vicious’s room at the Chelsea Hotel after the murder of Nancy Spungen, took the young Buscemi under his wing, helping secure gigs and introducing him to the scene. That version of New York disappeared in the 1990s, vanquished by rising rents, Rudy Giuliani and the devastation of Aids. His breakout role in 1986 was as a musician dying of Aids in Parting Glances – a bold choice for an actor launching his career. “When I played that character I only knew one person who maybe had Aids,” he recalls. “This was right smack in the middle of all that fear and anxiety: ‘Could you get it from somebody by just being in the same room?’ Of course, later, so many of my friends died of Aids. We lost so many good people in their prime.” He talks poignantly of Ethyl Eichelberger, a drag performance artist who dominated the 1980s scene before being diagnosed with HIV and taking his life in 1990. Most of those people have faded from public consciousness, but they hang on in Buscemi’s memory as the mentors and guides of his career. You feel their animating spirit in his own projects, populated as they are by oddballs and outsiders. He summons a quote by Frank Capra to the effect that every character in his Christmas classic, It’s a Wonderful Life, is worthy of his or her own film. “I tried to keep that in mind as I wrote Trees Lounge,” he said. “I thought I was being careful not to romanticise the life of someone who hangs out in a bar all the time, and yet I do find these characters romantic, and I still find bars really alluring.” He was touched when the owner of the bar they were set to film in changed his mind at the last minute. “He said: ‘I don’t think I can close my bar for a week and let you guys film here,’ and we said, ‘Why?’ and he said: ‘Where are my regulars going to go? What are they going to do?’” That bond with people who depend on each other resonates with Buscemi. On 12 September 2001 he reunited with his old fire unit, Engine Company 55, working 10 hours a day for five days in the rubble of the World Trade Center. It was a way to be useful at a time when being an actor felt like a grotesque whimsy. It was only afterwards that the magnitude and desolation hit him. In 2005, Buscemi went back to his old high school in Valley Stream, a predominantly Irish-Italian neighbourhood, to receive an award. Talking to students he recalled his anxious youth. “I still get scared,” he told them. “I try to live with it, and you keep going.” In Park Bench, Buscemi’s charming, little-watched web-only talk show, a telling moment comes during a conversation with the Wu-Tang Clan’s GZA. The rapper recalls his childhood inspirations, including Don McLean and Neil Sedaka, prompting an elated Buscemi to offer a formative experience of his own. “I went to the mall and bought some 45s. I ran into a bunch of girls from my school and they reached into my bag and pulled out Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree,” he says. “I could tell they were embarrassed for me, and I thought: ‘I don’t care, I like this song.’” Something about his response to being shamed for his dubious musical tastes – “I don’t care” – captures the animating spirit of an actor. Buscemi is among the least pretentious actors you will find, as comfortable working with Adam Sandler as with the Coen Brothers. When he describes Sandler as an “auteur” he is not doing it to be funny or contrary; he means it. “We just really hit it off when we did Airheads,” he says, referring to their first film together, pithily reviewed by Time Out in 1994 as a movie “about airheads, and for them, too”. Bad reviews, the few there are, glide off Buscemi like water off a duck’s back. As a rule, it’s not Sandler’s movies that fans think of when they picture Buscemi. That honour is more likely to go to his Atlantic City kingpin, “Nucky” Thompson, in HBO’s mafia origins epic Boardwalk Empire, or to his memorable date with a wood chipper in the Coen Brothers’ snowbound masterpiece, Fargo. His tip-kvetching Mr Pink in Quentin Tarantino’s Reservoir Dogs transformed both the director and his ensemble cast into touchstones of a new era in independent filmmaking. That film, made for just $1m, defined a 1990s cinematic “cool” that would have impressed those girls in the mall – if Buscemi cared about such things. It’s partly because he doesn’t care, you suspect, that he manages the tightrope walk along the tremulous line of popular and hip, equally at ease in bubblegum fare like Con Air as in cult films like Coffee and Cigarettes. Buscemi is one of the industry’s busiest actors, with more than 125 films to his name, and an equally impressive resumé in television, from The Sopranos and Boardwalk Empire to cameos in The Simpsons (as himself), 30 Rock (as a private detective-turned-lesbian drama teacher), and the new Channel 4 series, Philip K Dick’s Electric Dreams – in which he falls in love with a self-advertising robot in a dystopian vision of marketing gone rogue. There can’t be many days when he is not working. The director Jim Jarmusch, who has cast Buscemi in several of his films, once joked in the New Yorker that Hollywood had a “Steve Buscemi tax” to explain the actor’s ubiquity from the mid-1990s onwards: “It was like, ‘You want to make a film? You must have Steve.’” No one could have been more surprised by his catapulting fame than Buscemi himself. Although his passion for acting was cemented early – he recalls clambering adorably on to tables at family weddings to crack jokes – he spent much of his teens and early adulthood feeling thwarted by circumstances. He got an early taste of rejection when he failed to get cast as the dwarf he had set his heart on in his Catholic school’s production of Snow White. He was seven at the time. “I was a little crushed,” he recalls. “I asked our nun if I could have that part, and she said: ‘Oh no, I’m giving the part to another kid.’ She was sweet about it, but I just remember being really disappointed: ‘Oh, this is what life is.’” Years later he had a similar epiphany when he started auditioning for movies. “I remember going in to read for one part and asking the casting director if I could read for the lead, and she looked at me, and said: ‘Oh no, they’re going to get a name for that part,’” he recalls. “I thought, ‘What is she talking about?’ And then I realised: ‘Oh, you’re going to get a name – you’re going to get an actor whose name people know.’” Buscemi laughs at his naivety now, but at the time it was another flash of illumination. “I was like: ‘OK, I have to get a name now, it’s not enough to be a working actor.’” Years of being left on the cutting-room floor – in Woody Allen’s Alice, Stephen Frears’s The Grifters, and Gus Van Sant’s Even Cowgirls Get the Blues – taught him a similar lesson: audition for roles that are too big to be cut. Buscemi has been a name for more than 20 years at this point, yet through a combination of humble origins and insecurity he exhibits almost no ego. When I marvel at his direction of the “Pine Barrens” episode of The Sopranos – in which the show’s acute combination of menace and burlesque is on full display – he shrugs off the compliment, insisting that any director would have done the same. He tips his hat instead to the writers. This is typical of the way Buscemi views his craft, in which his emphasis is almost always on collaboration, rather than individual genius. “He’s the opposite of an asshole,” says Armando Iannucci, who cast Buscemi in his satirical new movie, The Death of Stalin. “On set he’s very generous and he’s not taking up anyone’s time. He’s almost apologetic when he comes up with a thought.” In that movie, which also stars Simon Russell Beale, Jason Isaacs, Andrea Riseborough and Michael Palin, Buscemi plays Nikita Khrushchev, stealthily coming from behind to take over the sudden vacancy created by Stalin. Iannucci recalls how, during rehearsals, Buscemi would observe and watch but rarely chip in. “He’ll only ask little questions, but you can see him going away and just thinking through each moment, and knowing when to turn it up a tiny notch, and then another tiny notch, and then another tiny notch, so you don’t notice the shift at any one point,” he says. “It’s just when you stand back to look at the whole thing you can see how delicately and cleverly he’d gradated that transformation.” Riseborough, who has just wrapped a second movie with Buscemi, Nancy, concurs. “He’s the most humble, down-to-earth, funny, easygoing genius. The sweetest man that I’ve ever worked with,” she says. “He has an enormous amount of gratitude for his work.” The gratitude is genuine. For all his professed angst, Buscemi never doubted his talent. What he fretted over was finding the right opportunity. A few years after the Snow White fiasco, he auditioned for the part of the Cowardly Lion in The Wizard of Oz. “I knew it was between me and this other kid, and really wanting to do this part so badly, and thinking: ‘It probably won’t happen, but what will I do when I don’t get it?’” Buscemi got the role, and a standing ovation for his efforts, but it did little to quell his fear of being rejected by an indifferent world. “I don’t know if it was my dad’s worldview, or something, but it was about not expecting much,” he says. “I’ve never really analysed it that deeply, but it’s something that I know is still in me. It hasn’t stopped me altogether.” He pauses. “It did stop the character I play in Trees Lounge, but what I find saddest about that character was that he didn’t seem to have an awareness that there could be a way out.” Shortly before he died three years ago, Buscemi’s father, the man who set him on the path to acting, had a cameo in the first episode of Park Bench. Seeing him among the cadre of friends and family that lend the series its distinctive Brooklyn tenor was moving in the way that glimpsing the departed affects all of us. As we drank in the neighbourhood bar, Buscemi – who tries to practise meditation every day – talked fondly about his father’s belief in reincarnation and the afterlife. As a child, he would come home to find visiting psychics communing with the dead. One year Buscemi sought out a psychic for a private session, and confided his hopes of being an actor. “He said: ‘I don’t really see acting so much as writing – writing is what I see for you,’” Buscemi recalls, his brow furrowing. “So, in some ways I feel that I haven’t fulfilled my true potential.” Electric Dreams starts on Channel 4 on 17 September.

The 56-year-old led the service desk team, helping customers who had problems with the stock exchange’s service. Woolnough had worked at the stock exchange for more than three decades and his family described him on Tuesday as a “kind and caring family man”. In a statement released through City of London police, they said: “[Chris] never married and didn’t have children of his own but was devoted to his three nieces and nephew. He would do anything for them. “He will be missed dearly by his family, friends and girlfriend. The world has lost a kind, gentle and caring man.” City of London police said they had compiled a report for the coroner on the circumstances surrounding Woolnough’s death, which officers are not treating as suspicious. Woolnough died at the building in Paternoster Square, near St Paul’s Cathedral, at about 10am on 15 August. A spokesperson for the London Stock Exchange Group said: “Last month, we lost a dear and highly respected colleague, Chris Woolnough. We are incredibly saddened by his passing. “With more than 30 years’ service with the group, Chris’s contributions were influential and his work ethic remarkable. He was a source of much support and guidance to his wider team and clients and, while progressing in his career, made many good friends. “He is sorely missed by his colleagues and our thoughts and condolences are with his family and friends.‎” In the UK and Ireland, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

Isn't it splendid?","bodyText":"I could swear the shape of Bertie Carvel’s face is actually changing as his character becomes ever more evil. Here, leering at Gemma and then Neil, he is basically made of triangles as his rat-faced gloating hits shrill new heights. For those of you happy to hitch up your skirts and chase after this melodrama charabanc of doom, keep up, because tonight’s episode barely pauses at the lights. Gemma’s spying, Simon’s sneering, the shape-shifting Sian. Parminster is one messed up, mixed up town (and end destination for Warwick uni graduates). Diagnosis Poor Gemma will spend almost all of this episode stalking Parminster’s autumnal pavements, looking for her lost son. Well, he’s lost to her anyway. Tom doesn’t want to speak to his mum and she doesn’t believe it can just be her unbelievably embarrassing closeness to his teacher. Even while she is mid-stalk outside the school gates, lovely, understanding educator James asks her out again “for breakfast” as he has a free period first thing. His extra-curricular commitment to biological studies during said free period is admirable but after Gemma’s shenanigans with Sian the night before, I’d be tempted to ask him if he went to Warwick university, just in case. While Gemma is off probing work frenemy Sian over Tom’s mysterious visit to the surgery, neighbour Neil is on a mission to find out about Simon’s business dealings – which isn’t easy since Simon and Neil’s friendship hit the skids two years ago, about the time Neil slept with Gemma. He pretends to bump into Simon at work (Simon isn’t that stupid) and the two men end up having a truly Shakespearean pint at the pub; Simon peering over the top of his glass like a modern-day Iago, suggesting weak Neil chats up that woman flirting with him across the bar. Having ruined Neil’s marriage (with Neil’s willing help), the grinning psychopath trips out of the pub only to have his half-cut ex practically fall at his feet. Naturally, he takes a picture of her looking a bit tired (the rest of us are probably thinking, “That’s me on a good day”) and she is suitably furious when he texts it to her the next morning. But just when we’re having too much fun watching Simon and Gemma do the full bullfighting routine, our gaze is dragged back to the collateral damage, thoroughly chastening us for enjoying the fireworks. Poor Tom (I think I’ll call him this from now as we’re referencing Shakespeare a lot) is not only suffering anxiety and insomnia (if Sian is to be believed), he’s becoming violent at school and even turning on his friends. This is perhaps the result of Gemma’s truly unbelievable behaviour, stalking her son’s friend Max who sits stiffly while she swigs his parent’s wine having suddenly appeared at his window in the middle of the night. She grills him about Poor Tom, enormous wine glass in hand. Has he had sex? Does he smoke? I know the woman spends most of her down time lurking in bushes, but this is a bit much even for her. “He says he doesn’t love you,” says Max, shattering her world anew. Whatever Simon said to Poor Tom, she’s thinking, it must be monstrously bad. Maybe he’s just sick of his kippered, mood-swingy mum being consumed by vengeance and having sex with his teacher. Prognosis Gemma is devastated. Simon is furious. Tom is a mess. And Kate might or might not be having an affair. Either way, everyone is miserable. Isn’t it splendid? Whose side is Sian really on? What is she up to, meddling in Gemma’s life without declaring her previous friendship with Simon. And what is going on at Warwick university? I’ll leave you with this: I went to Warwick university. Trust no one. Notes • What is happening to Gemma’s left hand? She keeps clenching it when she’s driving. Is the space formerly occupied by her wedding ring actually burning, such is her fury? • The carefully-timed arrivals of the estate agents at Gemma’s door were a lovely touch. Imagine how much you’d have to hate someone to send a plague of estate agents! • “What was she like? My wife, when you slept with her,” Simon asks Neil over a pint of Red Ribbon. It’s a line like that, verbal cape flourish followed by a small bow, that make me adore Bartlett’s ludicrously juicy writing. • I’m delighted with Sian Brooke’s character; another unknowable weirdo who drops little clues to who she might be but appears largely opaque, even when apparently oversharing. We do at least know she’s now into women, not men. Sticking a pin in that. • Gemma tells James she had a 28-year-old bit on the side for a while and she PAID him in order to keep him at arm’s length. If you reversed the sexes, this would be a truly shocking revelation. • Doctor Foster with her hair down is exactly like Doctor Foster with her hair up, just drunker and more promiscuous. May she throw away all her scrunchies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2017/sep/28/sylvia-plath-bikini-shot-its-time-to-stop-sexualising-a-serious-author-to-sell-books","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T11:25:14Z","webTitle":"Sylvia Plath's bikini shot: it's time to stop sexualising a serious author to sell books | Cathleen Allyn Conway","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/sep/28/sylvia-plath-bikini-shot-its-time-to-stop-sexualising-a-serious-author-to-sell-books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2017/sep/28/sylvia-plath-bikini-shot-its-time-to-stop-sexualising-a-serious-author-to-sell-books","fields":{"headline":"Sylvia Plath's bikini shot: it's time to stop sexualising a serious author to sell books","bodyText":"On the US cover of Sylvia Plath’s Collected Letters, a volume out this week that contains mostly unpublished letters by the poet between the ages of eight and 24, is a picture of her taken in December 1955. She’s walking outside somewhere in Cambridge, bundled up in a coat, and has a thoughtful smile. The UK edition went for a very different depiction of Plath, however: a full-colour photo of her on a beach in a bikini, blond and beaming – a visual antithesis to the ambitious, intellectual poet. This is not the first time Plath’s image has been used to make her appear trifling or superficial. In 2013, Faber, the publisher of the bikini-lead UK edition, released a much-derided anniversary edition of The Bell Jar that showed a woman checking her makeup on the cover. Whatever symbolism intended was overwhelmed by the proto-chick-lit design; a story of an attempted suicide and subsequent hospitalisation is somewhat undermined by the focus on matching lipstick and nails. Johnny Panic and the Bible of Dreams, a collection of her prose, is also bedecked with the bikini shot, which the Telegraph also recently used to illustrate a story about her love letters. Plath’s volume in the Faber Poet to Poet series, in which a poet selects work by another they admire, sees her estranged husband Ted Hughes’s choices illustrated with a photo of Plath semi-undressed; and the biography Mad Girl’s Love Song, by Andrew Wilson, is covered with a blond, bare-shouldered Sylvia in profile, cropped to suggest a nude nymph. These are the images that publishers think best represent Plath, an internationally recognised poet and novelist, an icon, an alleged victim of domestic abuse, a single mother, a person with mental illness and person who killed herself. Why is her work, so heavy with symbolism and myth, which documents the frustrating consequences of transgressive womanhood, marketed with so little thought and respect? In answering this question, it is hard not to be cynical about the British literary establishment and its continued “protection” of Hughes. In the wake of her death, Team Ted went into overdrive to construct an image of Plath as a crazy, spoiled woman. Bitter Fame, the only authorised biography of Plath – which included so much interference from Hughes’s sister, Olwyn, that author Anne Stevenson eventually referred to it as a “work of dual authorship” – includes two appendices that eviscerate Plath, presumably to undermine or negate any praise that remained. This is not a hysterical presumption. In her book Sylvia Plath and the Mythology of Women Readers, scholar Janet Badia writes about “tropes meant to disparage Plath’s fans, especially the young female readers among them, as uncritical consumers”. This, she argues, “has dictated the terms of Plath’s reception by the literary establishment and by popular media”. The curation of her image plays a role. Perhaps the rationale is that pictures of smiley Plath counterbalance the darkness in her work, lending extra tragedy to her illness and death. But this kind of correction is not made for male authors, no matter how dark their writing or interior lives. Consider Plath’s fellow confessionalists. Robert Lowell had manic depression and was hospitalised at McLean, in Massachusetts, where Plath was also treated in 1953 and which she immortalised in her novel, The Bell Jar. All his covers see him posed studiously, writing, reading, crucially able to keep his clothes on. Meanwhile, Anne Sexton, who studied under Lowell with Plath and also killed herself, receives the bathing suit treatment with her Selected Poems. Presenting female writers as sexualised and frivolous diminishes their intellectual credentials, tarnishes their work as slight, not to be taken seriously. Plath’s poems were visceral and impolite; her novel was about madness. The image that best represents a writer of her range and talent is not, as she wrote about in her poem The Applicant, the “living doll” on biographies and collections and broadsheets “everywhere you look”, forever emblazoned on our consciousness as a 22-year-old bronzed blonde in a bikini. Plath only had blond hair for about three months. She documented the phase in her short story Platinum Summer, another roman à clef in which her protagonist dares to “be a woman for a change … not a walking library stack”. But she discovers that “the worldly platinum-blond type” is incongruent with the true self she eventually reasserts by returning to her natural chestnut brown hair colour. In a letter to her mother on 27 September 1954, Plath admitted her “brown-haired personality is more studious, charming and earnest”. She was “happy” she went back to her natural hair colour, preferring to “look demure and discreet”. We know brunette Sylvia was how Plath wanted to present herself. So while the new Collected Letters boasts that it is “unabridged, without revision” and presents the author speaking “directly in her own words”, selling an author, who liked her studious and demure self, with a cheesecake bikini shot undercuts any claims of dedication to authenticity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/13/australian-primary-classes-larger-than-oecd-average-report-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T18:00:42Z","webTitle":"Australian primary classes larger than OECD average, report shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/13/australian-primary-classes-larger-than-oecd-average-report-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/13/australian-primary-classes-larger-than-oecd-average-report-shows","fields":{"headline":"Australian primary classes larger than OECD average, report shows","bodyText":"Australian primary schools have larger class sizes than the OECD average and the country has lower than average public spending on education as a percentage of GDP, according to a new report. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development released its 2017 Education At a Glance report on Tuesday evening, comparing education metrics across 35 countries. It found that Australian primary schools had an average of 24 students, compared with the average of 21. Secondary schools had average class sizes (23 students), while public high schools had slightly smaller than average class sizes, with 22 students compared with the average 23. The report found that across all levels of education, from primary to tertiary, Australia spends a total of 5.8% of its GDP on education, the ninth highest and above the OECD average of 5.2%. But total public spending on education was just 3.9% of GDP, below the OECD average of 4.4%. Public spending was 0.2% below the average for primary schools, average for lower secondary schools, 0.4% below for upper secondary and further non-tertiary education and 0.4% below for tertiary education. The data in the report is drawn from the 2014 financial year, at the cusp of the 2014 budget cuts taking effect. That budget removed $29bn from schools’ projected funding growth over 10 years. In June 2017 the Turnbull government restored $23.5bn over 10 years to the primary and secondary education budget, when the Senate passed its Gonski 2.0 package. The 2017 budget also proposed $2.8bn in university funding cuts and fee rises, which the government hopes to legislate this week but still lacks crucial Senate crossbench support. Australia’s level of private investment in tertiary education was 1.1% of GDP, more than twice the OECD average of 0.5%. In a statement the National Tertiary Education Union said this reflected the high level of tuition fees paid by Australian students, making further fee rises “patently unfair”. The education minister, Simon Birmingham, said: “While it can be difficult to compare with countries where much higher taxes help fuel government spending at the expense of personal contributions, these figures show Australia performs extraordinarily well on the world stage.” Birmingham noted that overall education spending was above the OECD average, and said the government was boosting its spending per student by an average of about $2,300. The Australian Education Union federal president, Correna Haythorpe, said the below-average public spending showed that “there is no doubt that our schools are under-resourced”. Haythorpe said that trend was “set to continue” because the Gonski 2.0 package cut $3bn in funding over two years, compared with previous needs-based funding agreements. “Australian teachers are teaching larger classes than the OECD average, which is a clear indication of resource shortages,” she said. “When schools are able to provide extra staff then they can address larger classes for students and provide extra support for those students that need it.” Birmingham said the report showed that “despite many in the community liking the idea of smaller classes, they don’t necessarily correlate to better outcomes for students”. “Of course we want to see students get quality time and attention from teachers, but these new statistics highlight there are some countries with larger class sizes than Australia and better student results and there are others with smaller classes and worse results.” The Turnbull government has asked David Gonski to conduct a review of the education system to report by the end of the year. Birmingham said the review would improve how school funding was spent after “Australia’s education performance has plateaued compared with other OECD nations”. In 2016 Programme for International Student Assessment results showed a long-term decline in Australian year 9 students’ results in maths, science and reading literacy. The shadow education minister, Tanya Plibersek, said: “Given the fact this report shows Australia’s public expenditure on education is below the OECD average, and going backwards, it’s extraordinary the Liberals are cutting billions from schools and universities.” “It’s also concerning that Australia has a comparatively low share of graduates in science related fields,” she said. The OECD report found that just over 21% of Australian university students were in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields compared with the OECD average of 25%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/12/barnaby-joyce-pulls-back-from-repeating-claim-agl-is-shorting-market","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T09:35:48Z","webTitle":"Barnaby Joyce pulls back from repeating claim AGL is 'shorting' market","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/12/barnaby-joyce-pulls-back-from-repeating-claim-agl-is-shorting-market","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/12/barnaby-joyce-pulls-back-from-repeating-claim-agl-is-shorting-market","fields":{"headline":"Barnaby Joyce pulls back from repeating claim AGL is 'shorting' market","bodyText":"The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, has pulled back from a comment he made to the Coalition party room on Tuesday that AGL was “shorting” the market by refusing to sell the ageing Liddell coal-fired power plant to a competitor. Joyce would not repeat the accusation during an interview on Sky News late on Tuesday – but he insisted the company had not provided a reasonable answer to the question of why it would decommission the New South Wales plant if a rival generation company wanted to buy it. “Why pull a plant to pieces if there are people out there who want to buy it,” the deputy prime minister said – adding that he knew two interested parties who were serious buyers. The negative public commentary about AGL’s market behaviour was echoed by the chairman of the Coalition’s backbench committee on energy, Craig Kelly, who said he intended to call the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Rod Sims, to ask for an investigation. “There’s an arguable case that AGL are acting in an anti-competitive manner, and I will be calling on the ACCC to investigate,” Kelly told Guardian Australia. The ACCC has expressed public concern about market concentration in power generation and retailing, and is currently inquiring into energy affordability, with an initial report expected late this month. Energy industry players argue power prices are a function of tight gas supply and coal capacity leaving the system, not market manipulation and anti-competitive behaviour. The focus by government MPs on AGL’s market behaviour are part of the Turnbull government’s continuing efforts to strongarm the energy retailer into either selling Liddell, or extending its operating life for another five years – pressure the company is attempting to resist. The company has agreed to give the Turnbull government a plan within 90 days detailing how it will supply the electricity market with reliable power when Liddell is retired in 2022. The public commitment came after a meeting between the AGL chief executive, Andy Vesey, the prime minister, and senior government ministers, in Canberra on Monday, where the company was asked to take a proposal to the board to either sell the plant, or keep it open for another five years. AGL has agreed reluctantly to take that proposal to the board, as well as its own plant to replace Liddell’s current generation capacity with peaking gas and renewables. Energy policy continued to dominate political debate in Canberra on Tuesday, with roiling contention inside the parliament and continued internal ructions inside the Coalition. The former prime minister Tony Abbott, who is an opponent of the clean energy target recommended by Australia’s chief scientist Alan Finkel, told the Coalition party room the government needed to keep its focus on keeping energy affordable. Abbott told colleagues if the government was to add Finkel’s proposed clean energy target to the existing renewable energy target, which peaks in 2020, but tapers out to 2030, that would be a “difficult position to sustain”. The proposed clean energy target remains alive, but will not emerge from the current policy development process in the form Finkel modelled during his inquiry. The government is making it clear the new investment framework, which it wants to resolve before the summer parliamentary recess, will need to be geared to reliability and affordability as well as to emissions reduction. Government players are now talking in more generic terms about an investment mechanism or framework that will deal with a range of issues, while ensuring Australia is on track to meet the Paris climate target. With some Nationals MPs are flat-out opposed to the clean energy target, Joyce said on Tuesday the policy was something that needed to be “negotiated” both inside the government, and between the Liberals and the Nationals. He has previously signalled he would support a clean energy target with a threshold set high enough to allow coal generators to get certificates. The deputy prime minister said the government would need to “land on a target that keeps our base-load power in play”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/13/infrastructure-fund-directors-under-fire-again-over-potential-conflicts-of-interest","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T18:00:42Z","webTitle":"Infrastructure fund directors under fire again over potential conflicts of interest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/13/infrastructure-fund-directors-under-fire-again-over-potential-conflicts-of-interest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/13/infrastructure-fund-directors-under-fire-again-over-potential-conflicts-of-interest","fields":{"headline":"Infrastructure fund directors under fire again over potential conflicts of interest","bodyText":"The independent board overseeing Australia’s $5bn infrastructure agency is again under fire over potential conflicts of interest that now involve half of its directors as a result of mining industry links. Fresh potential conflicts involving two Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility directors, including its chair Sharon Warburton, emerged after the body was approached about funding a Western Australia iron ore venture. Balla Balla Infrastructure Group (BBIG) reportedly sought Naif advice on whether it would be eligible for a concessional taxpayer-funded loan for a rail link as part of its $6bn venture in the Pilbara. Warburton also sits as a non-executive director on Fortescue Metals, whose own iron ore mine, rail and port in the Pilbara would be in direct competition with BBIG. In a statement Warburton said Naif “in accordance with good governance”, including guidelines issued by the Australian National Audit Office, “does not release details of specific recusals” made by its directors. She said directors were aware of their obligations to disclose and manage conflicts, and had “significant experience in deciding whether their personal circumstances give rise to an actual, apparent or potential conflict of interest”. Fellow Naif director Justin Mannolini is a partner in the law firm Gilbert and Tobin, which BBIG is paying for ongoing advice over the execution of a state agreement with the WA government. Mannolini is also chair of the board of Jindalee Resources, which has an interest in iron and base metal projects in the Pilbara. Mannolini did not respond to a request for comment. This means three of the agency’s directors – half of the Naif board – now face questions over potential conflicts of interest in ruling on concessional loans for mining companies. The revelation in May of the first possible conflict involving another Naif director, Karla Way-McPhail, was a trigger for a Senate inquiry into the agency’s operations and governance. Naif is also considering a controversial loan application by Adani for a coal rail line that would open up Queensland’s Galilee Basin, to the possible benefit of Way-McPhail’s mining services businesses. The agency has drawn criticism for its secrecy and the prevalence of mining industry links on its board. The Naif has defended its procedures to manage conflicts of interests among directors, but has declined to say whether Way-McPhail has recused herself from any deliberations on Adani. The Naif board lost a seventh director just weeks before the Senate inquiry began, when the Brisbane-based corporate governance expert and company director Sally Pitkin quietly resigned. Pitkin did not respond to emails. Leaked documents showed Naif was approached by BBIG in relation to a possible concessional loan for a 162km rail line and port, Fairfax Media reported on Monday. BBIG had sought Naif guidance on whether its Balla Balla project was eligible under the scheme, according to Fairfax. Australian Associated Press reported that BBIG had held “preliminary, investigative discussions” with the Naif but had made no formal application. It is not clear at what point the Naif board directors become involved in assessing a project’s eligibility. Nikola Casule, a Greenpeace climate and energy campaigner, said the revelations of more possible conflicts of interest at Naif were “disappointing but sadly not surprising”. “When you fill a board almost entirely with current or former mining executives and ask them to make decisions about distributing $5bn in taxpayer money, largely to mining companies, you can’t be surprised when you find yourself in this situation,” Casule said. “When you combine this with the other potential conflicts within the board, Naif’s refusal to respond in a substantive way to freedom of information requests, and assertions by prominent figures such as the former federal treasurer that it was set up to operate as a ‘slush fund’, it is clear that the Naif is not fit for purpose.” The Labor senator Murray Watt said the revelations around Warburton and Mannolini were “further proof that the Naif is riddled with conflicts of interest among its hand-picked directors”. He said the agency “must immediately reveal what steps have been taken to ensure decisions are made independently and fairly”. “For months, Labor has been raising concerns that the Naif is being used as a National party slush fund,” he said. “It’s critical that decisions to allocate $5bn worth of taxpayer money are made independently and are not influenced by any other directorships or shareholdings that Naif directors might hold. “Both Turnbull ministers and the Naif have refused to reveal what action directors have taken to avoid decisions being tainted by conflicts of interest.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/12/champions-league-best-forward-lines","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T11:00:33Z","webTitle":"MCN to LOL: the new super forward lines set to dominate the Champions League","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/12/champions-league-best-forward-lines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/12/champions-league-best-forward-lines","fields":{"headline":"MCN to LOL: the new super forward lines set to dominate the Champions League","bodyText":"When Paris Saint-Germain signed Neymar from Barcelona for £198m this summer they not only broke the transfer record but also destroyed one of the most successful attacking trios of all time. Neymar, Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez – nicknamed MSN – had terrified defences across Spain and Europe for the past three years before PSG managed to lure the Brazilian to the French capital and then add Kylian Mbappé from Monaco to form their own super forward line. That trident has now been given its own name MCN (with Edinson Cavani completing the lineup) while in Spain there is still the BBC of Real Madrid (Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo). As for Barcelona, they recruited Ousmane Dembélé from Borussia Dortmund and even though they have not yet been given an official nickname, someone jokingly suggested LOL. Whatever the lineup there seems to be a plethora of superb forward lines across Europe and as the Champions League kicks off we take a look at the 14 strongest of the teams involved. Paris Saint-Germain (rating 9.5/10) “He could become the next Pelé. He has no limits.” Hyperbolic or not, Arsène Wenger has a point, Kylian Mbappé has everything; terrifying speed, unerring finishing and an alarmingly quick change of direction. Worryingly for the rest of Europe this simply amounts to more of the same for PSG. Between Mbappé’s pace, Neymar’s irresistible swagger and Edinson Cavani’s ninja-like movement, Unai Emery’s front three have a variety of ways to insight panic and potentially provide an avalanche of goals. Assuming, that is, the clinical Cavani of the spring holds off the infuriatingly wasteful Cavani of last autumn. Are they good enough to lead Paris to Kiev? €465m says they are. Adam White Barcelona (9/10) For many, it was the best front three of all time but it has gone. No more MSN. Neymar will be missed by Messi and Suárez, off the pitch as well as on it where they were good friends. The president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, described Neymar’s departure as an “opportunity” to tilt the balance back towards midfield and some agreed - they had lost a little of their identity, so dominant were the front three. And yet €145m has been spent on a player who, in theory, is a direct replacement (if a downgrade) on Neymar. It could less a frontline of three, though, with Messi now playing deeper as a playmaker, passer, dribbler and goal scorer in one. It’s legitimate to ask how long Suárez has left and just how good Dembélé will be remains to be seen but this is still potentially a hell of a forward line. Because Messi is … well, Messi. Sid Lowe Manchester City (9/10) Pep Guardiola’s embarrassment of glittering forwards means Sergio Agüero, the Premier League’s most prolific goalscorer since 2012, may struggle to be a regular pick against continental rearguards, yet Saturday’s demolition of Liverpool may make the manager think twice before putting the Argentinian on the bench again. The manager’s difficulty in packing in all of his attack-minded talent is further illustrated by Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva now operating in a less advanced role as quasi-traditional central midfield string-pullers. Raheem Sterling is a further quick-footed forward who may receive unwanted bench time under the midweek bright lights of the Champions League. No defence will fancy facing this cadre. Jamie Jackson Real Madrid (9/10) Time for Real Madrid to change the channel? For so long, it was the BBC (Bale, Benzema, Cristiano) up front, with Zidane admitting that they were non-negotiable picks if fit, but no more. One newspaper has taken to calling them the bbC on the basis that only Ronaldo is really worth the title any more, while the performances of Isco – since he was given a chance in place of the injured Bale last season – make things far less clear cut now, as he dropped in behind the forwards and led them towards a double. Madrid looked a better team with that shift in style and personnel. With a more populated midfield came control and less of a counterattacking style. Add to that the emergence of the brilliant Marco Asensio, plus Zidane’s taste for rotation, and it’s not clear what their preferred forward line is now. One thing is for sure – it’s supremely talented. SL Juventus (9/10) The group of forwards who propelled Juventus to the final last season was already exceptional. Paulo Dybala is a one-of-a-kind talent, Gonzalo Higuaín a world-class No9, and Mario Mandzukic a furious competitor who recently scored one of the greatest goals in European Cup history. If Juan Cuadrado was perceived as the weak link, then how about the mercurial Douglas Costa – a man with a half-century of appearances in this competition – as an alternative? Federico Bernardeschi is new to this stage but has the talent to thrive in a deep-lying role. Paolo Bandini Bayern Munich (8.5/10) Robert Lewandowski is still there, as is Arjen Robben, Thomas Müller, Kingsley Coman and Franck Ribéry – and perhaps that is part of the problem. While the Pole is at the absolute peak of his game, the people around him seems to be stagnating or possibly be on the way down. Bayern are favourites to win the Bundesliga and are expected to go far in the Champions League but all is not well in Bavaria. On Saturday they lost 2-0 to Hoffenheim and looked a little devoid of ideas (although admittedly against a very compact side). Lewandowski recently criticised the club for not spending more than €40m on any player – for which he was rebuked by the club’s chief executive, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge – but maybe the striker has a point. Müller appears to have lost his magic and it still remains to be seen whether James Rodríguez, a two-year loan signing from Real Madrid, can find a way back to his 2014 World Cup form. Marcus Christenson Chelsea (8.5/10) Chelsea’s forward line has changed complexion without Diego Costa in the ranks – the Brazil-born striker has not been included in their Champions League squad – but, in Álvaro Morata, they still boast a Spain international of pedigree to lead the line. He will work defenders in a different way but his threat has already been clear in the Premier League and, once Eden Hazard is fit and firing, and with Willian or Pedro stretching teams on the right, Antonio Conte has a potent front three. The worry is a lack of depth. Michy Batshuayi has been only a bit-part player and the failure to secure Fernando Llorente on deadline day as a very different kind of option could still be felt. Dominic Fifield Liverpool (8.5/10) As Hoffenheim discovered to their cost in the play-off second leg, Liverpool possess forwards capable of obliterating opponents in the Champions League. There was no clearer demonstration of the speed of thought and movement in Jürgen Klopp’s attack than the devastating 21-minute spell at Anfield that secured Liverpool’s passage into the group phase. The intelligence of Roberto Firmino, the skill of Sadio Mané and the pace of Mohamed Salah provided an ideal balance and, with Philippe Coutinho returning to the fold, the supply line will only improve. Andy Hunter Manchester United (8.5/10) This frontline has already returned eight goals in four Premier League outings with José Mourinho’s headline summer signing Romelu Lukaku registering half of those. As Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s direct replacement to an attack that fired United to the Europa League title, the Belgian adds greater pace and a lesser tendency to drop deep. This allows Marcus Rashford, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Anthony Martial more chance to cut the opposition apart, a threat Champions League opponents are sure to study. It is the addition of the holding midfielder Nemanja Matic that may be key to the line flourishing as the Serb’s penchant for clever passes is creating opportunities that did not exist last season. Juan Mata’s guile and Jesse Lingard’s directness can be potent weapons from the bench, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic to add yet another dimension once fit. JJ Napoli (8/10) If we were assessing only starters, then Napoli’s score would be higher still. Dries Mertens’s emergence as a No9 has upgraded Napoli into a relentless scoring machine, with Lorenzo Insigne and José Callejón carving in from either flank. Undersized they might be, but these “Marvellous Smurfs” have made Napoli into Serie A’s most prolific side. Arkadiusz Milik can provide strength and aerial prowess when a different tack is required but there is a lack of depth on the flanks. PB Atlético Madrid (7.5/10) Antoine Griezmann stayed, insisting it would have been “dirty” to leave Atlético amid their transfer ban. He is the star, a special talent, and miles ahead of his team-mates. Who he plays with is still unresolved: Ángel Correa impresses from the bench, skilful and clever, more subtle than the rest, but tends to be less significant as a starter. Yannick Carrasco plays wide rather than in a forward line but is fast and talented. The 33-year-old Fernando Torres offers a physical presence but is now used less by Diego Simeone. Kevin Gameiro is, in theory, the most likely to threaten with his pace, directness and finishing, yet even he inspires some doubts. Luciano Vietto may get a second chance but so far Simeone appears unsure. Vitolo will arrive in the winter to play wide. Chelsea’s Diego Costa is the man they really want and the feeling is mutual but there is still no sign of that becoming a reality. SL Monaco (7.5/10) To say Monaco escaped the summer relatively unscathed seems ludicrous. But despite losing the effortless guile of Bernardo Silva and the lightning Kylian Mbappé, this is the case. Marquee sales are occasionally a necessary part of the way Monaco conduct themselves and these were losses they foresaw – keeping Thomas Lemar and Falcao are sizeable victories. The shrewd additions of Stevan Jovetic and the bulldozing Baldé Keita as well as the burgeoning talent of Rony Lopes allow Monaco to retain much of the youthful exuberance, technical panache and attacking flair of last season. Underestimating Leonardo Jardim would be a terrible mistake to make twice. AW Borussia Dortmund (7/10) A potent front three, but without the devastating speed and trickery of the departed Ousmane Dembélé, lacks a little something compared with best forward lines in Europe. Christian Pulisic, only 18, has accepted the challenge of replacing Dembélé in Dortmund’s starting XI with Maximilian Philipp starting on the left and Andrey Yarmolenko also to be integrated following his £23.1m transfer from Dynamo Kyiv. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is still the focal point of the attack with Marco Reus out yet again with another long-term injury. Milan wanted Aubameyang this summer but he stayed and has looked sharp. “It is proof of what a professional player he is,” said the Dortmund chief executive, Hans-Joachim Watzke, after the Gabon striker’s five goals in five games this season. The new manager has several options from the bench too, including André Schürrle, Alexander Isak and the 17-year-old Jadon Sancho, who joined from Manchester City in the summer. MC Roma (7/10) For now we can only guess at Roma’s first-choice attack under Eusebio Di Francesco. Appointed in the summer, he has not yet had a full squad at his disposal. Patrik Schick arrived at the very end of the transfer window, while Alessandro Florenzi – who has played at full-back in recent seasons, but previously operated as a wide forward – is just back from a cruciate tear. Edin Dzeko was Serie A’s top scorer last season but he will miss the assists provided to him by the departed Mohamed Salah.

Like the devastating mudslides in Sierra Leone this summer or the unprecedented floods across Bangladesh, India and Nepal that have affected more than 40 million people, Irma is the latest in a worsening pattern of extreme weather events borne out of climate change. We can be sure that the world will face more of the same. Irma is not just a humanitarian disaster for the Caribbean region, it is also specifically a national disaster for the UK, affecting our own citizens, on our own soil, destroying homes and infrastructure across Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, the Turks and Caicos Islands and other British overseas territories. Writing on Sunday, Boris Johnson was finally clear that the overseas territories must be treated fully the same as the rest of the UK, noting, “we will help just as surely as if the hurricane had struck Inverness or Dover or St Ives”. Against that measure, this government has fallen short. The aid and military assistance that is now – finally – trickling into the overseas territories is to be welcomed and the £32m in aid that has now been announced, along with several hundred soldiers, police and experts, is positive progress. But it is clear that the response should have been better prepared, more substantive, and quicker. Tom Tugendhat, a Conservative MP and chair of the foreign affairs select committee, and Stephen Twigg, a Labour MP and chair of the international development committee, have argued that the UK government’s response to Hurricane Irma has been “found wanting”. The UK Overseas Territories Association (UKOTA) has questioned “the adequacy of its response”. Had this been the government’s reaction in Inverness, Dover, or St Ives, an outcry and ministerial resignations would surely have followed. In times of crisis, simple human empathy matters: few will forget how the UK government and the prime minister, Theresa May, reacted initially after the Grenfell Tower fire. Donald Trump will head to Florida to visit those affected, and now Emmanuel Macron will fly to St Martin to oversee the French response there. The absence of May and Johnson from the British Virgin Islands, Anguilla, or Turks and Caicos is stark. Being there in person matters: it is a chance not only to show the UK government is doing everything it can, but to hear directly from people and see the situation with their eyes as they lead the response planning. If May and foreign secretary Johnson want to show that they stand in solidarity with the overseas territories, they must visit this week, quickly establish a regional reconstruction fund, and build a longer-term economic plan to build the territories’ resilience over time against disaster. It is also alarming that the government has failed to differentiate between its FCO-led response to the national disaster in the overseas territories and its obligations to the rest of the Caribbean region, led by the Department for International Development and funded by overseas development assistance (ODA). The Labour party has written to the government to ask for urgent clarification as to how much of the aid and assistance already announced will go to the overseas territories and the Caribbean respectively, as well as which parts are being funded by ODA. The people of Antigua and Barbuda, St Kitts and Nevis, and other independent countries in the region with which we share important historical ties face enormous challenges. We must not forget them in their hour of need, and must invest in the region’s long-term disaster preparedness for when the next hurricane or flood hits. With the frequency and scale of extreme weather events likely to grow in future, the UK must lead the way in preventing and effectively managing these crises. That includes championing real action on climate change internationally. The UK must do more to stand up publicly for the Paris climate agreement – challenge partners like the US that threaten to undermine it, take on polluters, and avoid downplaying the links between hurricanes, floods, and storms and climate change. In the past few weeks, the government’s responses to the Grenfell Tower fire, the Sierra Leone mudslides and the South Asia floods have all been criticised for their slow speed, limited scale, and perceived lack of empathy. This trend must not continue. If the government is to learn lessons and the public is to get the answers it deserves, an inquiry is needed on Hurricane Irma. Such an inquiry must look at whether a greater presence in the region, such as a second ship, could have produced a quicker response, or whether more could have been done to prepare in advance. It must also look at whether the government’s existing protocol for assessing and responding to humanitarian crises driven by extreme weather around the world is fit for purpose. There will be a next time, and we cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of Irma."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2017/sep/11/gucci-to-collaborate-with-bootlegger-dapper-dan","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T14:01:08Z","webTitle":"Gucci to collaborate with bootlegger Dapper Dan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/sep/11/gucci-to-collaborate-with-bootlegger-dapper-dan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/sep/11/gucci-to-collaborate-with-bootlegger-dapper-dan","fields":{"headline":"Gucci to collaborate with bootlegger Dapper Dan","bodyText":"What a difference 25 years make. Throughout the eighties and nineties, Dapper Dan, sometimes known as the Hip Hop tailor of Harlem, clothed rappers, drug dealers, boxers and anyone else who could afford it, in designs that bootlegged high fashion brands, including Gucci, Fendi and Louis Vuitton. As might be expected, these brands were less than thrilled. In 1992, his business was effectively shut down by lawyers acting on behalf of Fendi. Fastforward to 2017, however, and things have changed. It was announced this week that Gucci would be collaborating with Dan to reopen his store and atelier, using Gucci’s fabrics with the Italian brand’s approval. A collaboration between Gucci and Dan will follow in the spring. Dan himself will star in the ad campaign. There’s a backstory to this news. In May, Gucci were slammed for a jacket included in the cruise collection which had an uncanny resemblance to one that Dan had created for Olympic runner Diane Dixon in 1989. Dixon took to social media to showcase the comparison, posting a picture of the jacket on the catwalk with one of her in the eighties with the caption “‘Bish’ stole my look! Give credit to @dapperdanharlem He did it FIRST in 1989!” The bootlegger has, it seemed, become the bootlegged. Chatter online afterwards was angry about the lack of credit for Dan, with Teen Vogue seeing it as an example of how the industry fails black people, and many more suggesting this was cultural appropriation. Gucci’s decision to help Dan re-open his store could, cynically, be seen as a way to avoid bad press but it would be a very expensive one. Instead, it’s a shrewd move of a brand on the up, through a kind of anything-goes inclusivity. Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele sees the influence of Dan on his work as part of his intertextual way of working – one of his collections might just as easily reference Donald Duck, Walter Benjamin, Voltaire and Botticelli in the same breath. This partnership with Dan acknowledges the place that the Harlem designer has in fashion history though – and takes Michele’s Guccinaissance on to the next level of branding, logomania with the creative freedom of a counterfeiter. “It is the time to say that fashion is not just the windows of a Fifth Avenue store,” Michele said to the New York Times. “It’s more. It’s about culture. It’s about self-expression. It’s about expression of a point of view.” If Dan was using the logos and branding of existing luxury brands, his fusion of these with streetwear shapes was 30 years ahead of its time, when some of these brands had yet to start making clothes themselves: the Louis Vuitton monogram reworked into a panel of a leather tracksuit or a stripe down the leg of trackpants, Gucci’s Gs on a baseball cap or bomber jacket. All of this is now part of the high fashion conversation. And Dan was the man who started the thread. He’s finally getting another chance to put his point of view across – this time, through official channels."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/11/un-libya-envoy-to-warn-overlapping-plans-are-obstructing-peace-process","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T13:52:38Z","webTitle":"Multiple Libya peace plans are a hindrance, UN envoy to say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/11/un-libya-envoy-to-warn-overlapping-plans-are-obstructing-peace-process","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/11/un-libya-envoy-to-warn-overlapping-plans-are-obstructing-peace-process","fields":{"headline":"Multiple Libya peace plans are a hindrance, UN envoy to say","bodyText":"Fears that overlapping European and Middle Eastern peace initiatives for Libya are hampering the new UN special envoy are to be aired this week at a special conference convened by the UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. The conference on Thursday, due to be attended by the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, is likely to swing behind a plan to restart political talks, including making changes to a December 2015 peace deal that has so far failed to unite warring factions in the east and west of the country. The US had largely dropped out of the Libyan crisis since Donald Trump took power in January. It follows a run of peace initiatives in recent months that have involved conferences in Cairo, Brazzaville and Dubai. Meanwhile, a Libyan peace plan launched by Emmanuel Macron, the French president, infuriated Italy for the similarities to its plan. The Netherlands has also made efforts to bring the Libyan parties together. Ghassan Salamé, the UN Libya envoy, told the Italian newspaper La Stampa on Friday: “There are six or seven different operations in front of Libyans’ eyes. Too many cooks spoil the broth.” At the weekend, the senior Italian parliamentarian Giuseppe Esposito also expressed serious concerns, fearing that France and the UK were interfering in Italian efforts to solve the migration crisis. The UK Foreign Office said it was working in close coordination with Italy and the upcoming London meeting was designed to support Salamé. The meeting is also likely to discuss a plan from the Italian interior minister, Marco Minniti, for NGOs and UN regulators to recruit Libyans to run the heavily criticised refugee detention camps. Minitti said: “It is a plan that depends on security, but it is a way to improve the camps.” Salamé proposed sending 200 UN peacekeepers to Libya to bolster the organisation’s presence, while the Libyan interior ministry has already agreed to close seven of the 30 camps. The NGO plan is part of a wider proposal, still in gestation, to find €6bn (£5.45bn) for regulating the flow of people from Africa to Europe. But the demand for camps remains high as efforts to relocate migrants back to their countries of origin are slow, and the number of people making the crossing from Libya to Italy is declining, partly due to former traffickers, or militia members in towns such as Sabratha, west of Tripoli, abandoning human smuggling. The Italian ambassador to Libya, Giuseppe Perrone, visited Sabratha this week to praise the mayor, Hassen Dhawadi, for the clampdown on people traffickers. Reports of bribes to the Anas al-Dabbashi brigade in the town have been strongly denied. In the past nine weeks, the number of people reaching Italian shores from Libya has fallen by more than 80%, compared with the same period last year. In the first week of September, 862 arrived, down 17% from the previous week. If this trend continued through the rest of the month, a fall of nearly three-quarters on the same month in 2016 could be recorded. Nevertheless, the state of the detention camps has been repeatedly criticised, most recently by Dr Joanne Liu, the international president of Médecins Sans Frontières. After visiting centres in Tripoli, she said the camps were filthy and chaotic, and there were many reports of rapes, beatings and other abuses. Liu claimed that the EU was complicit by providing €46m to the Libyan coastguard for intercepting refugees at sea, and sending them back to Libyan detention camps."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/14/the-hungry-empire-lizzie-collingham-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T07:59:36Z","webTitle":"The Hungry Empire by Lizzie Collingham review – how food shaped the world\r\n","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/14/the-hungry-empire-lizzie-collingham-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/14/the-hungry-empire-lizzie-collingham-review","fields":{"headline":"The Hungry Empire by Lizzie Collingham review – how food shaped the world\r\n","bodyText":"Saturday 18 July 1545 was fish day on the Mary Rose. The crew ate on the cramped gun deck, sitting wherever they could find room. Fish days were not popular, but on this Saturday the meal provided a welcome respite from frantic activity, as all 185 soldiers, 30 gunners and 200 mariners on board were readying the ship for war. The next day the ship sank. A chance gust of wind caused the vessel, overloaded with artillery, to keel over. No more than 40 men survived, out of a crew of 415. In the face of the tragedy, Henry VIII is supposed to have exclaimed: “Oh my gentlemen! Oh my gallant men!” He could hear the cries of the drowning sailors as he watched from the shore in Portsmouth. The Mary Rose has proved a treasure trove for historians. In the wreckage, archaeologists have discovered the vertebrae of cattle and pigs, as well as thousands of fish spines, strewn among the remains of the wicker baskets that once held them. These were the residue of the ship’s stores of beef, pork and cod. Such evidence has shown the extent to which England was trading across Europe and beyond, even in the 16th century. Lizzie Collingham’s book, The Hungry Empire, is an energetic and refreshing account of a little considered aspect of British history. By examining what people ate, Collingham skilfully provides a full account of complex, even chaotic international connections. She constructs her book around 20 meals: each chapter tells a slightly different story about the empire, centred on a particular dish. It’s hard to think of a more ingenious way of treating imperial history. Climates and ethnic groups appear with almost bewildering speed. Chapters deal with the Chinese opium trade, the colonisation of New Zealand and the diet of 18th-century labourers in rural Lancashire. The range is dazzling. Purists may raise an eyebrow at the inclusion of several recipes, including “Nellie Husanara Abdool’s pumpkin and shrimp curry”, though budding chefs may well find the prescriptiveness useful: “Add curry powder, brown sugar, thyme, salt and pepper. Stir and cook for another 15 minutes. Add 250ml of water and cook for 20–25 minutes until the pumpkin is soft.” Yet The Hungry Empire, it should be clear, is supported by meticulous historical research. Using food as a way of understanding empire is highly effective. Food knows no barriers of race, gender or even time. The recipe for jollof rice, a specialty of west African cuisine, has probably not changed across the centuries. Michel Jajolet de la Courbe, a French explorer and slave dealer, described a rice dish from west Africa in the late 17th century, in which he defined chillies as “a green or red fruit, shaped like a cucumber, and with a taste resembling that of pepper”. No account of food in the empire can avoid references to the slave trade. The Africa-America sea route opened a channel whereby “a host of American plants and foodstuffs entered west African agriculture”. Trade, as always, is a two-way process. Forced labour was brutally taken from the African continent, which in return received a large range of American crops, particularly maize and manioc (cassava). Today, cassava is a mainstay of the west African diet. In Ghana, Nigeria, Togo, Angola and Cameroon maize is a staple, yet the earliest mention of maize in west Africa comes from a Portuguese document that lists it as being loaded on to slave ships bound for Africa. In the early days maize was even known as “white man’s grain” in the Gold Coast. The necessities of the second world war are dealt with in the closing chapters of this wide-ranging book. For the British working class, the restrictions of conflict actually improved their diet. Under Lord Woolton, the minister for food, a programme of free school meals was introduced. Priority supplies of milk were provided for pregnant women and nursing mothers, while orange juice, milk and cod liver oil were given to the under-fives. Under this regime, rickets and vitamin deficiency diseases all but disappeared in Britain, and infant mortality rates declined. Better nutrition on the home front was, however, accompanied by such disasters as the Bengal famine in 1943. There is little doubt that the imperial authorities were slow in dealing with this catastrophe. Ian Stephens, editor of Calcutta’s the Statesman newspaper, had to embark on an eight-week campaign attacking government indifference before Churchill’s government finally acknowledged Bengal’s plight. The war showed how even more connected disparate parts of the empire had become. As Collingham reveals, Britain “was not a tiny island standing alone on the edge of Europe but the centre of a powerful network on which it drew for supplies of men, arms and ammunition, raw materials and, above all, food”. Nigerian supplies of tin and rubber from Sri Lanka were of crucial significance after Malaya had fallen to the Japanese; Collingham, with her characteristic eye for detail, tells us that Cyprus produced silk for parachutes. Of all the meals that represented British culture, perhaps none captured the imagination more than the Christmas pudding. It was the Victorians who firmly fixed the traditional plum pudding as a festive dish. “The author of the Book of Christmas,” Collingham writes, “personified the plum pudding as a ‘blackamoor who derives his extraction from the spice lands’.” In the book’s illustration, it even appeared as a portly black figure, clothed absurdly in medieval costume. The pudding was thought of as a national dish precisely because of the foreign nature of the ingredients of sugar, spice and dried fruits: “an emblem of our commercial eminence”. This book’s treatment of food in the empire is innovative and exciting; to bring such vibrancy to an old topic is a remarkable achievement. • Kwasi Kwarteng is the author of Ghosts of Empire.

Turnbull spoke to president Moon by telephone on Monday evening, and the South Korean president thanked Australia for its support in pursuing tough sanctions against North Korea, which are the subject of ongoing negotiations in the UN security council in New York. The two leaders agreed to the implementation of strong sanctions was a critical component of isolating and containing the regime in Pyongyang, and pressuring North Korea to cease its reckless and provocative actions. They agreed that China and Russia were critical to ensuring the sanctions were agreed and enforced. The discussion between the Australian prime minister and the South Korean president follows talks in recent days between Turnbull and the US president Donald Trump and the prime minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe. The defence minister, Marise Payne, travelled to Seoul last week to send a message of regional solidarity. Last week, Australia’s foreign minister, Julie Bishop told parliament Canberra supported stronger UN security council responses to counter North Korea’s rogue behaviour, including even stronger and tougher economic sanctions, particularly those where China can exercise its leverage. Bishop said Australia was coordinating with partners in the region the permanent five members of the security council. “It is overwhelmingly in our interest to pursue every avenue and use every effort to find a peaceful resolution to this crisis,” the foreign minister told parliament last week. The security council is due to vote shortly on new restrictions on the regime.

The drum kit is the final straw","bodyText":"Requiring a cup of coffee, I open the cupboard and contemplate my choice of mug, quickly realising there is only one I am allowed to use. It is my least favourite. The one that reads, “Hello … Is it tea you’re looking for?”, with a picture of Lionel Richie’s grinning face. I take it down with a grumpy sigh. The rest of the mugs on the shelf are beautiful things, but off limits because they are the personal property of my daughters, and therefore sacred vessels for their lips only. I shout up the stairs to my offspring. “I’m making a new rule,” I tell them. “You are only allowed two mugs or cups each in the kitchen cupboard. Otherwise I can’t fit any of my own on the shelf and I never have anything nice to drink out of.” They look aghast. “Can’t we have four each?” Lily asks. “No.” “Three?” Megan tries. “Two!” I tell them. “You’ll have to keep the others in your rooms. You can rotate or something.” “But have you seen our rooms?” Lily wails. I have. They look as if Aladdin and Father Christmas have been doing joint retail therapy. Megan’s resembles a tightly packed furniture storeroom. Lily has a thing for bedspreads and antique quilts, but has a single bed; so she has hung covers on her wall and wardrobe doors. It is claustrophobic in the summer, and a year-round magnet for dust. Then there are the cushions. Piles of them. Walking across her room in bare feet is a delight, each step a squidgy, soft experience. But if you drop something, you will never find it. The girls, both in their mid-20s, are gripped by a mania for household possessions, swooning over rugs and mirrors, electric kettles and teapots. Bright, shiny new stuff keeps appearing in our house. “Stop buying things,” I tell them. “We have nowhere to put it! Can’t you sell it, or give away some of this clutter?” “It’s not clutter. It’s for our flat,” they protest. “Which flat?” “The one we’ll move into one day.” “Soon,” Lily says firmly. They are at that age when a yearning for one’s own place to furnish and decorate can take hold: a need to develop individual taste, make a home. A nesting instinct. The problem is that my adult children are still living with us, and their possessions are spilling out of their bedrooms. The clutter is making me itch. I contemplate ringing storage units to get quotes. Their brother Jake, whose room isn’t much bigger than a broom cupboard, is also busy acquiring stuff for the flat he will one day move into. He is collecting musical instruments. He has already crammed an electric keyboard and several guitars into his tiny space. I reel back in horror when he lugs a secondhand electric drum kit into the kitchen. But he assures me that he can play it on “silent”, and persuades me it will fit in the hall. He assembles the kit with excitement. It completely blocks the path to the stairs. We have to squeeze around it, kicking the kick drum, clattering the hi-hat with our elbows as we scramble past. At least, I reassure myself, it won’t be noisy when he plays. At first I don’t understand what the weird thumping sound is reverberating through the floor. It turns out to be Jake’s “silenced” drumsticks bashing away. The kit is banned. Jake won’t part with it, because, of course, he will be able to use it in his hypothetical flat, where his presumably tolerant new flatmates won’t mind a bit. It is packed away into the only space left in the house – behind the sofa pressed up against the floor-length curtains. “See – you won’t even know it’s there,” Jake says. He is right. Except for every time I draw the curtains, when I must climb on top of the sofa, balancing precariously on the back in order to tug them across dusty snares of folded metal. It occurs to me that when the kids do eventually move out, they will be taking half the contents of the house with them. But I think Ed and I are ready to release our inner minimalists.

The Turner prize winner has been responsible for a number of public works around the world, including a cast of the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square and the Holocaust monument in Vienna. Speaking ahead of a major retrospective of her work at Tate Britain, Whiteread said all her public sculptures were in places for a coherent reason. “I’m not a great fan of what I call ‘plop art,’” she said. “Where you plop a piece of work down in a place and it doesn’t really bear any relationship to anything else. “Art has got extremely popular which is great for many reasons but I think a lot of public sculpture is ill-thought-out and put in places it shouldn’t necessarily be. It then becomes something that is sort of invisible. People don’t even notice it. I think art is there for a reason and should be respected and looked at, not be just a sideshow.” Whiteread declined to name which sculptures she thought were plop art, but there will be many people who have strong views on the subject, given how fiercely divisive the subject of public sculpture can be. For as many people who love, for example, Maggi Hambling’s 12ft scallop shell on Aldeburgh beach, there are large numbers who loathe it. How many people could name the men who occupy the three other plinths in Trafalgar Square? How many can even visualise them? Whiteread said London was “completely full of sculptures which no one bears a blind bit of attention to”. She added that although there were figures everywhere: “People have no idea who they are or what they are for.”The Essex-born artist burst onto the art scene in 1993 with her cast of an entire east London terraced house, which won her the Turner. Her new retrospective surveys 30 years of her casts, whether of hot water bottles, doors, seats, windows, mattresses, or entire rooms and staircases. All the walls have been removed from Tate Britain’s exhibition space leaving just one 1,500 sq m space full of her sculptures. It took four weeks to install the show and Whiteread said she looks on it with pride. “It has been quite emotional actually; it has been an interesting journey. “What I feel very proud of in this show is the consistency, the work has kept this very rigid path and I’ve created a language and I’ve worked with this language ... it is like making an alphabet: you start to make words and play with them.” In the show, the casts of floors and chairs and mattresses have tape around them, but keeping visiting children off them may be an extra challenge, curators admit. Whiteread said she was more concerned about children getting yelled at by their parents than the threat to her work, although she stressed they were not for climbing on. For the Tate Britain show she has made a sculpture cast from a Norfolk chicken shed, owned by a friend. It has been installed on the gallery’s lawn and is part of a series Whiteread calls “shy sculptures” – of sheds, huts and cabins from remote locations such as a fjord in Norway, up a hill on New York’ Governors Island and the Mojave desert. Whiteread said sheds were beautiful things with their own poetry: “They are furniture for people to dream away their lives in.” She wanted to make many more and locate them in remote landscapes around the world accompanied by a book and a map, but added: “They have to be the right locations.” The Tate Britain retrospective will run in London from 12 September to 21 January 2018 before travelling to Washington, Vienna and St Louis."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/13/how-shoegaze-took-over-asia","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T12:35:04Z","webTitle":"'A language we use to say sentimental things': how shoegaze took over Asia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/13/how-shoegaze-took-over-asia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/13/how-shoegaze-took-over-asia","fields":{"headline":"'A language we use to say sentimental things': how shoegaze took over Asia","bodyText":"Perched at the edge of Shanghai’s Kaixuan Road, between Tianshan Park’s leafy calm and the imposing weight of the elevated West Yan’an Road metro station, sits Yuyintang Livehouse, a mainstay of the city’s underground music scene. Signposted by the electric glow of a polar bear holding a guitar, this indie music destination – in a city short on such venues – recently hosted the fourth East Asia Shoegaze festival. Organised by Lulu, guitarist of the Shanghai shoegaze quartet Forsaken Autumn, and Japan-based Luuv Label, this year’s lineup featured an eclectic range of new and known bands from the region, including rising stars RUBUR, Japanese shoegaze royalty Cruyff in the Bedroom and the diffuse Taiwanese dream-pop outfit U.TA. Despite the genre’s decline over two decades ago, shoegaze – a style of noisy, beautifully hazy psychedelic rock – never truly disappeared. Now it is back in the spotlight due to the re-emergence of genre figureheads Slowdive. With the Reading five-piece sitting alongside such seminal bands as My Bloody Valentine, Chapterhouse, Swervedriver and Ride atop its family tree, the genre continues to influence musicians across the globe, often taking root in the unlikeliest of places. From Tokyo and Taipei to Shanghai and Xiamen, lush hooks, half-whispered lyrics, melodic noise and warrens of effects pedals come together as a quintessentially western musical style cross-pollinates with Asian aesthetics to form a striking hybrid. Chinese shoegazers RUBUR were quick to stamp their own cultural background onto the genre. Along with the carefree noise-pop of the White Tulips (from Xiamen) and the silky electro-glitch effects of Goodbye Honey Boy (Beijing), their art school aesthetics are helping to define shoegaze in their home country. “Honestly, I am rarely influenced by western shoegaze,” says RUBUR’s drummer, Salajane. “I learn about it through various kinds of western, Japanese and Chinese bands, which have shoegaze elements.” He says he finds a sense of identity in the genre’s sound – “an introvert’s mode of expression”. At first glance, shoegaze and Chinese culture might seem unexpected bedfellows, but as another RUBUR member, Maojia, explains: “In ancient Chinese love stories, lovers wouldn’t say ‘I love you’ to each other. For us, the harsh noise and wispy voices of shoegaze music is the language we use to communicate sentimental things.” (The band incorporates dialogue from the Chinese film Springtime in a Small Town, a seminal romantic drama, on one of their tracks.) For Japanese band Dive’s singer and guitarist Takaharu Sasaoka, the musically promiscuous approach of Tokyo band Coaltar of the Deepers offered a compelling local example of shoegaze and post-rock musicians who were willing to experiment with other genres. For Sasaoka, shoegaze elicits an immersive euphoria: “A sense of the extraordinary combined with the isolation of being alone in a crowd”. Since their formation in Shimokitazawa in 1998, veterans Cruyff in the Bedroom have been a mainstay on the Japanese shoegaze scene. For them and innumerable others, Alan McGee’s Creation Records label was a gateway to the addictive joys of reverse reverb and the whammy bar. Their music reached western record companies, and these connections were strengthened by the internet, “especially through MySpace – the internet expanded our world,” says vocalist Hata Yusuke. The band remains captivated by the genre’s “ambiguous and beautiful sound” with its “feedback noise and sensitive melodies”. Paradoxically, the genre’s inward-looking emphasis has endowed it with a global outlook. Vocalist Uray of Taipei’s U.TA cites Cocteau Twins and early 4AD as formative influences, but for her, shoegaze represents music without borders. Their approach to music is also deeply informed by the aesthetics of Hong Kong cinema, particularly the films of Wong Kar-wai: “We transform all of that beauty and stylistic decadence into beats, sounds, melodies, and lyrics.” Such openness to influences and experiences is evident when listening to U.TA’s mixture of post-rock, psychedelia and punk. As with kindred Taiwanese rockers Skip Skip Ben Ben, the results – as geographic and stylistic differences dissolve – are mesmeric. Events like the East Asia Shoegaze festival further bolster the scene via the weird familiarity of strangers with shared interests. Between sets, audience and band members spill on to the narrow slice of pavement outside Yuyintang, careful to avoid the electric buses and bikes weaving their way through the humid Shanghai night. As each band takes the stage, their guitars slowly wash away the din of the street, tinting the evening with a euphoric wistfulness."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2017/sep/12/high-streets-charity-shops-money-local","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T07:13:29Z","webTitle":"If high streets must have charity shops, the money should stay local | Bill Grimsey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2017/sep/12/high-streets-charity-shops-money-local","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/public-leaders-network/2017/sep/12/high-streets-charity-shops-money-local","fields":{"headline":"If high streets must have charity shops, the money should stay local","bodyText":"Charity shops could be a perfect way to recycle in the 21st century, but local authorities need to wake up and stop sleep walking. The challenge today for central and local governments is the same as when I, with a team of eight professionals, wrote and published The Grimsey Review in 2013. Local plans are required that will turn our high streets into community hubs,where people can find health, education, entertainment, arts, crafts, leisure - and some shops, including charity shops. These 21st-century high streets will embrace technology and free wifi in our towns will be common in 10 years’ time. Charity shops should be there for the local community and support local charities, to ensure the revenue they generate stays in the local economy. When I was a lad growing up in the 1950s and 1960s high streets boomed in the post-war environment. This was the start of the consumer rush. With demand for shop space at a premium, there was no place for charity shops in the high street. But charity shops did exist back then; they werecalled the jumble sale. These were an opportunity for people to feel good about themselves and “recycle” unwanted clothes, toys, books and so on, which were bought by people on a budget. Everyone was a winner! As with high street retailing the recycling market has undergone dramatic change in the past 50 years and top of that sector today is the high street charity shop. Cubs and Brownies still have jumble sales and the car boot sale also does well but the monster in the pack is the charity shop. Is this a good or bad thing? One point often missed is that the economics behind the charity shop is now big business for national charities. National chains like Oxfam are high street retail chains, subsidised by local government through business rate rebates. Landlords often winas well, by supporting the value of their unwanted space with rents propped up by the business rate rebate. These national chains are run by highly-paid chief executives and have a costly organisation structure. Unlike the old-fashioned jumble sales, where almost all the revenue went to local good causes, charity shops have seen growing questions about their overheads and claims that in some cases barely half their revenue stream goes to a good cause. The way some high streets have evolved is unacceptable. Some now look like charity shop row. Penzance has a high street that is in severe decay, propped up by charity shops in double figures. To make today’s high streets work for everyone, the starting point should be a clear plan. The starting point is to have a plan. There are examples of local authorities taking the initiative to do this but many more towns need to wake up. As the Demos report, published on 11 September, shows, charity shops can be good for the local community and local economy.

I am contracted to stay here for two years. After that I may or may not get another job in the same town, but I’m not so attached to it that I’d want to stay if there wasn’t the compelling reason of a job. I have £280,000 invested offshore (a combination of life savings and proceeds from the sale of a flat) which is earning capital growth of £2,000 a month. I am single and paying only £400 a month in rent in cramped quarters. I could probably get something more comfortable for about £800 a month. If I were going to be staying here long term it would doubtless make sense to buy a place of my own. In the shorter term, however, I’m not sure. The capital growth on my investments far exceeds my monthly rental payments. If I were to purchase a house or flat it would be something in the range of £350,000-£400,000, so stamp duty would be in the region of £8,000. Using my savings as the deposit, I would forfeit the capital growth I currently get. Property values seem unlikely to increase much over the next two years, and the stamp duty is obviously money I will never get back. So according to my estimates, if I buy now I could end up worse off in two years’ time if I have to sell up and move on. So in financial terms I should continue renting. If we were talking a small amount of money it would be worth it for the sake of having my own place – I’m not getting any younger. But as far as I can see, if I buy now I will end up two years hence thousands of pounds worse off than if I continue renting while my invested assets grow. Or have I somehow got this wrong? JP A You are right that buying property is an expensive business. And it’s not just the stamp duty land tax (SDLT) that you won’t get back when you come to sell: it’s also legal fees and the possible valuation and survey fees. But as you say, the biggest hit is from the SDLT, which would be £7,500 on a property costing £350,000, but £10,000 if you bought somewhere for £400,000. Because of these un-refundable costs, as a general rule of thumb, if you don’t plan to stay in the same place for at least two years you are probably better off renting. However, it also has to be said that at the end of two years you won’t get back the £9,600 in rent you will have paid – or £19,200 if you were to move to somewhere less cramped. It’s also true that if you were to use your entire invested assets to buy a property you would lose out on the £2,000 it is growing by each month (assuming that level of growth continues). So, on the face of it, because you might be moving on in two years’ time it seems to make financial sense to carry on renting. But what if you don’t change towns at the end of your current contract? Will you kick yourself for not having bought? If there is a high chance you’ll be staying put, there could be a good reason for coming up with a compromise solution. Instead of using all your invested assets to buy a home, you could use only as much as you need to put down as a deposit to get an affordable mortgage for the rest of the purchase price. It’s true that reducing the amount you have invested won’t produce the same amount of growth as now, but on the plus side capital gains made on a home of your own are tax-free, while gains on investments – even if held offshore – attract capital gains tax. Income from offshore investments is also liable for income tax if you are a UK resident. If UK taxpayers don’t tell HM Revenue &amp; Customs about offshore income and gains they are breaking the law."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/11/chicken-lasagne-and-boiled-potatoes-theresa-mays-dismal-menu","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T14:26:29Z","webTitle":"Chicken lasagne and boiled potatoes?

Theresa May's dismal menu","bodyText":"If you needed further proof that Britain has given up on the European project, you can’t get much better than the lunch the prime minister served her top brass at Chequers in February, as they plotted their election strategy, as described in a new book about the 2017 campaign, Betting the House, by political correspondents Tim Ross and Tom McTague. Chicken lasagne and boiled potatoes – as Lynton Crosby apparently quipped, it is possible to tell a lot about a leader from the menus they serve. In this case, it is clear that Theresa May cares as little about respecting the culinary traditions of fellow Europeans as she does about the sanctity of fields of wheat. Although chicken livers are often added to a beef ragu for richness, or sauces are made with chicken broth, chicken itself is very rarely served with pasta in its homeland, reserved instead for the main course, where it might be stewed alla cacciatora or roasted with garlic and herbs. The culinary legend that is Anna del Conte gives a couple of ideas for using up leftover roast chicken in her book of pasta – but never for lasagne – Marcella Hazan does not countenance putting the two together at all in her comprehensive Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking, and neither does that bible of cucina italiana, the Silver Spoon. Part of the reason is that chicken would historically have been expensive, but as a lean meat, it is still better simply roasted or grilled to bring out its delicate flavour. The potatoes are a puzzle, too; February is too early even for Jersey Royals, so it can’t have been an expression of culinary patriotism, except perhaps in cleaving to the bizarre Anglo-Saxon custom of serving garlic bread with pasta – carb on carb, like a chip butty or a potato pie (both of which would have been infinitely preferable). Either way, the entire course sounds stodgy and dull, which some of the diners may have felt fitted the atmosphere well. Food at Chequers is usually more traditional – British traditional, that is. David Cameron served the Queen and Prince Philip lamb, potatoes and vegetables, with bread and butter pudding for dessert (with the news that Samantha sometimes chews every mouthful 50 times to stay healthy, one hopes that the royal couple didn’t have a train to catch), while John Major plumped for salmon and Edward Heath honoured the monarch with roast sirloin of beef when she came for lunch with Richard Nixon. The current PM is known to be a more adventurous cook, with more than 100 books in her collection, and has cited Yotam Ottolenghi’s marinated rack of lamb with coriander and honey and Diana Henry’s baked chicken with tarragon and dijon mustard as some of her favourites; she has even decided what to cook for Donald Trump if he ever shows up for supper (slow-roasted lamb shoulder). This makes me wonder whether the pragmatic May was making a deliberate point with her dismal menu – perhaps, in fact, she was just trying to prepare her team for disappointment.

Not any more. From now on it's cheap","bodyText":"The persistent myth that green energy is expensive has been shredded by the revelation that windfarms will be built around Britain’s coast far more cheaply than new nuclear reactors. New power stations in the UK today are usually only built with the certainty provided by subsidies paid through energy bills, so the record low guaranteed price awarded to the developers of three new mega offshore windfarms today is, first and foremost, welcome news for consumers. It is also good for the economy post-Brexit, for the foreign-owned developers behind the multibillion-pound projects, and the increasingly UK-based supply chain that supports them, such as Siemens’ £310m wind turbine factory in Hull. But there is no mistaking the fact that the low prices, labelled “astonishing”, “exceptional” and “astounding”, are terrible news for nuclear proponents. Ministers last year awarded French state-owned EDF £92.50 per megawatt hour of power generated by two new reactors at Hinkley Point C in Somerset. The price is nearly twice that of wholesale power and is goldplated by being inflation-linked and written in stone for 35 years. EDF said this week that future nuclear plants, such as the new one it wants to build at Sizewell in Suffolk, would be cheaper than Hinkley. But even the most vociferous nuclear supporters think that Sizewell C and a Japanese-backed bid to build new reactors at Wylfa in Wales would not come in below £80 per MWh, compared with the £57.50 per MWh over 15 years for new offshore windfarms. Ironically for the party that champions free market economics, the Conservatives’ commitment to a fleet of new nuclear power plants is being challenged by competition. Windfarm developers have to compete against one another in a reverse auction, ensuring the government gets the cheapest price for the low carbon power it needs. The price this time crashed so much that only £176m-a-year of the £240m subsidy pot set aside by officials will be needed. The timescales and monolithic nature of nuclear projects means it would be hard, albeit not impossible, for the government to run a competitive process for them. Playing EDF off against consortiums such as Horizon, which is behind Wylfa, is not really an option. Of course, wind power is variable, unlike the steady power provided by nuclear, so there are costs to the energy system of integrating all those new turbines. But experts say those costs are relatively negligible, especially if coupled with flexible and smart technologies such as batteries, which the government is backing with hundreds of millions of pounds. So large-scale renewable power built in the next decade will be inarguably much cheaper than nuclear. But it’s not just about cost – offshore windfarms can be built quicker, too. Their modular nature means they can be built in stages, and offshore wind generally has a good track record of being built on time in the UK. The projects that won subsidies this week should be operational by 2023. By comparison, Hinkley Point C is officially slated to be operational by 2025 but EDF admitted earlier this year that it could run 15 months over schedule. And the track record of plants being built with Hinkley’s reactor design is infamous: Olkiluoto in Finland is a decade behind schedule; the other, at Flamanville in France, is six years late. The price awarded to offshore windfarms is also even lower than new gas power plants, but this week’s auction is unlikely to spell the death of gas, which can be built much more cheaply and quickly than nuclear. Witness the German utility Uniper publicly mulling over the idea of taking apart its gas power stations in Germany and rebuilding them in the UK. But today could be, as the trade group RenewableUK puts it, a “gamechanger” for ministers in charge of setting energy policy. With a major government review of the cost of energy due out in October, there are calls for Theresa May to at the very least commit to further support for offshore wind and, more radically, to drop plans for new nuclear. It’s become clear which way the wind is blowing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/11/julian-nagelsmann-helped-by-a-ball-boy-as-he-aces-latest-bayern-munich-audition","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T10:25:40Z","webTitle":"Julian Nagelsmann helped by a ball boy as he aces latest Bayern Munich audition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/11/julian-nagelsmann-helped-by-a-ball-boy-as-he-aces-latest-bayern-munich-audition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/11/julian-nagelsmann-helped-by-a-ball-boy-as-he-aces-latest-bayern-munich-audition","fields":{"headline":"Julian Nagelsmann helped by a ball boy as he aces latest Bayern Munich audition","bodyText":"There was never even a flicker of doubt over who or what would be the centre of attention at the Rhein-Neckar Arena early Saturday evening. “Before the game,” wrote Süddeutsche Zeitung, “so many cameras were directed at him that one had to ask whether there was any pose at all he had not been photographed in; sitting, standing, looking into the distance, hands in the pockets.” It was, perhaps, less Hoffenheim against Bayern Munich and more the champions’ future taking on their present. There is consensus that Julian Nagelsmann, Hoffenheim’s 30-year-old coach of the year, will take the path to the top at the Allianz Arena at some point in the near future. The question, posed a lot in Germany over the last week as the two sides prepared to meet, is exactly when the moment will arrive. Hoffenheim’s 2-0 win – their second successive home victory over Bayern, after beating them 1-0 in the same fixture back in April – has certainly done little for the lingering doubts over Carlo Ancelotti, with the Italian approaching the halfway point of his three-year contract as head coach but doing less and less to convince us that he’ll reach term. This was Bayern’s earliest Bundesliga loss in a season since being beaten by Borussia Mönchengladbach in the opening game of 2011-12, and their first league loss by more than one goal since going down 3-1 at Gladbach under Pep Guardiola, almost two years ago. The performance was “not so bad,” Ancelotti said afterwards and one could have at least a degree of sympathy with that view, even if his claim that Bayern had “90 minutes control of the game” was perhaps stretching it. In statistical terms he had a point, with Bayern having 72% of possession and 23 shots to Hoffenheim’s six, but Ancelotti is experienced enough to know that possession doesn’t necessarily equal control. Bayern were chasing from the point just before the half-hour that Mark Uth opened the scoring, in a curious incident which underlined just how switched on Hoffenheim were – and how befuddled their opponents were to become that things just weren’t going for them. As the home side cleared long out of defence (for neither the first time nor the last), Mats Hummels intercepted in front of Andrej Kramaric, narrowly failing to keep the ball in play. Hummels was out of the picture, though, as in impeccable use of the multiball system Kramaric grabbed another ball and threw it down the line for Uth, who smashed his shot early past Manuel Neuer at the near post. Bayern complained at some length that there was a second ball on the pitch – the one cleared downfield by Hummels after it had gone off – with Robert Lewandowski, Joshua Kimmich and Thomas Müller among those to make their case to referee Daniel Siebert, who also had to put up with the lengthy complaints of Ancelotti’s assistant Willy Sagnol at the interval. Siebert explained the rules – that play only needs to stopped if the second ball is interfering with the game which, having been dispatched 70 yards into Hoffenheim territory by Hummels, it clearly wasn’t. It was a nuance to the rule that Ancelotti openly admitted he was unaware of until the referee explained it to him, while Hummels said he hadn’t heard of it “in 20 years of playing”. Bayern knew they’d been caught out, though; Ancelotti admitted “it was also our fault,” while Neuer said “we shouldn’t have switched off.” “They moved it quickly – Andrej, Mark and the ball boy,” Nagelsmann smiled with some satisfaction after the game, adding that the goal was in part the result of a shared philosophy running through the club. “The ball boys are encouraged to get the ball back into the game quickly,” Nagelsmann said of the 13-year-old that the club declined to name after the match. “I don’t want to say that a big percentage of the goal is down to the ball boy, but he had a good part in it.” Uth, who snaffled a neatly-taken second after the break, was certainly grateful, and he plans to give the ball boy a shirt “or something” as reward. The 26-year-old is probably in generous mood as he surfs the crest of a wave. Having scored in both legs of the Champions League playoff defeat by Liverpool, he now has three in three Bundesliga starts this season. It certainly backs the club’s judgement after they refused him a move back to his hometown club Köln this summer, preferring to hold him to the final year of his contract. Sporting director Alexander Rosen hasn’t given up hope of persuading Uth to sign a new one, and it’s easy to see why. Bayern could have done with some of the same incision. Their best opportunity was in the seventh minute, when Müller’s perfect cross offered Lewandowski an opportunity that he should have done better than hitting the outside of the goalframe with. Their numerical dominance can’t mask the fact that Hoffenheim goalkeeper Oliver Baumann performed tidily, rather than heroically. By the end Ancelotti had Lewandowski, Kingsley Coman, Arjen Robben, Franck Ribéry and debutant James Rodríguez all on the pitch at once to try and break through, all to no avail. “It was difficult,” Ancelotti mused. “There was no space.” That much was true, with Nagelsmann’s formation using more of a back five than a back three. In front of that, you could even argue that it was a five-man midfield, with Uth and Kramaric dropping deep to muck in. “They got into our penalty box three times and scored twice,” complained Ancelotti. Solving such conundrums could be the problem of Nagelsmann – who said Hoffenheim’s “bigger heart” made the difference – before long. With both teams in European action this week, as Die Kraichgauer get ready to face Braga on their Europa League debut, few eyes will be wandering from Nagelsmann any time soon. Talking points • It was another bad day for Köln ahead of their return to Europe, after a 25-year absence, at Arsenal on Thursday. Perhaps having one eye on that explains how they crumbled at Augsburg, for whom Alfred Finnbogason scored a hat-trick, leaving them bottom and as the only team in the division without a point. They were facing, as ZDF’s Aktuelle Sportstudio pointed out, “no Wenger, no Özil” (with lingering shots on Augsburg coach Manuel Baum and midfielder Daniel Baier laid over in faintly insulting comparison) but their defending left them no chance, with Frederik Sorensen in particular suffering. “We made it too easy,” said coach Peter Stöger, whose side can’t score either, with Jhon Córdoba fluffing a chance for a first-half equaliser chance that Anthony Modeste would have gobbled up. They face a trip to Dortmund – the other Bundesliga club north London-bound this midweek – in next Sunday’s late game. • There was more VAR fun at the Volksparkstadion, where Leipzig ended Hamburg’s 100% record. They might have started it off from the spot but referee Deniz Aytekin’s award of a penalty for Albin Ekdal’s foul on Timo Werner was overturned after video review – something that will do little to assuage his reputation among fans as a diver. Werner had the last laugh, though, streaking away to score a sensational counterattack goal to seal the win after shrugging off Dennis Diekmeier and Gotoku Sakai, after Naby Keïta had opened the scoring with a typical piledriver from range. • Schalke were saying goodbye to a couple of crowd darlings in Atsuto Uchida and Benedikt Höwedes in the home game with Stuttgart. Uchida had been playing for his new club, Union Berlin, at Fortuna Düsseldorf just a few hours before being presented on the pitch, and his old teammates were quick off the mark too, with Nabil Bentaleb scoring a penalty after four minutes and two quick goals from Naldo and Guido Burgstaller at the start of the second half calming nerves after Chadrac Akolo equalised. Amine Harit, who’s already building himself a following, was again excellent. • There were no such problems for Hertha Berlin, where Matthew Leckie opened the scoring against Werder Bremen after referee Bibiana Steinhaus allowed play to run when Vladimir Darida was fouled. Thomas Delaney, the scorer of four in a week for Denmark on international duty, equalised to earn Werder a first point of the season, while Steinhaus became the first female referee of a Bundesliga fixture. • There was no revenge for Gladbach on Eintracht Frankfurt after their defeat in last season’s DfB Pokal semi-final, with Kevin-Prince Boateng’s winner getting Niko Kovac’s team up and running. He might have ended the afternoon with an icepack on his head after a Jannik Vestergaard elbow, but his combination with Sebastien Haller is working well enough that they already even have a custom handshake to celebrate goals, with Haller having set up Boateng’s goal. • Leverkusen are in bother again after crashing at a previously-pointless Mainz, despite having taken the lead through Dominik Kohr. A super Yoshinori Muto equaliser changed the complexion of the game, and ghastly Leverkusen defending for second-half goals by Abdou Diallo and Suat Serdar did the rest. Herrlich hasn’t won a Bundesliga game in the last 13, going back to his previous top-flight tenure in charge of Bochum, and he admitted that “we’ve already got our backs to the wall” after the game. Sporting director Rudi Völler, currently busy trying to unpick the Lucas Alario situation after the Argentinian Football Association refused to sign off his move from River Plate, said ominously that “one point after three games isn’t enough.” • The Lower Saxony derby between Wolfsburg and Hannover ended in stalemate, though there was another unusual injury after Nicolai Müller’s celebration led to a knee injury for Hamburg. Mario Gómez damaged his ankle ligaments kicking his own leg, instead of the ball, in front of goal, and will be missing for a few weeks. Beside Gomez, on-loan Divock Origi missed chances but looks like he’ll add a lot, while the visitors got a point via a scruffily-made equaliser, brilliantly finished by Martin Harnik. The other Martin, chairman Kind, used post-match not so much to praise the fans who continue to back the team, but to respond to the dissenters against his prospective takeover in a divided fanbase. “They are supposed to support the team,” said Kind. “That’s their job.” Results: Schalke 3-1 Stuttgart, Hertha Berlin 1-1 Werder Bremen, Mainz 3-1 Leverkusen, Mönchengladbach 0-1 Frankfurt, Augsburg 3-0 Köln, Freiburg 0-0 Dortmund, Hoffenheim 2-0 Bayern Munich, Wolfsburg 1-1 Hanover, Hamburg 0-2 RB Leipzig."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/11/festival-no-6-review-charlotte-church-flaming-lips-wayne-coyne","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T13:25:24Z","webTitle":"Festival No 6 review – Charlotte Church throws curveballs and the Flaming Lips ride unicorns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/11/festival-no-6-review-charlotte-church-flaming-lips-wayne-coyne","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/11/festival-no-6-review-charlotte-church-flaming-lips-wayne-coyne","fields":{"headline":"Festival No 6 review – Charlotte Church throws curveballs and the Flaming Lips ride unicorns","bodyText":"‘Remarkable things can be achieved by the British in the rain,” announces Wild Beasts’ Hayden Thorpe on day one of Festival No 6. Nestled in a far corner of Wales in the final splutter of summer, it is all but guaranteed to face testing weather, and last year that test was an extreme one – torrential downpours flooded the car park and stranded hundreds. This year, the organisers have taken stock, making structural changes and reducing the capacity, and though there are cascading downpours aplenty, the festival holds up. When it’s visible through the deluges, the site is a remarkable thing indeed. With its backdrop of undulating hills and vast ocean, it spills out into the local village of Portmeirion, a bizarre, pastel-coloured collage of out-of-place fragments. A metal sheep hangs from a balcony; a golden Buddha sits in a baby-blue enclave; a giant chess board sprawls across the central village green. Though its designer, Sir Clough Williams-Ellis, was aiming to recreate a quaint Italian town, it looks more like a cartoon village come to life. The site’s eccentricities are matched by a handful of events on the line-up. Charlotte Church’s Pop Dungeon is an hour of operatically transformed pop covers with a sprinkling of perfectly judged curveballs – Willy Wonka’s Pure Imagination glides into Sugababes’ Overload as a Jefferson Airplane bass riff rumbles underneath. Sure, it’s glorified karaoke, but boy, is it glorious. Then there’s the Beatles parade, marking 50 years of Sgt Pepper. Complete with enormous effigies and a brass band, it marches through town and on to the main stage, culminating in an infectious, frequently uncanny performance from the Bootleg Beatles. The headliners, meanwhile, become progressively more unhinged as the weekend progresses. Scottish post-rockers Mogwai provide an expansive, shoegazey soundscape that is beautiful to listen to – but given their music’s cinematic scope, there’s surprisingly little in the way of visuals. Bloc Party put on a hyperactive show, where Kele Okereke’s bouts of sardonic abuse – “Come on you bougie fucks” – just serve to fuel the crowd’s enthusiasm. And there’s a characteristically bonkers performance from Flaming Lips. With at least four costume changes, an inflatable robot, multicoloured hanging tentacles and a rideable unicorn, the whole thing could be unbearably gimmicky if it weren’t for the strength of the band’s strange, jittery psychedelic rock. “We feel like we’re in the exact place we should be,” beams Wayne Coyne. The feeling’s mutual.

There are still some points of interest, though, and many punters are likely to latch on to Send Up (3.55) when she makes the step up to 12 furlongs on the south coast. Sir Mark Prescott has been getting horses handicapped at distances much shorter than their pedigree seems to demand before running up sequences at more appropriate trips for as long as most of us can remember. There is nothing to stop it in the Rules of Racing, and it provides the punters who back them with a steady stream of winners, albeit at steadily decreasing odds as ever more backers pile in. Send Up is textbook Prescott: a filly closely related to stayers out of a Sadler’s Wells mare whose first three runs were at trips between seven furlongs and a mile, finishing fifth of six, ninth of 13 and 11th of 12. She steps up to a mile-and-a-half off an initial rating of 58 and will surely improve significantly for the trip. And even at around 7-2 after showing so little to date, Send Up is probably worth backing. Prescott consistently records a strike-rate of 20pc or better with runners making their handicap debut, and while the profitability of backing them blind has declined somewhat in recent years, his 18 winners from 89 qualifying runners since 2013 are still in credit. Elsewhere on the Brighton card, the consistent Field Of Vision (3.25) could offer some value against recent course-and-distance winner Black Caesar, who may have been a little flattered by his six-length winning margin on deteriorating ground. Sarstedt (2.55) should also go well earlier on the card, while The Clock Leary (4.35) and Kapricorne (3.45) look best on the jumps cards at Perth and Newton Abbot respectively.

There are about 5.1 million public sector workers in the UK excluding banks rescued in the financial crisis, of whom 1.6 million work for the NHS and 1.5 million work in education. Although public sector pay rose compared with salaries in the private sector during and after the 2008 recession, the government’s cap on pay has led to the difference returning to its pre-crisis level. Its austerity policies have resulted in the number of staff employed in the public sector falling by about 1 million since September 2009, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. A poll of 2,100 employers across nine different sectors by employment agency ManpowerGroup found that a net balance of 6% were planning to increase staff levels rather than make cuts in the final months of the year. In the public sector, the balance improved by four percentage points to 2%, the biggest rise in two years. James Hick, the managing director of ManpowerGroup Solutions, said the positive hiring outlook in the public sector was due to a “rejection of austerity” sensed by hiring managers at NHS trusts and other government departments. “The public sector has really got to get a grip now and start hiring again with gusto across the civil service, the NHS and prison service,” he said. Theresa May’s government, after rejecting calls before the election to bust the 1% pay cap for public sector workers, is preparing to break the rule for police and prison officers as a first step towards recognising the concerns of cash-strapped staff. The prime minister had told a nurse during an election campaign TV appearance “there’s no magic money tree,” when asked about the cap. Average weekly earnings for public sector staff were £511 in June, compared with £506 in the private sector during the same month, according to the ONS. Meanwhile, the TUC estimates the cap has meant that some workers have lost more than £4,000 in real terms from their salary since 2010, amid rising inflation. The cap has led to problems in hiring staff. There were more than 86,000 vacancies in the NHS earlier this year and the government has said it will train an additional 1,500 doctors a year and create 20,000 new mental health posts. “With the health service so heavily dependent on EU nationals, these hiring targets are going to be extremely difficult to meet,” Hick said. However, allowing public sector pay to rise at the same rate as the private sector would cost the government as much as £9.2bn by 2021-22, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. But the TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, has said removing the cap could help to alleviate some pressure on the government’s benefit bill, while also helping to raise pay in the private sector to boost the economy. The recruitment firm also highlighted greater levels of hiring in construction after the fire at Grenfell Tower led to greater checks and more maintenance work on social housing. Construction was the most upbeat sector in its study, up six points to +11%. Brexit is also having an impact on recruitment trends. Official data show a slowing trend for EU workers coming to Britain, which some business leaders have warned could lead to labour shortages. The Guardian revealed the government’s post-Brexit immigration blueprint earlier this month, which would restrict the number of lower skilled migrants coming to work in the UK. Despite construction hiring typically experiencing a slowdown at the beginning of the winter months, firms are pushing to replace European workers opting to leave Britain or those who have chosen not to return, according to Hick. “We’re seeing very considerable numbers of EU workers leaving that sector, which is creating skill shortages. We see this across the job market as a whole, but it starts to become very acute here,” he said. However, there are concerns that the expected expansion of jobs may not materialise, as firms could face problems attracting and retaining skilled employees. “There is lots of talk around [that] what we need to do to fix the UK’s ailing housing market at present but politicians’ promises are just hot air without the essential skilled talent needed to deliver these programmes,” Hick said. Confidence of employers about hiring in London – where housing and the broader cost of living is highest – has halved to 4% since last quarter. The east of England has the strongest regional outlook at 11%, while employers in Northern Ireland expect to hire more staff following the payment of £1bn by the Conservatives to secure backing by the Democratic Unionist party."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/11/miami-or-mexico-trump-aide-mocked-for-tweeting-video-of-wrong-airport","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T11:44:59Z","webTitle":"Miami or Mexico?

Trump aide ​​​​​mocked for tweeting video of wrong airport","bodyText":"Hurricane Irma has left a trail of death and destruction across the Caribbean and battered Florida with 130mph winds. What it has not done is left planes trying to navigate a waterlogged runway at Miami international airport – as Donald Trump’s director of social media tweeted on Sunday night. As the sunshine state took shelter from the superstorm, Dan Scavino shared a video of a flooded airport saying: “Here is Miami International Airport. STAY SAFE!!” He tagged both the president’s and the vice-president’s official Twitter accounts. Scavino was swiftly corrected by Miami airport, which tweeted to say that the information was inaccurate – the airport is closed – as others pointed out that the footage he shared appeared to be from Mexico city. Scavino removed the video from his official government account, saying that it was among hundreds of photos of videos people had sent him and that he was trying to notify those who might have shared it. A correction job that also fell to Miami airport, which has also been updating passengers about travel disruptions caused by the storm. It is not unusual for fake images from extreme weather events to circulate online, but the mistake left many to question why Trump’s social media director failed at the fundamentals of his job: to verify content before posting it online. That the president frequently uses the charge of fake news to attack his detractors made the slip-up more egregious to some Twitter users. “There appears to be nobody in the administration who understands fact-checking, vetting sources, or value of only speaking truth,” said one. “Perpetrating Fake news. Way to go White House. I feel safe!” joked another. As Scavino continued to tweet details about how the administration was responding to to Irma, whose severity has now been downgraded, others on Twitter are teasing Scavino with images and videos that are also clearly not of Florida."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/11/bestival-review-pet-shop-boys-dizzee-rascal-a-tribe-called-quest","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T11:36:29Z","webTitle":"Bestival review – Pet Shop Boys and battleship raves keep spirits stormproof","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/11/bestival-review-pet-shop-boys-dizzee-rascal-a-tribe-called-quest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/11/bestival-review-pet-shop-boys-dizzee-rascal-a-tribe-called-quest","fields":{"headline":"Bestival review – Pet Shop Boys and battleship raves keep spirits stormproof","bodyText":"With Secret Garden Party packing away its tit-glitter for good, is the wasted White Rabbit calling time on the boutique festival? Last year Bestival, at its original Isle of Wight site, carried a faintly withered air: Britain’s wildest costume party gauging the sour national mood and winding down, with fields once full of techno trees, rum shacks and underground pirate restaurants abandoned to camping. Transferred to a smaller site at Lulworth Castle, this year’s event feels at first like a V&amp;A exhibition about Bestival. Previous years’ centrepieces such as the world’s largest mirrorball, the clockwork robot and two giant astronauts are displayed like monuments, and a miniature replica of the once-mighty Wishing Tree stands by the campsite entrance, forlornly whispering reggae remixes. All that’s missing is an audio tour in which the Cuban Brothers inform you how many breaths it took to blow up the world’s biggest bouncy castle. The newest exhibit is Happy Kanye, an illuminated rainbow enshrouding the giant inflatable face of Kanye West, which represents 2017’s costume theme of colour – and the acts duly oblige. Little Dragon’s Yukimi Nagano hits the stage in a neon-red veil and kabuki dress, like Grace Jones playing Ziggy Stardust. If only their amorphous electropop were as vivid; it has as much flavour and substance as yesterday’s gum. London’s post-gender collective HMLTD are another eye-aching sight, featuring a blue-haired dandy sailor, a catwalk Bay City Roller and a singer in a lime green Let’s Dance suit. Somehow their theatrical sound-clashes – channelling Fischerspooner, Adam Ant, Suede, Bond theme fanfares and an ultra-camp Nick Cave – match up well. Pet Shop Boys also got the memo. Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe appear against luminous spheres wearing sci-fi Malteser helmets and lead a band of metallic bird people through a hit-shy set of brainiac synthpop about the pitfalls of commercialism and love being a bourgeois construct (it isn’t). By the time they break out West End Girls, It’s a Sin and the big cover tunes that sell their magnificent pop songwriting short, Tennant is in a silver rainbow jacket, multicoloured bubbles hang from the stage roof and Lulworth Castle has become English Heritage’s most rainbow-washed edifice. Friday bill-toppers the xx don’t play ball, instead dealing in monochrome magic. With Oliver Sim swinging his bass like a Game of Thrones dragonslayer and Romy Croft coming within a fringe flick of rocking out, their formerly stillborn alt-soul has been brought to life by an emergency infusion of Balearic electronics. Once they were the house band at the sort of introverts’ disco where Morrissey might’ve been able to pull; now they conjure spectral dance music that manages to be both tempestuous and vulnerable. Loud Places and the superb On Hold are the euphoric dancefloor payoffs their tantric set of zero-gravity Adele songs always demanded. Though they tell us “we’re so excited to be here” as convincingly as David Davis claims he’s fully prepared for the next round of negotiations, the cheering rightly lasts an age. Bestival’s Lulworth relaunch battles a deluge of vibe dampeners. Torrential rain slimes around the hilly new setting, Wiley and Justice cancel, and wind shuts down the entire site on Sunday afternoon. By far the most dominant costume onsite is the very convincing body-armoured policeman. But Bestival parties on regardless, and the firing of the world’s largest confetti cannon on Saturday afternoon is the starting pistol on a new era of that grand Bestival tradition: getting munted with random Freddie Mercurys. Dizzee Rascal’s populist grime anthems send the crowd bonkers and, after-hours, the compact site creates a Khao San Road of themed clubbing areas. Glittery Neptunes, complete with tridents, slide and slither between neon 80s disco, a battleship rave, a woodland dub cinema and a hilltop Buddhist temple, chasing the strains of Despacito. Here, DJ Shadow is king with his geometric rap sampling and Charlotte Church is his queen, demanding she “fuck you like an animal” while covering Nine Inch Nails in her Late Night Pop Dungeon. Bestival’s broadmindedness survives the sea crossing too. Laura Mvula’s space-age soul shows up Rag’n’Bone Man as the pointless throwback he is. A Tribe Called Quest’s farewell gig – full of moving tributes to late member Phife Dawg, who is present on backing track – is a hip-hop masterclass. Indie rock stages a fightback in the form of Jamie T, Twin Atlantic, Honeyblood’s ball-busting grunge and Circa Waves, whose Hawaiian-shirted indie has the crowd standing on each others shoulders despite the distinct lack of T-shirt weather. And the boutique mindset? That lives on in the bloke going round making people wear 3D glasses that turn all the stage lights into love hearts. The Bestival spirit, it transpires, is stormproof."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/11/lcd-soundsystem-first-ever-no-1-album-american-dream-us-billboard","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T08:52:04Z","webTitle":"LCD Soundsystem score first No 1 album with American Dream","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/11/lcd-soundsystem-first-ever-no-1-album-american-dream-us-billboard","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/11/lcd-soundsystem-first-ever-no-1-album-american-dream-us-billboard","fields":{"headline":"LCD Soundsystem score first No 1 album with American Dream","bodyText":"LCD Soundsystem have reached the top of the US charts for the first time with their new record American Dream.

The No 1 record comes a decade on from Murphy attempting to score a No 1 with their second album Sound of Silver.

In Florida, panic grew as Irma approached. City streets emptied, the skies over the state were quiet after airports closed and those who chose to defy evacuation orders bunkered down for the coming fury. They have endured a days-long preview of the storm’s ferocity as it crashed into homes, hospitals, schools and airports across the Caribbean, wiping out buildings and infrastructure and claiming 20 lives already, a toll that is almost certain to rise. The British Virgin Islands declared a state of emergency and brought in a curfew to deal with devastating destruction; there were reports of looting in Franco-Dutch St Martin, one of the first places hit. In many of the islands that took the full force, most homes were damaged or destroyed. Nick Cunha, a publisher who lives on Tortola, was in one of the houses picked apart by the storm. He had taken shelter with friends who thought their home was stormproof; in fact, the five adults and set of five-month-old triplets cowering inside barely survived. “The house literally blew away, it blew into the road and the hillside behind it, and the room that we were in was the only part that stayed still,” said Cunha, who is helping coordinate relief. “Layers of the home were being stripped away and as each one went the next one was taken faster.” The group retreated into a bathroom, trying to barricade the window with mattresses and the door with chests, but the winds simply ripped off the roof, forcing them to climb out of a tiny bathroom window and shelter beside a generator. When Cunha returned to his own home the next day, looters were already picking through the shattered wreckage. “We have lost everything,” he said. The group are now sleeping in a bank with another family, rationing their tinned food and drinking water, and bracing for the forecast arrival of Hurricane Jose. That storm may be less fierce than Irma, but the debris still lying in many areas could make it more dangerous. They hope the arrival of Royal Marines will stem the violence and speed up the search for missing friends and family. Also badly hit were parts of the Turks and Caicos. At least 13 people, including children, have not been heard from since the storm descended on the tiny island of Salt Cay, where they chose to stay in defiance of an evacuation order. “I am very concerned about Salt Cay; it looks like the southern half has flooded,” said Stacey Schneider, who set up a Facebook page to share information about the crisis, where residents and friends begged the government to send a boat or plane to check on the group. In Florida, state governor Rick Scott visited Sarasota County on the state’s west coast as Irma moved north from Cuba and edged closer to landfall. He warned that the window of time for evacuation was closing rapidly. “If you have been ordered to evacuate you need to leave now. Not tonight, not in an hour, you need to go right now,” he said. Irma was expected to strike the Florida Keys very early on Sunday morning. Thousands of people have already left their homes – though, as the Miami Herald reported, some diehards are clinging on – which seems rash bearing in mind the threat of a storm surge of up to 10ft. In Miami, the first power outages – of 26,000 homes – have been reported, but hopes are rising that it may escape the worst of Irma’s fury as the eye of the storm swings towards the west coast. Nonetheless, the streets were virtually empty, and all petrol stations, supermarkets and other commercial outlets were closed. The city of 6 million people is now in a stunned state of foreboding, waiting to find out what nature has in store. The storm slammed into Cuba on Friday night, taking many in the country by surprise after veering farther south than forecast. It had regained strength at sea to land as the first category 5 hurricane to hit the island since 1924. Hundreds of thousands of people in central areas had already been evacuated. Electricity was cut along much of the northern coast, and the storm ripped apart buildings, felled trees, and churned up metres-high waves, as it had elsewhere. Despite the extensive damage, Cuba is sending doctors around the Caribbean, to Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, the Bahamas, Dominica and Haiti to help with relief. On Barbuda there was unexpected joy, after preparations for another hurricane were set aside when Jose changed course. “It’s a good morning,” ABS TV station said on its website. The island, where almost all homes were rendered uninhabitable by the storm, had already been emptied of its 2,000 strong population by a government that didn’t want to take chances. “There are a few persons who have decided they think they are all right, one of them is actually living in a cave. About maximum 10,” said Arthur Nibbs, minister for Barbuda affairs, who rode out Irma at home but said it had been an unprecedented disaster. From the Virgin Islands, survivors painted a picture of desolation and violence, but warned that the situation could deteriorate if aid did not arrive fast. “There is nothing left, I don’t think people will believe the severity of what happened. There is no water, no food, no supplies, no transport. You can’t get from one part to another unless you walk,” said Giles Cadman, who lives on the islands part-time and has been part of a remote relief network that sprang up in the wake of the disaster. He worries that public perception of the Virgin Islands as a millionaire’s playground could undermine promises of relief aid, even though most residents are ordinary workers on modest salaries. Dr Annalise Wilkins left her home on Tortola to go to a wedding, and now fears she will never see it again. The island does still have a hospital but, as one of few largely intact buildings, it has been partly commandeered by the government, she said. And it was still badly hit by flooding and wind damage, with windows blown in and the dialysis unit flooded. For now, Wilkins is trying to coordinate relief efforts from a distance, and prepare helicopter transport of urgent medical supplies that are already running low. Longer term, she is worried about disease and water supplies, with most of the island’s cisterns and all but one of the desalination plants taken out. “Even basic infrastructure is going to take months.” She fears rebuilding will be slow and the damage may yet intensify. “I think the aftermath is proving worse than the hurricane itself. The devastation and people running out of food and water and not being able to get out.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/09/hurricane-irma-shelters-florida-miami","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T22:22:41Z","webTitle":"Shelters fill up as Florida makes final push to keep people safe from Irma","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/09/hurricane-irma-shelters-florida-miami","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/09/hurricane-irma-shelters-florida-miami","fields":{"headline":"Shelters fill up as Florida makes final push to keep people safe from Irma","bodyText":"Almost a third of the entire population of Florida was under evacuation orders on Saturday afternoon, as Hurricane Irma approached and authorities made a final push to drive more than 6 million people out of danger zones, off the streets and into shelters or on to high ground. With attention increasingly on the west coast, where Irma was expected to grind its way north on Sunday, bringing havoc in its wake, exceptional measures were in place throughout the south of the state. Though it looked like Miami would avoid the worst of Irma’s punch, the 70-mile wide expanse of hurricane winds meant that storm surge and powerful gusts were still likely to cause extensive damage in the city. More than 600,000 residents from Miami-Dade, the county that encloses the fourth largest urban area in the US, were under evacuation orders. The city was scheduled to impose a curfew from 7pm on Saturday to 8am on Sunday. Broward County further to the north had imposed an even more stringent curfew, starting at 4pm in an attempt to propel the last stragglers in a largely deserted area behind closed doors as the hurricane hit. Tropical storm-force winds of more than 50mph were expected to pummel the region from about 5pm on Saturday. Forty-two shelters were open across the Miami area, with 11 already full as more than 25,000 people hunkered down, temporary refugees from the storm. The shelter program was not without its glitches or critics. Refuges were opened at a faster pace than volunteers could be found to staff them, and in some cases evacuees were turned away amid scenes of confusion. “Opening a shelter is not as easy as people think,” the mayor of Miami-Dade, Carlos Giminez, was forced to admit. Many of the shelters were located in high schools, which had turned their sports halls and assembly spaces over to thousands of evacuees. Media were being prevented from entering one such shelter, at the Ronald Reagan high school in Doral, near Miami airport. But evacuees staying at the school told the Guardian conditions inside, for about 1,200 people, were holding up and spirits were high. “People are keeping happy,” said Carola Gil, 55, who had left her home in a nearby neighbourhood, fearful it would be unable to resist Irma’s wrath. “The school is very clean and there’s plenty of space for more to come.” Families seeking shelter were told to bring their own bedding and sufficient food and water for three days. Some people were rather zealous in how they interpreted that advice. Shelter organizers in Broward County put out a subsidiary notice that large objects should not be brought in, following reports that some people had turned up with king-sized mattresses and refrigerators. In the west, as the storm approached Tampa Bay, people who had already entered shelters said they were trying to adjust to their new reality. George Rogner, a 58-year-old professional DJ, was evacuated to an elementary school where he was bunking in a hallway with “lots” more people. “Right now, the power’s on so we’re all charging up the phones and they have the hallways air-conditioned here, thats where we’re at,” Rogner told the Guardian. “You never what a storm is going to do, people are driving all over the state to get away from it and it just follows them.” As the path of Irma veered, hundreds of thousands of Floridians found themselves caught in the changing patterns of a major weather system. Many people from the Miami area fled north and west under evacuation orders, only to find they had been swept into the westward track of the hurricane. Francisco Esser, 44, evacuated Miami on Thursday with his wife and two young children, making a four-hour drive to Tampa. Then, as he avidly followed the news on the Weather Channel and from the National Hurricane Center, he realized that one of the most heavily threatened regions was precisely the one he had evacuated into. So on Saturday, at 5am, the family got back into their car and drove the reverse four-hour journey to their home in Miami. They were unpacking when they spoke to the Guardian. “Thousands like us left their homes and went to Naples and Tampa on the west coast,” Esser said. “But within 24 hours everything had changed, which is why we’re back home again. “I feel good about that decision, I think we’ve done the right thing.” • This article was amended on 28 December 2020 because an earlier version mistakenly referred to Miami as the fourth most populous US city.

Jimmy Anderson, fresh from claiming his 500th Test wicket on Friday, completed career-best figures of seven for 42 to bowl out Jason Holder’s tourists for 177. The target of 107 was knocked off with minimal fuss in 28 overs for a nine-wicket win. Thoughts naturally now turn to the tour of Australia with Root saying: “I’m happy with the way the whole group is shaping up. Guys have stepped up and taken their games forward. There’s plenty of challenges ahead but, with those, is a great opportunity. We shouldn’t be afraid of going over there and, if we perform at our best, doing something really special.” While Ben Stokes collected the man of the match for his first-innings six-wicket haul and 60 with the bat, Anderson claimed the series award, and his 39 wickets across the Test summer were the most by an English bowler since Jim Laker’s 46 in 1956. Though his attack leader is 35, Root puts this success down to Anderson’s continuing appetite and skill. Root said: “He’s one of the most skilful bowlers I’ve ever played with. The control he has with a ball that’s doing a minimal amount and one that’s hooping around is remarkable. It’s just relentless pressure for the batters. “He has just shown what he is still capable of and that he is still desperate to kick on and do some more great things.” Despite defeats to South Africa at Trent Bridge in July and West Indies in the second Test at Headingley Root was impressed by the response to both in the two series wins, praising his side’s resilience and character – noting them as two attributes required for an Ashes tour. Speaking to BBC’s Test Match Special, Trevor Bayliss, the head coach, said that the next selection meeting at the end of this month will mean “two or three” positions would be discussed – alluding to those of Tom Westley, Mark Stoneman and Dawid Malan – but said he could not see the panel looking outside players used in the last 12 to 18 months. Westley and Stoneman will be buoyed by their presence at the end of the win, unbeaten on 44 and 40 respectively, with Root saying: “The way they went out there and were ruthless. To show composure and be the two guys not out to win a game for England was great to see and it shows where the mentality of the dressing room is right now.” On England’s catching, which was sub-par all series, resulting in 16 drops in total, Root said: “Especially in Australia, you need to make sure when you create opportunities you take them. So there’ll be a lot of hard work going into that, but it’s not something we’ve shied away from this summer and we’ll continue doing everything we can to take those chances.” Holder highlighted the bowling of Kemar Roach after a first-innings five for 72 and described West Indies’ tour as encouraging for their development overall. Shai Hope, whose twin hundreds in Leeds set up the decider here, was named their man of the series."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"social-care-network/2017/sep/12/reduced-workloads-essential-to-stop-scottish-social-workers-quitting","type":"article","sectionId":"social-care-network","sectionName":"Social Care Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T06:43:28Z","webTitle":"Reduced workloads essential to stop Scottish social workers quitting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2017/sep/12/reduced-workloads-essential-to-stop-scottish-social-workers-quitting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/social-care-network/2017/sep/12/reduced-workloads-essential-to-stop-scottish-social-workers-quitting","fields":{"headline":"Reduced workloads essential to stop Scottish social workers quitting","bodyText":"Attracting people into social work is getting easier in Scotland – but keeping them in the job will be increasingly difficult unless workloads are curbed. This is the mixed picture to emerge from analysis of Scottish results in the latest Guardian survey of the profession, Social Lives 2017, launched in Edinburgh before an audience and expert panel. Structural integration of health and social care in Scotland has presented new opportunities but also challenges for social work, not least in respect of lines of accountability and supervision. Audit Scotland, the official public spending watchdog, has meanwhile warned that social services is “at a watershed” with spending needing to rise by between 16% and 21% by 2020 to meet spiralling demand. Yet council budgets are set to drop in real terms. Susan Taylor, president of Social Work Scotland (SWS), the leadership body for the social work and social care professions, said there was a recognition that things needed to change to reduce demand. “How do we get involved in preventing problems arising in the first place,” she said. “That could mean less dramatic – or traumatic – impact on families all along the line: child poverty, alcohol abuse, domestic violence. If we could intervene earlier, we would not have to wait for social work to get involved.” Shifting the emphasis to prevention will be the focus of a multi-professional summit called by SWS in December to discuss the future of social work and social care in the context of the Audit Scotland report. Taylor said: “We can’t do it ourselves. Everybody has to play a part: police, education, health. Most of the [social work] budget is spent on children at risk. To change that is a challenge.” The Social Lives survey indicates that recruiting social workers in Scotland has become slightly easier – 74% of respondents involved in recruitment finding it difficult to source qualified and experienced staff, compared with 84% in the equivalent survey last year. However, 49% of employer respondents said they were finding it difficult to retain staff, compared to 47% previously. And in line with findings in the rest of the UK, job satisfaction among Scottish social workers is shown to fall with experience: 88% enjoying the job in the first year, but dropping to 84% between one and three years and 73% after 10. More Scots (37%) than English (32%) expressed satisfaction with their work-life balance, but both nations came behind the Welsh (44%). What would it take to keep more Scottish social workers in their posts? Asked what needs to change, 35% of respondents called for lower caseloads and 29% or an end to a culture of long hours. Trisha Hall, manager of the Scottish Association of Social Workers, said: “Workload is not just about caseload. You can be in the Highlands with a far smaller caseload than in the city, but it takes hours to get round them. I know of a case where an authority not far from here announced that contracted hours were going up from 35 to 37. It was a case of, ‘just sign here or you’ll lose £2,000’.” Consistent with results for the UK as a whole, 84% of Scottish respondents said they were proud to be a social worker. But 74% felt undervalued by the public and 90% by the media. Vivienne Cree, professor of social work at Edinburgh University, said: “There is something about social work that always causes a discussion. My mother used to tell people I was a sociologist rather than let on I was a social worker.” Cree compared the modern office environment for many social workers to working in a call centre and having to “hot-desk”. She said: “Now there is nowhere to put a book or a pot plant to mark out their own space.” David Carter, a senior practitioner in child protection in Edinburgh, who works at the city’s Royal Infirmary, said he did still have his own desk. He had never regretted going into social work and was not too embarrassed to admit to his profession at parties. “Grumbling tends to be directed upwards,” Carter said, seeking to explain the levels of dissatisfaction shown by social workers surveyed. “There will be times when they are frustrated by the family they are working with, but their frustration is directed at the process rather than the clients.” Taylor, whose day job is chief social work officer and head of service in East Ayrshire, said: “Let’s not pretend everything was OK before we embarked upon these changes. Open-plan might not be the best plan, but it’s about how you manage it. In my area the compromise was team managers having their own offices, with break rooms and places where you could talk privately. “We would all like a pot plant on the desk to create personal space. The reality is different. The important thing is to support staff to make them feel safe in practice.” Join the Social Care Network for comment, analysis and job opportunities direct to your inbox.

What a comeback: from 957th in the world only five weeks ago to US Open champion today. “If there’s someone I had to lose to today, I’m glad it’s her,” Keys says. “If you told me two months ago I’d be holding a finalist trophy at the US Open, I’d be really happy and proud of myself.” Stephens and Keys, friendly rivals and Fed Cup team-mates, are laughing in their chairs ahead of the trophy ceremony. Lots of flags on the court. Both will speak in a moment. Second set: Keys 3-6, 0-6 Stephens Keys opens with a backhand volley winner, but mixes in another unforced error off the forehand for 15-all. Stephens then overcooks a forehand, but Keys sprays a backhand for 30-all and Stephens is now two points from her maiden grand slam title. Keys misses a backhand and Stephens has championship point, but it’s saved when Stephens nets a forehand from just inside the baseline for deuce, only Stephens’ sixth unforced error on the day. Keys goes long and wide on a backhand again and it’s second championship point for Stephens, but she saves it with a forehand winner for deuce. Stephens goes wide on a backhand late in a rally, but pulls it back to deuce when Keys puts a backhand into the top of the net. Stephens hits a sharp angled volley that Keys can’t return into the court for a third championship point and finally converts it when Keys nets a forehand. The players share a long embrace at the net and shake hands with the chair umpire before Stephens raises her arms to the crowd and takes her bow! Second set: *Keys 3-6, 0-5 Stephens (*denotes next server) Well, it’s not over yet. Stephens serving to effectively finish the match, but makes only her fifth unforced error for love-15. Then a Keys forehand winner followed by another Stephens mishit brings it to love-40 and triple break point for Keys. But Stephens saves all three of them with brio: backhand winner, forehand winner and a forehand volley winner to cap a longest rally of the match so far. The first break points of the match for Keys and they gone just like that. Now another unforced error by Keys, but she responds with a forehand winner for deuce. Now Stephens hits a casual backhand volley winner at the net, followed by a netted backhand by Keys. A hold by Stephens from love-40 down and she’s one game from the title! Second set: Keys 3-6, 0-4 Stephens* (*denotes next server) Danger zone for Madison Keys, who makes another unforced error (her 24th, compared to Stephens’ three) followed by a Stephens backhand winner for love-30. She misses on a forehand late in a rally and it’s triple break point to Stephens again. She saves the first when Stephens misses a backhand and saves the second with a backhand winner. But now she makes a double fault to go down a double break! Oh dear! Second set: *Keys 3-6, 0-3 Stephens (*denotes next server) Keys opens with a backhand winner, but misses on a forehand for 15-all. She then responds with a forehand volley winner, but Stephens answers with a volley winner at the net of her own for 30-all. Two more unforced errors off forehands by Keys gift the hold to Stephens, who consolidates nicely and is halfway to the set and the championship. Second set: Keys 3-6, 0-2 Stephens* (*denotes next server) Keys misses on a pair of backhand volleys at the net for love-30, then Stephens crushes a backhand winner down the line that passes Keys and suddenly she’s got three chances at a break point to take inside track for the title. Keys saves the first with a wicked baseline forehand that Stephens can’t return and the second with a 114mph ace, but Stephens rips a cross-court forehand winner to pass the approaching Keys and secure the early break! Second set: *Keys 3-6, 0-1 Stephens (*denotes next server) Stephens picks up right where she left off in the first set, rattling off two quick points on her serve. But a pair of misfires brings it to 30-all before Keys mixes in yet another unforced forehand error from the baseline. Stephens misses on a forehand for deuce, but a pair of missed backhands by Keys give Stephens the hold. First set: Keys 3-6 Stephens Keys opens with a forehand volley winner, but misses on a backhand for 15-all. Stephens then puts a forehand into the net from the baseline, her first unforced error of the afternoon. But Keys follows with a netted forehand for 30-all. Stephens now two points from the set. Stephens then rips a backhand down the line that Keys can barely get a racket on, giving Stephens a point for the break and the set. Keys saves it when Stephens gets tight on a backhand and dumps it into the net. Deuce. Now Keys crushes a forehand winner from a step inside the baseline that paints the line and sets up game point, but she nets a forehand on the next point for deuce. Another scratchy backhand by Keys gives Stephens another break and set point and this time she converts it when Keys airmails a backhand past the baseline. Sloane Stephens takes the opener! First set: Keys 3-5 Stephens* (*denotes next server) Another easy hold for Stephens. She races to 40-love before Keys hits a pair of forehand winners, the second at the net. But Keys misses on backhand and now she will serve to stay in the first set. Eight games in and Stephens has still yet to make an unforced error. First set: Keys 3-4 Stephens* (*denotes next server) Stephens pounces on a Keys second serve and ends a rally early with a forehand winner down the line. Keys hits a pair of service winners, but then sprays a forehand wide for 30-all. Keys comes to net again and wins the point on a volley winner into the open court, then holds when Stephens sends a forehand into the tramlines. A stress-free hold for the No15 seed, but she’ll need to make some headway on Stephens’ serve if she hopes to salvage this set. First set: *Keys 2-4 Stephens (*denotes next server) Keys misses on another forehand but finally wins a point on Stephens’ serve with a forehand winner for 15-all. Keys then comes to net and hits an angled volley that Stephens can’t return into the court for 15-30. A hint of a chance for Keys, but she follows with two more unforced errors off the forehand, followed by another off the backhand, to give Stephens the hold. First set: Keys 2-3 Stephens* (*denotes next server) Keys opens with a pair of unforced errors off the forehand and suddenly it’s love-30. Stephens is forced into a miss on a backhand, but then Keys mixes in another unforced error and Stephens has a pair of break points. She needs only one when Keys sprays another forehand, giving Stephens the first break of the match. Keys is playing the more aggressive tennis but so far it’s backfired: she’s made seven unforced errors to four winners (compared with zero unforced errors to one winner for Stephens). First set: *Keys 2-2 Stephens (*denotes next server) Keyas makes a pair of errors on Stephens’ serve, then hits a forehand that caroms off the netcord and back into her court for 40-love. A missed backhand by Keys gives the love hold to Stephens, who’s now a perfect eight for eight on service points. First set: Keys 2-1 Stephens* (*denotes next server) Some nervy play from both players early on, but Keys takes control of the game with a sharp forehand winner for 30-15, then forces Stephens to put a backhand then a forehand into the net for the hold. Stephens hasn’t made an unforced error yet, but she’s only hit one winner (compared to four winners and three unforced errors by Keys). First set: *Keys 1-1 Stephens (*denotes next server) Stephens responds with an even quicker hold at love, hitting a nice forehand winner at 15-love and sitting back as Keys makes a few errors on the other points. First set: Keys 1-0 Stephens* (*denotes next server) Keys to serve to open the match. She loses the first point by dumping a forehand into the net early in a rally, but follows with a service winner and aces of 103mph and 111mph. Stephens then misses on a backhand and Keys has the comfortable hold to start. Hello and welcome to Arthur Ashe Stadium for today’s US Open final between Madison Keys and Sloane Stephens. It’s an improbable and to a most improbable tournament, but one thing is certain: the United States is guaranteed a grand slam champion not named Williams for the first time since Andy Roddick in 2003 – and the first on the woman’s side since Jennifer Capriati in 2002. Today’s match represents only the seventh time in the Open era that a grand slam final has featured two first-time major finalists – and only the 10th time a US Open final has featured two Americans. A sold-out crowd of 23,771 is expected at the world’s biggest tennis stadium, where a tribute to Billie Jean King has just concluded and the national anthem is about to be performed. The players should be on court for their warm-ups shortly. Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime, here’s a look at Kevin Mitchell’s lookahead to today’s final."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/09/national-trust-trail-hunting-deep-divide","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T23:05:21Z","webTitle":"Deep divide over vote on  use of National Trust land  for trail hunting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/09/national-trust-trail-hunting-deep-divide","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/09/national-trust-trail-hunting-deep-divide","fields":{"headline":"Deep divide over vote on  use of National Trust land  for trail hunting","bodyText":"The fractious politics of hunting was far from the minds of Julian Smith and Becky Whitehead during a pleasant afternoon exploring Leicestershire’s only National Trust house – a 118-year-old cottage nestled in countryside just out of earshot of the M1. Nevertheless their views were clear, before a landmark vote next month that could prohibit trust land from being used for trail hunting – where riders follow hounds in pursuit of a fox-based scent. “We would be very anti-hunting, to be honest, and very much in favour of the existing government ban on foxhunting,” said Smith, a trust member who had travelled from Nottinghamshire to visit old houses and walk in the Peak District. The forthcoming poll has divided trust members and the annual meeting at which the vote will take place is likely to be stormy. Those behind the motion view trail hunting as a loophole to circumvent the 2004 ban on foxhunting, while campaign groups such as the League Against Cruel Sports claim that 10 years of monitoring show that hunts rarely lay a trail, foxes end up dead and horses “ride roughshod over valuable and often protected land”. “To be honest I would be surprised if the trust let foxhunting happen on their land,” Smith added, “although I have heard that once the hounds get the scent of a fox then there’s no stopping them.” For an organisation already mired in its fair share of other controversies – last month there was a row about staff wearing gay pride badges – the latest is something the trust could have done without. Asked whether hunting took place around Stoneywell, the property at the trust’s Ulverscroft nature reserve, the poker-faced response from a tour guide was: “Foxhunting is illegal.” But trail hunts do take place. Joss Hanbury, the master of one of Britain’s most prestigious hunts, the Quorn, said that riders used the land at least once a month and that an NT ban would “take quite a chunk” of the land used by the hunt. “Our National Trust area is relatively small in comparison to other hunts but it would have quite a big impact on one day a month,” he said, while adding that northern hunts would be more affected. “The Fell hunts are the ones which would be really impacted and some of them would almost have to stop hunting probably.” Hanbury was also critical of recent changes introduced by the National Trust to the way it licenses trail hunts. While the trust’s board is calling on members to vote against the motion to stop trail hunting, the reforms include banning the use of animal-based scents for hounds or beagles to follow. The intention is to reduce the risk of foxes being chased accidentally. “The problem is that hounds have been bred for generations to hunt live prey, in our case foxes, and so it’s difficult to retrain them to hunt something different because of their instincts,” said Hanbury. “They will know the difference between an artificial scent and the real thing, so the closer we get to an animal scent we feel they are more likely to stay on that.” The potential threat to hunting posed by the National Trust vote carries a particular significance for the Quorn hunt, which was founded in 1696 and takes its name from a Leicestershire village. The charity’s president is Prince Charles, who once enjoyed hunting with Hanbury and the Quorn but no longer rides with them. Asked why, Hanbury pauses before replying: “I’m sure he wouldn’t want me to say so but I think age comes into it. Also, he felt that he couldn’t be political and continue hunting even if it was hunting within the law, and so he stopped.” Would Charles have held strong views on the current controversy? “I am sure he does but they are views that he cannot voice.” In the local area there is no shortage of vocal hunt supporters in the affluent community of Woodhouse Eaves. One of the villagers, Diana van Nievelt, used to hunt herself. “I remember going out with the hunt before the ban and it was never about bloodlust or wanting to kill foxes,” she said. “And when they were caught it was so quick.” “The result now of that ending is that you will find people in the countryside here poisoning and trapping foxes in order to keep the population down, which means that they die a most miserable death.” Nevertheless, even here the hunting fraternity has been on the defensive. Permission for the Quorn hunt to pass through the Outwoods – 110 acres of ancient woodland near Woodhouse Eaves, which riders had used as a shortcut while trail hunting – was revoked last year following an intensive campaign. “Opposition has always been strong in Loughborough and Leicester, but I think that things really have been changing in terms of how hunting is viewed even by people in the country villages and towns,” said Christine Harris, a Labour councillor and animal rights activist who had been vice-chair of the woods management committee. “I’ve been doing this for 35 years and when we have taken stalls to places like Oakham and even Melton, where they have the hunting museum, we have always had a good turnout. “Eastern Leicestershire might be a little bit different but even there you will find farmers who do not want hunting to take place, although some feel they cannot say so.” Back in Woodhouse Eaves meanwhile, the differing views among National Trust members were illustrated by Sue Gyles, who had journeyed from Nottinghamshire with her friend Susan Sullivan to ramble through a forest trail. “I would probably vote for the status quo,” she said, when asked about her thoughts on whether hunts should be allowed to continue trail hunting on trust land. “Some people will make a fuss out of anything and there has been a tendency for everything to have to be so PC these days. In fact, I remember coming across a hunt some time ago and the horses were all around us. It was lovely.” That said, she chuckled at the very different view taken by another fellow trust member, her late husband: “He said that he didn’t want to pay and it was because he was very opposed to hunting.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/live/2017/sep/09/strictly-come-dancing-2017-the-launch-night-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T19:41:02Z","webTitle":"Strictly Come Dancing 2017: the launch night – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/live/2017/sep/09/strictly-come-dancing-2017-the-launch-night-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/live/2017/sep/09/strictly-come-dancing-2017-the-launch-night-live","fields":{"headline":"Strictly Come Dancing 2017: the launch night – as it happened","bodyText":"So that was the first instalment. There might not have been any big stars, but there was charm, glitter and great moves by the bucketful. Thanks very much for joining me. Here’s a final thought from sojomo. So judging by the group dance to Kenny Loggins’s Footloose, Chizzy is a useful mover, Debbie McGee can dance, Charlotte Hawkins has all the animation of a fossil and the hip-thrusting Rev is this year’s Ed Balls. So that’s it, everyone’s paired off and Strictly 2017 can commence. Bruno is asked for his verdict and says it will either be “ecstasy or shock horror”. Channeling RuPaul’s Drag Race, with a BBC-friendly spin, Craig advises the couples in the group dance, “Don’t mess it up”. Joe McFadden is paired with Russian raver Katya Jones. Jonnie gets South African sizzler Oti Mabuse. And Brian Conley gets Welsh waltzer Amy Dowden. Brian’s Mr Saturday Night routine could do with turning down a notch or two IMO ... We’re meeting the final three contestants: Joe McFadden first, whose modest aim is “moves I can bust out at parties”. Then is Paralympian Jonnie Peacock, who lost a leg aged five, but is unlikely to let even that deter him from expert hoofing. And then there’s Bradley Walsh, who says that whatever happens, “it is gonna be entertaining”. Now we’re at the Strictly Boot Camp and Simon Rimmer looks like he couldn’t cut a rug if you gave him a pair of shears and directed him to Carpet World. I didn’t enjoy Rita’s song as much as the pictures of her emerging from the GQ Awards this week in a tired and emotional state. Craig’s pick for success is Mollie, thanks to the “twerking she did on the red carpet.” Now we’ve got Rita Ora covering a song by Avicii - what a time to be alive as the youth would say. Susan has a poster of Kevin on her fridge, claims Claudia, “laminated”. She then suggests that he moves in with Susan, her wife and their five cats. Sounds like a plan. Which leaves a hyperventilating Alexandra Burke paired up with the superbly named Gorka Marquez. Susan Calman is is glamorous in purple and dramatic eyeshadow. She’s paired with Grimsby groover Kevin Clifton – and it sends her dissolving into tears - aww ... In a partner, Mollie is looking for “anyone who’ll have me.” She gets AJ Pritchard, who looks about 10 but is apparently 21, and from Stoke-on-Trent. They’re getting partnered up. Charlotte has been up since 3am thanks to her job on Good Morning Britain. She’s paired off with Brendan Cole, which has to be an upgrade from the man she usually shares a sofa with – Piers Morgan. Back to the contestants. Charlotte Hawkins “can’t wait to be Strictlyfied.” Mollie King from the Saturdays sounds posher than the Queen. And Susan Calman says “there is nothing in this world I have wanted more than to be on Strictly. She adds that she hasn’t worn a dress since she was 17 or danced with a man for over a decade. If she goes all the way it will be magnificent. Alexandra Burke, meanwhile, has been hoofing in Sister Act but says her dance experience is “very little” – hmm ... “It’s incredibly hard to think that he’s not around ... but I bet he’s watching,” concludes Darcey. Then there’s a rather beautiful ballroom routine to Fly Me to the Moon. “What a routine, he would have loved that,” says Tess, who is visibly choked up. “Didn’t he do well?” Tess remembers that Bruce Forsyth allayed her early nerves by saying “Just walk towards me, darling, and I’ll give you a little twirl.” You can just imagine it, can’t you? We also get a good airing of one of his many catchphrases, “You’re my favourite”. Reigning champion Ore Oduba and Joanne Clifton return to reprise their jive to Bruno Mars’s Runaway Baby. It’s crisp, sharp and sensational – something to aim at for this year’s crop. Tess says it’s Joanne’s last appearance – she’s off (he says, googling) to be a West End star. After all that action, we’ve got Shania Twain taking to the podium to perform her new number Life’s About to Get Good. It’s 15 - 15! - years since she last put out an album. Diane’s “truly blessed” to be partnered with the Rev. Given that their union prompted a blast of the Hallelujah chorus from the Beeb, expect the religious gags to wear mighty thin between now and Christmas. Simon’s with Karen Clifton, the Venezuelan hoofer, and says he’s looking forward to being slagged off by Craig. Gavood has got Nadia Bychkova, who is already exciting the tabloids as she once posed for Playboy. Gavood is frequently naked in EastEnders, so they’ve got a propensity to disrobe in common. Early candidates for the Strictly curse? “God moves in mysterious ways, will you?” asks Tess of Richard Coles, who says “it’s more of a spasm”. He’s partnered with flame-haired Diane. “Craig’s giving me the evilest look right now,” says Aston. “That’s just Craig’s resting face” zings Tess. Aston is partnered with Janette Manrara. She’s height-appropriate, so Aston’s happy. Davood Ghadami from Eastenders is ripped af isn’t he? This doesn’t necessarily translate on the dancefloor, though he’ll certainly manage to carry off the glittery shirt. Simon Rimmer, meanwhile, calls himself a “lumbering 54-year-old bloke who might come out with a new skill”. Good attitude. Here come the blokes. Aston Merrygold wants a partner who’s short, a “towering Amazon might be quite good for me but not so much for the judges”. He acknowledges that he danced professionally in JLS, but that it was mainly backflips. Richard Coles, meanwhile, offers to unleash the “lord of the dance within”. Controversy breaking out BTL over Claudia’s frock: Wow, the pros are doing a routine that involves the women being spun around like catherine wheels in mid air, before they descend on green drapes to the strains of Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It). Susan Calman’s now talking about the dancer she wants to partner, who she “loves slightly more than my wife”. There has been some minor controversy about the fact that she’s dancing with a male partner. I guess this passes for controversy if you don’t get out that much. Shirley sounds a bit like Sharon Osborne doesn’t she? She’s taking us through her illustrious dancing career. “You really have spent a lifetime on the dancefloor,” says Tess. We’ve all had nights out that felt like that. She’s after top-notch technique and claims to be stricter than acid-tongued Aussie Craig Revel Horwood which could make for a rather spicy Saturday evening. tinyismynewt has a question: My far from expert view is that they both look spiffing. Ruth Langsford doesn’t fear the curse of Strictly – she hopes her husband and co-presenter Eamonn Holmes gets “horribly jealous” by her dancing partner. This turns out to be Anton Du Beke ... so maybe not so much. Chizzy has landed Strictly stalwart Pasha Kovalev, the Siberian, er, slider. Debbie McGee, meanwhile, has landed Giovanni Pernice, the Sicilian stomper. Which dancer would she like to partner? “I’ll take any,” says Gemma with admirable lack of fussiness. She’s ended up with Aljaž Skorjanec. Debbie McGee reckons she’ll be best at the Latin numbers – no doubt seen-it-all Shirley will have something to say about that. Chizzy can do the electric slide, aka the dance you do at weddings when three sheets to the wind. Ruth Langsford says she’s a blank canvas, ready to be transformed. And the first dancer is Gemma Atkinson, drawing the short straw. Shirley speaks! To make a winner, she says, takes tenacity and “creativity outside the box”. She’s seen it all when it comes to dancing, she reckons – although we all thought that before we saw Katya Jones riding Ed Balls like a crazed bull (or was it the other way round)? Aaand here come the contenders, descending the staircase onto the dancefloor. Who will be the one who really can’t dance at all ie the Ed Balls? Maybe Richard Coles, who has pimped up his shirt front/cassock, if that’s not an inappropriate expression for a man of the cloth, with some glitter. Tess and Claudia are looking glamorous – of course – in midnight blue. They kick off by paying tribute to the late Bruce Forsyth. We’ve also got Shania Twain and Rita Ora coming up, along with a jive from last year’s winners. If that’s not a recipe for a great Saturday night, what is? Here come the professionals on an enormous red-carpeted dancefloor doing an old-school Hollywood number with enormous white fans, sparkly gowns and elbow-length gloves. Then we cut to that famous shiny-floored studio and the BBC’s band parping out Daft Punk’s Get Lucky as the pros perform further expert gyrations. And here come the judges throwing a few shapes, with Shirley shimmying onto the set in a flaming red dress. Tess and Claudia kick us off with a skit in which they’re receptionists in the dear old BBC, admitting the dancers, the judges, Shirley Ballas the new judge (whose face we haven’t seen yet, but who seems to have va-va-voom in spades), and workmen carrying two vats of fake tan and a wheelbarrowful of glitter. It’s witty, tongue in cheek and very Strictly. In the comments, davidargile is setting the mood admirably. It’s the high point of the light entertainment calendar – a whole new series of Strictly. Last year brought us the unforgettable spectacle of Ed Balls doing the salsa to Gangnam Style – and in the process, completely rehabilitating himself in the eyes of the great British public. It’s a bit more difficult to see who will generate the watercooler moments this year since, as many people have pointed out, the contestants aren’t exactly A-list. We’ve got not one, but two cast members from Holby City (Joe McFadden and Chizzy Akudolu); a brace of former X Factor contestants (Alexandra Burke and Aston Merrygold from JLS); another pair from morning telly (Ruth Langsford and Charlotte Hawkins); and Mollie King from the Saturdays – the third person from the band to do Strictly (she was in the X Factor as well). I can imagine the cloud of dust being blown off an old showbiz Rolodex in order to book Debbie McGee and Brian Conley. The wild card is the Reverend Richard Coles, Communard turned clergyman, who has national treasure status in his sights if he plays this one properly – as does the diminutive comic Susan Calman. So why have actual famous people fought shy of Strictly this year? Tom Harrington, a TV research analyst, puts it in blunt terms in a story from the Guardian today: “It’s hard for husbands or wives to go on the show because they always run off with the dancer.” In other words, the famous curse of Strictly, which the Sun calculates has killed off 13 relationships, the most recent being the 18-year marriage of Louise and Jamie Redknapp. There’s more drama over on the judges’ table, with Shirley Ballas replacing Len “pickle me walnuts” Goodman as head honcho. Known as the Queen of Latin, and with a trophy cabinet groaning with gongs from her career as a professional dancer, what she doesn’t know about the cha-cha-cha probably isn’t worth knowing. Len, meanwhile, has sailed off into the sunset – or rather, is devoting himself to his somewhat more lucrative gig as judge on Strictly’s American equivalent, Dancing With the Stars. Bruno Tonioli also serves as a judge on the show, which is filmed in LA. OK, they won’t exactly be doing it on Ryanair, but even so I wouldn’t fancy doing that flight twice a week. So who am I to be liveblogging Strictly like some kind of self-styled expert, you might ask – and you’d be right. I was living abroad between 2013 and late last year, meaning that the last time I saw a full series of Strictly, Bruce Forsyth was presenting it. Naturally, there will be a tribute to that legend of showbiz on the show tonight, conveyed through the medium of dance. In other words, the dancers will strike Brucey’s famous “Thinker” pose. If that’s the extent of the tribute, don’t make a cup of tea – or even blink – for fear of missing it. Back to my relationship with Strictly. It was long and passionate, then we went on a break, but I’m hoping the magic will return tonight. Do join me in the comments, or on twitter @alexneedham74. You can even email me if you’re feeling that strongly – alex.needham@theguardian.com. The show starts at 7pm on BBC1. In the meantime, here’s an old Strictly clip that brings me deep and inexplicable joy – Gethin Jones casting off his inhibitions to jive to Amy Stewart’s Knock on Wood a full 10 – 10! – years ago."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/09/hurricane-irma-florida-evacuates-storm","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T23:06:34Z","webTitle":"Millions flee from Hurricane Irma's path as Florida prepares for deadly hit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/09/hurricane-irma-florida-evacuates-storm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/09/hurricane-irma-florida-evacuates-storm","fields":{"headline":"Millions flee from Hurricane Irma's path as Florida prepares for deadly hit","bodyText":"More than 7 million people evacuated from the path of Hurricane Irma on Saturday as one the most powerful storms in history lined up a potentially catastrophic strike on Florida. Slightly weakened after hitting Cuba but still packing an enormously powerful punch, effects of the storm that has claimed more than 20 lives during a week-long 185mph rampage across the Caribbean reached deep into the Sunshine State by late afternoon. The centre of the category 4 storm was predicted to make landfall in the Florida Keys, the vulnerable low-lying island chain off the state’s southern coast, in the early hours of Sunday. But the outer bands of a storm that Florida governor Rick Scott warned was “wider than the entire state” lashed coastal and inland areas through the day, sparking tornado warnings and widespread loss of power. At an early evening briefing, Scott said: “If you’re in an area that was told to evacuate, you need to leave now. This is your last chance to make a good decision.” He added: “Millions of Floridians will see life-threatening winds beginning tonight,” with the “significant threat of serious storm surge along the whole west coast of Florida.” A storm surge of 15ft would be “devastating and will cover your house”, Scott said. “Do not think the storm is over when the wind slows down. The storm surge will rush in and it could kill you.” Scott recalled a storm some years ago that brought 6ft storm surges into Naples, on the west coast, and the breathtaking speed of the water that crashed into homes. It was hard to describe, he said, “how fast the water moved in and how fast the water moved out”. “That was six feet,” he said. “You just think about – how can anybody survive this stuff? I just want everybody to live.” The projected track of Irma took it up the west coast of Florida during Sunday and in line for a direct hit on the 3 million residents of the Tampa Bay area early on Monday, still as a major hurricane with sustained winds of greater than 140mph. A tornado watch was issued for all of southern Florida. Radar images of Irma over Cuba’s northern coast showed that the storm’s core had been disrupted by its interaction with land, raising hopes its power could be diminished. But later data showed it regaining shape as it moved back into the warm, open waters of the Florida Straits. “We’re concerned that as it eases away from Cuba it will strengthen again,” said Max Mayfield, a former director of the National Hurricane Center (NHC). “The core of the hurricane, where the really devastating winds are going to be, is going to move right over the lower Florida Keys early tomorrow morning, and then likely another landfall somewhere on the south-west Florida coast.” The restrengthening was confirmed by the NHC’s late-afternoon advisory, which forecast a category 4 hurricane at landfall. The agency had earlier adjusted the projected track of Irma’s centre further west, away from Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach in the south east, home to more than 6 million people. But NHC specialist Lixion Avila warned that hurricane force winds stretched more than 70 miles from Irma’s centre and that no part of Florida was out of danger. “There is an imminent danger of life-threatening storm surge flooding in portions of central and southern Florida, including the Florida Keys,” he said. “Irma is expected to bring life-threatening wind and storm surge to the Florida Keys and south-western Florida as an extremely dangerous major hurricane.” All but deserted from a mandatory evacuation order, the near sea-level Florida Keys island chain was expected to be inundated by up to 15ft of water. Officials reported that the mass evacuation of millions of residents of coastal and vulnerable areas close to inland water had mostly gone smoothly, despite shortages of fuel and gridlock on major highways. “Very few cars are out there, citizens have taken evacuation warnings very seriously, our shelters are beginning to get full,” said Scott Israel, sheriff of Broward County, where a 4pm curfew was ordered. By late afternoon, however, the northbound I-75 near Ocala was gridlocked. Further north in Georgia, another half-million residents were told to evacuate. Although Irma is forecast to weaken as it travels north over land, authorities in Georgia and Alabama urged residents to be on alert for heavy rains, wind and flooding as early as Monday. Across Florida, close to 100,000 customers had lost power by late Saturday, most of them in Miami-Dade and Broward counties. Crews worked to restore about half of them before strengthening winds made it too dangerous to work. The number of outages was expected to grow. In Miami-Dade county, almost 50,000 were without power. Carlos Gimenez, the mayor, said: “There have been rumours about Miami-Dade being in the clear, being safe. Let me make this clear, Miami-Dade is still being affected by Irma and there are already reports of hurricane force gusts. A serious storm is coming our way and will be here through Sunday.” In Miami, the streets were virtually empty by Saturday morning, with all petrol stations, supermarkets and other commercial outlets closed. The city was in a state of foreboding, waiting to find out what nature had in store. In St Petersburg, near Tampa, shelves were bare of essentials – bleach, soup, beans and bread. In one branch of the Publix supermarket, deliveries of ice were announced on a loud speaker with a two-bag maximum per person. Cases of water were also limited to two per person. Every shopper had water. Nearly all had beer. As the storm approached, people on the western edge of the bay in Pinellas County scrambled to get ready for likely 110mph sustained winds. “We’ve been having press conferences two or three times a day trying to get people informed, to get them to evacuate,” said Pat Gerard, a county commissioner. “Of course they’re not doing it, but it’s just what they do.” The last seriously destructive storm to hit Tampa Bay was in 1921, a category 3 hurricane that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) called the “forgotten nightmare”. Around the county, many said they were making last-minute preparations to for the storm. Putting plywood on windows, charging phones, stocking propane, gas, water and food. Irma claimed its first fatality in Florida on Friday when a 57-year-old man fell attempting to put up hurricane shutters on a second-story window. Late on Saturday Donald Trump issued a video of his remarks at a cabinet meeting at Camp David, in Maryland. “This is a storm of enormous destructive power,” the president tweeted. “I ask everyone in the storm’s path to heed ALL instructions from government officials.” In the morning, Governor Scott said he had “talked to President Trump, he has promised all federal resources [and] I’ve talked to Brock Long, who runs [the Federal Emergency Management Agency], this morning, and he’s guaranteed us all federal resources. “Florida’s tough, Florida’s resilient and Florida’s unbreakable. This is a great state and we’re going to come out of this very strong.” The foreign office has a hotline for Britons affected by Hurricane Irma in the United States and the Caribbean: +44 207 008 0000"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/sep/10/kevin-anderson-rafael-nadal-us-open-final","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T11:00:35Z","webTitle":"Kevin Anderson aims to serve up a surprise for Rafael Nadal in US Open final","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/10/kevin-anderson-rafael-nadal-us-open-final","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/10/kevin-anderson-rafael-nadal-us-open-final","fields":{"headline":"Kevin Anderson aims to serve up surprise for Rafael Nadal in US Open final","bodyText":"If Rafael Nadal is to win his third US Open here on Sunday afternoon – which seems likely after his merciless crushing of Juan Martín del Potro – he will have to nullify the awesome serve of Kevin Anderson, the South African appearing in his first slam final at the 34th attempt. The Spaniard has been to this stage of tournaments 108 times previously, 22 of them in majors, in his trophy-heavy career. It is where he has played the overwhelming majority of his best tennis, in big-stage showdowns with Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray. Only rarely does he falter near the end of a slam fortnight; indeed, his win over Del Potro on Friday night was his 15th in a row in a slam semi. The locker-room mantra has always been, if you are going to get him, get him early. It may be that Anderson is getting him too late, in every sense. The South African is 31 and, for all his best efforts, there is a reason other than injury and bad luck that he is ranked No32 in the world while Nadal is No1, even though there is only 16 days between them in age. He has a considerable deficit in pure skill to overcome. Nadal repeated his philosophy before the match: “For me, more than winning grand slams or not – of course, if I win, I will be more happy – but is about being healthy, and feel myself well and competitive.” That is all well and good in a press conference. On court Nadal turns into the most competitive, intense animal on the Tour. But Anderson has that serve. And what a weapon it is. He goes into the biggest match of his life with 114 aces for the fortnight, 28 more than the next best, Sam Querrey. He has won a phenomenal 336 points on first serve, 83%. On second serve, where a lot of matches are won, he is tied for eighth place, winning 57%. And 48% of his serves overall have been unreturnable. Countering such a blizzard of numbers, however, Nadal gets 74% of his service returns in, winning the point 40% of the time on first serve and 55% on second serve. There are not many better defenders in the game. Nobody here in the past two weeks won more points from the baseline than Nadal – 58%, 10% more than Anderson. If they get into a slugging match, there will only be one winner and he will not come from Johannesburg. Nevertheless, Anderson deserves to be here. He came through the weakest side of a draw that any experienced observer could recall in a slam. It was to be Andy Murray’s half, but he pulled out just after the draw was made and chaos ensued, as Federer remained on Nadal’s side of the lottery. As it happened, they did not meet in the semi-finals, because Del Potro stopped Federer in the quarters. Anderson played his part perfectly, finding his best tennis to beat Pablo Carreño Busta in four sets on Friday. He said he was going to celebrate because it meant so much to him to get even this far, but he will be up for the fight. It is second nature to him. A year ago, a hip injury nearly ended his career – or at least might have taken a full year out of it. Murray, who also contemplated surgery but decided against it, might take heart from the big man’s experience. Anderson, the first South African in the final here since Cliff Drysdale lost to Manuel Santana on the grass of Forest Hills in 1965, could hardly stop smiling after winning his semi-final in just under three hours, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3, 6-4. “I will be playing for a grand slam trophy,” he said, incredulously. “That’s an amazing feeling. I have to get ready, but right now I’m just trying to unwind a little bit and enjoy it.” He said of his injury woes in 2016: “There were a couple that definitely forced me away from the Tour, but there were a few that were constantly nagging injuries. Towards the end of the year, my hip really played up, and that was probably the most severe injury. It seemed like surgery was maybe even on the table. I was fortunate to have escaped that whole thing.” And he sent out a message to Murray to call him if he wants to talk about hip injuries. “It was diagnosed as a labrum tear. I spoke to several doctors. It’s a tricky injury. If anybody has labrum issues, they’d like to talk to me about it, feel free. I learned a lot about it. After speaking to a lot of people who had similar issues, surgery is always a last resort. I was fortunate enough to be acquainted with some very good physios who thought I could beat it without getting surgery. “It took a lot of work, several hours a day over almost two months. Even after that, there was another couple months of rehab. I feel the biggest plus is when all the work you do really pays off, where surgery just becomes a whole different ball game. It’s something I was fortunate to avoid.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/09/changing-nappies-not-best-guide-to-being-good-father","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T23:05:21Z","webTitle":"Changing nappies is not the best guide to being a good father | Vanessa Thorpe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/09/changing-nappies-not-best-guide-to-being-good-father","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/09/changing-nappies-not-best-guide-to-being-good-father","fields":{"headline":"Changing nappies is not the best guide to being a good father","bodyText":"Who out there wants to be a “deadbeat dad”? No takers? If you put aside the fact this insult is pleasantly alliterative and rather quaint, it is clearly not a good thing to be called. When Harriet Harman used the term to urge the fathers of Britain to change more nappies last week she put the fear of god into them by pointing at Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory MP and father of six who has just admitted that, among other stone-aged attitudes, he does not see a dirty nappy as his problem. For around 40 years, a readiness to change one has been a measure of the modern British man. In other words, since about the time it became a lot easier to do so. And for around two decades it has actually been up there with other macho-rated, but frankly routine, domestic duties, such as mowing the lawn or putting out the bins. As a result, it was no great shame on Philip May when he jokingly confessed to being under the thumb of his wife, the PM, on TV. He was, after all, a real man, prepared to tackle grubby bins on a weekly basis. Harman, a pioneer of breastfeeding within the Palace of Westminster, clearly knows her changing bag from her Chiltern Hundreds, but she is wrong to see nappy skills as the true marker of a modern dad. Studies show that while in the early 1980s a whopping 40% of men never changed their baby, that figure is now vanishingly small. We have moved on, praise be, since the days when filmstars Tom Selleck and Steve Guttenberg could hope to appear adorably daft with a packet of Pampers in the 1987 hit Three Men and a Baby. Today, it is pretty much only Rees-Mogg and Simon Cowell, that unlikely duo, who can tease the public with admissions of reactionary naughtiness. For most new fathers, such as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who says he can process a baby bottom in 20 seconds, the job has simply joined the list of household chores they can do better than women, should they deign to focus. Sure enough, a recent supermarket survey judged that fathers were faster and more efficient at the task than mothers, because they apparently treat it “like a Formula One pitstop”. As most parents of either gender understand only too well, the real domestic challenge lies in the less satisfying work of consistently tidying and planning ahead, let alone remembering to play with your baby. A commitment to the boring work of sorting washed socks would be my personal benchmark, but there are others, possibly like knowing without looking what is in the fridge at any given moment. If the burden of regular nappy changing is not yet quite equally borne, it is not all men’s fault either. As the campaigner and father of three, Al Ferguson, has noted, few men’s loos are yet fitted with changing tables. Nappies also remain, to a great extent, a class issue, as Rees-Mogg typically and helpfully highlighted when he said he did not believe that “Nanny” would approve of any attempt he might make at the job. It is possible that a nanny, rather than Mrs Rees-Mogg, is the real dab hand with the baby wipes in their home. If so, some might wish the nanny was closer to the levers of power than either parent."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/live/2017/sep/09/premier-league-stoke-city-v-manchester-united-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T18:28:36Z","webTitle":"Premier League: Stoke City 2-2 Manchester United – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/sep/09/premier-league-stoke-city-v-manchester-united-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/sep/09/premier-league-stoke-city-v-manchester-united-live","fields":{"headline":"Premier League: Stoke City 2-2 Manchester United – as it happened","bodyText":"And that’s that! A wonderfully entertaining game ends with the spoils shared. It’s a fair result, because both teams sparkled in attack, going for it pretty much from the get-go. Stoke move into the top half of the table with that point, while United reclaim top spot on goal difference over their neighbours Manchester City. 90 min +4: A bit of head tennis on the edge of the Stoke area. Pogba tries to Mark Hughes a spectacular bicycle kick home from 12 yards. It’s high and wide. 90 min +3: Diouf takes possession of the drop ball at the restart, and delivers it back to Manchester United, who were on the attack. On the touchline, Mourinho applauds the sportsmanship. 90 min +2: ... the ball’s swung deep, flicked on by Jones. With Pogba lurking, Zouma deflects the ball towards the bottom left. It’s going in, but Butland parries it with a strong hand! A fine save! Zouma clears, and then play’s stopped for a head injury to Wimmer. 90 min +1: United are pinning Stoke back. It’s the way they’ve rolled historically. Jones bustles down the right and earns a corner. In it goes, and ... 90 min: Lukaku blooters the set piece straight into the wall. That wasn’t very good. There will be three added minutes. 89 min: Matic rakes a long pass down the middle. Stoke don’t really deal with it, and the ball breaks wide right for Mata, who looks to return it inside for Lingard. But Butland smothers the cross. United come again, though, Martial switching the ball from the left to the right. Mata picks up possession, and is clumsily clattered to the ground by Allen, just to the right of the D. A free kick in a very dangerous position! 87 min: Zouma is upended by Martial as he zips down the right. Shaqiri’s free kick is a bit better this time, but not much, and Valencia clears easily enough from a tight spot out on the Stoke left. 86 min: There’s been some handbags between the managers on the touchline, incidentally, Mourinho encroaching into Hughes’s technical area, and receiving a light go-away shove in the chest as a result. Nothing particularly serious, to be honest, all part of the pantomime. 84 min: Before the corner can be taken, Lingard comes on for Mkhitaryan. Then the set piece, which leads to Darmian converting in the rugby style. 83 min: Shaqiri curls a dreadful effort into the arms of De Gea. United scoot up the other end, Mata crossing dangerously from the left. Allen, tracking back, is forced to head behind at the expense of a corner. 82 min: Pogba shoves Allen over in the playground style, as the Stoke man scuttles down the right. A free kick, and a chance to load the box. 81 min: Martial turns on the jets and makes space down the right. He curls a stunning low cross into the area. The ball sits up on a plate for Lukaku, six yards out. He must score, but leans back and shins it over the crossbar. What a chance! 79 min: United spend a little time hovering on the front edge of Stoke’s final third, but the home side hold their shape and there’s no space for the visitors to break through. 77 min: Berahino, Zouma and Shaqiri take turns to annoy Bailly on the edge of the United area. Bailly has the opportunity to clear, but doesn’t, and eventually concedes a corner. Shaqiri takes, and attempts to catch De Gea out with a cheeky curler towards his near post. For a second it looks like flying in, but ripples the side netting instead. 76 min: Pogba makes a little space for himself 30 yards out with a cute drop of the shoulder, before sending a pea-roller straight at Butland. 75 min: Jese is replaced by Saido Berahino. 74 min: Mata’s first act is to drop deep on the right and look for his fellow sub Martial with a curling cross into the area. There’s too much weight on the ball and Butland claims with ease. 72 min: A double change by Manchester United. Juan Mata and Anthony Martial come on for Marcus Rashford and Ander Herrera. 70 min: Choupo-Moting is brimful of confidence. He shimmies in from the left and has a whack from 25 yards. The effort flies well wide left. United counter through Lukaku, who attempts to find Rashford in the middle with a dinked cross from the right. Butland reads and snaffles. 68 min: Some good work by Choupo-Moting, who rides a couple of weak United tackles in the middle of the park before swinging the ball wide right for Jese. The resulting cross back into the area is overcooked, but Stoke have their tails up once more. 67 min: One corner leads to another. Butland punches the second miles clear. Valencia tries to return it with extreme prejudice, shooting low for the bottom left from 25 yards. It’s just wide. This match is great fun. 65 min: United come straight back at Stoke, Valencia, Matic and Pogba busying themselves down the right. Eventually Pogba breaks into a bit of space and smacks a shot goalwards from a tight angle. Butland does very well to turn the ball round the post for a corner. So this starts with a wonder save by David de Gea! Pieters hooks a cross in from the left. Jese meets it, flashing a shot from the corner of the six-yard box. It has to go in, but De Gea somehow fingertips it over! What reactions! And what a futile effort, because the resulting corner, coming in from the right, is hit long, missed by Jones, and Choupo-Moting rises to slam a simple header into the top left from close range! Both teams have taken turns to give up a lead in short order! 61 min: Bailly plays a quick ball forward from deep. Mkhitaryan spins and shuttles it further down the inside-right channel, releasing Rashford on goal. But the flag goes up. The Stoke fans cheer ironically, presumably convinced Lukaku was offside for United’s second goal. But both decisions have been correct. 59 min: Jese’s over-elaboration on the Stoke counter really cost his team there. Harsh to say, because he had eaten up half of the pitch with a marvellous run upfield. But he dillied and dallied with options either side, was stripped of possession, and United showed him how to counter in the fuss-free style. Rashford pops up on the right and earns a corner. Once again, United let Stoke stream upfield from their set piece. Jese makes good down the right. But he runs out of steam, and is stripped of the ball. United counter the counter. Mkhitaryan chips a clever pass down the middle to bust Lukaku clear. Lukaku’s first shot is parried brilliantly by Butland, but he picks up the rebound and knocks it home! 55 min: So having said that, the game suddenly turns a little scrappy. But out of a midfield nonsense, Allen bursts down the middle with the ball and slips it forward and right to Jese, who threatens to break into the box and shoot. Darmian comes across to cover brilliantly. 53 min: This is a free-flowing, open game, and both sides appear hell bent on attack. Surely there will be another goal, though good luck calling the team to score it. 51 min: Pogba shovels a pass down the inside-right channel to release Mkhitaryan into space. Mkhitaryan chests down and lashes a low shot goalwards. Butland kicks clear, and it turns out the United midfielder’s offside anyway. 49 min: Now it’s Stoke’s turn to earn a corner, Allen setting Pieters away down the left with a fine crossfield pass. Pieters crosses deep, forcing Darmian to head behind. Choupo-Moting attempts to chest the set piece down in the six-yard box, but the ball doesn’t fall for a shot and United clear. 48 min: ... another corner’s won. The second is half cleared, though Pogba is given time and chance to shoot from 25 yards. His effort goes straight down Butland’s throat. 47 min: Pogba blasts through a couple of challenges in the midfield and sets Rashford off down the inside left. The striker looks to curl one into the top right, but Zouma blocks. United come again, though winning a corner down the right. From which ... Here we go again! Bruno Martins-Indi comes on for Geoff Cameron, who has picked up a knock. United get the ball rolling for the second half. Shameless half-time plug. I’ve got a new book out. I know, I know, but a man needs to eat, and anyone interested in the history of English football before the Premier League circus came to town could do worse. An oblique nod to Abbott and Costello, it’s called The Title, and contents include: Stanley Matthews throwing a diva fit; Terry Venables and George Graham’s late-night casino shame; the trenchant political analysis of erstwhile Leeds full back Bert Sproston; and a qualified doctor green-flagging a pre-match booze-and-fags frenzy at the Arsenal. Enjoy! A lively end-to-end half which promised goals, and ultimately delivered. Stoke will be fuming, having given up their lead after a couple of minutes, but the scoreline seems about right. It’s been entertaining. More to come! Mkhitaryan loops the ball to the near post. Matic rises and flicks on. Pogba flashes a header goalwards from six yards. The ball takes a deflection off Rashford, and flies into the top right! Pogba celebrates the goal, and Rashford doesn’t claim it, but it’s surely Rashford’s goal. 45 min: United try to respond immediately, Darmian winning a corner off Diouf down the left. And from the set piece... United win a corner, but do nothing with it, and Stoke stream upfield. After a few patient passes hither and yon, Fletcher, on the left, sprays a magnificent ball towards Diouf on the opposite flank. Diouf is in plenty of space, and he flashes a wonderful cross towards Choupo-Moting, who hammers a sidefoot home from six yards! United finally concede a Premier League goal this season, and it’s a peach! 41 min: Some fine pressing at high speed down the Stoke left by Allen and Choupo-Moting. Lukaku caught sleeping. Shakiri is eventually sent scampering down the touchline, but his ball inside is aimless and United break upfield, very nearly releasing Rashford on goal. Not quite. 39 min: Some head tennis along the front of the United area. The ball drops to the feet of Choupo-Moting, who tries to release Jese into the box with a cheeky backheel. He doesn’t connect properly, but full marks for ambition. That’s a rare sortie into opposition territory for the hosts, though. After a promising start, they’ve retreated into their shell somewhat. 38 min: Another free kick for United out on the right, Fletcher again the culprit. Matic’s delivery is appalling, with the box loaded. It was nowhere near to beating the first man. Stoke hack clear. 36 min: It’s gone slightly flat. Stoke are doing nothing in attack. United are dominating possession, but are happy to play a patient game, stroking it around in the middle of the park quite a lot. 34 min: United are beginning to turn the pressure up a little bit. More joy for Valencia down the right. He’s in loads of space, but opts to shoot from a tight angle. Marco van Basten would have thought twice from there. 6 am, Saturday 27 January 1973. The BT Sport clock has now disappeared totally, and I’m not sure if it will ever return. We know exactly where we all are, though, don’t you fret. 31 min: Valencia tears off down the right, exchanges a one-two with Lukaku, and fizzes a dangerous low ball towards Rashford at the near post. Zouma hacks it behind for a corner that results in Matic’s wild shot from distance. Zouma’s intervention wasn’t far away from an own goal, incidentally; the Stoke fans certainly had their hearts in their mouths as he flashed that one away. 30 min: Shaqiri, his dander up, has another go from 25 yards out on the left. It’s a rising diagonal effort which looks on target for the top right, but De Gea is behind it all the way and holds on spectacularly. This match is threatening to turn into an entertaining affair. Just not quite yet. On another day, though, there would have been goals already. It’s not been for the want of both teams trying. 28 min: Good work by Allen and Diouf down the right, some crisp passing. They set up Shaqiri, to the right of the United D. Shaqiri has a dig towards the bottom right. It’s a fast bobbling effort which De Gea does extremely well to collect. And there’s more quality goalkeeping up the other end as United attack through Rashford down the inside-left. A strong hand palms the shot away from the bottom right. Lukaku, looking to pick up the pieces, is flagged offside. 26 min: Shaqiri hoicks a long ball down the inside-right channel with a view to releasing Jese. A little too much on the pass, and De Gea is able to collect. 24 min: Bailly, quarterbacking from deep, slips a stunning pass down the inside-right channel to release Rashford. The striker enters the area, and lashes a low shot towards the bottom left, but Butland clears well with his feet. United’s best moment so far. 22 min: Shaqiri does well to win a ball in the midfield and set Stoke away on the attack. He feeds Jese, who is very close to slipping Pieters into an awful lot of space down the left. But Bailly and Valencia are on hand to snuff out the danger. 25 o’clock: BT Sport still haven’t fixed their on-screen timer. I must buy a watch. But worry not, I think we’re on top of this situation. 20 min: Valencia earns a corner down the right. It’s half cleared, but United regain possession and Matic very nearly releases Lukaku into the area with a chip down the inside-left channel. The flag goes up for offside. 19 min: This is a bit better from Choupo-Moting: an attempt to chest down and Le Tissier a volley into the top right from the best part of 40 yards, De Gea having wandered off his line. It’s high and wide, but not by a ridiculous amount. A decent effort, though De Gea was never in serious danger of being embarrassed. 18 min: Rashford plays a ridiculous crossfield pass straight to Choupo-Moting. United are light at the back, and Stoke have men over on the right. But the striker dillies and dallies for the second time in this game, and the chance to put United under some serious pressure is gone. 16 min: United knock it around the middle awhile. Stoke keep their shape. Eventually Herrera gets fed up and chips a ball down the inside-right channel. No black shirts near it. Butland comes out to gather. 14 min: Fletcher flaps his hand at a ball and concedes a free kick out on the United right. United load the box with big lads, but Mkhitaryan opts to fire a low delivery. Not a great idea. Shaqiri batters clear. 12 min: United stroke it around the back awhile. Jones slips and for a second looks like letting Shaqiri away on goal, but regains his balance and sorts himself out. After a very open and hectic start, this has calmed down a tad. 10 min: After that early flurry, a bit of a lull. United try to up the tempo as Darmian bursts down the left and sends in a cross for Lukaku, but once again Stoke deal with the situation pretty well. 8 min: Rashford is sent scampering down the left by a fine Pogba pass, but he can’t dig out a cross; Cameron closes him down and tidies up. Stoke have started fairly confidently here, but this United side don’t look the sort to panic. 986 min: Incidentally, the clock on BT Sport is up the spout, so please forgive me if my timings are a wee bit out. I’ll try my best to work things out. 4 min: This is quite the start! Jese makes good down the right and dribbles a shot across the face of goal and out of play on the left. Then there’s another Stoke attack, Diouf making his presence felt on the right. A corner, which De Gea claims, but only after letting the ball slip from his grip and onto the turf. Fortunately for United, there were no red-and-white shirts around him to benefit. 2 min: There’s a minor brouhaha as Choupo-Moting falls over in United’s crowded box. No penalty. United then zip up the other end through Rashford down the right. United are two on one! Rashford also turns down an opportunity to power into the box, slipping the ball to his left for Lukaku. But the big striker can’t get the ball out from under his feet, and Zouma is able to block. It really should be 1-1. 1 min: Within 30 seconds, Jese hooks a ball over his own head down the right wing and sets Choupo-Moting clear down the flank! But the striker glides rather than drives into the box, and instead of powering a shot on goal, he allows the ball to be bundled out of play for a corner. After a last blast of Delilah, we’re off! The home side get the ball rolling. A rollicking atmosphere at Stoke, but when is there ever not? The teams are out! Stoke City wear their famous red-and-white-striped shirts (think Stanley Matthews); Manchester United are in 1990s retro-chic black (think Sharp Viewcam). We’ll be off in a minute! Jose Mourinho meanwhile takes the opportunity to show Stoke some respect, but doesn’t say much else of note. “Of course we have an important match on Tuesday, but we are focused on this match first. It’s difficult enough to do that.” Mark Hughes speaks! “We’ve started brightly enough at the beginning of a new season. But today is a big test, we’ll have to play well. There are always elements of play we think we can take advantage of. It’s important to get Kevin Wimmer out there for his home debut, though it’s a blow to lose Ryan Shawcross to a back injury. But our back three are all good players.” Stoke City make two changes to the team sent out at West Bromwich Albion before the international break. Ryan Shawcross is unfit while Bruno Martins Indi drops to the bench. In come new signing Kevin Wimmer and Mame Biram Diouf. Manchester United relegate three of the side that started the Old Trafford victory over Leicester City to the bench. Daley Blind, Juan Mata and Anthony Martial step down; Matteo Darmian, Ander Herrera and Marcus Rashford take their spots. Stoke City: Butland, Zouma, Wimmer, Cameron, Diouf, Fletcher, Allen, Pieters, Shaqiri, Jese, Choupo-Moting. Subs: Berahino, Tymon, Martins Indi, Adam, Crouch, Haugaard, Sobhi. Manchester United: de Gea, Valencia, Bailly, Jones, Darmian, Herrera, Matic, Pogba, Mkhitaryan, Lukaku, Rashford. Subs: Mata, Martial, Smalling, Lingard, Carrick, Blind, Romero. Referee: Neil Swarbrick (Lancashire). ... in which Manchester United look to reclaim top spot in the Premier League. The form book suggests they’re in good shape to do it: they’ve won their first three matches without conceding a goal, while scoring ten. Stoke, by contrast, have only managed to find the net 11 times in their last 14 Premier League games. Still, one of those came at the Bet 365 Stadium against Arsenal, and it proved the Potters have what it takes to see off the big boys. They’ll also take heart from their recent home record against United: they’ve not lost this particular league fixture since April 2013, winning two and drawing two, a record that would have been three and one were it not for a last-minute Wayne Rooney free kick back in January. United look a more expansive proposition now, however, so Stoke will need good performances from Jack Butland and their new defensive signing Kevin Wimmer if they’re to get anything out of this game. You’d have thought. But who knows anything? Will Stoke turn a half-decent start to their season into something special? Or will United further establish their title-challenging credentials at a notoriously awkward venue? It’ll be a blast in the Potteries finding out. It’s on!

A new report, Death, Dying and Devolution, by the University of Bath Institute for Policy Research, suggests that the sector is undergoing a period of expansion that has not been experienced for decades, as private-sector companies, such as Dignity, which is floated on the stock market, and the Westerleigh Group, which is owned by a Canadian pension fund, seek to fill the gaps in provision left by the public sector. The newcomers claim the rise in fees imposed by council-owned crematoriums has not seen corresponding improvements in service, with many customers expressing frustation at lengthening waits to have their loved ones cremated. There are also rigid rules governing the sort of services council premises can offer. Last year a parliamentary inquiry heard evidence that the average length of time between death and cremation in 2013 was about 15 days, five days longer than a decade before. The report notes that, while local authorities remain the largest providers of crematoriums throughout the UK, they are likely to lose their market share as the sector evolves, which could hurt them financially. “There’s pressure on local government with funding being decreased,” said Brendan Day, technical coordinator at the Federation of Burial and Cremation Authorities, who wrote the section of the report on cremations. “Crematoria, along with car parks, are probably the two of the larger income generators for local authorities, so they are increasing their fees to offset cuts elsewhere.” In the past decade cremation fees have risen by more than 100% in some regions. The most expensive fee has risen by 80%, from £552 to £999, charged in 10 areas across the UK, while the cheapest has more than doubled from £151 to £364. The increase means that smaller sites can turn a profit on just 600 cremations a year. This has resulted in crematoriums springing up across the UK, with applications to build many more in the pipeline. “The private sector offers a lot more flexibility,” said Day, who stressed that he was speaking in a personal capacity. “If you want a cremation at 3am tomorrow morning, if it’s a private site, then they’ll most likely say yes. If you’d like a really large memorial in the grounds, they’ll be open to discussing it with you, whereas local authorities tend to point to the regulations.” Day warned that council-run crematoriums now needed to respond to the challenge if they are to survive as revenue sources. “A lot of local authority sites are tired and run down; they might get a lick of paint occasionally. If they do not keep up with the levels of investment that the private sector put into their new facilities then people will vote with their feet. “Cremation is the last thing that you will do for your loved one. “If you have the choice between a well-managed site which has received a lot of investment and one that doesn’t, then naturally you will want to go to the better one.”” The popularity of cremation is a relatively new phenomenon. In the 1940s only 4% of people were cremated. Today almost four out of five people choose it. The changing dynamics in the cremation market come as the UK faces a looming burial crisis, with new burial space at a premium. “Cemetery and crematorium capacity has been allowed to drift for decades, meaning that across the country we are unprepared for the projected rise in the death rate and increased demand on services,” said Dr Kate Woodthorpe from the Centre for Death and Society at the University of Bath, which will publish the report on Tuesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/09/british-diplomat-lobbied-big-tobacco-bat-bangladesh-unpaid-vat","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T23:05:21Z","webTitle":"British diplomat lobbied on behalf of big tobacco","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/09/british-diplomat-lobbied-big-tobacco-bat-bangladesh-unpaid-vat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/09/british-diplomat-lobbied-big-tobacco-bat-bangladesh-unpaid-vat","fields":{"headline":"British diplomat lobbied on behalf of big tobacco","bodyText":"The Foreign Office is immersed in a major lobbying row after it emerged that a senior official sought to help a British tobacco company to avoid paying tax owed to one of the world’s poorest countries. Alison Blake, the British high commissioner to Bangladesh, has been accused of lobbying on behalf of British American Tobacco (BAT) after it sought her help in a long-running battle with the country’s revenue authorities. The extraordinary intervention has provoked anger among health organisations and transparency campaigners, both in the UK and in Bangladesh, who say that it breaches strict World Health Organisation rules on lobbying. BAT is disputing a £170m claim for unpaid VAT brought by the government of Bangladesh against its subsidiary BATB. The claim has been recognised in the country’s courts but BAT, in a letter to Blake seeking her support, boasted of its “proud history of more than 105 years of investment and revenue contribution in Bangladesh”. The company described the demand as “baseless” and signalled that it may take the matter to the international court of arbitration. Shortly after she received the letter, Blake wrote on 6 August to the Bangladeshi government repeating the arguments made by BAT. She said: “I am writing regarding the long pending VAT case of British American Tobacco Bangladesh which we have discussed a number of times before and on those occasions I felt assured that your honourable office was determined to resolve the matter.” Blake highlighted the fact that BAT paid more to the exchequer than any other company last year. She also noted that the high commission was aware of government legal opinions stating that there was “no scope to hold the manufacturer liable to pay VAT on a retrospective basis”. She noted that the Bangladeshi finance minister had in the past discussed meeting the law minister and attorney general to consider an out-of-court settlement “but somehow these meetings have not been held”. This is not the first time the Foreign Office has found its relationship with BAT under scrutiny. In 2015 the British high commissioner in Pakistan attended a lobbying meeting between BAT and the country’s finance ministry at which the company protested about proposed tobacco control measures. In 2013 the Foreign Office was forced to issue new guidelines to its staff about its relationship with the tobacco industry following a previous scandal when the British ambassador to Panama intervened on BAT’s behalf in 2012. The guidelines stated that officials must not “engage with foreign governments on behalf of the tobacco industry, except in cases where local policies could be considered protectionist or discriminatory”. The guidelines also forbade officials from seeking to “encourage investment in the tobacco industry, or provide any assistance in helping tobacco companies influence non-discriminatory local business policies to their advantage”. The UK is also a signatory to WHO guidelines prohibiting officials from acting in the interests of big tobacco. Progga, a Bangladeshi nonprofit organisation that promotes transparency, said it was dismayed by the Foreign Office’s intervention. A spokesman said: “We appreciate the development initiatives of British government in Bangladesh but the attempts to settle the BATB tax issue out of court by the British high commissioner, Ms Alison Blake, is entirely undesirable. Tobacco kills around 100,000 people annually and cripples around 382,000 in Bangladesh, and BATB owns the largest share [of the market] here.” As smoking declines in the west, big tobacco is seeking to expand into countries such as Bangladesh that have not implemented tobacco control measures. But BAT’s actions have provoked controversy. Allegations that it was involved in bribery and corruption in Africa are being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office. However, a spokeswoman for BAT defended its relationship with the high commissioner. “We have done nothing wrong here,” she said. “It’s incorrect to say that WHO guidelines prohibit all engagement between governments and the tobacco industry; in fact, they caution governments to ensure that all operations and activities of the tobacco industry are transparent.” Deborah Arnott, chief executive of the health charity Ash, said: “The Foreign Office has instructed all its diplomats not to act as tobacco company lobbyists. Indeed they are supposed to assist tobacco companies in complying with foreign government laws or regulations, not try and overturn them. This case is particularly egregious as BAT has enlisted the British high commissioner to pressurise the Bangladesh government to overturn a legal decision handed down by the courts. “This is a company currently under investigation by the UK’s Serious Fraud Office over allegations of bribery in east Africa, so what on earth is a senior diplomat doing acting as its lobbyist?” A Foreign Office spokesman defended the commissioner. “It is entirely appropriate that the UK government supports British businesses overseas. Our actions were in line with guidelines and the letter in question highlighted the original legal opinion that there was no legal basis for retrospective VAT.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/09/lauren-child-let-children-dawdle-and-dream","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T23:03:20Z","webTitle":"Lauren Child: ‘We should let children dawdle and dream’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/09/lauren-child-let-children-dawdle-and-dream","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/09/lauren-child-let-children-dawdle-and-dream","fields":{"headline":"Lauren Child: ‘We should let children dawdle and dream’","bodyText":"Children are often told what’s good for them, but the advice of the new children’s laureate may take them by surprise. Lauren Child, speaking for the first time since her investiture in Hull this summer, has a simple message: just stare into space. In an age of prescriptive talk about targets and aspirations, Child, the creator of Charlie and Lola, plans to make a stand against the theorising and goal-setting during her two-year tenure. “Lost time is so lovely,” she says. “We have become so goal-oriented, so it is no longer enough to learn to play the Beatles’ hits on the piano, you have to become a great pianist. Why can’t children do something just for the sake of it?” It is vital, the bestselling author argues, for the young to daydream and dawdle if they are ever to develop a sense of their own personality. It is a thesis she will explain on a new website and in an inaugural lecture in London on 19 October. “This summer, I have thought a lot about our need to be creative and how you discover it by accident,” she says. “It was such an exciting moment for me when my English teacher asked me to do some improvisation in front of the class and I made people laugh. So I would like to talk about making time for these accidents. We need to be aware that just having a go has a value. Chance interactions can lead to something bigger. And it is something children can do without having to join something, or start something up.” Child, 51, is the fourth illustrator to become children’s laureate, an honour bestowed by BookTrust, a charity, and sponsored chiefly by Waterstones. She follows artists Sir Quentin Blake, Anthony Browne and the outgoing laureate, Observer cartoonist Chris Riddell. Child also writes longer novels for young adults, including the series about secret agent Ruby Redfort, as well as illustrating her own popular books for younger children, the Charlie and Lola stories, which were made into three Bafta-winning animated series for CBeebies, and the Clarice Bean novels, which have sold six million copies. Child’s literary career itself is something of an accident. Growing up in Berkshire, she studied art and then tried window dressing and lampshade design, as well as working as an assistant to Damien Hirst. “Working for Damien was great, primarily because I had a job, but also because I was mixing colours and it reminded you how they work together. I painted a lot of perfect circles for him and that allowed my thoughts to drift. It was a mechanical, concentrated job but my mind was free.” Child’s new website, Staring into Space, will invite young visitors to post details of odd things they have spotted. She plans to contribute with a daily blog about items she has noticed in the street. “There is always something amazing. Whether it is a single sock, or something you overhear people saying. “I once found two raw steaks lying on the pavement. I write it down in a notebook, or on the back of envelope. Often it is a description of somebody I have seen, like a tiny woman in a velvet trouser suit walking along in New York, pulling a shopping cart. I can use her in a story one day. Ideas are made from these things.” Child is about to start working inside her first purpose-built studio above a shop near her home in north London. It is partly a reaction to the increased activity in her house since the arrival of her daughter, Tuesday, five years ago. “I loved working from home, but now my daughter’s social life is quite something. Yesterday a whole team of girls came round, dressing up and popping their heads around the door.” Hearing Tuesday, now seven, and her friends talk has confirmed the writer’s sense of the extreme vocabulary children are drawn to use. Her daughter, adopted after a Unesco-funded artists’ trip to Mongolia, now contributes to Child’s visual processes too. “I love it if she comes in while I am illustrating, as she can see what I am doing. With the new book, A Dog With Nice Ears, she drew the dogs we have used on the endpapers because they look like Lola’s drawings.” The pet-related theme of this, the sixth Charlie and Lola picture book, will be familiar to Child fans after her 1999 book I Want A Pet and the popular That Pesky Rat story, about an animal in search of an owner. “My daughter and I often design in our heads the ideal dog we would have and think what we would do with it and where it would sleep.” Child is apprehensive about taking up a position in the public eye, and sees her laureateship as “a responsible job, rather than an achievement award”. Her forthcoming lecture, staged by BookTrust at Riba in London, will be on the subject of confidence and creativity. “I want to talk about the fact that children’s writers approach their work just as seriously as any other writer approaches work. “I have a slight worry that we are seen as children’s entertainers, particularly with the number of comedians who are now also writing books for children. Many are very good and there is nothing wrong with them writing them. “What can be difficult, though, is if a writer has had a great deal of attention as a comic first, it can be an easy way for a publisher to sell the books. Then, when there is so much promotional emphasis on people who are already successful, publishers lose out on all the younger, talented writers and illustrators that might come along. “I am not saying that purely funny books shouldn’t be done, of course, it is just that I don’t really see life like that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"education/2017/sep/09/cambridge-considers-typed-exams-as-handwriting-worsens","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T10:42:15Z","webTitle":"Cambridge considers typed exams as handwriting worsens","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/sep/09/cambridge-considers-typed-exams-as-handwriting-worsens","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/sep/09/cambridge-considers-typed-exams-as-handwriting-worsens","fields":{"headline":"Cambridge considers typed exams as handwriting worsens","bodyText":"The increasing illegibility of students’ handwriting has prompted Cambridge University to consider ending 800 years of tradition by allowing laptops to replace pen and paper for exams. Academics say that students are losing the ability to write by hand en masse because of their reliance on laptops in lectures and elsewhere. Sarah Pearsall, a senior lecturer at Cambridge’s history faculty, said: “Fifteen or 20 years ago, students routinely wrote by hand several hours a day, but now they write virtually nothing by hand except exams. “As a faculty we have been concerned for years about the declining handwriting problem. There has definitely been a downward trend. It is difficult for both the students and the examiners as it is harder and harder to read these scripts,” she told the Daily Telegraph. The university has launched a consultation as part of its digital education strategy after piloting an exam typing scheme in the history and classics departments earlier this year. A similar scheme was implemented for first- and second-year divinity students at Edinburgh University in 2011. At the time, Dai Hounsell, a professor of higher education at the university, told the Scotsman that students faced a dual strain in providing handwritten exam answers. Physiologically, they were not used to extended bouts of writing by hand, and structuring essays on paper presented a different mental challenge to writing on a computer, he said. Such concerns led Edinburgh to take steps to give students the option of using a laptop in exams, although the idea has not been rolled out across the institution. Cambridge’s move comes as the Harvard academic Eric Mazur, known as the father of the “flipped classroom”, says he now encourages students to bring their laptops and smartphones into exams. Permitting devices in the exam room allows students to “look up whatever you want, whenever you want” and test their creative and analytical skills, rather than their ability to recall information, he told the Times Higher Education World Academic Summit this week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/09/wills-and-kate-are-now-royaltys-middle-class","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T23:05:21Z","webTitle":"Wills and Kate are now royalty’s ‘middle class’ | Barbara Ellen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/09/wills-and-kate-are-now-royaltys-middle-class","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/09/wills-and-kate-are-now-royaltys-middle-class","fields":{"headline":"Wills and Kate are now royalty’s ‘middle class’","bodyText":"You might have noticed that last week Prince George embarked on his first day at school – at the prep Thomas’s, Battersea, south London – accompanied by his father, William. (Mother, Kate, was absent, incapacitated by morning sickness.) Some people might now hope that this marks the close of a particularly intense period of royal watching – the period of Diana remembrance frenzy. For a while, at least, a halt might be called to the anguished guff about people’s princesses, princesses of hearts and the like. At least – this time around – it was the actual anniversary of her death. Too often, no excuse seems necessary for the cyclical torrents of (extremely repetitive) information about Diana. Personally, it can feel akin to being forced by a crazed, bayonet-wielding Beefeater into retuning into a decades-old royal soap opera. Watching William being a good, hands-on father reminded me of a persistent odd quirk in royal coverage. Every time William or Harry displays any sign of humanity or good manners, it’s boomed that they’re “a credit to their mother”. And, of course, they are, but why does Charles never get a mention? He parented them, too, and alone (with Camilla) for all the years after the tragedy, but it’s generally Diana who gets all the credit. Perhaps it’s this kind of mawkishly militant beatification of Diana that makes the whole spectacle so wearisome. In a way, George’s first day at school showcased the new generation, perhaps even the next phase, of British royalty, a bit like a Star Wars or Avengers franchise renewal, but without the Christmas tie-in merchandise opportunities. Leaving aside the vexed matter of whether it was a good idea for the nation to gawp at a small, vulnerable child’s first day at school – thankfully, only one photographer was allowed to be present – it was quite interesting to watch William in action. On one level, just another dad (a nice caring dad) seeing his kid off to his first day of school. On another, it’s the latest instalment of what’s fast becoming “The Wills and Kate Windsor Middle-Class Real-Time Panto”. While this was Kate’s actual background, she somehow joins William in appearing as though they’re actively engaged in an over-zealous tutorial, or well-received TED talk, on “being uber-middle class”. Indeed, the future monarch and his queen appear to be meta-normalising or, if you prefer, “de-royalising” at such an incredible rate, I keep half-expecting to bump into Kate going through the sales rail in Seasalt or to spot William in Caffè Nero and asking if he could keep an eye on my cappuccino while I nip to the loo. While William’s yearning for Middleton-level normality has long been noted, the elephant stubbornly refuses to budge from the room – in that (deep breath)… William and Kate are not middle class! Not even a posh version. The last time I checked, middle-class people didn’t tend to be feudal heirs to the British throne or have their child’s first day at school broadcast all over the world. The fact that William and Kate want to be middle class, or at least present as such, could say something very positive – demonstrating that they want the royal family to remain relatable to the British public in a more metropolitan way than ever before. More cynically, this couple triggering all the right middle-class endorphins (“The Veg-Box Factor”?) could help ensure the royal family’s survival in these serious troubled times. Whatever lies behind it all, nothing quite takes away the strangeness of watching these high-ranking royals conduct an ongoing, near-flawless impersonation of affluent, middle-class life, almost as though an evil wizard has trapped them inside an affluent London snow globe. Whether you find this bizarre, sweet or sad (or annoying), for me, it makes the royal family more interesting than they’ve ever been before."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/09/observer-view-on-apple-and-other-tech-giants","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T23:07:21Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on controlling the power of digital titans | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/09/observer-view-on-apple-and-other-tech-giants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/09/observer-view-on-apple-and-other-tech-giants","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on the power of Apple and other tech giants","bodyText":"On Tuesday, there is a cultural, technological and economic event of global significance. Apple will launch its new range of iPhones, wearables, services and its improved Apple TV. If they are successful, Apple will become the first company ever to be valued at $1tn on the New York Stock Exchange. The world will be plunged ever deeper into the digital age. Apple has emerged in a few years alongside Google, Facebook and Amazon as one of the corporate titans of our times. In their wake are Airbnb, eBay, Instagram, LinkedIn, Snapchat, Spotify, Twitter, Uber and YouTube, all of which have transformed our lives. Nobody would gainsay the creativity and transformational capacity of these companies. They are a tribute to the creative power of capitalism. Nobody argues the services they provide would have happened faster or more efficiently in a world of public ownership and state planning. And yet. These are new and powerful sources of private power. These companies know ever more about us: our personal data is integral to their business model. They take the concept of monopoly to a new level; each digital platform, once dominant, creates an embedded advantage of being the only platform worth using, so making their market position unchallengeable. How ethically they behave towards customers, staff, competitors and public authority is thus of existential importance. Yet it is already evident that existing structures of corporate governance, competition law and of intergovernmental collaboration are not up to the task of insisting that crucial ethical norms are adhered to.. Apple is one of the better in class. It is a manufacturer and service provider and less able to create an impregnable market position than, say, Facebook or Google. If Tuesday’s product launch is poorly received, there are plenty of rivals ready to step in and provide better mobile phones or wearables. It lives off its creativity rather than a monopolistic position. It is also more vigilant about respecting personal privacy. But even Apple cannot escape concerns about its possession of so much private power. It stands on the threshold of being the world’s first trillion-dollar company. It pays trivial amounts of tax in relation to its sales. It has played hardball with the EU over its claims that it owes billions of unpaid tax. It possesses an enormous amount of knowledge about our data, with only thin and weak processes of accountability, along with systems to address grievances and complaint. It is becoming ever clearer that public policy needs to be tougher on a number of fronts and that individual European countries and their citizens will only escape being exploited if they act together. IT companies operating anywhere in Europe should be signatories to an EU-wide data charter, as proposed, for instance, by the Big Innovation Centre, setting out their acknowledgement that data is owned by the individuals who generate it: the principle must be that “my data is my own”. There must certainly be derogations for commercial use, but only with the express agreement of its owners, along with agreed processes for redress of grievances and speedy payment of fines. Competition policy must operate internationally. Similarly, IT companies must comply with OECD initiatives on tax avoidance or face the risk of paying a flat rate levy on sales. And all must establish ethical guidelines and ensure that there is compliance. Britain will want to work closely with the EU, even after Brexit. Apple and its fellow IT disrupters are changing the world. That does not mean they can change the ethics by which we live – that requires European countries to work together."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/09/nhs-hospital-reforms-closures-job-losses","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T23:05:21Z","webTitle":"Senior doctors warn of hospital closures in NHS shake-up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/09/nhs-hospital-reforms-closures-job-losses","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/09/nhs-hospital-reforms-closures-job-losses","fields":{"headline":"Senior doctors warn of hospital closures in NHS shake-up","bodyText":"Almost two in three senior doctors fear a controversial NHS shake-up that will downgrade or close dozens of hospital units will damage the care patients receive. The hospital consultants fear the sustainability and transformation plans (STPs) will lead to staff losing their jobs, will exacerbate workforce shortages and will act as a cover for cuts to services. Of 450 hospital clinicians surveyed by the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA), 42% believe that STPs will have a “negative impact” on patient care. Barely one in 10 consultants who belong to the union expect a “positive impact”. Three in four (77%) fear STPs are a way of making cuts to the NHS, while just over half (56%) fear they will lead to job losses and worse understaffing. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens views STPs as local plans that will modernise the way patients are cared for, reduce the pressure hospitals are under, and help plug the £22bn gap in the service’s budget expected to have opened up by 2020. Patients will be cared for more often in or close to their homes to avoid unnecessary stays in hospital. Stevens has divided England into 44 “footprints”, many of which are facing big changes to how clinical services in the area are organised, including the downgrading or closure of units. But plans to cut the number of hospitals, shrink the supply of beds and centralise key services have sparked protest campaigns in many parts of England. Theresa May relayed her anxiety about the political fallout from a series of A&amp;E, stroke, maternity and other units being downgraded or closed when she met Stevens for the first time last September. Last week Rishi Sunak, the Conservative MP for Richmond, and Darlington’s Labour MP Jenny Chapman put aside party allegiances to write to Stevens and voice their concerns about possible bias in the STP process that has raised doubts about the future of services at Darlington Memorial Hospital, which could see its A&amp;E and other departments taken away and transferred to the North Tees Hospital, 12 miles away in Stockton-on-Tees. “Many hospital doctors see STPs as a managerially driven process with no real clinical basis, and fear that a mix of underfunding, under-resourcing and service rationalisation can only damage patient care,” said Eddie Saville, the HCSA’s chief executive. “This is, in effect, yet again an NHS reorganisation, but region by region, with management trying to plug the financial gaps rather than putting high-quality care of patients at the forefront. The fact that STPs are being planned against a backdrop of underfunding and cuts has led many doctors to conclude that this transformation programme is purely an attempt to mask further cutbacks.” Although a majority of the HSCA members surveyed are undecided on STPs, almost all (95%) said they had not been involved in drawing up their local plan, prompting Saville to claim that they have been “shut out and systematically excluded” from the process. The King’s Fund health thinktank says STPs “offer the best hope of delivering essential reforms to NHS services”, that concentrating specialist services will improve patient care, but that the NHS needs more money to ensure success. The British Medical Association, meanwhile, has dubbed STPs “a cover to deliver £26bn in cuts to health and social care [in which] millions of patients will be affected by hospital and bed closures”. The Local Government Association, which represents local councils, criticised STPs as “secretive, opaque and top-down” reforms that would fail patients. Campaigners in Huddersfield against the closure of its hospital’s A&amp;E unit decided last week to seek a judicial review of the lawfulness of the plan, drawn up by the local NHS clinical commissioning group. They fear lives could be lost if people from the town are forced to travel the 15 miles to Halifax for urgent and emergency care. The plan has been referred to the Independent Reconfiguration Panel, an expert group that advises Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, on which hospital units should be allowed to close. Rosie Duffield’s vigorous defence of the hospital in Canterbury played a key role in her being returned as the Kent town’s first ever Labour MP at the general election in June, ousting the Tory incumbent, Sir Julian Brazier, in the process. Fears raised by the NHS deciding that patients from the Canterbury area needing urgent treatment for a heart attack, stroke or pneumonia should instead go to Ashford or Margate led to claims that people would die because of the change. Hundreds of people protested last weekend in Louth, Lincolnshire, against plans that could see the hospital close or be downgraded through a merger with Skegness hospital. However, Louth’s Tory MP, Victoria Atkins, has accused campaigners of “scaremongering” over the hospital’s future."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/09/celtic-champions-league-psg-neymar-sinclair-rodgers","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T22:00:19Z","webTitle":"Celtic have the talent to take on Neymar’s PSG, claims Scott Sinclair","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/09/celtic-champions-league-psg-neymar-sinclair-rodgers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/09/celtic-champions-league-psg-neymar-sinclair-rodgers","fields":{"headline":"Celtic have the talent to take on Neymar’s PSG, claims Scott Sinclair","bodyText":"Brendan Rodgers is well used to the great Celtic paradox. Supporters headed to Friday’s canter at Hamilton via a badly maintained lane, dodging beer cans and dog mess. Upon reaching the SuperSeal Stadium, the scene was of two permanent stands, an artificial pitch and the prospect of fierce clearances ending up in a supermarket car park. It seems faintly laughable to label such a fixture as preparation for the visit of Neymar and Paris Saint‑Germain. It is understandable that Rodgers does not belittle the Scottish football landscape. More typical settings greet Celtic at Ibrox, Pittodrie, Tynecastle and Easter Road. While Celtic were pulling Hamilton apart 4-1, PSG were doing likewise at Metz, winning 5-1. On Friday, Celtic’s manager pointed towards “the beauty of being up here” in respect of contrasting backdrops. He railed against the suggestion of Hamilton, or anywhere similar, being a useless precursor to Europe. “For me, it is irrelevant [where we are]. My concentration is on the pitch, I focus on the field. Hamilton was a big game for us.” And now? “We are now going to face one of the best teams on the planet.” Whatever his views are regarding the necessity for Celtic to enjoy the Champions League to offset the domestic scene, he keeps them to himself. This is the message given to players: that Celtic’s unbeaten run in Scotland, stretching back to May 2016, demonstrates intensity. Scott Sinclair says: “To go from Hamilton to PSG is a massive jump but everyone in the squad has that mentality that all the games are just as important, no matter whether league, Champions League or League Cup. No matter what game you go into, you have to say it is just as important.” Celtic’s style is untypical of other Scottish sides, who look to profit from getting the ball forward quickly and feeding off scraps. In Sinclair, James Forrest, Patrick Roberts and Stuart Armstrong, Rodgers has creative forces who operate in more nuanced and varying ways. Although Leigh Griffiths is almost certain to start in attack on Tuesday, the flashes shown by the PSG loanee Odsonne Édouard on Friday suggest yet another successful foray into the transfer market. Of all those keen to impress in the Champions League – and display improvement from the same platform a year ago – Sinclair has added motivation. If history suggests an English player has little chance of international recognition when performing in Glasgow, his story is untypical. He was an England representative from under-17 to under-21 level, for starters. Does he look at Gareth Southgate’s squads now and wonder why he doesn’t get a look-in? “Yes, that’s always the case. All players can do that.” The 28-year-old’s talent was sufficient for Manchester City to pay a considerable sum for him in 2012. Celtic have reinvigorated his career, to the point where his form has never been better. When England’s lack of depth in the left side of attack is factored in, Sinclair should have a World Cup charge in mind. “Well that’s the question,” he says to the suggestion of the Champions League enhancing his international appeal. “All I can do is concentrate on what I’m doing, playing as well as I can at Celtic. Whatever happens outside, happens. I just need to do everything in my control, playing well. “This is the stage. All I can do is as well as I can in the Champions League then just wait and see what happens. I’m looking forward to it just as much as everyone else. It is a great platform for all of us to show what we are about, to step up to the plate. “We are a much stronger group now. We have learned from the mistakes of last year going into this group stage. We will go into every game thinking we are not just here to make up the numbers. We are here to compete and make sure we give all the teams a good game.” Neymar has previous in a Celtic context, meaning he is destined to be cast as the pantomime villain regardless of events. He has encountered previous scraps with two of Celtic’s starters, Scott Brown and Mikael Lustig. Sinclair stops short of confirming he admires the former Barcelona man and rightly cites an intense Celtic Park atmosphere as a boost to the hosts rather than cause for Parisian panic. “I’m sure it won’t faze him at all but it will make us raise our game,” he says. “Neymar is world class. His goalscoring speaks for itself. I’m sure all the boys are looking forward to playing against him; and making sure we stop him.” It is quite the challenge, a world away from Hamilton."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27308","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T23:00:17Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,308","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27308","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27308","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,308","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/11/slaven-bilic-west-ham-poor-start-under-pressure-david-sullivan","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"David Sullivan’s salvo bursts Slaven Bilic’s fragile bubble at West Ham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/11/slaven-bilic-west-ham-poor-start-under-pressure-david-sullivan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/11/slaven-bilic-west-ham-poor-start-under-pressure-david-sullivan","fields":{"headline":"David Sullivan’s salvo bursts Slaven Bilic’s fragile bubble at West Ham","bodyText":"David Sullivan, to quote an increasingly demob happy Slaven Bilic, likes to talk. West Ham’s co-owner wants to have his say, regardless of what his manager thinks. He makes headlines by not holding back in interviews. Just this past week, with the dust still settling on the non-signing of William Carvalho, Sullivan released a statement on the club’s website detailing how close West Ham had been to a swoop for the Sporting Lisbon midfielder on deadline day. He also revealed that Bilic, under fire after an awful start to the season, had turned down deals for Grzegorz Krychowiak and Renato Sanches, who joined West Bromwich Albion and Swansea City respectively. Plenty has happened since that statement, much of it bizarre even by football’s standards. Sporting responded by denying receipt of any offer for Carvalho, prompting West Ham to hit back at accusations of dishonesty by announcing, in a tweet from one of Sullivan’s sons, a lawsuit against their Portuguese sparring partners. The sorry episode reached a farcical peak when Bruno de Carvalho, Sporting’s president, livened up the international break by calling West Ham’s owners “offended virgins” and “the Dildo Brothers”. “It’s funny,” Bilic said on Friday. “It made me laugh.” Speaking in an atmosphere reminiscent of an unruly classroom, Bilic did not exactly rush to defend the honour of his bosses when Carvalho’s disparaging comments about Sullivan and David Gold came up. If loyalty is a two-way street, what was he supposed to make of Sullivan’s comments about Krychowiak and Sanches? The suggestion that he rejected midfielders from Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich hardly spoke volumes for his judgment. Unless there were shades of grey. “That is not exactly what happened with those two you mention,” Bilic said. “I wanted Carvalho.” Bilic went on to question why Sullivan could not have spoken to him in private and already there is a sense of the PR war beginning, of hands being washed of blame and battle lines being drawn. It is not hard to see which way the wind is blowing. There is little prospect of Bilic’s contract being extended beyond this season and he knows that losing to Huddersfield Town at the London Stadium on Monday night could be the end. He had fears of being sacked at the end of last season and West Ham’s links with Rafael Benítez refuse to disappear. What cannot be lost in this debate is how poor Bilic’s side have been in their first three league matches, even though they have all been away. The bottom side have conceded 10 goals in defeats by Manchester United, Southampton and Newcastle, and after more than two years in charge it remains difficult to work out what Bilic wants from his players. What is their style of football? Are they solid and physical? Are they a counterattacking team? Do they favour possession? One thing is indisputable: they cannot defend. There are concerns about a lack of tactical planning and intensity in training. Bilic finished seventh in his first season but inspiration often arrived from Dimitri Payet, a mercurial talent motivated by the challenge of making the France squad for Euro 2016. West Ham have floundered since Payet returned to Marseille for £25m in January, winning six out of 21 league games. At the same time, there is a sense that Bilic is being made a scapegoat to deflect attention from the questionable recruitment strategy that has held the club back since the move to the London Stadium. Payet’s replacement, the £10m Robert Snodgrass, joined Aston Villa on loan last month. José Fonte, an £8m 33-year-old centre-back, has struggled. The search for a top striker in the summer of 2016 brought links with Carlos Bacca, Michy Batshuayi and Alexandre Lacazette. All proved unattainable. Jonathan Calleri, Ashley Fletcher and Simone Zaza arrived instead but none of that trio wear claret and blue any more. West Ham’s business was initially encouraging this summer. They recruited Joe Hart on loan from Manchester City and bought Javier Hernández for £16m, while Marko Arnautovic is their record signing at £24m. But Bilic had spoken about needing more pace and power. They were short-term buys, while the 32-year-old Pablo Zabaleta has yet to impress after signing on a free from City. An ageing defence has looked cumbersome against fast attacks. What Bilic wanted most was a top defensive midfielder. Carvalho was expensive – Sporting wanted £37.5m – but Bilic let go of squad players in order to make room in the budget for the Portugal international. Come deadline day, West Ham had signed four senior players and sold nine. Their squad looked short of depth, but they signed no one. Carvalho stayed in Lisbon. Sullivan has assumed the role of director of football, which means he shares culpability with Bilic for the mess. Bilic is on borrowed time. It is no secret that West Ham hope to prise Benítez away from Newcastle, where the Spaniard has grown tired with working for Mike Ashley. Yet their treatment of Bilic, who is experiencing what Sam Allardyce and Gianfranco Zola went through, runs the risk of putting off prospective hires. Sometimes the quietest person in the room is the smartest. For all the noise coming out of east London, how much of it is worth listening to?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/09/drone-robot-military-human-control-uk-ministry-defence-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T23:03:20Z","webTitle":"Humans will always control killer drones, says ministry of defence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/09/drone-robot-military-human-control-uk-ministry-defence-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/09/drone-robot-military-human-control-uk-ministry-defence-policy","fields":{"headline":"Humans will always control killer drones, says ministry of defence","bodyText":"Britain’s military will commit to ensuring that drones and other remote weaponry are always under human control, as part of a new doctrine designed to calm concerns about the development of killer robots. The move by the Ministry of Defence comes after more than 100 leading robotics experts wrote to the United Nations urging the organisation to step in to halt the development of artificial intelligence in weaponry. The announcement is also timed in response to demonstrations at this week’s biennial Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEI) fair, one of the world’s biggest arms exhibitions. More than 34,000 visitors are expected to attend the event at the ExCeL centre in east London’s docklands. The new doctrine will make clear that the UK opposes the development of autonomous weapons systems that could operate without trained controllers and traditional chains of command. It will be in line with similar commitments made by other Nato members. The doctrine will see the MOD pledge: “UK policy is that the operation of weapons will always be under control as an absolute guarantee of human oversight, authority and accountability.The UK does not possess fully autonomous weapon systems and has no intention of developing them.” The UK currently has a small squadron of Reaper drones – currently being expanded – which can be armed, but which are always remotely piloted. Mark Lancaster, the minister for the armed forces, said: “It’s absolutely right that our weapons are operated by real people capable of making incredibly important decisions, and we are guaranteeing that vital oversight. “We’re certainly not ignoring robotics; our dedicated science and technology budget and our £800m innovation fund [are] keeping our armed forces at the cutting edge of technology, but our weapons will always be under human control.” The Ministry of Defence insists that its investment in remote technology is now aimed at reducing the risk to troops on battlefields in the so-called “last mile” of combat. It is looking at systems to resupply frontline troops using remotely controlled vehicles or aircraft. The Royal Navy also supported the world’s first large-scale demonstration of marine robotic systems last year. Over the summer a letter backed by more than 100 experts and co-signed by US billionaire Elon Musk warned against “a third revolution in warfare”. “Once developed, they will permit armed conflict to be fought at a scale greater than ever, and at timescales faster than humans can comprehend,” the letter stated."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/09/arms-sales-repressive-regimes-saudi-arabia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T23:04:21Z","webTitle":"British arms sales to repressive regimes soar to £5bn since election","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/09/arms-sales-repressive-regimes-saudi-arabia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/09/arms-sales-repressive-regimes-saudi-arabia","fields":{"headline":"British arms sales to repressive regimes soar to £5bn since election","bodyText":"UK arms manufacturers have exported almost £5bn worth of weapons to countries that are judged to have repressive regimes in the 22 months since the Conservative party won the last election. The huge rise is largely down to a rise in orders from Saudi Arabia, but many other countries with controversial human rights records – including Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Venezuela and China – have also been major buyers. The revelation comes before the Defence and Security Equipment International arms fair at the Excel centre in east London, one of the largest shows of its kind in the world. Among countries invited to attend by the British government are Egypt, Qatar, Kenya, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. Campaigners called on the government to end arms sales to the United Arab Emirates in light of its record on human rights. They accused the government of negotiating trade deals to sell the Gulf state cyber surveillance technology which the UAE government uses to spy on its citizens, and weaponry which, they allege, has been used to commit war crimes in Yemen. The Saudis have historically been a major buyer of British-made weapons, but the rise in sales to other countries signals a shift in emphasis on the part of the government, which is keen to support the defence industry, which employs more than 55,000 people. Following the referendum on leaving the European Union, the Defence &amp; Security Organisation, the government body that promotes arms manufacturers to overseas buyers, was moved from UK Trade &amp; Investment to the Department for International Trade. Shortly afterwards, it was announced that the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, would spearhead the push to promote the country’s military and security industries exports. But charities and other organisations that campaign against the arms trade fear that a post-Brexit Britain will see an increase in weapons sold to countries with poor human rights records. Last week Labour MP Helen Goodman questioned why the UK had exported £80,000 worth of arms – believed to be components for submarine systems – to the Maduro government of Venezuela in the past year. Goodman asked: “In light of the Maduro government’s refusal to cooperate with the ongoing UN-led investigation into human rights abuses, will the government suspend any further arms sales until those concerns are resolved?” Campaign Against the Arms Trade has found that of the 49 countries that are classed as “not free” by Freedom House, the independent organisation that promotes democracy, 36 have bought British-made weapons under the current government. Since 2015, Saudi Arabia has agreed orders for more than £3.75bn worth of British defence equipment – mainly bombs and fighter aircraft – up from £160m in the 22 months leading up to the election. Even when Saudi’s massive order book is stripped out, arms exports to repressive regimes have almost doubled since the Tory government was elected: orders to such countries, excluding Saudi, amount to almost £1.2bn, compared with £680m in the 22 months before the election. Among the major buyers were: Algeria, which agreed a military helicopter deal in September 2015, worth £195m; Qatar, which is buying military support aircraft worth £120m; and China, which is subject to an arms embargo. Despite the embargo, the UK agreed a £16m deal to export components for military radar. One notable new customer is Azerbaijan, which bought £500,000 of “targeting equipment”. “The UK has consistently armed many of the most brutal and authoritarian regimes in the world, and a number have been invited to London to buy weapons,” said Andrew Smith of Campaign Against Arms Trade. “These arms sales aren’t morally neutral, they are a clear sign of political and military support for the regimes they are being sold to. The government has played an absolutely central role, and has consistently put arms exports to despots and dictators ahead of human rights.” The government insists that its arms export licensing systems is subject to stringent rules. Foreign Office minister Alan Duncan told parliament last week: “The government take their export control responsibilities very seriously and operate one of the most robust defence export control regimes in the world. We rigorously examine every application case by case against consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/12/marriage-equality-rallies-around-australia-readers-photos-and-stories","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T08:00:51Z","webTitle":"Marriage equality rallies around Australia – readers' photos and stories","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/12/marriage-equality-rallies-around-australia-readers-photos-and-stories","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/12/marriage-equality-rallies-around-australia-readers-photos-and-stories","fields":{"headline":"Marriage equality rallies around Australia – readers' photos and stories","bodyText":"Tens of thousands of Australians attended rallies in support of marriage equality on Sunday, and we asked readers to share their photos and videos.

UBS banking analyst Jonathan Mott said one third of Australians who took out a mortgage in the past 12 months were not “completely factual” with their financial information, and the level of factually inaccurate mortgage applications has risen significantly since 2015, from 27% to 33%. He said many Australians were overstating their income and the value of their assets in their mortgage applications, and a “substantial number” of applicants were continuing to say their mortgage consultants were suggesting they misrepresent their documentation. He said the level of inaccurate mortgages meant the probability of default, and loss in the event of default was being underestimated by Australia’s biggest banks, and he has warned his clients he is “very cautious” about the medium-term outlook for the sector. “In Australia, the average life of a mortgage is approximately four and a half years,” he has written to clients. “As a result this would imply between one quarter to one third of the mortgages on the banks’ books are based on factually inaccurate applications. “This equates to approximately $500bn of factually incorrect mortgages (aka ‘Liar Loans’) on the Australian banks’ books, or 18% of all outstanding Australian credit.” Mott has sounded his warning after UBS anonymously surveyed 907 Australians who took out a mortgage in the past 12 months, following similar surveys in 2015 and 2016. The online survey was conducted between 7 July and 4 August, with respondents, who were over 18, answering 70 questions. It found just 67% of respondents stated their mortgage application was “completely factual and accurate” in 2017, a statistically significant reduction from 2016 (72%). It found 25% of participants said their application was “mostly factual and accurate”, 8% said it was “partially factual and accurate”, while 1% “would rather not say”. It also found consumers did not feel as though it had become harder to attain credit in the last 12 months, despite efforts by the banking regulator to tighten lending standards. It said mortgages originating with brokers were statistically significantly more likely to misrepresent their information than mortgages originated by banks. “We believe that 26 consecutive years of GDP growth in Australia has led to a large level of complacency within the economy,” Mott said. “This survey suggests many people have come to take house price inflation as a given and are prepared to be factually inaccurate on their mortgage application to ensure they get access to housing leverage. And why not … housing has paid off handsomely for decades. “However, as many regulators have highlighted, household indebtedness is at concerning levels and housing credit growth is continuing to run at many multiples of household income growth despite macro prudential tightening. “[The] survey findings suggest that the risks within the mortgage book [of Australia’s banks] may be more elevated than the banks believe.” Last month, data suggested Australia’s housing boom may be coming to an end as investors disappear from the market. Figures released in August by the Bureau of Statistics revealed that, over the past six months, the growth of housing finance has stalled, with the value of investor housing falling 6% in the first six months of this year. Mott said one of the reasons mortgage arrears were still so low in Australia, despite the high level of inaccurate mortgages, may be due to sustained house price inflation in many parts of Australia, so customers who had been under financial stress had been able to sell their properties, repay their debts and get a capital gain. “[But] in the event that household income growth remains subdued or interest rates continue to rise (via the Reserve Bank or bank mortgage repricing) this is likely to place pressure on many households,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/11/monday-briefing-irmas-storm-surge-is-the-biggest-fear","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T05:28:47Z","webTitle":"Monday briefing: Irma's storm surge is the 'biggest fear'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/11/monday-briefing-irmas-storm-surge-is-the-biggest-fear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/11/monday-briefing-irmas-storm-surge-is-the-biggest-fear","fields":{"headline":"Monday briefing: Irma's storm surge is the 'biggest fear'","bodyText":"Top story: ‘You can’t hide from the water’ Good morning to you, Graham Russell here bringing you the news to start your week. Hurricane Irma continues to lash Florida with rain and wind gusts of up to 230km/h, flooding parts of Miami and bringing dangerous storm surges of more than four metres to the west coast. “You can’t hide from the water. That’s our biggest fear,” said Florida senator Marco Rubio. The scale of the damage is likely to be unknown for days but analysts say the disaster could cost $300bn. As the category 2 storm gradually heads north towards Tampa, thousands of people remain in danger, either unwilling or unable to join the 7 million people who have evacuated. Those who stayed in Naples, on the west coast, spoke of their desperation. “I have nobody in the world,” said Della Ratta, 94, who lives alone in a first-floor condo likely to be flooded within hours. She asked her neighbours to help her but according to Della Ratta they refused, slamming the door in her face. In the Caribbean, now picking up the pieces after the storm, the premier of the British Virgin Islands has called on the UK to provide long-term support to address a “critical’ situation. “We are a resilient people but this has shaken us to our core,” said Orlando Smith. British troops have been deployed, with the Royal Navy delivering medical supplies, including vaccines, by helicopter.

David Davis was forced last night to defend her position, saying: “A vote against this bill is a vote for a chaotic exit from the European Union. The British people did not vote for confusion and neither should parliament.” Backbenchers have been lining up to force concessions on what former attorney general Dominic Grieve called an “astonishing monstrosity” of a bill. Jeremy Corbyn’s Brexit stance also faces pressure, with the TUC’s general secretary, Frances O’Grady, set to call for the UK to remain in the single market. * * * Dishing the dirt – The UK is violating its obligation to protect its citizens from illegal and dangerous levels of air pollution, a UN special rapporteur has said. “I am alarmed that despite repeated judicial instruction, the UK government continues to flout its duty to ensure adequate air quality,” said Baskut Tuncak in his report, shared exclusively with the Guardian before a meeting this week. A government spokeswoman blamed the problem on “failed” EU policies. “We now have an opportunity to deliver a green Brexit,” she added. * * * Cap no longer fits – The end could be nigh for the sweeping public sector pay freeze imposed in 2010 by George Osborne, with ministers expected to accept recommendations this week to breach the 1% pay cap for police and prison officers. Labour is preparing to force a vote on the pay cap on Wednesday and unions have been calling for coordinated action on what GMB national secretary Rehana Azam called a “cruel policy”. * * * Apple loses X factor – The usually extremely secretive Apple might have sprung a leak, releasing the name of its new iPhone before its launch on Tuesday.

It was a very different political time: Diana’s death, Britpop and Bill Clinton in the White House, writes Gerry Hassan. Since 1997, devolution has emerged as a success and the Scottish public now view the Scottish parliament, rather than Westminster, as the most important political institution. Irrespective of formal independence, Scotland already has an informal independence of the mind in how it talks, thinks and acts.

Business The financial markets in Asia have brushed aside any concerns about a possible drag on the US economy from Hurricane Irma. The Nikkei in Japan has surged 1.4% helped by a stronger dollar and, critically, the absence of another nuclear test by North Korea. The ASX200 in Sydney is up 0.8% and the Hang Seng 0.9%. The Kospi in Seoul added 0.8% as well. The FTSE100 is due to rise about 0.4% later. The pound is down a bit at $1.318, but up ever so slightly on the euro at €1.096. The papers A few different leads on the front page although Hurricane Irma remains a theme. The Mail lashes out at the government with the headline “Torment of the hurricane Brits”, reporting that those living on some Caribbean islands say they have been abandoned. The Guardian has its exclusive on the front about how a UN special rapporteur says the UK government is flouting its duty to protect its citizens from air pollution. The Telegraph splashes on a long-term study showing that the use of bleach in the house can lead to a greater chance of contracting a fatal lung condition. The Mirror leads with “North Korea nuclear threat to the UK” and a warning from the defence secretary, Sir Michael Fallon, that the country could soon be in reach of Kim Jong-un’s missiles. The Times goes with “Britain is sick man of Europe” – not a reflection on Brexit but on life expectancy. It is increasing elsewhere in the EU but not in the UK. The Sun continues to focus on Wayne Rooney’s troubles off the field and lastly the FT, no doubt with insurance companies in mind, splashes with “Florida suffers huge devastation as Hurricane Irma strikes US”.

Andy Roddick’s abrupt retirement during the 2012 US Open left the United States without an active men’s grand slam champion for the first time in 129 years, since the inception of what then was called the US National Championships. And while Venus and Serena Williams have combined for 30 major singles championships, 121 WTA titles and 173 finals appearances – and counting – the hand-wringing over their successor on the women’s side persisted. That concern was buried for good at 5.22pm on Saturday when Sloane Stephens stood frozen behind the baseline at Arthur Ashe Stadium after Madison Keys sent a forehand into the net on match point in the final. Stephens’ triumph was the climax of a women’s tournament where four Americans made it to the semi-finals for the first time at a grand slam in 32 years – and the first all-American final at Flushing Meadows since Serena defeated Venus in 2002. When Monday’s rankings are released, the ageless Venus – still the oldest player in the top 300 – will be ranked in the top five for the first time in nearly seven years. Keys will be ranked No12. CoCo Vandeweghe will climb to a career-high No16, one spot above Stephens. Even Serena, on maternity leave and inactive since January, hangs on at No22 – lying in wait as the betting favorite to defend her title at the Australian Open. There will be 14 women from the United States in the top 100 – more than any other country – suggesting that women’s tennis in the United States is as strong and healthy as ever. And for the first time, the demographics women reflect America as it truly is. That it was Stephens, who is black, defeated Keys, whose mother is white and whose father is black, is not insignificant in a sport predominantly owned, played and watched by affluent white people. It’s not hyperbolic to say American tennis is in the suddenly vibrant state it’s in because of black women, who have been among the most oppressed and marginalized people in the country’s history. Athletes of color are far more commonplace today than six decades ago, when Althea Gibson won the first of her two US Open titles shortly after becoming the first African American tennis player of either gender to break the sport’s color line. The Williams sisters fought their way onto the stage amid resistance, derision and criticism from all corners, weathering the double burdens of racism and sexism from the moment they burst on the scene as teenagers in the late 1990s. It’s been said a legacy is planting seeds in a garden you never get to see, but it’s taken only one generation to behold the #BlackGirlMagic first teased in the 1950s and sown by a pair of sisters from Compton come into full blossom. Those fruits were on further display on Sunday as Cori ‘CoCo’ Gauff, a 13-year-old from Florida, became the youngest girl to play in the US Open girls’ final since the event began in 1974. Her favorite player? Serena. Twelve-year-olds today don’t remember when Venus surged through the draw as a teenage debutante, a more enduring signal of the limitless promise ahead than Arthur Ashe Stadium, which also opened that year. They certainly don’t remember Gibson. But they will remember Stephens and Keys trading groundstrokes on the game’s biggest stage. That so little was said of race in the aftermath of Stephens’ win can be viewed as a sign of progress. The 24-year-old champion offered little more than boilerplate responses to questions addressing the topic when it came up over the fortnight. “Obviously, Venus, we are following in her footsteps,” Stephens said on the eve of the final. “She’s been here. She’s represented the game so well as an African American woman. Maddie and I are here to join her and represent just as well as Venus has in the past and honored to be here.” But it does matter. As the list of black players to win major singles titles inevitably grows longer as barriers to entry continue to fall – Stephens is the sixth, joining Gibson, Arthur Ashe, Yannick Noah and the Williams sisters – each successive title will become less newsworthy. But let not the knee-jerk deluge of plaudits seduce us into slighting the struggles that made these victories possible. The breakthrough of Stephens, 24, and Keys 22, augurs yet another era of promise for US tennis, one that will carry the domestic game forward when the Williams sisters finally decide to walk away. But that it’s a pair of black women leading the group who would make American tennis great again must not be lost in the confetti."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/11/road-crashes-cost-australian-society-almost-30bn-a-year-report","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T02:25:48Z","webTitle":"Road crashes cost Australian society almost $30bn a year – report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/11/road-crashes-cost-australian-society-almost-30bn-a-year-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/11/road-crashes-cost-australian-society-almost-30bn-a-year-report","fields":{"headline":"Road crashes cost Australian society almost $30bn a year – report","bodyText":"Road crashes are costing Australian society almost $30bn a year, a new report estimates. The Australian Automobile Association (AAA), which commissioned the report, is warning that efforts to reduce road trauma are failing, and calls on the federal government to show leadership and boost safety funding. The chief executive of the AAA, Michael Bradley, said the report showed Australia’s approach was “neither effective nor proportionate” to the total cost of road trauma. “The government can choose not to act, but choosing not to not only kills a lot of Australians but it costs billions of dollars every year,” Bradley said. “Even though fewer people are dying, more are getting injured, probably because crashes are getting more survivable thanks to car technologies and airbags. So when you have a crash what used to kill you will now just disable you or maim you.” The AAA-commissioned report makes two estimates of the total cost of road trauma to Australian society, differing in the way they value human life. The first estimate puts the cost of road crashes at $22.2bn annually using a “human capital approach”, which estimates a person’s economic worth through lost output and earnings. The second approach places a dollar value on society’s desire to avoid injury and death by measuring how much individuals would pay to reduce their risk of harm. Under this method, known as “willingness to pay”, that value is lost when someone dies or is injured in a crash. The willingness to pay approach estimates a total cost of $29.7bn a year. The cost has decreased in real terms since 2006, when the “willingness to pay” method was used to estimate a cost of $27.12bn, according to the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics. Overall, road safety in Australia has improved dramatically since the 1980s. But over the past two calendar years in Australia there has been a slight jump in road deaths, reversing an otherwise long-term downward trend. The Australian road toll reached a low of 1,065 between January and November in 2014 but has since jumped twice, to 1,110 and then 1,185 for the same periods in 2015 and 2016 respectively. The hospitalised injury rate has also increased since 2000, from 141.7 per 100,000 people to an estimated 160.3 per 100,000 people in 2013. The AAA says the effectiveness of the government’s 10-year national road safety strategy – which aims to reduce road deaths and serious injuries by at least 30% by 2020 – is doomed to fail. A report released earlier this year by the AAA suggested the funding from the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development for road safety would fall from a high of $18.2m in 2016-17 to $16.3m in 2020-21. The transport minister, Darren Chester, issued a statement on Monday saying he was proud of the government’s investment in road safety. Among other things, Chester cited $684.5m funding for the black spot program over seven years; $4.4bn for the construction, repair and upgrade of local roads; $828,000 for heavy-vehicle driver fatigue research; a $450,000 commitment to the Australian trauma registry; and $8.25m for the Ancap safety rating system for cars since May 2010. “I am passionate about road safety and I refuse to accept that human lives are the price we have to pay for a modern road network,” Chester said. “Funding these important road safety initiatives will continue to build on this government’s legacy to ensure Australia remains one of the safest road systems in the world,” he said. But the AAA wants to see road funding tied directly to safety priorities. The group also wants better data collection, a re-established national office for road safety, and a review of data collected by emergency services at crash scenes. The group has also called for the removal of tariffs to give Australians better access to safer cars. “More than 100 Australians are killed in car crashes every month and the same number are seriously injured every day, so the significance of this problem cannot be overstated,” Bradley said. “The social cost of road deaths is both obvious and immeasurable, however the economic implications of Australia’s road safety crisis are not,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/sep/11/rugby-union-premiership-talking-points-from-weekend-action","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T08:03:28Z","webTitle":"Rugby union: Premiership talking points from the weekend’s action","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/11/rugby-union-premiership-talking-points-from-weekend-action","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/11/rugby-union-premiership-talking-points-from-weekend-action","fields":{"headline":"Rugby union: Premiership talking points from the weekend’s action","bodyText":"1) Worcester can’t afford injuries that are piling up The Premiership is an unforgiving place for teams who start slowly. Bottom-placed Worcester have lost their opening two games and injuries are already beginning to bite. Losing their strongest scrummager, Nick Schonert, to a suspected broken ankle is a major blow and the Warriors are down to two fit fly-halves with the league season barely a fortnight old. To compound matters, England’s Ben Te’o has an ongoing arm problem which has forced him off prematurely in both his team’s games to date. “He’s got a plate in it and it’s sore,” said Gary Gold, Worcester’s director of rugby. “Every time he gets a bang on it, it’s a bit more sore. He probably is in quite a bit of pain so he deserves a huge amount of credit for the character he put up before he came off. He showed he’s a world-class player.” Wasps’ Dai Young, meanwhile, is happy enough to be on top of the table but says his team still have plenty to improve on after their 27-10 victory over the Warriors. “I don’t think it was a two-score victory, if I am honest. It wasn’t a great performance from us.” Robert Kitson Match report:Worcester 10-27 Wasps 2) Rokoduguni too good to be forgotten Semesa Rokoduguni is one of the Premiership’s most lethal finishers, able to conjure a try out of nothing as he did to turn the game against Saracens four minutes from time by shredding Europe’s tightest defence, but on current selection he would not make England’s fourth team. The options for Eddie Jones mean Rokoduguni’s defensive weaknesses restrain the Fijian-born back but, at a time when law tweaks enhance attacking play and more tries are being scored, a player so energised by the sight of the opposition tryline grows in value. Defence can be worked on, as Rokoduguni has been doing, but the opportunism shown for his first try on Saturday is not a product of coaching. Bath are operating Anthony Watson at full-back and, after an impressive all-round display at 15, he has given Jones something to ponder leading up to the autumn Tests with the shoulder injury he sustained after being clattered by Maro Itoje not thought to be serious. Paul Rees Match report: Bath 31-21 Saracens 3) Saints show they don’t have a soft centre Sometimes, when a person/couple/rugby club are enduring an acutely miserable time, it’s best to look away. For example, we left Northampton to it last week, as they mulled over the horrifying embarrassment of their opening-day thrashing by Saracens and what they were going to do about it. But Luther Burrell, their centre, who responded with a try-scoring return to form that mirrored his team’s in their comprehensive victory over Leicester, has given us an insight into what was said within the walls of Franklin’s Gardens. The players were called soft. And rugby players never like to be called that. “When you come in on Monday and your coaches are fuming with you and calling you soft,” said Burrell, “ultimately as a player you’ve got to react. You don’t want to upset your director of rugby, you don’t want to be called soft.” No wonder they were a side transformed on Saturday. Michael Aylwin Match report: Northampton 24-11 Leicester 4) Patience a necessary virtue for Gloucester fans Not a great day at the office for Gloucester who, having fought back to within touching distance early in the second half, proceeded to give away a string of penalties to allow Harlequins to keep ahead on the scoreboard. Johan Ackermann was sensible enough to temper the optimism that came after beating Exeter but there are promising signs. They have considerable back-row heft, even without Ross Moriarty, and Freddie Clarke certainly caught the eye at blindside flanker. Richard Hibbard was one of few shining lights but he had a disappointing afternoon, though there is pace in the back three with Jason Woodward and Ollie Thorley. Ackermann senior arrived at the club late in pre-season so it is likely to be a campaign of steps forward followed by steps back for Gloucester. Steady progress is more welcome than another false dawn at Kingsholm however. Gerard Meagher Match report: Harlequins 28-17 Gloucester 5) Exiles know it is their home form that will count A 30-point defeat at the home of the champions but no need to be downhearted for London Irish. They may have been thoroughly outclassed by Exeter but they are not the first side to feel the full force of fortress Sandy Park. And Nick Kennedy will be only too aware that the Exiles’ home form will dictate whether they remain in the Premiership next season. The win on the opening day of the season has bought them considerable time – Bristol did not manage a first win until Boxing Day last year – and there is clearly no need to panic, even if they succumb on the road next week at Sale. Kennedy will also know, however, that how they fare the week after against Northampton in their first match of the season at the Madejski Stadium could be hugely significant. Win that one and plenty of those supporters who stayed away last season will come flooding back. Gerard Meagher Match report: Exeter 37-7 London Irish 6) Falcons fly high but Stateside Saracens test is next Dean Richards was nothing if not blunt in his assessment of Newcastle’s one‑point victory at Sale: “We stole it to be honest.” Still, to see the Falcons riding high at the top of the Premiership table after the second Saturday of the season is heartening indeed. It was 20 years ago that Newcastle were in the embryonic stages of a campaign that resulted in their one and only Premiership title and while next weekend’s fixture in Philadelphia against Saracens is likely to demonstrate just how much more development there is to go, there is something stirring in the north-east. Indeed, Eddie Jones even saw fit to take this one in himself as the first leg of his triple header. Yes, it was the only match on Friday night but there have been times in the past when this fixture did not command the attention of the England head coach. It certainly does now.

Yet despite his larger-than-life character he always put the animals’ story at the heart of his films, and prided himself on “keeping it real” throughout his long and innovative career. In the words of Sir David Attenborough, “Alan Root made natural history film-making grow up.” Alan, who has died aged 80, was one of the first people to bring Africa’s wildlife to our screens. He was best known for his contributions to Anglia Television’s long-running series Survival, many made in partnership with his first wife, Joan. One of these – the 1978 film Mysterious Castles of Clay, about the hidden life of a termite mound – was nominated for an Academy Award. He also introduced Dian Fossey to her first mountain gorillas, and later shot some of the wildlife footage for the 1988 film Gorillas in the Mist. Despite his early success, Alan never lived on past glories: he always looked for new ways to achieve his aims, pioneering the use of hot-air balloons, which allowed him to obtain intimate footage without scaring the animals. But much of his enduring fame came from the various mishaps and near-death experiences he endured while trying to get close to his subjects. As fellow film-maker Mark Deeble noted: “Alan approached everything as if it was his last day on earth. Then he pushed the boundaries so that, in many cases, it almost became that.” He had countless scars from encounters with hippos, gorillas and leopards, and on meeting someone new would proffer his right hand – missing the index finger from a bite by a puff adder – just to see their reaction. Not all his near-death experiences were the result of animal attacks. He taught himself to pilot a small plane, flying at ludicrously low altitudes so he could spot birds en route. He then progressed to helicopters, but having written off two – and walked away more or less unscathed – he never even thought of giving up flying. Alan was born in London, where his father, Ted, managed a food-processing factory. In 1943 the family moved to Kenya for his father’s work, and he attended the Prince of Wales school in Nairobi. As a teenager, encouraged by the legendary film-maker Armand Denis, who lived in Nairobi, he bought a Bolex clockwork camera and shot a film about jacanas, the birds known as “lily-trotters” because of their ability to walk across aquatic vegetation. He got to know the father-and-son film-making team of Bernhard and Michael Grzimek, and became firm friends with Michael. However, Michael died at the age of 24, in 1959, when he was flying a small aircraft through a mountain gorge near the Serengeti in Tanzania and collided with a vulture. At the time, the Grzimeks were making a film about the wildlife of the Serengeti. Alan completed the filming, and Serengeti Shall Not Die went on to win an Oscar for best documentary feature. Afterwards Alan used to observe that “it was all downhill after that”. In 1961 he married a Kenyan fellow film-maker, Joan Wells-Thorpe. During their 20-year partnership the couple produced some of the most acclaimed wildlife films ever made, including The Year of the Wildebeest (1975) and Safari by Balloon (1975). They split up in the early 1980s, and in 2006 Joan was murdered at her home after campaigning against wildlife poaching. After the end of his marriage Alan continued to work for Survival, encouraging and mentoring young film-makers, including Deeble and Victoria Stone, who as a team under his guidance made many memorable African wildlife films. He married Jenny Hammond in 1991; she died in 2000, after which he was married a third time, to the biologist, artist and violinist Fran Michelmore. In 2008 he was appointed OBE, and during his career he picked up more than 60 other awards, including two Emmys and a Bafta. Audiences loved his way with words as well as the stunning images: a classic line was “the aardvark – first word in the dictionary, last word in anteater design”. Root was always rather dismissive of the trickery used in some modern wildlife films, preferring to rely on his own knowledge and fieldcraft, gained from more than six decades in the bush. In 1998 he paid a visit to the team of Big Cat Diary, a BBC nature series of which I was the series producer, in the Masai Mara. He spent the evening regaling us with gripping anecdotes about his extraordinary life and times, and was remarkably modest about his many achievements. He never officially retired, and for his 80th year planned his most ambitious idea yet: to walk alone with the migrating wildebeest on their epic journey from the Serengeti into the Masai Mara. Because he knew that the authorities would never give him permission for filming, he would pretend to go “on safari” with Fran and their teenage sons, Myles and Rory. “It was pure Alan Root,” said Deeble, “the maverick film-maker, making a statement, as only he knew how.” But in March this year he was diagnosed with a brain tumour. So instead he took his family on one last epic voyage – to Alaska – before returning to their home near Mount Kenya, where he died. He is survived by Fran and their sons, and by two stepchildren, David and Karen, from his second marriage. • Alan George Windsor Root, wildlife film-maker, born 12 May 1937; died 26 August 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/sep/10/rafael-nadal-v-kevin-anderson-us-open-mens-final-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T23:21:31Z","webTitle":"Rafael Nadal overwhelms Kevin Anderson to win third US Open title – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/sep/10/rafael-nadal-v-kevin-anderson-us-open-mens-final-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/sep/10/rafael-nadal-v-kevin-anderson-us-open-mens-final-live","fields":{"headline":"Rafael Nadal overwhelms Kevin Anderson to win third US Open title – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s all for this year’s US Open. Thanks for following along with us these past two weeks and for all your comments, encouragement and fact-checks. Do check out Kevin Mitchell’s full match report and we’ll see you again soon enough. Nadal congratulates Anderson for his run to the final and thanks all the people who make the US Open possible. He then says a few words about Uncle Toni, who will not be traveling with the team any more after this tournament: “I can’t thank him enough for all the things he has done for me. Without him, I would have never been playing tennis. ... For sure, he was one of the most important persons in my life.” He then sends out his thoughts for all the victims of the earthquake in Mexico and the hurricanes that have struck the United States and Caribbean over the fortnight. “It is very sad moments for the world but it is time for be strong,” he says. “All the best for the victims and all the people who are suffering.” He then accepts a check for $3.7m and lifts the trophy for the third time in his career. Anderson opens with words of congratulations for Nadal: “I know we’re the same age but I feel like I’ve been watching you my whole life.” He thanks the USTA, Brad and the University of Illinois tennis team and all the fans who have supported him these two weeks. Also thanks for his fans back home, his wife Kelsey, his brother and his parents. “I’ll keep fighting like you always taught me and I’ll be back,” he says. What a masterclass from Nadal, who lost only 15 points on his serve and didn’t face a single break point. He improved to a perfect 16 for 16 on net points with that backhand volley to win the match, an appropriate finishing kick for his 16th grand slam. Third set: Nadal 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 Anderson Nadal wins the opening point on a service winner. Then someone calls out his name during his service motion, prompting a warning from the chair umpire (and a grimace of annoyance from the man himself). A return winner by Anderson makes it 15-all, but the South African then badly mishits an elementary overhand winner, sending it long for 30-15. Nadal is two points from the title. Anderson pulls one back with a nifty backhand volley winner for 30-all. The crowd swells, knowing another Anderson point could earn him his first break-point opportunity of the match. But it’s not to be as Nadal crushes a service winner for championship point. Nadal then puts a forehand into the net for deuce, but answers with a 117mph service winner out wide for a second championship point. That one is all he needs as he comes to net to hit a backhand volley winner into the open court and raises his arms skyward with a smile from ear to ear. Third set: *Nadal 6-3, 6-3, 5-4 Anderson (*denotes next server) Nadal gets the best of Anderson over a taxing 18-stroke rally, but Anderson responds with four quick points including a pair of aces. Now Nadal will attempt to serve it out after the changeover. Third set: Nadal 6-3, 6-3, 5-3 Anderson* (*denotes next server) Another ruthless service game by Nadal, who holds at love once more to move within a game of his 16th grand slam title and third at the US Open. He’s now won 52 of 64 points on his serve. Third set: *Nadal 6-3, 6-3, 4-3 Anderson (*denotes next server) Anderson forces Nadal into an error on the opening point then booms a 126mph ace for the 10th straight point on his serve. Nadal breaks that run with a forehand volley winner, but Anderson hits a forehand winner for 40-15. More pressure from Nadal, though, as Anderson sprays a forehand for 40-30. But he escapes with the hold after hitting a 130mph service winner. Third set: Nadal 6-3, 6-3, 4-2 Anderson* (*denotes next server) Nadal sends a forehand long on the opening point for love-15 and the crowd buzzes a bit, perhaps hoping Anderson can push the Spaniard here so they can see more tennis. Nadal then hits a service winner followed by a forehand volley winner for 30-15. Now a backhand volley winner brings it to 40-15. Incredibly, Nadal is a perfect 15 for 15 on net points. Nadal misses forehand from the baseline for 40-30, but pulls out the hold with a service winner out wide. Third set: *Nadal 6-3, 6-3, 3-2 Anderson (*denotes next server) It’s an easy hold at love for Anderson punctuated by a backhand winner. The South African has had an easier time on his serve compared to those marathons in the early stages, but it’s immaterial if he can’t get his teeth into a Nadal service game. Third set: Nadal 6-3, 6-3, 3-1 Anderson* (*denotes next server) Nadal opens with a forehand volley winner, then watches as Anderson dumps a backhand into the net. Nadal hits a 114mph service winner out wide for 40-love, but he then mixes in his first double fault of the day and follows with an unforced error from the baseline for 40-30. That’s only the second time today that Anderson’s has won consecutive points on Nadal’s serve. Alas, it’s not the start of anything special: an unforced backhand error by Anderson gives Nadal the hold. Third set: *Nadal 6-3, 6-3, 2-1 Anderson (*denotes next server) Anderson goes love-15 down on another unforced error off the forehand, but hits a gorgeous drop-shot winner from a tight angle for 15-all. Nadal then misses on a backhand, then Anderson booms a 128mph ace into the body for 40-15. A service winner ends it and Anderson has the easy hold, but he’ll need to figure out a way to solve Nadal’s serve at least once in the next few games if he hopes to extend this match to a fourth set. Third set: Nadal 6-3, 6-3, 2-0 Anderson* (*denotes next server) Anderson hits a booming return winner off the backhand side for love-15, but Nadal rattles off three quick points for 40-15. He then caps the hold with a service winner, backing up the break with efficiency. Make that 40 of 48 points on his serve. Third set: *Nadal 6-3, 6-3, 1-0 Anderson (*denotes next server) “At the moment Rafael is better than the opponent,” Uncle Toni tells ESPN during the break between sets in the understatement of the day. Anderson opens the third set with a service winner but Nadal evens with a backhand winner. Two quick points by Anderson brings it to 40-15, but Anderson makes a forehand error – his 28th of the afternoon, quadruple Nadal’s seven (despite 24 winners for both) – and it’s 40-30. And just to show how quickly matters can get away from you against Nadal, Anderson makes two more unforced errors off the forehand side to go break point down ... then a third to see his serve go up in smoke. Second set: Nadal 6-3, 6-3 Anderson Nadal’s latest gem of a love hold: service winner, forehand volley winner, service winner, forehand winner. He’s won 36 of 43 points on his serve – and 36 of 80 on Anderson’s. Second set: *Nadal 6-3, 5-3 Anderson (*denotes next server) Anderson misses a backhand from the baseline to fall behind love-15, but hits a forehand winner at the net for 15-all. Now Nadal paints the line with a vicious forehand winner and he’s two points from a commanding two-sets-to-none lead. Anderson hits a sharp forehand early in the next point that Nadal can’t return for 30-all, followed by a 120mph second-serve service winner for 40-30. He then fires in another unreturnable serve off the second serve for the hold, putting it on Nadal to serve out the second set. Second set: Nadal 6-3, 5-2 Anderson* (*denotes next server) Nadal falls behind love-15, but answers with a pair of service winners for 30-15. Now he shows incredible court coverage in attempting a blistering forehand passing shot that Anderson manages to return only for Nadal to sprint across the court and uncork a backhand passing winner for 40-15. Anderson then sends a backhand sailing past the baseline and Nadal has another easy hold. Anderson now will serve to stay in the second set. Second set: *Nadal 6-3, 4-2 Anderson (*denotes next server) Nadal opens with an overhand winner following by a forehand passing winner for love-30. A key moment for Anderson and he takes a bit too long to reorganize mentally and he’s called for a time violation. Anderson then hits a backhand volley winner for 15-30, but makes an unforced error off the backhand side for 15-40 and it’s two more break-point opportunities for Nadal. Anderson saves the first with a big second serve that Nadal can’t return into the court, but capitalizes on the second when he rushes the net and puts away a 10-stroke rally with a overhand smash, punctuating the moment with a big fist pump as Uncle Toni and coach Carlos Moya are on their feet in the box! Second set: Nadal 6-3, 3-2 Anderson* (*denotes next server) Nadal rips a 113mph ace followed by service winners of 121mph and 113mph to race to 40-love. He then finishes the easy love hold with a forehand that Anderson can’t return. Nadal has now won 28 of 34 points on his serve. Second set: *Nadal 6-3, 2-2 Anderson (*denotes next server) Two quick points by Anderson, followed by a thudding backhand winner by Nadal for 30-15. Anderson then hits another service winner followed by a missed forehand by Nadal and he’s out with another easy hold. These were the kind of service games he could have used in the first set. Now can he make any headway on Nadal’s serve? Second set: Nadal 6-3, 2-1 Anderson* (*denotes next server) Nadal opens with a forehand winner, but nets a forehand on the next point for 15-all. Anderson sends a return long on the following point, but answers with a sharply hit cross-court forehand winner from a step inside the baseline for 30-all. Big point for the South African, but Nadal crushes a 112mph serve that Anderson sends into the net. He then overcooks a baseline forehand on the next point for the hold. Second set: *Nadal 6-3, 1-1 Anderson (*denotes next server) Anderson opens with a forehand winner, but Nadal rips a forehand winner down the line past a stationary Anderson for 15-all. Anderson comes to net on the next point and hits a forehand volley winner, then follows with a 130mph ace out wide for 40-15. Nadal puts a return into the net on the next point and Anderson has his first easy service game of the afternoon. Second set: Nadal 6-3, 1-0 Anderson* (*denotes next server) Nadal holds at love, hitting winners off both wings and capping it with a 122mph service winner down the middle. He’s breezing through his service games, having lost a scant four points on his serve in the match. First set: Nadal 6-3 Anderson Anderson mishits a forehand on the opening point and followed by a Nadal backhand passing shot winner for love-30. Nadal now two shots from taking the opener. Anderson pulls one back with a forehand winner. If Nadal was standing any farther back on these Anderson serves, he’d be in the seats. Anderson then hits a forehand winner for 30-all, then Nadal accommodates with an unforced error on the forehand for 40-30. But Nadal rips a gorgeous backhand winner past an approaching Anderson for deuce. Now another unforced error by Anderson on the forehand gives him a break and set point. Now Nadal, after starting about 12 feet from behind the baseline, works his way toward the net over three shots in the rally and deposits a feathery volley winner into the open court for the break and the opening set after 58 minutes. First set: Nadal 5-3 Anderson* (*denotes next server) Nadal opens with a service winner but Anderson answers with a nifty drop-shot winner from the baseline. That was unexpected. Now another service winner by Nadal, followed by a quick serve and volley that sees Anderson sail the return over the baseline. It’s 40-15 and Anderson is breathing heavy between these points. Now Anderson puts a backhand wide and Nadal has consolidated the break. Now Anderson will serve to stay in the first set. First set: *Nadal 4-3 Anderson (*denotes next server) Anderson misses a backhand volley early in the point for love-15. A ball has come out of his pocket and he earns a warning from the chair umpire that he will lose the point if it happens again. Anderson then hits a forehand volley at the net followed by a forehand winner from the baseline for 30-15. Now a serve and volley by Anderson, but he puts the backhand volley into the net for 30-all. Anderson follows with a 130mph service winner down the middle, but he airmails a forehand on the next point for deuce – the 13th deuce point in Anderson’s service games already. Now another double fault by Anderson, his fourth of the afternoon, and it’s a fifth break-point chance for the Spaniard. This time he capitalizes as Anderson badly misses on a forehand at the net, giving Nadal the first break of the proceedings after 47 minutes. Anderson misses on a backhand from the baseline, but he forces Nadal into a backhand error then hits a running forehand cross-court volley winner for 15-30. A half-chance for the South African. Nadal then lays in a soft 110mph first serve but Anderson can’t capitalize, sending a backhand return wide early in the point for 30-all. A service winner by Nadal moves him to within a point of the game, and he finishes off the hold from 15-30 down wtih a forehand volley winner. Anderson has had to play 42 points in his first three service games compared to 15 for Nadal. First set: *Nadal 2-3 Anderson (*denotes next server) Anderson opens with a service winner but Nadal hits a backhand winner early in the rally for 15-all. Anderson then comes to net again and puts away a forehand volley for a winner, but Nadal rips a forehand passing shot for a winner that stokes the crowd at 30-all. Now Anderson blinks with a missed forehand at the end of a 12-stroke baseline rally and Nadal has a third look at a break point. Anderson saves it with a 97mph second-serve service winner for deuce. Now he double-faults again, his third of the afternoon, and Nadal has a fourth break-point chance. And Anderson saves this one, too, with a 134mph ace out wide. Now Anderson pounds another service winnerand finishes off the hold with a powerful backhand winner up the line that appears to paint the line, but Nadal challenges it – and successfully! Deuce again. Anderson moves within a point of the hold after hitting a 133mph ace down the middle, but it’s back to deuce after Nadal misses on a forehand from the baseline. Anderson then hits another 132mph ace down the T, but it’s deuce No5 after Anderson dips a forehand volley into the net. From there, the South African hits a service winner and a forehand volley winner to escape, but it’s another hard-won hold requiring 16 points. Eventually these body shots have to take their toll. First set: Nadal 2-2 Anderson* (*denotes next server) Nadal caps an easy hold at love with a forehand winner up the line, needing just two minutes to do it. Anderson has had to play 26 points in his first two service games compared to nine for Nadal. That strikes me as untenable. First set: *Nadal 1-2 Anderson (*denotes next server) Anderson wins the first point when Nadal makes an unforced error on a backhand from the baseline, but then he misses on a forehand and mixes in a rare double fault for 15-30. A hint of a chance for Nadal. Anderson forces Nadal into an error for 30-all, then wins the longest rally of the match so far when Nadal blinks from the baseline during an 11-stroke exchange. Nadal then rips a wicked two-handed cross-court backhand that Anderson can’t return for deuce. Now a backhand pass winner that sails over Anderson and lands in the court for the first break-point chance of the match. Nadal then draws Anderson toward the net and loads up on forehand passing winner but dumps it into the net for deuce. Anderson drifts toward the net again and tries a backhand down the line but misses it and Nadal has a second break-point chance, but Anderson saves this one with an easy forehand winner. Anderson then cruses a 116mph ace out wide (that Nadal challenges unsuccessfully), but misses on a forehand for deuce once more. A service winner by Anderson sets up another game point and he’s undone by a double fault again! A fifth deuce. Then he closes an exhausting 19-stroke baseline rally with a cross-court backhand winner, but makes an unforced error with a forehand on the next point for deuce No6. But from there he rattles off two quick points for the hold, ending an 18-point, 12-minute service game. First set: Nadal 1-1 Anderson* (*denotes next server) Nadal takes the first point when Anderson misses on a forehand from the baseline, then Nadal sends a forehand sailing for 15-all. The world No1 then hits a pair of service winners for 40-15. Second serves on all four points so far. Now a fifth but Anderson sends the return sailing and Nadal has the hold. The Spaniard no doubt feels good to hold serve comfortably despite going 0-for-5 on first serves. A bit of a nervy start for the grand slam final debutant on the return. First set: *Nadal 0-1 Anderson (*denotes next server) Anderson won the toss and elected to serve. Nadal takes the first point after a short rally ending with Anderson missing a forehand with both players at the net. Anderson responds with a pair of service winners for 30-15, but then misses a backhand volley for 30-all. He then crushes a 136mph ace down the middle, but sends a backhand from the baseline sailing in the next point for deuce. Nadal making Anderson work for this first hold. But the tall South African answers with a service winner and a 128mph ace out wide and he’s on the board. Big serving early with an average first-serve speed of 128mph. The players are on court and about to start. Lots of celebs here: Christie Brinkley, Hilary Swank, Candace Bergen and media magnate Rupert Murdoch! Nadal is appearing in his fourth US Open final with a pair of wins (2010 and 2013) and a loss (2011), all to Djokovic. The world No1 in his third grand slam final of the year after a loss to Federer in the Australian Open and a win at Roland Garros over Wawrinka. The 31-year-old from Mallorca is 15-7 lifetime in major finals and trying to win at least two majors in a season for the fourth time in his career (three in 2010, two in 2008 and 2013). Anderson is the first South African to reach the US Open final in the Open era and the first overall since Cliff Drysdale was a runner up at the US Championships in 1965. He’s the first South African in any grand slam final since Kevin Curren, who lost to Mats Wilander at the 1984 Australian Open. The last player from South Africa to win a major title was Johan Kriek, a champion at Melbourne Park in 1981. This may only be their fourth meeting at the professional level, but these two have a history that dates back to their days as tweens on the junior circuit. Hello and welcome to Arthur Ashe Stadium for today’s US Open men’s final between Rafael Nadal and Kevin Anderson. It’s a gorgeous 74F afternoon here in Queens for today’s championship match between the world No1 and 15-time major champion and the No28 seed Anderson, a grand slam final debutant who was an 80-1 longshot when the tournament began. Nadal has won all of the four meetings between these two players with a nine to one advantage in sets played, including their lone clash at a grand slam: a 7-5, 6-1, 6-4 win in the fourth round of the 2015 Australian Open. Today’s champion will be the fifth straight grand slam winner aged 30 or over going back to last year’s US Open when Stan Wawrinka took the title. Since then, Roger Federer, 35, won the Australian Open and Wimbledon while Nadal, 31, captured his record 10th title at Roland Garros. This is just the seventh time in the Open era that a grand slam final has been contested by a pair of players aged 30 and over and the first at the US Open since 2002 when Pete Sampras beat Andre Agassi. The Big Four of Nadal, Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray has combined to win 45 of the last 50 major singles titles.

Smith has overseen one of the most successful periods in Warrington’s history since joining as coach in March 2009, helping the Wolves win the Challenge Cup on three occasions, as well as reaching three Grand Finals. However, Warrington have struggled in 2017 and finished the regular season in Super League’s bottom four though they were able to secure a place in Super League next season with a Qualifiers victory against Leigh over the weekend. “I’ve really enjoyed my nine years at the club and feel that it’s now in the best interests of all for us to go in different directions,” Smith said. “I’m grateful for the relationship I’ve had with the board, in particular [owner] Simon Moran, and I’d like to thank them for their support over the time I’ve been at Warrington. “I’d like to think that while this has been a tough year, the club has progressed in the time I’ve been there in many ways, on and off the field, and is now in a position that means they can go on to bigger and greater things.” The Wolves are in no rush to appoint Smith’s successor – but senior club officials will fly to Australia this week to meet a number of candidates. Reports in Australia this month had linked them with a move for Michael Maguire, the Australian who helped Wigan win a league and cup double in 2011. However, there has still been no contact with Maguire, who is a strong contender for the vacant Gold Coast job in the NRL. The 43-year-old was sacked by South Sydney last week following a disappointing campaign with the Rabbitohs. “Since joining, Tony has helped transform the club and it is testimony to his time at Warrington that the club’s expectations have been lifted,” said the club’s chief executive, Karl Fitzpatrick. “Unfortunately things have not worked out this year but when people reflect back on his time here I’m sure they will do so with many fond memories.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/10/arsene-wenger-turned-down-manchester-united-love-arsenal","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T21:47:00Z","webTitle":"Arsène Wenger says he turned down United as ‘I love the values of this club’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/10/arsene-wenger-turned-down-manchester-united-love-arsenal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/10/arsene-wenger-turned-down-manchester-united-love-arsenal","fields":{"headline":"Arsène Wenger says he turned down United as ‘I love the values of this club’","bodyText":"Arsène Wenger says his dedication to Arsenal’s values persuaded him to reject an offer from Manchester United in 2001 and continue his career at the north London club. High-profile suitors have been many during Wenger’s 21-year tenure but a move to United, who were Arsenal’s primary rivals for the Premier League title during the early part of the century, would have caused shockwaves. That is what Martin Edwards, the United chairman at the time, sought to achieve after Sir Alex Ferguson – in a decision he later reversed – announced that he would retire at the end of the 2001‑02 season but Wenger opted to turn down a proposal that he admits was attractive. “You should ask him,” Wenger said of Edwards after the latter claimed in his new autobiography that the pair met in London to discuss a move. “I am always very confidential. One day maybe I will get all the contacts I had during my stay at Arsenal and it would make a few chapters. You should ask Martin Edwards.” Pressed on why he would turn down United, who were the reigning champions when Edwards made his approach, Wenger was more expansive and explained he saw no reason to leave a club whose philosophy matched his own. “Because I love the values of this club and, for me, a club is about values first,” he said. “One day it would be a good chat to have with the press to look at the evolution. You speak about Manchester United, and the evolution in the last 20 years would be very interesting. A lot has changed but when I came here this club was about values that I love in sport. That is why I am still in the competition. “So I always question myself. Yes, of course, Manchester United is attractive but am I happy here? The answer was yes.” Wenger clarified that he was never tempted by a move to Old Trafford. “No, because I was always happy here,” he said. “More than people [were] happy with me, I was always happy here.” The last sentence resonates particularly at a period when the fault-lines around Arsenal are more pronounced than at any stage under Wenger. Saturday’s straightforward 3-0 win over Bournemouth went a small way towards salving the wounds inflicted by their crushing defeat at Liverpool on 27 August but, while the Emirates Stadium sounded content enough, there was little outward support for the manager. Nor was there unequivocal backing for Alexis Sánchez on the forward’s 74th-minute introduction, his first Arsenal appearance since a deadline day move to Manchester City broke down. Sánchez put in a bright enough cameo and Wenger said he had underlined his commitment in a training ground meeting after returning from international duty. “He is focused,” Wenger said. “He told me he is focused on the Premier League and the Europa League. On top of that he had a bad result with Chile against Bolivia but he came back full of desire and ready to play.” It is probably not a stretch to suggest that the reintegration of Sánchez, whether that extends merely to the January transfer window or through to the end of the season, may define this phase in Wenger’s stewardship but the noises from his dressing room are as positive as can be expected. Petr Cech, who was extended by an insipid Bournemouth team only during the last 10 minutes, said he had held his own conversation with Sánchez and was encouraged by the attitudes shown by the forward and another player of uncertain future, Mesut Özil. “I spoke with Alexis and he wants to win,” Cech said. “Some people say, ‘He does this, he does that.’ But I think he’s a guy who plays with all of his passion and all of his heart. You could see that in his performance. He came on and you could see he put a shift in. Mesut was outstanding as well … defensively, offensively, he put a huge amount of work into the game. That’s exactly what we expect and what we want.” Wenger has not decided whether Sánchez will play from the start in Thursday’s Europa League match with Cologne, which precedes a visit to Chelsea on Sunday. It is possible he will again be kept in reserve, with the manager admitting that the Premier League takes priority between now and the end of the group stage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/11/donald-trump-betrayed-republican-party","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T10:00:03Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump stabbed his party in the back.

It might just pay off","bodyText":"The mainstream, “establishment” Republican leadership made a cynical calculation to tolerate Donald Trump’s dangerous faults, believing they could use him to rubber-stamp their long-sought conservative legislative agenda. They made a bargain with a con man, and now he has betrayed them. His deal last week with Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi on debt limits and disaster spending is a huge political betrayal. But make no mistake: for Trump, it’s good politics. Americans are fed up with gridlock and dysfunction in the Washington DC “swamp,” and they blame Republicans as much as Democrats. Furthermore, the legislation which might pass by making deals with Democrats polls well across the political spectrum. The White House has even hinted at much broader cooperation on issues that are anathema to mainline conservatives – legislation to remedy the Daca dilemma, repealing the debt limit, which frequently puts us in danger of default, disaster aid for hurricane victims. There are rumors of some cooperation on tax reform (which give Democrats real leverage on tax breaks for billionaires.) And although nobody will admit it publicly, there is even whispered talk about fixing the problems with Obamacare. Meanwhile, back in the “swamp”, the establishment Republican leadership, hamstrung by their own caucus’ fractious fringe, the Freedom Caucus and Republican Study Committee, cannot deliver on any of this, even if they wanted to. But Trump’s loyal base wants action. Voters are angry at Congress, and most polling reveals that even Republican base voters support a much more progressive agenda than the party orthodoxy allows. (See here, here and here.) This empowers Trump to unhitch himself from people like Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan and other establishment Republican party leaders and venture forth on his own, making deals across the aisle, catering to his base and building a cult of personality broader and more powerful than the Republican party brand. However frightening the prospect of “Dear Leader” Trump might be, if he can find enough common ground with Democrats and Republican moderates, we might just see a breakthrough on a whole host of important legislation. If government actually started to function again, it might ease voters’ frustration levels and lower hyper-partisan political temperatures across the spectrum. All things being equal, that’s all to the good. But all things are not equal. Trump’s calculation ignores the one truly existential threat he faces: Russia. Trump craves adulation – praise to feed his outsized ego - and to get it he’s happy to betray friend and foe alike. But he also desperately needs the partisan protection of Congressional Republicans to shield him from Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian collusion and obstruction of justice, which is gathering steam every day. So far, Republicans in Congress have been doing just that. Despite the fact that most of them either openly dislike, distrust or disdain Trump, they have been careful to support their fellow Republican in the White House. But now he has stung them with the worst wound of all: betraying his own party. If he keeps it up, all bets are off. There was already a constant undercurrent of murmuring among Republicans that they would be better off with Pence. Now that Trump has monumentally pissed them off, there’s no reason to pretend anymore. If he keeps siding with Democrats over his own party, Mueller would be doing them a favor. In the short run, Trump’s gambit may be popular with voters, and if we’re lucky, it might even do some real bi-partisan good. But when time rolls around for Congress to judge “high crimes and misdemeanors,” just watch the Republicans abandon him.

The richest club in the world had the attacking might of Romelu Lukaku, Anthony Martial, Juan Mata, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford at their disposal. Nemanja Matic, the imposing £40m signing from Chelsea, offered brawn in midfield and there was no space on the bench for the new £31m centre-back Victor Lindelöf. Yet Mourinho pined for his sharp-elbowed Belgian nuisance, whose absence with a calf injury apparently left a team containing eight players taller than 6ft vulnerable to a classic Stoke City aerial bombardment. Mark Hughes, who was more than happy to continue his touchline contretemps with Mourinho, bristled at the perceived dig at Stoke’s supposed long-ball tactics. His team might possess physical power but they also have flair players and no longer rely on set pieces or Rory Delap’s long throws. “That’s just an easy swipe at us really,” the Stoke manager said. “You could argue United played more long balls and why wouldn’t they, because they’ve got power and pace and, if they can get those players ahead of the ball with good accuracy, they’ve got pace and power to burn. “I don’t know what the stats are but I’d argue that in general play they played more long balls than we did because they’ve got that threat and that’s what they try to exploit. I think it’s a bit lazy of people to keep on reverting to that ‘Stoke are a physical team’ thing.” Mourinho incorrectly and ungenerously claimed that only one team wanted to win. The truth is that United did not do enough to leave the Bet365 Stadium with the victory that would have taken them two points clear of Manchester City at the top of the table. Stoke, competitive and creative, were good value for a point. The sense lingered that Mourinho wanted to divert attention away from United’s flaws after they struggled to pass their first big test. United had momentum after beating West Ham, Swansea City and Leicester City without conceding a goal but they drifted out of the title race after a similarly dominant start last season. They finished sixth after drawing 15 times and qualified for the Champions League only by winning the Europa League. A disappointing league campaign was largely attributedto a shortage of ruthlessness during a transitional period. Fine players spurned a lot of chances, a weakness that flared on Saturday when Lukaku missed a late chance to score his second goal and make it 3-2. Yet it is too simplistic to conclude that better finishing alone will make United champions for the first time since 2013. In attack they boast enviable class and depth. They have skill, speed and craft. Rashford scored again, albeit fortunately, and Mkhitaryan created Lukaku’s goal with a beautifully disguised through-ball. But this is still a team striving for a smoother offensive rhythm. Too often play was slow or predictable and they did not create enough chances. There was not enough of a pattern, with players regularly not on the same wavelength. United have so many gifted forwards that there will always be individual flashes that lead to goals, but stubborn opponents such as Stoke are tough to wear down and that lack of refinement could hold them back. A game for Fellaini, though – what does that mean? That United, who were able to bring Martial, Mata and Jesse Lingard off the bench when it was 2-2, would have had a better chance of winning if they had spent the dying moments hurling the ball into the mixer for a big man to attack? Penalty box chaos: is this really the way forward for a team of United’s ambitions? Of course Mourinho spoke about Fellaini in defensive terms. Stoke’s equaliser came when Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting, who gave the hosts the lead in the first half when he beat Eric Bailly to Mame Biram Diouf’s cross, eluded Phil Jones and headed the excellent Xherdan Shaqiri’s corner past David De Gea. But the argument that Fellaini’s height would have helped was disingenuous. United are not a small side, especially after Matic’s arrival. They were ready for a battle, with Mourinho bolstering his midfield by dropping the creative Mata for the 6ft Ander Herrera. They conceded because of slack defending. Bailly was dozing for Choupo-Moting’s first goal and Jones was left in an embarrassed heap for the second. United return to the Champions League when they host FC Basel on Tuesday night. They are taking nothing for granted against the Swiss champions. “We have to know where we come from,” Herrera said. “We have come from the Europa League. We were sixth in the Premier League.” They are a developing team. But wherever they are going should be possible to reach without Fellaini."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/10/liverpool-womens-leadership-group-steve-rotheram","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T17:07:27Z","webTitle":"Liverpool women lobby all-male regional cabinet to hand over seats","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/10/liverpool-womens-leadership-group-steve-rotheram","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/10/liverpool-womens-leadership-group-steve-rotheram","fields":{"headline":"Liverpool women lobby all-male regional cabinet to hand over seats","bodyText":"Women in Liverpool have written an open letter to members of the all-male regional cabinet asking them to give up their seats and nominate female replacements. The Liverpool city region cabinet votes on all key decisions of the combined authority, along with the elected mayor, Steve Rotheram. The letter has been sent to Rotheram and cabinet members from the Women’s Leadership Group, a collective of Liverpool women that aims to tackle the lack of diversity in power and decision-making structures in the region. Rotheram has claimed his hands are tied because the constitution dictates that the cabinet has to comprise the six local authority leaders and the chair of the local enterprise partnership, who currently happen to be men. But the WLG point out that Rotheram’s counterpart in Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, changed his combined authority constitution so that both men and women would be represented at meetings from across the 10 local boroughs that make up the region. Only one of the 10 Greater Manchester leaders are women, but the nine men agreed to appoint female assistant leads to ensure balanced representation in meetings and around decision-making. Oldham council leader Jean Stretton, the sole female leader, appointed a man to assist her. In June, shortly after Rotheram’s election, furious female councillors in Liverpool wrote to the city region cabinet to express their disappointment. They said: “As women Labour members in Merseyside, we are all deeply disappointed at your recent announcement of an all-male city region cabinet. “We expect this from the Tories. We don’t expect it from Labour - the party of equality. Seven men have decided that none of the hundreds of thousands of Merseyside women are good enough to join them in cabinet.” The WLG, which includes representatives from business, politics, academia and the voluntary and not-for-profit sector, says Rotheram has an opportunity to modernise the constitution, to ensure the LCR is truly reflective of the people it serves. The WLG’s Tabitha Morton, who stood against Rotheram in the mayoral elections for the Women’s Equality party, said: “This is not just a social and political argument, but also an economic one. Women bring talent to the table and represent 51% of our communities. Not having women on the LCR board is not just a failure to harness the energy and ideas of innovators across the LCR, but it is a failure to recognise the breadth and depth of work that women input into both our social economy and our thriving businesses that holds the LCR communities together.” A recent report (pdf) by the Institute of Public Policy Research thinktank found that women are not only entirely absent among the new directly elected metro mayors but also represent just 4% of the leadership of England’s new devolved institutions – the combined authorities. This article was amended on 11 September 2017 to clarify that the IPPR report was referring to the new directly elected metro mayors."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/sep/11/england-the-ashes-selectors-joe-root-fast-bowlers","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T09:00:01Z","webTitle":"England put emphasis on tried and tested in selection thinking for Ashes | Vic Marks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/11/england-the-ashes-selectors-joe-root-fast-bowlers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/11/england-the-ashes-selectors-joe-root-fast-bowlers","fields":{"headline":"England put emphasis on tried and tested in selection thinking for Ashes","bodyText":"The handbrake on Ashes speculation has been released with the conclusion of the Test series against West Indies. This may not be a good thing but it is inevitable. Even Trevor Bayliss, usually so wary about looking too far ahead, seems eager to enter the fray with observations about who he would prefer to bat at three and the likely provenance of the tour party. After the Lord’s Test he said the squad was likely to comprise only players chosen in the past 18 months, which is bad news for any blind-side runners around the counties. For local readers it is possible to start on an optimistic note. England can set off for Australia with the No1 bowler in the world in their ranks. After nine more Test wickets at Lord’s, including his 500th, James Anderson now sits above the Indian spinners, the two Ravis, Jadeja and Ashwin. At 35 years of age Anderson remains a huge asset to a captain, wherever the Test is played. Of course wickets will be harder to come by under the clear blue skies and hard tracks of Australia. The necessity to treat that Kookaburra ball like a precious diamond in those opening overs contrasts with the pattern of play in England where the mischievous Duke ball can keep swinging all day. Yet there remains great virtue in having a bowler with the skill, control and nous of Anderson whatever the conditions. He will find the swing if it is available and he knows better than any modern fast bowler where the ball will land. However England may lack variety in their pack of fast bowlers for Australia, which is bound to include Chris Woakes and Toby Roland-Jones alongside the old firm. There is a shortage of pace and left‑handedness, which may not be solvable. Mark Wood has a few games to show that he can touch 90mph again, which is not the style of another contender, Jake Ball. Any “wildcard” may be housed among the Lions squad, which will also be in Australia when the Ashes series gets under way. There will, however, be more debate about the batsmen. The selectors are delaying the announcement of their squad so they have the option of journeying around the counties to watch some of the likely lads – or at least one of them, James Whitaker, does; presumably Mick Newell and Angus Fraser will be more concerned that their sides, Nottinghamshire and Middlesex respectively, regain or retain first‑division status. Bayliss can accept some responsibility this time for the final decisions. His hint that the party will be chosen from those who have already caught the selectors’ eye means that he will now have significant input to the final decision. No longer can he sit back and accept the selectors’ judgment. He has now seen the candidates play in Test cricket and – less importantly, but often more frequently – in the nets. At last he can make up his own mind. His insistence that he would like Joe Root to bat at No3 is interesting because it is so public and obviously at variance with the view of his captain with whom he has a very healthy relationship. It is also very Australian, though there have been plenty of relatively modern examples of the best Aussie batsmen in the side not batting at three: Allan Border, Steve Waugh, Michael Clarke and, sometimes – though not in their last Test in Bangladesh – Steve Smith. Currently Mark Stoneman and Dawid Malan, of the newcomers, look secure, though a few more runs for Surrey and Middlesex in the coming weeks would confirm their appetite for the fray. If Root is not intending to bat at No3 it might be useful from an England perspective if Surrey were to experiment a little by batting Stoneman there. It is one of the strengths of the Championship – it seems to matter so much – and a possible source of frustration for the England and Wales Cricket Board that Surrey would probably be reluctant to juggle their side accordingly at the sharp end of the season. Following the Bayliss indicator the form of Tom Westley, Haseeb Hameed, Gary Ballance, Alex Hales and Keaton Jennings in their remaining Championship matches should be of significance. The delicious uncertainties – at least for those looking on from afar – continue in the keeping and spinning departments. Who will be Jonny Bairstow’s understudy after a Test summer when the Yorkshire keeper has made very few mistakes? Recently that man has been Jos Buttler but given that he is such an integral part of England’s white-ball teams is it counterproductive to have him traipsing around Australia for a couple of months before he takes centre stage again? In this conversation Ben Foakes of Surrey is always mentioned. Moeen Ali’s understudy – and just conceivably his partner by the time the circus gets to Sydney – is another puzzle. The wrist-spinners seem to be the flavour of the month but Adil Rashid has been ditched; Mason Crane has been picked instead but never played. Logically one should have someone in the party who could replace Moeen if he turns an ankle on the morning of the match. He should probably be a finger spinner capable of giving solid support to the pacemen rather than a quixotic wrist spinner. No such men have been identified but a few candidates will have to be in Australia, either in the senior party or with the Lions come November. In the meantime enjoy the speculation over the best list of names for the tour, a rather more relaxing pastime for us armchair critics than it will be for the selectors over the next two or three weeks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/10/the-guardian-view-on-climate-change-see-you-in-court","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T19:12:05Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on climate change: see you in court | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/10/the-guardian-view-on-climate-change-see-you-in-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/10/the-guardian-view-on-climate-change-see-you-in-court","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on climate change: see you in court","bodyText":"Recent days have seen Houston, Texas literally sunk under sheer weight of rain, Carribbean islands battered by powerful storms barrelling across the Gulf and now Florida homes blasted by Irma, the largest of three hurricanes churning in the Atlantic basin. It seems almost certain that man-made climate change has a role in such events. Scientists used to be circumspect at attributing any single extreme event to global warming. No longer. Now scientists make the link between climate change and droughts in Kenya, record winter sun in Britain and torrential downpours in south-west China. The unmistakeable fingerprint of extreme weather at the crime scene of global warming seems intuitively obvious: consider that Houston is reckoned to have been hit by three “500-year floods” in three years. A 500-year flood does not have to happen only twice a millennium. But a run of three indicates that past climate is no longer a reliable guide to the present weather. The explanation is that the climate itself is changing. Such thinking should be a wake up call for the world, which has to understand how profoundly we must make a shift in the way we produce, distribute and consume energy, and how disruptive this will be for the real economy. While governments have, via the Paris agreement, signalled the end of the fossil-fuel era, the political processes by which states will decide how to meet their mitigation targets have been hijacked and influenced by Big Carbon. Fossil-fuel companies, hydrocarbon billionaires and their allies, particularly in the west, have for years now been funding a massive and sophisticated campaign to mislead voters about the environmental harm caused by carbon pollution. They have good reason to: a landmark study released earlier this year revealed 50 corporations account for more than one-fifth of all carbon released into the atmosphere since the industrial revolution began. The groundbreaking research not only helps establish legal accountability for climate change, it also weakens any corporate defence of wilful blindness. A major polluter cannot say it was going ahead with its activities because it was unaware its products caused great harm. Corporations have made handsome profits as the globe ended up a degree warmer than it should be. These polluters privatised the fossil-fuel profits and socialised the cost to the world’s poor, global taxpayers and future generations. Big Carbon entities and individuals who claim their lobbying activities are just an expression of their democratic rights sound a lot like Big Tobacco when it was denying the health dangers of smoking. Three major legal actions will test such thinking. First in the Philippines, where it is being determined whether polluters violated the human rights of Filipinos for their role in creating the conditions for Typhoon Haiyan, the strongest ever tropical storm to make landfall, which left more than 7,000 dead. Second in Germany, where a German utility company is being sued for costs associated with glacial lake flooding in Peru. Last in the US, where two California counties are suing 37 oil, gas and coal companies, claiming they knew their products would cause sea-level rise and coastal flooding, but failed to reduce their greenhouse gases. Fossil-fuel companies should be held accountable for the effects of climate change. Legal warfare has a two-fold aim: to overhaul transgressors’ business models so that they are in line with the global commitment to phase out fossil fuels and limit temperature rises to 1.5°C; and to get them to pay for damages resulting from global warming. Climate litigation is the inevitable result of a failure of two decades of talks. But it is also an important way of reframing the climate crisis as a human rights emergency."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/11/morning-mail-florida-under-siege-from-hurricane-irma","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T20:59:48Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Florida under siege from storm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/11/morning-mail-florida-under-siege-from-hurricane-irma","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/11/morning-mail-florida-under-siege-from-hurricane-irma","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Florida under siege from storm","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 11 September. Top stories Hurricane Irma has been downgraded to a category three storm as it makes landfall with Florida, where 2 million people have lost power. On Sunday the storm lashed low-lying western regions with winds of more than 200km/h, threatening record storm surges and flooding in urban areas around Tampa Bay, where many people remained in their homes despite days of evacuation orders from officials. Many poorer residents were simply unable to evacuate, as Irma exposed yawning wealth gaps in Florida. Almost 650km wide, Irma initially moved at 13km/h, slower than forecast, adding to concern that its most destructive potential lay in the threat of flooding. “You can’t hide from the water,” Florida senator Mark Rubio said. “That’s our biggest fear.” In downtown Miami cranes snapped off and were threatening nearby homes, while in Hollywood, Florida, a mix of rain and seawater covered the roads. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, will visit the island of St Martin on Tuesday, where about 95% of the buildings on the French-administered side were destroyed. More than 1,100 military, healthcare and relief personnel have been sent to the island, along with tens of thousands of rations. France has also sent police, in response to reports of widespread looting. Follow today’s developments on Hurricane Irma with the Guardian’s live blog. The fight over energy policy continues today in Canberra, as Malcolm Turnbull meets the head of AGL, Andy Vesey, to discuss the future of the Liddell power station. The National party MP Andrew Broad, chairman of parliament’s environment and energy committee, told Guardian Australia he believed the ageing plant was “about stuffed”. He urged a fresh approach, including a new federal loan mechanism to upgrade the coal fleet and a “lock in” mechanism for the clean energy target. Broad said that, rather than pursuing a piecemeal approach, the key to lower power prices for consumers was policy certainty. The government’s decision to withdraw financial support and housing from a group of asylum seekers and refugees has drawn formal complaints to three senior rapporteurs at the United Nations. The joint submissions from the the Human Rights Law Centre and the Geneva-based Global Initiative for Economic, Social and Cultural Rights call on the rapporteurs to urge the government to abandon its final departure bridging visas, reinstate housing and income support, and allow those seeking asylum to apply for refugee status in Australia. After Sunday’s huge march for marriage equality in Sydney, the Coalition and Labor appear close to a deal on legislation that would guarantee truth in advertising and provide protections against vilification during the campaign. Both major party leaders spoke in favour of a yes vote at the weekend – Bill Shorten at the Sydney rally and Malcolm Turnbull at the New South Wales Liberals and Nationals for Yes campaign launch. The acting special minister of state, Mathias Cormann, said on Sunday that discussions were continuing on the legislation and the Coalition wanted the campaign “to be fair to both sides of this argument”. Defeated US democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has given a candid TV interview calling Donald Trump’s inauguration speech “a cry from the white nationalist gut”. Speaking two days before the release of her book What Happened, Clinton said sitting onstage as Trump was sworn in was “an out-of-body experience” but her appearance was nessasary to present a unified front following a bitter election campaign. Trump’s dark-hued inauguration speech focused on a vision of “American carnage”, a supposed crime-riddled post-industrial dystopia the new president said only he could fix. In the wide-ranging interview, Clinton addressed everything from her missteps as a candidate to the shock of realising she would not become the first female president: “He was quite successful in referencing a nostalgia that would give hope, comfort, settle grievances, for millions of people who were upset about gains that were made by others,” Clinton said. Sport After the Wallabies’ draw with South Africa, Michael Cheika’s side appears to be progressing and regressing simultaneously, Bret Harris writes. But one fundamental flaw in their game is becoming alarmingly consistent – their inability to hold on to a lead. Friday night’s AFL finals victory over Geelong put Richmond supporters on a journey from “gut-wrenching tension” and “uncertainty and fear” to “a release of joy and freedom”, writes Craig Little. Richmond fans can finally breathe a sigh of relief, after sustaining a love that for nearly 40 years has been an ill-fated romance, so deeply knit into the psyche that it has inspired a cottage industry of elegiac football tales. Thinking time “Endometriosis has taken part of my life,” writes Guardian Australia’s opinion editor, Gabrielle Jackson. However, the often misunderstood disease may be reaching a turning point, with two members of the Australian parliament to meet the peak endometriosis associations from around the country to hear a list of demands. The health profession is showing some positive signs that current average diagnosis time of eight years can be reduced, Jackson writes. Audience involvement is required to stage everything from awkward first dates to a noodle-dough-pillow assault in the ludicrous and hilarious Chef: Come Dine With US at the Brisbane festival. Green Chef (Taemin Jung) and his moustachioed rival Red Chef (Seongmin Oh) are in a culinary showdown. After taking orders for various dishes from the audience – chicken noodle soup, pizza, bibimbap – the chefs compete with each other to concoct the tastiest and most impressive version of each dish. But the real star is the on-stage singing and dancing, puppetry and slapstick, which offers just enough utterly meaningless, totally absurd and thoroughly entertaining fun for one evening. New Zealand rugby must change its outdated attitudes towards women and sexual orientation, and get over its culture of entitlement, an independent review into the country’s beloved national sport has found. The Respect and Responsibility Review was commissioned by New Zealand Rugby after a string of serious incidents last year, where players from the Chiefs were accused of groping, licking and throwing gravel at an erotic dancer they had hired for their end-of-season party, as well as making homophobic comments to a gay couple. The review found that NZ Rugby had investigated 36 incidents of misconduct in the past four years, including cases of violence, inappropriate sexual comments, homophobia and drug and alcohol breaches.

Cracksman was a convincing winner of the Niel, one of the main trials for the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe, and would probably start second-favourite at around 5-1 were he to line up in three weeks’ time. His position in the market was also strengthened later in the day when Satono Diamond, Japan’s big hope for this year’s race and the 10-1 third-favourite, ran a dismal trial in the Prix Foy, finishing fourth of the six runners. Oppenheimer, though, feels that the rider on top is as important as the horse underneath. With Frankie Dettori, Cracksman’s regular jockey, all but certain to ride Enable, the even-money favourite, Oppenheimer feels that a run in the Arc might be better postponed until 2018. Many racing fans will struggle to understand the question here, never mind the answer. Cracksman is an improving, top-class three-year-old colt with form in the book that makes him a serious contender for the Arc. Next year he will give weight to the three-year-olds, and anyway, who knows what might happen in the next 12 months? Oppenheimer, though, insists that he is taking a long-term view. “Whether we run him in the Arc or the Champion Stakes [at Ascot in October], we’d prefer to put him away without giving him a hard race this year,” he said. “We think if we give him a hard race this year, it might take the sting off him next year. “That’s the gamble, do you keep this horse as a four-year-old, knowing everyone says he will be much better next year, or do you take a run in the Arc and get second or third and have a hard race without his [usual] jockey, because he will almost certainly be on Enable.” Oppenheimer also suggested John Gosden, who trains both Enable and Cracksman, will make the final decision, though few owners would not want a significant say in the outcome. “I think he might [wait until a few days before the race],” he said. “If Enable were not able to run for some reason, then it might change his plans.” Cracksman’s price for the Arc ranges from 5-1 to 10-1 as a result of the uncertainty over his place in the field, while Dshingis Secret, who was a ready winner of the Prix Foy, can be backed at around 16-1 to follow up in three weeks’ time. With Cracksman clearly a doubtful runner in the big race, though, one of the more significant potential trials for the Arc came in Ireland, where Order Of St George, third home behind Found last season, was an easy winner of the Group One Irish St Leger. Order Of St George finished fast but too late in the same race 12 months ago, and Ryan Moore took no chances this time as he sent Order Of St George to the front at the top of the long home straight. The five-year-old was cut to around 12-1 for this year’s Arc, though he is also the 6-4 favourite with Hills for the Long Distance Cup on Champions Day. Order of St George was Aidan O’Brien’s third Group One winner on Champions Weekend in Ireland, following Happily’s success in the Moyglare Stud Stakes earlier on the card. He missed out in the National Stakes, however, where Gustav Klimt, the likely favourite, was a late scratch and his three remaining contenders finished well beaten behind Jim Bolger’s Verbal Dexterity.O’Brien now has 17 Group One winners this year, but Hills eased him slightly, from 7-4 to 2-1, to beat Bobby Frankel’s long-standing record of 25 wins at the highest level in a season. Bolger has won the Dewhurst Stakes, Britain’s most prestigious two-year-old contest, five times in the past and feels that Verbal Dexterity is a worthy contender to make it six. “I can see him being champion European two-year-old, he’s the real deal, as good as any of the two-year-olds I’ve had,” Bolger said. “He needs the seven [furlongs], even though he has plenty of toe. Seven or a mile is his real cut. He handles any ground. He has a marvellous temperament, great looks. He has everything and is the complete package. “He’s as good as any of the ones that have won the Dewhurst for us, any of those five. I would think he’ll go for the Dewhurst next.” Ribchester was the other big winner on the Chantilly card as he made up for a shock defeat on soft ground in the Sussex Stakes last time out with success in the Prix du Moulin. Richard Fahey’s colt could now run in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes on Champions Day but is also be lined up for a crack at the Breeders’ Cup Mile in California just two weeks later.

The Metropolitan police’s parliamentary liaison and investigations team, set up in August 2016 after the murder of the Labour MP Jo Cox, has dealt with 71 complaints of “malicious communication”, which includes abusive messages or letters, 15 thefts and seven allegations of criminal damage. There were five reports of harassment and four of racially aggravated harassment between August 2016 and 20 July 2017. The figures were met with concern from MPs, many of whom have spoken out about abuse in recent months. Labour MP Rachael Maskell said the numbers were deeply worrying, adding that it was important that people spoke up about such crimes. She said: “That is about one in six MPs and I would want to know how these figures compare to the rest of society. It does show the vulnerability of people in public life who stand up to represent their communities.” Maskell, who was elected to York Central in 2015, added: “For me, day-to-day abuse is low. But I have had far-right groups sending me death threats following the death of Jo Cox, and the police were absolutely excellent at addressing this. “We have to make sure that we have the right legislation so everyone is protected … Certainly from talking to colleagues a lot of the abuse has been online, not exclusively but it seems like most of it takes place with people behind screens.” Tom Watson, the deputy leader of the Labour party, said the figures were “shocking but sadly not surprising”. He said: “A number of our colleagues have been threatened with violent retribution if they voted in a particular way … we cannot let intimidation undermine our democracy in this way. Harassment and bullying on social media is not unique to MPs. These figures show why big platforms like Twitter and Instagram have got to get their house in order.” Tom Brake MP, the Lib Dem MP for Carshalton and Wallington, said the figures showed “an alarming level of crimes committed against MPs. The level of aggression towards MPs and public servants, particularly on social media, must be toned down. If not, parliament will be the poorer as high quality candidates are put off by the level of abuse”. The new Met figures come after Theresa May ordered an investigation into intimidation experienced by parliamentary candidates during the last election. May asked the committee on standards in public life to prepare a report, saying she was “horrified” by stories from colleagues about “intimidation, bullying and harassment”. The committee will hear evidence from various MPs, the CPS, the parliamentary director of security, the National Police Chiefs Council and the deputy speaker on Thursday as part of its inquiry. A number of MPs have called for an end to anonymity online and said there should be a new code of conduct for members of political parties, which will be considered by the committee as it prepares to put forward recommendations to No 10. The report is due to be delivered before Christmas. In her maiden speech Labour MP Rosie Duffield last week said: “Before I speak a little more about my constituency, I want to mention the so-called ‘trolling’ of my, mostly female, colleagues over the summer. I have already experienced a fair amount of trolling myself. This ranges from ill-informed, badly researched articles published as fact to unpleasant personal messages late at night, and vile, vitriolic insults from a small, but persistent, handful of activists from other parties posted online.” She added: “Groups such as Glitch UK and Reclaim the Internet, led by my colleague my Rt Hon Friend Yvette Cooper and many of my other friends and colleagues in this house, are deserving of our support. We must continue to fight against this and highlight the problem.” A spokesperson for the committee on standards in public life said: “Hearing reports of intimidation experienced by parliamentary candidates, MPs and others, it is clear that too many individuals in public life have had experiences that nobody should have to go through.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/09/pauline-hanson-took-four-months-to-repay-air-fares-claimed-for-norfolk-island-trip","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T20:00:48Z","webTitle":"Pauline Hanson took four months to repay air fares claimed for Norfolk Island trip","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/09/pauline-hanson-took-four-months-to-repay-air-fares-claimed-for-norfolk-island-trip","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/09/pauline-hanson-took-four-months-to-repay-air-fares-claimed-for-norfolk-island-trip","fields":{"headline":"Pauline Hanson took four months to repay air fares claimed for Norfolk Island trip","bodyText":"The One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, sought to charge taxpayers nearly $3,000 to fly to Norfolk Island last year, then told the Senate she had travelled there at her own expense. But at the time she made her statement to the Senate, government officials were chasing her for a reimbursement. It took her four months to repay the debt. Officials sent an initial invoice, and two reminder invoices, before she finally reimbursed taxpayers in March this year. Hanson travelled to Norfolk Island on 18 October 2016 and returned on 21 October 2016 with her chief adviser, James Ashby. She toured the island on the invitation of Norfolk Island People for Democracy. When she returned to Australia, she asked the Turnbull government to underwrite a plan to connect Norfolk Island to a new fibre optic cable stretching between Australia and New Zealand. Freedom of information documents reveal that two weeks after Hanson returned to Australia on 21 October, a representative for One Nation called the Department of Finance, on 2 November, seeking clarification about whether or not Hanson was allowed to charge taxpayers for the trip. The department told Hanson’s representative she was not entitled to charge taxpayers, and an invoice for $2,911.70 worth of flights was sent to Hanson, via her representative, on 4 November. On 8 November, Hanson told the Senate about her trip to Norfolk Island, saying she had paid for the trip herself. “Last month, at the request of the local community, I travelled to Norfolk Island at my own expense,” Hanson said, as Hansard recorded. But documents show Hanson had not repaid the money at that point. They show the Department of Finance had to send Hanson a reminder email more than two months later, on 24 January 2017, requesting a reimbursement of the airfares. A letter accompanying the reminder email said: “I refer to previous correspondence regarding your outstanding invoice. The total amount of $2,911.70 … remains debt owing to the commonwealth and we are writing to seek repayment. As this debt is now overdue, I appreciate your immediate attention to settlement.” Hanson may not have replied to the reminder email, because the department had to send a second reminder invoice – a month later, on 22 February. It was not until 8 March that Hanson’s outstanding debt to taxpayers was paid. In June, Ashby told Guardian Australia Hanson would have reimbursed taxpayers for her Norfolk Island trip before she told the Senate she had travelled at her own expense. But on Friday, when contacted by Guardian Australia, he said that when he made that statement, it was an assumption. He said the fact Hanson’s air fares were not repaid until March was an “oversight,” and he was unaware the Department of Finance had made several requests to her ofice for repayment. “In Pauline’s defence, it was left for the office to pay [for the trip],” he said. “It would have simply been that she had instructed the office to do it but hadn’t thought anything more of it, thinking the matter was dealt with. “I gotta admit, Pauline receives on average of over 2,000 emails a day, so sometimes those things can get lost. “Quite clearly it’s an oversight. Does she deserve hanging, quartering? That’s your call I guess.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2017/sep/08/pierre-berge-yves-saint-laurent-co-founder-and-true-prince-of-culture-dies-at-86","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T11:33:43Z","webTitle":"Pierre Bergé, Yves Saint Laurent co-founder and ‘true prince of culture’, dies at 86","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/sep/08/pierre-berge-yves-saint-laurent-co-founder-and-true-prince-of-culture-dies-at-86","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/sep/08/pierre-berge-yves-saint-laurent-co-founder-and-true-prince-of-culture-dies-at-86","fields":{"headline":"Pierre Bergé, Yves Saint Laurent co-founder and ‘true prince of culture’, dies at 86","bodyText":"Pierre Bergé, the French fashion tycoon, philanthropist and art collector who was the driving force behind the creation of the Yves Saint Laurent fashion house, has died at the age of 86 following a long illness. Bergé was one of the most influential business figures on the French cultural scene, known for his very public long-term personal and business relationship with the designer Saint Laurent, which captured the public imagination and inspired a series books and films. From 1961, when the two men founded the fashion house, the tough Bergé led the business side, while the shy Saint Laurent created the designs that would shape French style throughout the 60s and 70s. Bergé was a passionate bibliophile and art collector, amassing two of the world’s top private art and rare books collections with Saint Laurent. He also campaigned for gay rights and donated a large part of his fortune to Aids research. In 2010, he was part of a group of business figures who took over the struggling daily French newspaper Le Monde, and was chairman of the supervisory board at the newspaper. The former Socialist French culture minister, Jack Lang, led tributes on Friday, calling Bergé a “true prince of the arts and culture”. Always politically engaged, Bergé was an important backer and confidant of the late French Socialist president François Mitterrand and later backed other Socialist presidential candidates including François Hollande. In January this year, he threw his weight behind the centrist newcomer, Emmanuel Macron, who went on to win the presidency in May. Although backing Macron “wholeheartedly”, Bergé at the same time lamented the decline of the Socialist party. “A whole part of our collective citizen and artistic memory dies with Pierre Bergé,” Macron said in a statement, praising Bergé’s genius for creating “beauty and excellence” wherever he could. Hollande described Bergé as “an exceptional man of conviction who defended the idea of equal rights for all”. The leftwing MP Jean-Luc Mélenchon praised Bergé’s contributions to the fight against racism, to Aids research and to supporting the arts, lauding him as someone who “did not devote his life to his money”. Bergé was born on the Île d’Oléron in the west of France, the son of a tax official and teacher. As a rebellious teenager in La Rochelle, he left school early intent on seeking his fortune in the cultural world of the capital. His story was an extraordinary saga of a self-made man who, from a modest start, ended up holding one of the world’s most valuable art and books collections. Shortly after arriving in Paris he was walking on the Champs Élysées when the poet Jacques Prévert fell from a window and nearly landed on top of him. “He fell. Comme ça!” Bergé told the Observer in 2009. “They took him to the hospital. I didn’t know it was Jacques Prévert. I learnt later from the newspaper.” Bergé took this strange and surreal fall as a sign that the city was his natural place to be. He began working in antique books, scouring bookstalls along the Seine for treasures, built up a network of influential friends and worked in art promotion. In 1958, the 28-year-old Bergé met Saint Laurent, who was six years younger. They began an intense relationship that would last the rest of their lives, morphing into a friendship, business partnership and joint ownership of an art and books collection. When Bergé met Saint Laurent, the talented young artist and designer had taken over as head designer at the house of Dior. Saint Laurent’s spring collection had made him a star, but when Dior let Saint Laurent go shortly afterwards, Bergé decided they should set up their own label and turn it into an empire. Saint Laurent, who was as shy as Bergé was outspoken, suffered periods of depression and Bergé became a driving force, organising the business and caring for him. Bergé became known as the imposing figure who “took care of everything”. Saint Laurent said of Bergé in 2001: “Everything I didn’t have, he had. His strength meant I could rest on him when I was out of breath.” Bergé and Saint Laurent were joined in a civil union a few days before the designer died of a brain tumour in 2008 aged 71. In recent years, Bergé decided to sell his and Saint Laurent’s vast book collection and part of their art collection, donating large sums to Aids research and the two men’s charitable foundation. Two museums dedicated to the life and work of Saint Laurent, financed by the foundation that the two men founded, are to open in Paris and Morocco this year. In March 2017, Bergé married the American garden designer Madison Cox, vice-president of the Bergé-Saint Laurent foundation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/08/uk-exports-eu-weak-pound-trade-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T16:58:50Z","webTitle":"UK exports outside EU fall despite weak pound","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/08/uk-exports-eu-weak-pound-trade-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/08/uk-exports-eu-weak-pound-trade-europe","fields":{"headline":"UK exports outside EU fall despite weak pound","bodyText":"Britain’s efforts to expand trade in goods beyond the European Union’s border took a knock in July after official figures showed the UK’s deficit with the rest of the world widened following a drop in exports. The deficit in the trade in goods with non-EU countries widened by £2.4bn while exports to the EU grew to cut the trade gap by £1.3bn. The figures were released as a new report from thinktank the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said economic growth shows signs of accelerating in the UK, albeit still at a slower pace than in recent years. Analysts had expected the fall in the pound to give a significant boost to exports with the EU and beyond, but the trend since last year’s Brexit vote has shown only a gentle increase in exports and a continuing appetite for imports, despite the higher cost, leaving only a marginal improvement in the net trade position. Overall, UK exports of goods and services edged down 0.2% month on month in July and were up just 0.6% from one quarter to the next. At the same time the eurozone is showing signs of outpacing the UK as the fall in sterling fails to lift exports as much as expected. The Office for National Statistics added to the gloomy economic news with data showing that the manufacturing sector remained “subdued” in July and the construction industry suffered a large drop in new orders in the three months to the end of June, especially in the housebuilding sector. Manufacturers improved their output, though this only meant reducing the loss of production of 0.6% in June to 0.1% in July. The ONS said a flurry of new car models helped the motor industry recover ground lost earlier in the year. The news came as the second of the UK’s new generation of aircraft carriers, HMS Prince of Wales, was officially named in a ceremony at Rosyth Naval Dockyard on Friday. Liam Fox, the trade secretary, said 90% of the suppliers for the construction of the £3bn boat and its sister ship, HMS Queen Elizabeth, were based in the UK. Set against the positive picture for manufacturing, there was worse news for the construction sector. Output dipped by 1.2% in July, the fourth consecutive month of contraction, while new orders fell to the lowest level since 2014 following an 8% slump. In a damaging development for the government, housing orders were down almost 10% on a year ago with public housing the worst affected. Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club forecasting group, described the trade, construction and manufacturing data as a “mixed bag” that showed the upbeat signals from some manufacturing industry surveys was starting to register in official data, though the trade and construction data “point to a UK economy still struggling to break out of sluggish growth”. ONS senior statistician Kate Davies said: “Manufacturing remains relatively subdued since the start of the year, though July showed the first significant monthly growth of 2017, with car production increasing partly thanks to new models rolling off the production lines. The usual period of summer maintenance of North Sea oil platforms also failed to materialise for a second month running. Lee Hopley, the chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers’ trade body, said there was some good news from the export figures, which revealed “robust numbers on manufactured exports”. She said: “Double-digit year-on-year growth is carrying through to the start of the second half of the year. But the need to import materials and components at the same rate means the overall deficit isn’t budging.” Industrial production appears to be helping to bolster GDP growth after the worst start to the year since 2012. The economy is expected to have grown by 0.4% in the three months to the end of August, according to NIESR. While that’s still below the long run trend of about 0.6%, it’s an improvement on the three months to the end of July, when the economy grew by just 0.2%. The mixed signals on the economy add to the conundrum facing interest rate setters at the Bank of England as they prepare to meet on Thursday. Rising inflation, hitting 2.6% in July and expected to head higher over the coming months, would usually be enough for Threadneedle Street to put up its base interest rate. But weak growth and the stuttering Brexit talks will probably convince them to stay put, according to economists. Philip Shaw, of City bank Investec, said the monetary policy committee will probably keep rates steady until 2019, while a rate hike this year is “very unlikely”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2017/sep/08/politics-live-readers-edition-friday-8-september","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T08:04:38Z","webTitle":"Politics Live - readers' edition: Friday 8 September","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/sep/08/politics-live-readers-edition-friday-8-september","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2017/sep/08/politics-live-readers-edition-friday-8-september","fields":{"headline":"Politics Live - readers' edition: Friday 8 September","bodyText":"I’m not writing my usual blog today but here, as an alternative, is the Politics Live readers’ edition.

It’s not a great over, however, and Chase survives comfortably. The West Indies will lead by 22 overnight after another fascinating day, in which James Anderson took his 500th Test wicket and then got in a rare old huff. Thanks for your company, goodnight. 30th over: West Indies 93-3 (S Hope 35, Chase 3) Anderson has changed ends. He should be able to get off the pitch easier, because of the slope, and he’s no longer at Marais Erasmus’s end. His first delivery is a nasty lifter that Hope deals with beautifully, softening his hands to drop it short of gully. There should be time for one last over. 29th over: West Indies 93-3 (S Hope 35, Chase 3) Anderson is still moaning at Erasmus. I’m not sure why, because replays show he was running on the pitch. The umpiring in this game has been almost perfect. Anyway, Anderson’s been replaced by Stuart Broad, a sensible decision from Root. He probably wasn’t expecting to bowl, and his first delivery is a wide loosener that Hope slams square on the off side for four. It’s increasingly hard not to get carried away about how good he could be. He’s almost comically calm. If you drop a marmot in the bath his heart wouldn’t skip a beat. 28th over: West Indies 88-3 (S Hope 30, Chase 3) Shai Hope plays another sizzling drive between extra cover and mid off for four. England have lost their discipline in the last 15 minutes and, while I still think they’ll win this game, it’s a lot closer than most people think. 27th over: West Indies 81-3 (S Hope 23, Chase 3) Anderson is still going into the danger zone in his followthrough, and could easily be pulled out of the attack. Erasmus has another chat with him at the end of the over. It’s excellent umpiring, fair and quietly authoritative. Anderson has been given a second warning by Marais Erasmus. One more and he can’t bowl in the innings. From the next ball, Erasmus turns down a big LBW appeal when Chase pushes around an inswinger. Anderson immediately turns away in disgust. I thought it was swinging past leg stump, but Joe Root has decided to risk England’s last review. Yes, it’s missing the leg stump by a fair distance. That’s a shocking review from England. 26th over: West Indies 79-3 (S Hope 23, Chase 1) West Indies lead by eight runs. There are 17 minutes left before the close of play. If England don’t get another wicket tonight they might be in a little bit of trouble over the weekend. Shai Hope falls over a big inswinger from Stokes and is hit on the pad, prompting a huge appeal for LBW. Chris Gaffaney says not out and England review. Replays show it did too much and would have missed the stumps both on height and line. More terrific umpiring from Gaffaney, who has had a magnificent match. 25th over: West Indies 77-3 (S Hope 21, Chase 1) One of the interesting things about Anderson is that in the last two years he averages 19 with the ball. That would be outstanding at any age, never mind as you approach your mid-30s. Hope inside edges him just wide of leg stump for four, and then Anderson is warned for stepping on the danger area in his follow through. Anderson, the loveable grump, takes it as well as you might expect, chuntering to everyone and no one as he strides off at the end of the over. 24th over: West Indies 72-3 (S Hope 16, Chase 1) Ben Stokes is dispensing unpleasantries at Roston Chase, who was similarly vocal during Stuart Broad’s innings. Shai Hope, the man on strike, calmly takes a single off the last ball to keep strike. 23rd over: West Indies 69-3 (S Hope 14, Chase 0) Powell played so well, but that delivery was the definition of unplayable. The new batsman Roston Chase survives a big appeal first ball for a strangle down the leg side. England don’t review, and replays confirm it hit him on the thigh. James Anderson strikes with the fourth ball of a new spell! That is a quite stunning delivery. It angled in from around the wicket, turned Powell round and then straightened like an off-break to trim the off bail. 22nd over: West Indies 65-2 (Powell 41, S Hope 14) Hope reaches to push-drive Stokes through extra cover for four. An affronted Stokes rams consecutive bouncers past the head of Hope, who then steers four more to third man. Excellent stuff from both men. “How about Alan Oakman?” says David Murfin. “Wiki entry includes ‘his telescopic skill as a close fielder snared him five catches in Jim Laker’s famous 19 wicket haul at Old Trafford, and totalled 594 catches in his career’.” 21st over: West Indies 57-2 (Powell 41, S Hope 6) Anderson is getting loose, presumably to replace Roland-Jones at this end. West Indies look comfortable at the moment and have reduced the deficit to 14. 20th over: West Indies 55-2 (Powell 40, S Hope 6) Hope repels a booming inswinger from Stokes. The ball hasn’t done quite as much as it did yesterday, when Stokes got swing that we are contractually obliged to describe as “lavish”. Hope only has six from 32 balls but he looks excellent again. How on earth did he have a Test average of 19 before Headingley? Everything about him, from his demanour to his cover drive, suggests potential greatness. 19th over: West Indies 51-2 (Powell 40, S Hope 6) Two more boundaries to Powell, both through the covers off Roland-Jones. The first was a tremendous drive. My colleague Tim de Lisle points out that he is approaching his first Test fifty since November 2012. Meanwhile, thanks to Brian Withington this clip of Roger Harper’s futuristic fielding. 18th over: West Indies 43-2 (Powell 32, S Hope 6) Powell thick-edges Stokes for four. It’s really dark at Lord’s now, a lovely time to bowl; as such 43 for two is a really good effort from the West Indies. I’m surprised you can still get odds of 8/1 on a Windies victory. “Besides Roger Harper, surely Jonty Rhodes owed at least some of his Test appearances to his fielding?” wonders Geoff Wignall. “I’m struggling to think of any English examples though. It wasn’t enough for Randall to hold down his place and he was truly outstanding in the field.” Yes possibly, though – not unlike England now – they never had that many contenders for top-order places, and often relied on their lower middle-order batting. They had a lot of Westleys and Jennings too. Rhodes was decent, though I agree that he only really looked a top-class Test batsman on that tour of England in 1998. 17th over: West Indies 38-2 (Powell 27, S Hope 6) Roland-Jones has a biggish LBW appeal agianst Shai Hope turned down on the not unreasonable grounds that there was a big inside edge. Powell and Hope have to cope with that horrible combination of attacking fields and a broken scoreboard. You don’t know where your next run is coming from and you feel like your wicket is under threat all the time. After 16 consecutive dot balls, Hope drives sweetly through the covers for four. “There is a precedent for knighting a cricketer while he’s still playing,” notes John Starbuck. “Sir Richard Hadlee.” Good point. Wasn’t he knighted during that series in 1990? I thought Her Majesty missed a trick by not formally acknowledging the entertainment provided by Trevor Franklin at Lord’s, though. 15th over: West Indies 34-2 (Powell 27, S Hope 2) Shai Hope looks calm and composed, this being a weekday, and plays out a maiden from Roland-Jones. Time for drinks. “TMS reckon Broad has had five dropped just in this series,” says John Starbuck. “You can account for some by the amount of poor light they’ve had to put up with sometimes, not to mention the pink ball, but I don’t think any of the newer crowd has made his mark as a fielder. There’s usually one or two, but the last was probably Mark Wood. Could being a very good fielder swing it for anyone’s selection?” The West Indies spinner Roger Harper, an astonishing fielder, played some Tests in which he hardly bowled and batted down the order, though that was invariably because the fast bowlers had routed some poor sods for 77. 14th over: West Indies 34-2 (Powell 27, S Hope 2) Ben Stokes replaces Stuart Broad. Powell survives the hat-trick ball, Stokes having taken wickets with his last two deliveries of the first innings. There is immediate swing, however, which is extremely good news for England. “Interesting, the ‘Sir James’ thing,” says Richard Morris. “Very unlikely to happen. Only 10 Englishmen ever knighted for services to Cricket, last was Bedser in 1996. Even Botham wasn’t - he was knighted for services to Charity. Best pull on the walking boots if Jimmy wants a trip to the Palace.” That was before digital mob rule though. I’d definitely bet 500 pence that he and Cook will be knighted at some stage, though I’ve been throwing imaginary bets all over the place this afternoon so I wouldn’t take me seriously. 13th over: West Indies 30-2 (Powell 23, S Hope 2) It was in the summer of 2010 that Jimmy really started to move towards greatness. In the first seven years of his Test career he took 156 wickets at 34.81; in the seven and a half years since he’s picked up 344 at 24.39. His record is much better at home, but that shouldn’t obscure some mighty spells in the landmark series victories in Australia (2010-11) and India (2012-13), not to mention some ridiculous performances in the UAE. He made himself into a great all-weather bowler. 12th over: West Indies 30-2 (Powell 23, S Hope 2) Powell swivel-pulls Broad majestically for four, one of the shots of the day. It might be time for Stokes at that end. “My hunch is that they will attempt to fix one problem by breaking something that’s working very well and move Moeen up to number three, allowing them to bring in Mason Crane,” says Matt Emerson. “It’s a terrible idea, which is why it appeals...” That would be so England, though I doubt Moeen will ever bat in the top three again after that experiment against Pakistan. I think the team for the Gabba will be: Cook, Stoneman, Ballance/Hameed (depending on whether Root digs his heels in), Root, Malan, Stokes, Bairstow, Moeen, Woakes, Broad, Anderson. 11th over: West Indies 25-2 (Powell 19, S Hope 1) There are still 29 overs remaining tonight, though I doubt we’ll get them all. Toby Roland-Jones comes on to replace the future Sir James Anderson and has an instant impact: Powell toe-ends one short of the slips before being beaten by a kicking leg-cutter. It’ll be fascinating to see how Roland-Jones does in Australia; Gus Fraser struggled there, certainly after his hip injury, apart from one magical day on a juiced-up wicket at Sydney. An interesting tweet here from Tim. My first thought was Pietersen, though I feel slightly dirty saying that given Anderson’s superior artistry. 10th over: West Indies 21-2 (Powell 15, S Hope 0) “Rob,” says Stephen Kear, “do you have any idea how many wickets Broad has missed out on this summer due to poor English catching? I get the feeling he has missed a hatful which may explain why his stats are not as good as usual.” Fair point. Seven in this series apparently. I still don’t think he’s been anywhere near his best, though. I suppose it shows how good he is that he can be below par, have loads of catches dropped and still average in the mid-30s for the summer. That said, I think it’s the first time since 2008 that he’s averaged over 30 in an English summer. Broad is rewarded for a really good new-ball spell. Hope drives all around a fine, full-length delivery that comes back through the gate to hit the pad in line with off stump, and Chris Gaffaney raises the finger. Hope reviews - more in his name than expectation - but replays show it was hitting the top of the stumps. 9th over: West Indies 20-1 (Powell 15, K Hope 1) An unplayable outswinger from Anderson beats Powell’s defensive poke. There have been a lot of false strokes in this innings, though most have been due to good bowling rather than bad batting. Powell has started to settle down after a dreadful start. “Why are we picking on Stoneman?” says Simon Thomas. “He’s only played three matches and did OK in the second. He’ll play in the first Test for sure.” I agree. It used to be that openers got seven Tests; Stoneman was being written off by some after two innings, one of which was ended by a jaffa. And Malan, for all his stodginess, has made fifties in the last two Tests, so I think he’ll play at Brisbane too. 8th over: West Indies 17-1 (Powell 12, K Hope 1) Broad is too straight to Powell, who clips him confidently off the pads for four. 7th over: West Indies 12-1 (Powell 7, K Hope 1) This is an almighty test for Powell and Hope, with Anderson and Broad bowling majestically in helpful conditions. Hope is beaten again by Anderson. On Sky, Ian Ward points out that, when Brathwaite was bowled, Jonny Bairstow charged to the boundary to retrieve the ball so that Anderson could hold it up to the crowd. That’s a nice touch from a consummate team man. “I’m not Gaz Baz’s biggest fan, would they take a punt on someone like Sam Robson (oodles of runs) or Nick Gubbins (plays the short ball well)?” says Dean Ainsworth. “In the case of Robson, without a specialist #3, perhaps a spare opener would work, although I’m always reminded of Ian Healy’s second ball sledge to new No3 Mark Butcher in 1998-99...” Yeah, I think that’s a strong possibility. Root loves Ballance, so it depends how that conversation goes, but if it’s not him I think they will pick an opener, probably Hameed, to bat after Cook and Stoneman. I think Malan will play in Brisbane, though whether he should is a different debate. 6th over: West Indies 11-1 (Powell 6, K Hope 1) Broad cuts Hope in half with a cracking delivery, then beats the outside edge next ball. He’s resembling Stuart Broad in this spell, and later in the over he beats the outside edge again with a monstrous legcutter. The lights are still on, which is definitely helping England. If I was a West Indian I’d be pretty hacked off about that. 5th over: West Indies 10-1 (Powell 6, K Hope 0) Powell is batting like Stuart Broad. That’s not a compliment, not for an opening batsman. He is beaten at least three times in that Anderson over, once after a quite disgusting yahoo. “Call me a risk-taker, but can anyone deny that replacing Stoneman, Westley and Malan with Hales, Buttler and Morgan makes a really strong statement to the Aussies that attack is the best form of defence?” says Kimberley Thonger. “If only one of the three comes off in any innings he’d probably contribute more runs.” I admire the philosophy, but it reminds a bit of an old quote from the football writer Henry Winter: “Picking Stewart Downing would be a statement of intent to the rest of the world.” 4th over: West Indies 10-1 (Powell 6, K Hope 0) I’ve seen it all now. Powell edges Broad to gully, where the usually perfect Stokes makes a rare hash of a simple chance. It went straight through his hands to hit him in the chest. Powell then edges a big yahoo just over the slips for four. 3rd over: West Indies 6-1 (Powell 0, K Hope 0) That was the last ball of the over. Amid all the excitement, the dismissal of Brathwaite is a big moment in the game. “You’re suggesting that England can pick a specialist batsman rather than Woakes who would then outscore him by 25 runs per innings?” says Geoff Wignall. “Really? Do you have evidence for this fantasy? Even if the point regards Roland-Jones instead, you’d still need to identify a batsman who’ll be able to average 40+. Who? Also Broad and Anderson, both of whom I expect to play form notwithstanding, have had enough injury problems to make a fifth seamer a handy form of insurance. Though I’d still like to see four seamers and two spinners.” No, I’m suggesting playing Woakes at No9 to reinforce a weak top order. Even if the No2 averages 20, it’s better than having a No9 who averages 10, with Woakes pushed up to No8. England need every run they can get. Have we learned nothing from all those Tesco’s adverts? More to the point, the No2 might average 40, or 60, or 80. Why do they have to average 40? Andrew Strauss didn’t average 40 in the 2005 Ashes, and England wouldn’t have won it without him. They might not have won it without Ian Bell, and he averaged 17. And two finger spinners, in Australia? Good one. It was a brilliant delivery from Anderson: on a full length and roaring back through to the gate to bowl Brathwaite. He didn’t have to wait long; that was his 12th delivery of the innings It all started here against Zimbabwe 14 years ago, when he was a talented kid with diabolical hair, and now he has 500 Test wickets. By the end of his career, he should have more Test wickets than any fast bowler in history. He’s an old don with a sober haircut these days, an absolute master of his craft whose returns have been better than ever in the last couple of years. All the England balcony are on their feet, and Anderson smiles almost sheepishly as he raises the ball to the crowd. James Anderson becomes the first Englishman to take 500 Test wickets! 2nd over: West Indies 5-0 (Brathwaite 4, Powell 1) Stuart Broad starts at the Nursery End. It’s a lovely evening at Lord’s, yet the lights are still on; no idea why. A loose ball is put away for four by Brathwaite. “Afternoon Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “Re John Withington’s cocktails, I emailed a suggestion yesterday, but, like all of my best work, it wasn’t published. It happened also to be the best cocktail ever invented.” Someone really should create the Beefy, a 72% ABV unwinder that never gives you hangovers. 1st over: West Indies 0-0 (Brathwaite 0, Powell 0) Jimmy Anderson, 499 not out, gets a mighty cheer as he prepares to bowl the first over. A tense series decider has temporarily turned into a testimonial. There’s a little bit of early swing, nothing dramatic, and Brathwaite plays out a maiden. “With grim inevitability, you just know it will be Ballance at No3 in Brisbane,” says Colin Dean. “But surely there’s a stronger case for Alex Hales?” I don’t think there is, personally. I’d love Hales to succeed at Test level but I can’t see it, certainly not in the top three. There might be an argument to have him as a loose cannon at No5, though I’d probably prefer Buttler or Morgan in such a role. Buttler played really well in India; I hope he gets another chance at some stage. It won’t happen, but I’d give Stokes the new ball - both on merit as a full-length swing bowler, and also to give Broad a rousing boot up the trousers. The Lord’s honours board hat-trick “Colin Noble is correct!” says Michael Bate. “I did say Stokes would be the 4th Englishman to achieve it. Miller is, of course, the only visiting team player to have managed it and Botham the only one to have done it in a single year - 1978 against NZ/Pakistan.” “However we disagree over bowlers and all-rounders from 3 to 9.. .that Broad fella can bat a bit, can’t he?” says David Hindle. “Must have heard Geoff Wignall from a few overs ago!” This England team is so weird. The tail starts at 2 and ends at 6. Here’s a question for you all: who will (not who should) bat No3 at Brisbane? I haven’t a clue. I don’t think Root will move and Westley won’t be picked. My money’s on, and you’ll like this, Gary Ballance, with Hameed as an outside bet. Broad’s fun comes to an end when he toe-ends another hack through to Dowrich. England lead by 71, having added 60 for the last two wickets. That’s tea. We’ll be back in 15 minutes, when Jimmy Anderson, who has 499 Test wickets, will endeavour to sate the needs of stattos across the globe. 52nd over: England 193-9 (Broad 38, Anderson 7) Broad backs away again to slap Roach over backward point for six more! When the Joy of Six: Comedy Slogfests is written, this Broad innings will be a contender. Roach, who has bowled throughout this session, responds with a vicious bouncer that hits Broad on the body. This must be so demoralising for the West Indies, a bit like the dreaded Dave Richardson/Paul Adams stand in another low-scoring series decider at Cape Town in 1996. I’m still not over that. 51st over: England 185-9 (Broad 32, Anderson 6) Anderson drives Holder handsomely for four. Shane Warne, commentating on Sky, wonders whether batting is getting easier now that the sun is out. There’s certainly a party atmosphere as Broad and Anderson swing merrily. Broad moves into the thirties with a lusty slap down the ground for three. “The argument is simple,” says David Hindle. “In the current circumstances, there are no specialist batsmen of sufficient quality available. Hence, Woakes is a better bat than any “specialist” alternative. You are strengthening both A and B, but in a very unorthodox fashion. However, needs must....” Yes but you would still lose runs, even if it’s just an average of 25 per innings, by taking a batsman out. If you only pick specialist batsmen of proven quality, then Ben Stokes would be coming in at No3 and England would have about eight bowlers. I guess we’ll always disagree. 50th over: England 177-9 (Broad 29, Anderson 1) Broad backs away to slash Roach over the slips for four, and then he creams him over extra cover for six! This has been an absolutely filthy innings from Broad - and he has more runs than Cook, Root, Stoneman, Moeen and Westley combined. Truly, it’s a funny old game. England lead by 54. “I think there already are four on the three Lord’s honours boards,” says Colin Noble. “Gubby Allen, Botham and Stuart Broad, and then Keith Miller from Australia.” It’s the right answer! (I think) 49th over: England 164-9 (Broad 16, Anderson 1) “I’m struggling to get on board with the notion that a choice has to be made between Woakes and Roland-Jones for the final seamer’s spot,” says Geoff Wignall. “Surely form dictates that it’s a choice between those two and Broad for two places. Fine bowler for England that Broad has been, he needs to be contributing more than his reputation and a once a season cameo with the bat. I know there’s the argument then when he’s hot he’s very hot, but that only stands up so long as he’s at least generally competent the rest of the time. Too often lately that doesn’t seem the case - batsmen can leave at least half of the balls he delivers, which is inexcusable with the new ball. It’s also the opposite of his own declared approach and intentions.” He’s had a relatively bad summer, I agree, but he’s the greatest Ashes-winner England have ever had, he gets high on conflict and has unfinished business in Australia. I’d be astonished if he didn’t start. Holder ends the nonsense with the useful wicket of Roland-Jones, who slices a drive straight to Shai Hope in the gully. England lead by 40. 48th over: England 163-8 (Roland-Jones 13, Broad 16) “My favourite thing about those Advanced Hair Studio ads is Darren Gough popping up at the end and saying it’s the best thing he’s done,” says Kevin Wilson. “This is a guy who took a hat trick at the SCG.” And who did this when he was on another hat-trick against Australia. 47th over: England 163-8 (Roland-Jones 13, Broad 16) Holder replaces Gabriel. It’s all the same to Broad, who pulls him round the corner for four. These are dangerous moments for the West Indies, who have lost a bit of control since Broad started swinging like Leatherface. The over ends with a good delivery from Holder that is edged just short of the cordon by Roland-Jones. “My favourite thing about those Advanced Hair Institute ads is Darren Gough popping up at the end and saying it’s the best thing he’s done,” says Kevin Wilson. “This is a guy who took a hat trick at the SCG.” 46th over: England 158-8 (Roland-Jones 13, Broad 11) Roland-Jones flashes a confident cut for four off Roach - and then he is dropped by the keeper Dowrich. It was an easy chance to his right, and he is visibly angry with himself. England’s lead is now 35. “Experiments with Jennings, Stoneman, Westley, Ballance and Malan (did I miss anyone?) have surely proved that they are good at massacring county trundlers, but not fit for Test cricket,” says David Hindle. “And taking any of them to Australia against their current attack in those conditions, would be an act of savage cruelty. We have no more options with the bat. We can put Hameed in. That’s it. Therefore, surely we should play Woakes and TRJ, spread the brutal bowling load, reduce the risk of injury, and see Woakes comfortably outscore any so-called “specialist” bat alternative anyway?” I’m probably missing something but I’ve never understood this argument. If A is weak and B is strong, why would you weaken A to strengthen B? England will need every run they can get in Australia. If they only had four bowlers I would agree but five is enough anywhere except Asia. I’d keep the same balance, though I have no idea who should bat No2/3/5. Not Hameed, that’s for sure; England should play the long game with him, or at least the medium game: at the start of next summer give him the No2 position on a 15-year lease. 45th over: England 152-8 (Roland-Jones 7, Broad 11) If Broad looks like a walking, hopping, ducking wicket, then Roland-Jones is very comfortable. He pulls smoothly for a single off another Gabriel no-ball, and then Broad - vulnerable but dangerous - belts a couple of boundaries through the covers. “This really has been an absorbing series, even more astonishing after the first Test blowout,” says Guy Hornsby. “We could lead by 150 or 25 here. Personally it’ll be the Test series when my daughter Leila started her own innings. We got through labour on the last day of Leeds and she’s nine days old as Blowers bows out and we have another firecracker of a game on our hands today. I’ll have her emailing into the OBO by the end of the Ashes.” Ah, congratulations! 44th over: England 141-8 (Roland-Jones 6, Broad 3) Roach continues to work Broad over, beating the outside edge either side of another sharp bouncer. A maiden. “Shame Stokes didn’t reach the Beefy/Greig milestone you mentioned,” says Michael Bate. “He still has a chance to become only the fourth Englishman to get on all three dressing room honours boards (Century, 5-for, 10wkts in a match) at Lord’s. Can any Friday afternoon OBOers guess the three who’ve done it? (I should declare an interest - I’m a Lord’s tour guide.) Botham, Botham and Botham? 43rd over: England 141-8 (Roland-Jones 6, Broad 3) The last really low-scoring Lord’s Test was that weird classic between these sides in 2000. Batting may become easier in the second innings here, as the sun has just emerged to loud cheers. England lead by 18. “I’ve continued my Test match cocktail theme for this last match of the summer,” says John Withington. “Sadly despite getting onto OBO yesterday there wasn’t a single suggestion of how to mark Jimmy’s 500th with a new cocktail. Then he went and did the job for me by ending up high and dry one short on 499! Which gifted me a couple of names and ideas. So I’ve just published today’s article including two cocktails for the event, the One Short and the High and Drye. Have a look at the link for the full article. Hope you and the readers enjoy.” 42nd over: England 134-8 (Roland-Jones 4, Broad 0) Roach greets Broad with two very sharp bouncers, the first of which has him hopping all over the place. Roach has bowled so well in this innings; his figures are five for 47 from 19 overs. “Everyone knows that part of the perks of being a Test cricketer is that you get free treatment at the Advanced Hair Institute,” says Charlie Tinsley. “I expect Stokes to take guard during the winter’s trials looking like Tormund Giantsbane.” Yep, I did have to look that up. Roach has his five-for! That was all very predictable. Moeen resisted a few tempters outside off stump but that abstinence was never going to last. Eventually he threw his hands into a loose drive and was beautifully taken by Kyle Hope in a wide slip position. 41st over: England 134-7 (Moeen 3, Roland-Jones 4) A short ball from Gabriel is clouted merrily for four by Roland-Jones. That really isn’t the length to bowl on this pitch, or rather in this atmosphere. “In the early eighties when Spielberg was at his true peak, a Hollywood wannabe saw him sitting on the sand looking out at the ocean and when he left went he sat in the same spot hoping to get inspiration and see what the great man saw,” says Ian Copestake. “Some of the England team might be advised to follow Stokes about a bit more.” 40th over: England 129-7 (Moeen 2, Roland-Jones 0) Moeen is beaten, swishing at an outswinger from Roach. Roland-Jones also plays and misses later in the over. The ball isn’t just talking; it’s talking like Brian Blessed. Even a frisky 30 from Moeen could be match-winning. 39th over: England 128-7 (Moeen 1, Roland-Jones 0) “Hi Rob, given we’re about to see a low-scoring game, do you think England may regret not having Woakes at number nine?” says Dean Ainsworth. “TRJ is handy but no more, Woakes likes a better bet that some of the top six at times. I think he would have done as well as TRJ with the ball as well, he looked sharper at the weekend.” They might, as he’s an offensively good No9, but I think Roland-Jones (sorry, I can’t bring myself to call him TRJ; I have no idea why) was the right choice. Woakes did look sharper at the weekend, though he was bowling spells of one and two overs. Brisbane is a tough choice though, as there are still doubts over Woakes in overseas conditions. I suspect he’ll play, as he probably should. He’s done him again! That’s an exceptional comeback from Gabriel, an almost identical delivery. It was just full of a length and jagged back through the gate to ransack Stokes’s stumps. That was reminscent of Darren Gough’s double dismissal of Greg Blewett on the first morning of the 1997 Ashes. This was two balls later rather than next ball. The umpires didn’t bother to check the no-ball, which was a bit of surprise - until we saw the replay, which showed he was well behind the line. Oh my. Gabriel cleans Stokes up with a superb delivery from around the wicket - and it’s a no-ball. As soon as the umpires went upstairs to check there was a sense of inevitability about it. 38th over: England 125-6 (Stokes 58, Moeen 1) West Indies will be dreading another Moeen cameo, particularly in a tight match like this. It must be quite confusing bowling to Moeen: he has such obvious defensive weaknesses that it must feel like you’ll get him any second, and then you look up and he’s 50 not out from 60 balls. 37th over: England 122-6 (Stokes 56, Moeen 0) Stokes has become a high-class Test batsman, particularly outside Asia. He averages 46 since the start of 2016 and 47 this year. There’s a good argument for putting him at No5 in the Ashes. The counter-argument says: don’t mess with a strength to cover a weakness. “Rob,” says John Starbuck. “You can’t see it now because of the batting helmet, but Ben Stokes is losing scalp hair at a pretty fast rate now. Not to worry (unless he does and needs a Rooney) since if he goes without a hat or cap in the field the freckles will cover the pate soon enough. You’ll know it’s working when he starts having close shaves all over and we say Welcome to the Smooth Club.” He’ll be a credit to the bald community when we induct him. 36th over: England 119-6 (Stokes 53, Moeen 0) That was the last ball of the over. It was a timely wicket for West Indies - and a deserved one for Roach, who bowled superbly to Bairstow. I thought it might be a touch high, and maybe going down, with Roach bowling from wide on the crease. The umpire took his time before giving Bairstow out. Here comes ball-tracking... and it shows three reds, so Bairstow is out. That’s an excellent decision from the umpire Chris Gaffaney, because there were a couple of doubts and he could easily have played it safe. This is a bit of a slugfest between Roach and Bairstow. Roach beats the outside edge with a beautiful lifter; Bairstow creams the next ball to the extra-cover boundary. And now Bairstow has been given out LBW! Hello folks. I come bearing stats. Only two England players have scored a hundred and taken a five-for in a Test: Tony Greig, who did it once, and Sir Ian Botham, who did it a superheroic five times. Ben Stokes has a chance to join that club. He is lording over this Test like a colossus, and this could even become his take on Beefy’s Jubilee Test (without the 4am drinking games). Overhead conditions have made batting so difficult for everyone else in this game; for the moment, the Stokes aura has neutralised the Lord’s atmosphere. 35th over: England 113-5 (Stokes 52, Bairstow 16) That’s a nice shot from Bairstow, even if it picks out a fielder at extra cover and he gets no runs for it. The next ball beats the batsman again, but was a massive no-ball so any wicket wouldn’t have counted. And with that I’ll hand you over to Rob Smyth, email him here if you feel so inclined. Bye! 34th over: England 110-5 (Stokes 51, Bairstow 15) Stokes’ half-century featured 10 fours, 10 singles and 31 dots. Bairstow remains in search of fluency, and has an inadvisible slash at Roach’s final delivery. 33rd over: England 109-5 (Stokes 50, Bairstow 15) Stokes pushes the ball gently with a straight bat and it rumbles down the ground for four, slowly enough that a fielder has to chase it all the way, quickly enough that the chasing fielder has no chance of catching it. All about the timing. A single brings up his 50, from 51 deliveries, and he’s basically won the man of the match award already, hasn’t he? 32nd over: England 104-5 (Stokes 45, Bairstow 15) Stokes tries to drive through the covers and instead gets a thick edge. Still, the effect is the same, as the ball flies wide of gully and away for four. “Hoping our ginger warriors can at least reach their own averages until the sun comes out, batting conditions improve and we can have a Test that lasts beyond Saturday,” murmurs Ian Copestake. 31st over: England 99-5 (Stokes 40, Bairstow 15) Stokes, though, is looking comfortable. He pulls Holder’s first delivery through midwicket for a tasty four, and a single then takes his past Powell’s 39 and makes him the biggest scorer of the match so far. Holder then delivers some short nonsense that Bairstow capitalises upon, also with a pull through midwicket for four. 30th over: England 90-5 (Stokes 35, Bairstow 11) Roach is back after a change of ends, and tempts Bairstow with a delivery that’s too full to safely drive, but wide enough to be tempting. The batsman tries to hit it and is lucky to miss. The last ball of the over prompts an even wilder swing, equally imprecise. 29th over: England 89-5 (Stokes 34, Bairstow 11) Holder bowls short and wide, Stokes swings his bat, and when he connects only with its toe and sends the ball bouncing limply to cover the look of regret and disgust on his face is a picture. He absolutely nails the next, a stonking pull through midwicket, but it flies straight to the only fielder in the neighbourhood for a single. “Is it tempting fate to say that Stokes will get at least 124?” wonders Matthew Doherty. Yes, I’d say it’s definitely tempting fate. 28th over: England 86-5 (Stokes 33, Bairstow 9) That’s nice though! Gabriel bowls towards Bairstow’s hip, and he gently nurses it to the deep square leg boundary. And then he flicks the ball off his pads and through midwicket, though it’s fielded in the deep. 27th over: England 79-5 (Stokes 33, Bairstow 3) Here’s a curious stat, particulaly because he’s never played in the West Indies, and his average in England is 44.20. At the other end of the scale, in three matches against Sri Lanka Bairstow averages 129.00. 26th over: England 75-5 (Stokes 29, Bairstow 3) Gabriel starts with a wild, short, wide delivery across Stokes, which but for a fine leaping save from Dowrich would have flown away for four but as it was remained a dot. A single later Bairstow is back on strike, and still looking awkward. He does get a couple through square leg, mind. 25th over: England 72-5 (Stokes 28, Bairstow 1) A fine over from Roach, with Bairstow looking uncomfortable throughout. There’s a strangled appeal for lbw at one point, but all that comes of it is a couple of leg byes. 24th over: England 70-5 (Stokes 28, Bairstow 1) And so it starts again, and in the first over back there’s a drop! Gabriel bowls, Stokes gets a thick edge and it flies straight to third slip! Sadly, West Indies had a third slip until the previous ball, when they decided they didn’t really need one and moved him away. Thus Kyle Hope at second slip had to dive high to his left, and though he got his hands to it, he couldn’t make it stick. A tough chance, but catchable. They immediately bring back a third slip, but the next ball goes down the ground for four. The players are out! This is actually happening! Possible imminent cricket claxon! It has stopped raining again, perhaps for a while this time, so they are going to play cricket at 2.15pm BST! So the umpires abandoned their inspection and will have another go in a bit, perhaps half an hour or so. Bad tidings: it’s started raining again. The umpires should be inspecting the field precisely now. An update should be imminent. In the meantime, you can read about rain falling (or not) elsewhere here: Yesterday play could potentially have gone on until 7.10pm, so it could certainly continue until then, particularly if there’s some sunshine. The umpires have been out, and decided that there should be a further pitch inspection in about 15 minutes. It’s not raining! But it will be again in a bit, and there may be showers after that. But the thickest, darkest, most unfriendly bit of cloud has now moved on eastwards. This isn’t promising. It looks like there might soon be a rainless half-hour or so, but it won’t last. Lunch is being taken. It’s still raining. “If you went dressed as Gaillardia Goblins, a yellow and maroon dwarf variety of plant that beds in well but requires a lot of liquid, you would probably pass the Lord’s club colour, stature and quenching criteria,” suggests Raymond Reardon. Now, on to weightier matters: I’ll have the halibut and the chocolate torte, if you’d be so kind. Update: it’s still raining. “Maybe subtle fancy dress is required,” suggests Robin Hazlehurst. “Going as Michael Fish would blend in with the old buffers while making an understated comment on the weather. And it would be instantly recognisable while not actually screaming ‘Fancy Dress’. Although you might need a pretty good wardrobe and make-up department to help achieve it convincingly.” “Please tell Alec we weren’t of course planning to make our costumes visible,” writes Kim Thonger. “They would be worn underneath ordinary attire, it’s more subversive that way. Doesn’t everyone do this at work? I just assumed it was the norm.” Flippers would have been hard to pull off, but I’d love to have seen you try. I’d like to give you some good news. I am unable to. “You can wear pretty much anything in Club colours,” Alan Synnott tells me. “I was admiring the egg and bacon scuba tank in the MCC shop only yesterday.” It still looks reasonably bright in St John’s Wood, but I’d be surprised if we get more play before lunch. If you’re in Beaconsfield, Abingdon or Didcot, your last hour is our next hour, and something tells me it wasn’t a great one. Well, someone. Two balls into Gabriel’s over the umpires decide it’s time to head for cover. 23rd over: England 58-5 (Stokes 20, Bairstow 0) A maiden. If it was raining wickets yesterday, it seems the downpour is continuing. And it is also actually literally raining, and my rain radar suggests it isn’t going to stop for a while. It has started gently, though, and the players remain on the field. It had been a comfortable opening to the day for England. Even quite sedate. No more, though! Malan is squared up by a ball that straightens and kisses his edge, giving Dowrich the most straightforward of catches! 22nd over: England 58-4 (Malan 23, Stokes 20) There’s an unsuccessful lbw appeal against Malan, the ball having pitched outside leg, and once again Gabriel’s final delivery is speared away for four, this time by Stokes. Now, doesn’t allow fancy dress? Have you seen the state of some of the people in the Pavilion? How would you describe the MCC’s own bacon-and-egg blazer if not as the most fancy of dress? 21st over: England 57-4 (Malan 19, Stokes 18) Kemar Roach gives Stokes a bit of width, and the ball is cut away for four. In other news Theresa May, our dear leader, is in the audience, and Ian Copestake has taken to his keyboard. “A 24% chance of rain before lunch?” he writes. “I much prefer ‘might’ or ‘it’s possible’ to this arrogant insistence on the measurability of all things. 65% of me is fuming.” 20th over: England 52-4 (Malan 19, Stokes 13) Shannon Gabriel starts day two, and Malan drives his final delivery through the covers for four. A fine shot, that. “Morning Simon,” writes Kim Thonger. Morning Kim. “My wife and I are going to Lord’s tomorrow and in view of the weather forecast are in a quandary as to which fancy dress outfits to wear? I favour the full Jacques Cousteau (and Mme Cousteau) wetsuits with SCUBA gear. My wife is tending towards Captain Troy Tempest and Maria the Mermaid. I’ve advised her that getting up the steps to the top level of the Warner Stand may be tricky without feet. She argues that it’s no harder than in flippers, and anyway a gentleman would carry her. Could your readers please settle the dispute? (By DRS if necessary)” Tomorrow’s forecast is pretty good, so I’m afraid I would suggest a total rethink, focusing perhaps on land-based entertainment. Looking at the rain radar, I’d say we’ve got 45 minutes, tops. The players are out! We’re going to have cricket! If you’re at Lord’s, looking at the skies and feeling unlucky, you’ve actually got it pretty good: Ottis Gibson has been tlaking to Sky about Ben Stokes, and the state of English pace bowling: Look, we’ve seen that before with Ben, in the Ashes in 2015 at Trent Brige. When the ball is swinging, next to Jimmy Anderson he’s probably the best swing bowler we have. Yesterday morning we were chatting, and he’d not had the best summer. The ball was swinging a lot yesterday morning. I said, when the ball is swinging the only skill you need to have is accuracy. Don’t worry about pace, just concentrate on accuracy. That goes against his normal character. To see him drop it on a length and let the swing do its work was outstanding. He’s not somebody who likes too much technical stuff and coaching, and relies on natural ability. He controlled length really well yesterday. When he missed length and got hit he got very angry with himself. He lets his natural instincts control not just his cricket but his life. I think England are in a great position, to be honest. Woakes had an outstanding summer last year, but we’ve not had him most of this year. Toby’s come in this year and given a really good account of himself. Mark Wood, who I still think is going to be the x-factor for England. He’s still got a lot too offer. I was very impressed with Olly Stone in the T20 Blast. Important news! Play will start at 11.15am. Unless it doesn’t. The covers are back on. It’s going to be one of those days, I fear. ... and the forecasters now put the odds on afternoon rain no higher than 60%, and (unlike the rain) falling. Hello world! The good news is that, as I write this, the weather in north London is considerably better than it was when I woke up a few hours ago, and the forecast for today is also much improved from yesterday’s bleak rainfest. Neither however could exactly be described as excellent: the heavy clouds at the moment are light grey and not chucking water at us, but they remain fairly menacing. Meteorologists inform me there is but a 24% chance that they will start to shed their watery load between now and lunch. After lunch, however, it’s an entirely different story, with the chance of rain currently hovering between 75% and 90% between 2pm and 5pm. Still, that leaves us at least a 10% chance of a rainless day, which is something to celebrate I’m sure you’ll agree (I’ve looked at the rain radar, and if that’s what happens I suggest we all invest in some lottery tickets). Here’s today’s forecast: And here’s an optimistic 9.40am update from Lord’s:: So, let’s cross our fingers, caress our rabbits’ feet and hope for some play. On the evidence of yesterday, it wouldn’t take much more effort for these players to compress an entire day’s worth of action into a few interrupted hours. Simon will be here shortly. Ben Stokes took six wickets on day one and said afterwards his bowling performance was “a monkey off my back”: Ben Stokes spoke of his pride at recording his career-best figures with the ball after believing he had been letting the England team down this summer. But, given a wicket-laden first day during which West Indies hit back late on with four strikes themselves, the third Test remains in the balance. By claiming six for 22 from 14.3 overs in a masterful exhibition of swing bowling either side of tea, Stokes helped Joe Root’s side to dismiss the tourists for 123 in the series decider and became only the sixth England cricketer to get his name on both honours boards at Lord’s. The all-rounder, whose efforts left Jimmy Anderson on 499 Test wickets after claiming the first two breakthroughs, will resume with bat in hand on the second day, however. Both Stokes and Dawid Malan are unbeaten on 13, with England a less than convincing 46 for four after Kemar Roach and Jason Holder took out the top order. “I felt I was letting the team down a little bit, so to bowl like I did today was a monkey off my back,” said Stokes, who had previously struggled for rhythm due to a knee injury sustained this summer and came into the series decider with 10 wickets at 44 apiece from his previous six Tests. “This is a place where you’re proud if you get your name on the honours board. No one can take it away from you and I’ll always be able to say I’m on there through batting and bowling.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/17/night-heron-somerset-levels-birdwatch","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T20:30:50Z","webTitle":"The night heron: at home on the Somerset Levels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/17/night-heron-somerset-levels-birdwatch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/17/night-heron-somerset-levels-birdwatch","fields":{"headline":"The night heron: at home on the Somerset Levels","bodyText":"The news that night herons had bred in Britain for the first time barely registered on the ornithological Richter scale. Perhaps this was because it happened on the Somerset Levels, the UK’s new hotspot for long-legged wading birds. Over the past couple of decades, first little egret, then little bittern, great white and cattle egrets, and now night herons, have flown across the Channel. Many ended up on the Somerset Levels, liked what they saw, and settled down here. Meanwhile, bitterns came over from East Anglia, while cranes were given a helping hand from us, via a reintroduction scheme. Now that we can see five or six of these exotic newcomers in a day, we have become rather blase about them. Yet I can remember when the arrival of a new British breeding bird was a major event. During the whole of my childhood, apart from introduced birds such as Lady Amherst’s pheasant and ring-necked parakeet creeping on to the official British List, only a handful of truly wild species managed to colonise the UK. Some, like the Mediterranean gull and Cetti’s warbler, stayed the course. But most didn’t. These included the snowy owls that bred on the Shetland island of Fetlar for a few years in the 1960s and 70s, before retreating north as climate change took hold. We know that the same warming trend that stopped the snowy owls in their tracks is partly responsible for so many waterbird species extending their ranges into southern Britain. But having arrived, they would never have colonised successfully if it weren’t for the habitat created out of disused former peatworks. “Build it, and they will come,” as the saying goes, and that’s exactly what has happened. Acres of devastated land, scarred by peat digging, have been transformed into homes for wetland birds. So it’s good to know that all that hard work – from professional conservationists and volunteers – has finally been rewarded. In last month’s national lottery awards, the Avalon Marshes project beat 1,300 other schemes, to be named the UK’s best environment project. But although what is happening in the West Country is good news, the bigger picture shows the negative consequences of climate change. In Scotland, seabird numbers are plummeting as sand eels head north in response to warming seas. And in the Scottish Highlands, Arctic birds such as the ptarmigan and snow bunting are also under threat. So while I celebrate the events in my neck of the woods, I worry that our gains will be outweighed by losses elsewhere. Back here in Somerset, the day the news of the night herons broke I wandered along to Westhay Moor, hoping to catch a glimpse of one. As its name suggests, this is a largely nocturnal species, so the best time to see one is at dawn or dusk. As the sun began to set, I waited, along with the two local birders who had found the birds in the first place. Then, just as I was about to give up and head home, a single night heron – small, stocky and broad-winged, with a heavy bill – flew overhead. A brief, but still incredibly special, moment. I will certainly never take a pioneering bird such as this for granted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/10/grenfell-tower-priest-community-anger-grief-poem","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T16:41:00Z","webTitle":"Grenfell Tower priest tells of community's anger and grief in poem","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/10/grenfell-tower-priest-community-anger-grief-poem","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/10/grenfell-tower-priest-community-anger-grief-poem","fields":{"headline":"Grenfell Tower priest tells of community's anger and grief in poem","bodyText":"The vicar of a church that became a focal point for survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire has turned to poetry to express the community’s pain and how the “dead black block” now dominates their lives. Father Alan Everett of St Clement church, close to the base of the tower, was moved to write after the church became a refuge for people escaping the fire and as a response to the ongoing trauma suffered by the local community. He said that writing his eight-part poem was a profoundly emotional experience. “There was a strong element of reliving events I’d experienced directly and also things that people told me,” he said in his first newspaper interview since the fire. “It was powerfully loaded, but also a massive relief to write it.” Three months after the fire, survivors still found it difficult to express their unimaginable experiences, he said. “People are struggling with memories, with the things they can’t block out. They are very, very damaged.” Everett’s poem, 14 June 2017, recounts the night of the fire and its aftermath. It tells of local residents “Forced to watch / Lights at the windows / Torches / Of those who were still alive / For the time being / Signalling / Desperate faint hope / Until floor by floor / The darkness snuffed them out.” He describes “The crowded and all too soon / Impassable / Single staircase”, and firefighters “Crawling along beneath the smoke / Reaching up grasping hands guiding survivors out”. Later, the poem tells of the “persistent prophetic warnings” that “fell with a thud on deaf ears” and the continuing work to recover remains from the “dead black block … filled with debris and dust”. On the night of the fire, Everett, 59, who has been vicar of St Clement and the nearby St James churches for the past seven years, was woken in the early hours by another priest. The pair went to St Clement at 3am, switched on the lights and opened the doors. “Those two actions, that one moment, feels like the core, the heart of my entire ministry as a priest,” he said. Within minutes, evacuated residents and people offering help began to arrive at the church. In the following hours and days, St Clement and the normally peaceful garden of the adjoining ClementJames community centre resembled a refugee camp, crowded with traumatised survivors, volunteers and mountains of donated items. Everett and his team stepped into the void left by the widely criticised council response to the fire and mediated between distraught and furious residents and officialdom. “We have spent decades working deep within the community, very dedicated, embedded work, which is why we are trusted and why we could respond so effectively,” Everett said. Among those who sought help or volunteered their services were Muslims, who knew they would be welcomed by the ClementJames team. By the end of the week, Everett was anxious to reclaim his church for Sunday mass. Despite negligible help from Kensington and Chelsea council, the ClementJames centre located storage for donated items and removed the equivalent of three articulated lorries full of boxes. “I wanted the church to be right and beautiful, and indeed the mass was wonderful, a service of profound emotion,” he said. His poem describes the scene: “Friends and strangers / Standing so still / For the opening prayer / Listening so intently / To the angry searing sermon / Clergy so rarely preach / Sermons like that / Which is why so many people wrote to me afterwards to say / It almost restored their faith / In Christianity / Almost.” Now, three months on, he writes: “We’re small and disconnected and tired / And as powerless as we’ve ever been / And coming together feels almost too raw / And everywhere you look / There are people walking around / In a daze.” Survivors and residents still feel angry and helpless, Everett said. “The sense of disempowerment is very strong. This is a long haul. It’s going to take a very long time. People have been changed.” They were helped by a “strong sense of connection. People are very gentle and supportive of each other although public meetings can be fraught and angry. Everyone’s story is unique, but the grief is communal.”. Residents were also struggling with a sense that public attention was moving away from Grenfell, he said. Everett began writing poetry when studying English at Oxford. It was “complete rubbish”, he said. He gave up for a long period, but resumed about a decade ago. “Poetry is very immediate. I think we’re fortunate to be living in a time when people can write poetry deploying a wide range of approaches, metres, styles. It’s very flexible. And it’s capable of responding to very serious subject matter providing you don’t try to be too literary.” His poem felt like a Greek chorus, he said. “Enmeshed in the action, helpless, involved, concerned. The chorus figures aren’t protagonists, but deeply implicated in what’s going on. I felt I was tapping into a tragic voice. “Poetry of this kind attempts to speak the unspeakable, and to help people to imagine the unimaginable.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/08/before-and-after-hurricane-irma-images-of-caribbean-destruction","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T08:50:51Z","webTitle":"Before and after Hurricane Irma: images of Caribbean destruction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/08/before-and-after-hurricane-irma-images-of-caribbean-destruction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/08/before-and-after-hurricane-irma-images-of-caribbean-destruction","fields":{"headline":"Before and after Hurricane Irma: images of Caribbean destruction","bodyText":"The category 5 Hurricane Irma has ripped through the Caribbean, causing deaths, flash foods and flattened landscapes.

It’s a fairly mixed bag: FTSE 100: -0.4% at 7,369 Germany’s DAX: +0.1% at 12,306 France’s CAC: -0.1% at 5,107 Italy’s FTSE MIB: +0.3% at 21,780 Spain’s IBEX: flat at 10,125 Europe’s STOXX 600: flat at 375 The pound has held on to gains against the dollar - boosted by stronger than expected manufacturing - and is still above $1.32. Sterling is also doing well against the euro, up 0.7% at €1.0968. The euro meanwhile is just about holding on above the $1.20 mark, but the earlier gains have eased. A flurry of data from the ONS painted a mixed picture of the UK economy in July. Manufacturing growth was stronger than expected, but construction output suffered a bigger fall than forecast. At this point, economists think UK growth will pick-up slightly in the third quarter overall, to about 0.4% from 0.3% in the second quarter. That’s it for today. Thank you for reading the blog and for all your comments. Have a lovely weekend, and please do join us again on Monday. AM US stock indexes are slightly lower this afternoon, as Florida braces itself for Hurricane Irma. Dow futures are down 0.3% or 58 points S&amp;P 500 futures are down 0.2% or 6 points Nasdaq futures are down 0.2% or 9 points UK growth picked up to 0.4% in the three months to August, from 0.2% in the three months to July, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. The think-tank publishes its rolling three-month estimate of UK growth every month to coincide with the industrial production figures. Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomic forecasting at NIESR, said the economy was likely to grow by 0.4% in the third quarter (July to September): Service sector output as well as industrial production appears to have contributed to the uptick in GDP growth. Looking ahead into the second half of this year and beyond, we see the economy rebalance towards international trade in response to strengthening global growth and a weaker pound and away from domestic demand. Household spending is likely to be weighed down by weak wage growth and investment spending held back by Brexit-related uncertainty. NIESR says that if the UK economy grows at a pace of 0.4-0.5% per quarter, the Bank of England should raise interest rates to 0.5% from 0.25% in the first quarter of 2018. Meanwhile in Greece, the visiting French President, Emmanuel Macron, has been chairing a meeting of Greek and French entrepreneurs. On the second day of his two-day official trip to Athens, the focus has turned firmly to investment. Macron, who is accompanied by 40 prominent business leaders representing companies big and small, told the select gathering of bankers and industry titans that with Greece finally emerging from economic crisis, France would lead fresh efforts to invest in the country. “France will assume the responsibility in that effort [to attract foreign investment]”, he said, adding it was vital that European investors did business with EU member states such as Greece rather than “the Chinese, Americans and Koreans.” French investors, long in the country, should “give new energy, new dynamism to investments in Greece. We are calling on the Europeans to invest in Greece.” A former economy minister, Macron has used the visit to applaud Greek reforms under prime minister Alexis Tsipras. He has stressed that, like the leftist leader, he believes Greece is on the road to recovery and growth after seven years of recession. “The Greek economy is turning the page after seven years of crisis,” said Tsipras who also attended the meeting. The pound is up 0.8% against the dollar at $1.3205, helped by July’s stronger-than-expected manufacturing output growth. It is the first time the pound has made it above the $1.32 mark in five weeks. Sterling is also up 0.5% against the euro, at €1.0954 Labour MP Chuka Umunna says the latest trade figures show that Britain’s membership of the single market is crucial to Britain. Commenting as a leading supporter of the Open Britain campaign group, Umunna said: Brexiteers repeatedly argued that the upside of crashing the pound would be that we would see a major boost in British exports. But there is scant evidence of this, and Britain’s trade deficit remains stubbornly high. It is also increasingly clear that any gains in manufacturing exports will not be not enough to offset the damage being done to other sectors as a result of the government’s hard Brexit plans. A chink of light in today’s figures is that Britain’s deficit in goods trade with other EU countries has narrowed. But this just serves to underline how crucial full membership of the single market is to British jobs and the economy.” Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, says this morning’s UK data suggests the economy got off to a decent start at the beginning of the third quarter. (UK growth was 0.3% in the second quarter.) Based on today’s numbers we are comfortably in the 0.5% ballpark for GDP growth in the third quarter, with wiggle room in both directions. The monthly services data at the end of the month are likely to be the ultimate swing factor. Trade Britain’s trade in goods deficit with the rest of the world was roughly unchanged in July at £11.6bn The wider trade in goods and services deficit (which includes things like legal advice) was also unchanged over the month at £2.9bn Exports of UK-made goods to the EU rose by £1.8bn, or 4.4% in the three months to July Over the same period, exports to non-EU countries fell by £1.7bn or 3.9% Industrial output Industrial production rose by 0.2% in July, following a 0.5% increase in 0.5% The manufacturing sector was the main driver of growth, with output rising 0.5% over the month thanks to more cars rolling of UK production lines. It was the first month of manufacturing growth in 2017 Mining output fell 1.2%, mainly because of a 1.4% drop in oil and gas extraction Construction output Construction output fell 0.9% in July, more sharply than the 0.2% drop predicted by economists and the fourth consecutive monthly fall The fall was mainly driven by a £95m decline in private house building over the month Building of infrastructure was also a drag, dropping for a third consecutive month, by £38m A third release from the ONS this morning shows that UK construction output fell by 0.9% in July, following a 0.1% fall in June. It was the fourth consecutive monthly fall, and worse than the 0.2% dip predicted by economists. A fall in house building was a main drag on the sector, doing little to ease concerns over Britain’s housing shortage. UK manufacturing output grew by 0.5% in July, following zero growth in June and beating expectations of a 0.3% increase. Kate Davies, senior statistician at the ONS, said the increase was largely down to car manufacturing: Manufacturing remains relatively subdued since the start of the year, though July showed the first significant monthly growth of 2017, with car production increasing partly thanks to new models rolling off the production lines. The usual period of summer maintenance of North Sea oil platforms also failed to materialise for a second month running. A stronger-than-expected July pushed the annual rate of growth in manufacturing to 1.9% in July, from 0.6% in June. The broader measure of industrial production, which includes mining and utilities as well as manufacturing, rose by 0.2% in July. It was a slowdown compared with 0.5% growth, but bang in line with economists’ expectations. Britain’s reliance on trade with the EU is highlighted in the latest set of figures from the Office for National Statistics. Exports of British-made goods to the EU increased by £1.8bn, or 4.4%, in the three months to July (compared with the previous three months). Exports of crude oil, machinery, and transport equipment were the main drivers. Exports to the rest of the world however fell by £1.7bn, or 3.9%. Germany’s trade surplus narrowed more than expected in July, as growth in imports easily outpaced export growth. The surplus dipped to €19.5bn from €21.2bn in June, after exports just scraped growth of 0.2%, but imports rose by 2.2%. It was the smallest surplus in six months. Economists were exporting exports to grow by 1.3%, and as such were forecasting a bigger trade surplus of €20.3bn. The figures suggested that Europe’s largest economy could be feeling the effects of the stronger euro, which makes German-made goods more expensive abroad. Jack Allen, European economist at Capital Economics, said the data provided an early sign that GDP growth in the wider eurozone might slow in the third quarter (from 0.6% growth in the second). July’s data on German trade, as well as French and Spanish industrial production, provide some early hints that eurozone GDP growth might slow at ouch in Q3.But the continued strength of activity surveys suggest that any slowdown will be small. Here is Draghi’s euro headache in graph form. The euro has been rising against the dollar since the beginning of the year and is climbing further still today. A stronger euro makes exports from the eurozone more expensive in other countries, and is likely to dampen domestic inflation (because imports are cheaper). With the exception of Spain’s IBEX, it’s red across the board in Europe this morning, although the losses are limited so far. FTSE 100: -0.3% at 7,376 Germany’s DAX: -0.1% at 12,285 France’s CAC: -0.2% at 5,102 Italy’s FTSE MIB: -0.1% at 21,702 Spain’s IBEX: +0.1% at 10,138 Europe’s STOXX 600: -0.2% at 374 Before, we take a look at the equity markets, some UK corporate news. Trinity Mirror - the publisher of the Daily Mirror - is in exclusive talks to buy the Daily Express, Sunday Express and Daily Star, which are owned by Richard Desmond’s Northern &amp; Shell. The deal is thought to be worth about £130m and also includes Northern &amp; Shell’s magazines, including OK!, New! and Star. Here is our full story with all the background on the deal: Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The cautious tone adopted by Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, at Thursday’s policy press conference failed to put off investors who piled into the euro. Instead, those buying the euro heard two things: Eurozone growth has been stronger than expected so far this year, so much so that the ECB now expects growth this year to be 2.2% - the strongest in a decade. The second thing they heard was that the ECB’s governing council will “probably” be ready to make a decision in October on whether to taper its €60bn a month bond-buying programme. Investors assumed this meant the programme will be scaled back to purchases of about €40bn a month from January 2018. A stronger euro is not helpful to Draghi and his colleagues at the ECB, not least because it dampens inflation which is currently at 1.3%. But a stronger euro is what they’ve got, with Draghi’s comments sending the euro through the €1.20 on Thursday. Those gains have continued this morning, with the euro currently up 0.3% against the dollar at $1.2060, having hit an earlier high of $1.2092. That’s the strongest in more than two and half years. A reminder how events unfolded on Thursday: Also coming up today is a flurry of UK data, all at 09.30: Industrial production (July) Manufacturing output (July) Trade in goods and services (July) Construction output (July)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/08/mexico-earthquake-warning-tsunami","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T01:28:01Z","webTitle":"Mexico earthquake kills at least 61 and sparks mass evacuations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/08/mexico-earthquake-warning-tsunami","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/08/mexico-earthquake-warning-tsunami","fields":{"headline":"Mexico earthquake kills at least 61 and sparks mass evacuations","bodyText":"The strongest earthquake to hit Mexico in a century has left at least 61 people dead, toppling houses, damaging hospitals and government offices, and sparking mass evacuations. The magnitude 8.1 quake struck off the country’s southern Pacific coast, 100 miles (165km) west of the state of Chiapas just before midnight on Thursday local time. All the deaths were in three neighbouring states clustered round the epicentre. In Oaxaca, 45 people died and in Tabasco three people lost their lives, the head of Mexico’s civil protection agency, Luis Felipe Puentes, said. Chiapas’s governor, Manuel Velasco, said 12 had died in Chiapas, bringing the total to 61. Velasco called on people living near the coast to leave their houses as a protective measure. “There is damage to hospitals that have lost energy,” he said. “Homes, schools and hospitals have been damaged.” The Tabasco governor, Arturo Núñez, said two dead in his state were children. One died after a wall collapsed and the other, a baby, died in a children’s hospital after a power cut stopped electricity to its ventilator. On Friday morning, Mexico’s president, Enrique Peña Nieto, tweeted: “Sadly, there are reports that people have died. My deepest condolences to their families.” The president said at least a million people had been left without electricity after the quake, but power had since been restored to 800,000 of them. He urged people to be vigilant and to check gas supplies as well as walls and columns. The US Geological Survey recorded at least 20 aftershocks of magnitude 4.0 or greater within about five hours after the main shake, and the president warned that a major aftershock as large as magnitude 7.2 could occur. In a series of tweets, Peña Nieto said schools would be closed for the day in Mexico City, the state of Mexico, Chiapas, Hidalgo, Veracruz, Guerrero, Tabasco, Oaxaca, Puebla and Tlaxcala. He said the suspension of classes would allow experts to determine the damage to schools. The Pacific tsunami warning centre said waves as high as three metres could strike the coast but the president sought to allay fears about huge waves rushing towards the coastline, telling the Televisa TV network: “The tsunami risk on the Chiapas coast does not represent a major risk. It’s not very big, it’s not a major worry.” Rodrigo Soberanes, who lives near San Cristóbal de las Casas in Chiapas, told Associated Press his house had “moved like chewing gum” during the quake. Reports suggested that a hotel in the south of the country was among the buildings that suffered severe damage, and rescuers were searching for trapped people. In Mexico City, windows were broken at the airport and power went out in several neighbourhoods. People in the capital, one of the world’s largest cities, ran out into the streets in their pyjamas after the quake struck, a Reuters witness said. Helicopters hovered overhead a few minutes later, apparently looking for damage to buildings. Liliana Villa, 35, who had fled her apartment, said: “It felt horrible, and I thought ‘this is going to fall’.” Luis Carlos Briceño, a 31-year-old architect visiting Mexico City, said: “I had never been anywhere where the earth moved so much. At first I laughed, but when the lights went out I didn’t know what to do. I nearly fell over.” A video quickly went viral showing the Ángel de la Independencia monument swaying as it was bathed in green light. The tremor appears to have been stronger than the magnitude 8.0 earthquake in 1985 that levelled large portions of the capital, killing 5,000 people and destroying 10,000 houses. Much of Mexico City was built on the soft soil of a former lakebed, leaving it vulnerable to earthquakes. Building codes have been tightened since 1985, and earthquake drills for apartment dwellers and officer workers have become common in recent years. Public officials were quick to provide updates on damage and give instructions, unlike in 1985 when the country’s politicians went missing in action and residents, many left homeless, fended for themselves and teamed up to pull people out of piles of rubble. The tsunami warning centre recorded initial waves a metre over tide level off the city of Salina Cruz. It predicted waves of between 30cm and a metre for the Cook Islands, Ecuador, El Salvador, Fiji, French Polynesia, Guatemala and Kiribati. Guatemala’s president, Jimmy Morales, said he had reports of an unconfirmed death near the border with Mexico, in San Marcos state. “We have reports of some damage and the death of one person, even though we still don’t have details,” he said. Lucy Jones, a seismologist in California who works with the US Geological Survey, said such a quake was to be expected. “Off the west coast of Mexico is what’s called the subduction zone: the Pacific plate is moving under the Mexican peninsula,” she said. The Mexican seismological authority said the quake was 19km deep and triggered a series of magnitude 6 aftershocks. “Chiapas is historically a very seismic state due to the interaction of five tectonic plates,” it said in a report on the earthquake. The state has suffered three tremors above magnitude 7 since 1970, including one on 7 November 2012 that measured 7.3."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/08/narendra-modi-criticised-over-twitter-links-to-abuse-of-shot-journalist","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T11:01:42Z","webTitle":"Narendra Modi criticised over Twitter links to abuse of shot journalist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/08/narendra-modi-criticised-over-twitter-links-to-abuse-of-shot-journalist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/08/narendra-modi-criticised-over-twitter-links-to-abuse-of-shot-journalist","fields":{"headline":"Narendra Modi criticised over Twitter links to abuse of shot journalist","bodyText":"India’s ruling party has defended Narendra Modi’s use of Twitter after a number of users followed by the Indian prime minister appeared to celebrate the fatal shooting of a journalist this week. Leaders from across Indian politics have condemned the murder of Gauri Lankesh, who was shot dead outside her home in Bengaluru on Tuesday, but a number of Modi supporters appeared to attempt to justify the killing. One commented: “You reap what you sow.” Another wrote in Hindi: “A bitch died a dog’s death and all of her litter is crying in the same voice.” Modi, who operates his own Twitter account and follows 1,779 others, has been criticised for continuing to follow accounts that have levelled abuse at Lankesh. He has yet to comment on the killing. The head of his BJP party’s information unit, Amit Malviya, said the prime minister followed “normal people” and described the controversy as “mischievous and contorted”. “PM following someone is not a character certificate of a person and is not in any way a guarantee of how a person would conduct himself,” he said in a statement. “[Modi] follows normal people and frequently interacts with them on various issues. He is a rare leader who truly believes in freedom of speech and has never blocked or unfollowed anyone on Twitter.” Modi is regularly criticised for following users who post offensive content. In July 2015 he invited 150 social media users to his residence for a meet-and-greet, among them Twitter users who had used sexual slurs and levelled other abuse against women. Malviya said Modi was frequently attacked for the actions of his supporters while abuse by backers of opposition political leaders was ignored. “This debate is not only farcical and fake, but also an exhibit of selective right to freedom of expression,” he said. India’s information technology minister, Ravi Shankar Prasad, condemned the online abuse of Lankesh, tweeting that he “deplore[d] the messages on social media expressing happiness on the dastardly murder”. Separately, Delhi police have filed a case against a Facebook user who published a “hit list” of journalists, activists and authors including the Man Booker prize-winner Arundhati Roy. Police have sought the IP details of the user, who identified himself as Vikramaditya Rana, after he made a series of posts including one saying Lankesh’s killing “serves her and her kind right for the damages these so-called journos have caused our nation”. Lankesh, whose murder is being examined by a specially appointed investigative team, had previously voiced concern about the “rabid hate” that she was subjected to online. In her speeches and writing, Lankesh, 55, frequently criticised the Hindu nationalist ideology associated with the BJP and worked to rehabilitate guerrillas involved in the country’s five-decade-long Maoist insurgency. Though police have not commented on the motive for her killing, friends, lawyers and colleagues of the journalist as well as some members of the BJP have speculated that it was in retribution for her work. On Thursday the hashtag #BlockNarendraModi was used as part of a campaign to block the leader’s account and highlight the abuse that many prominent Indians, particularly women, say has become endemic online. One prominent journalist, Barkha Dutt, wrote in the Hindustan Times this year that trolling “has become part of my daily life”. “I don’t even notice it any more; that’s how dangerously inured I have become to the gross innuendo and violent and sexually explicit abuse that is heaped on so many women,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/08/kevin-anderson-pablo-carreno-busta-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T23:48:00Z","webTitle":"Kevin Anderson sees off Pablo Carreño Busta to book spot in US Open final","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/08/kevin-anderson-pablo-carreno-busta-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/08/kevin-anderson-pablo-carreno-busta-report","fields":{"headline":"Kevin Anderson sees off Pablo Carreño Busta to book spot in US Open final","bodyText":"While Arthur Ashe Stadium resembled a coliseum on the second Friday of the 2017 US Open – the 28th seed Kevin Anderson serving his way past 12th seed Pablo Carreño Busta to Sunday’s final in a match strong on grinding, light on magic – Jamie Murray completed a mixed week for Dunblane’s favourite tennis family when he and Martina Hingis reached the finals of the mixed doubles. While Anderson was compiling 22 aces in a 4-6, 7-5, 6-3, 6-4 win over the elegant but outgunned Spaniard with absorbing, attritional tennis on the tournament’s main court, Murray and Hingis, the Wimbledon champions, got the job done in a tight tussle with the Romanian Horia Tecau and the American CoCo Vandeweghe, 6-4, 7-6 (8) on the more intimate, half-filled Grandstand court. Anderson, who like Andy Murray decided against hip surgery at the start of the year, is the first South African to reach the US Open final here since Cliff Drysdale lost to Manuel Santana on the grass of nearby Forest Hills in 1965. (Both are at Flushing, Drysdale as a TV commentator, Santana in support of Rafael Nadal.) Johan Kriek won the 1981 Australian Open while still holding a South African passport, before successfully defending that title as an American citizen the following year. Anderson’s win maybe lacked the light touch of the contest between Drysdale and Santana, but it was enthralling none the less. Carreño Busta, a thoughtful player who has had an excellent season and had not dropped a set on his way to the semi-final, found Anderson’s big hitting a problem, yet gave him his toughest match of the tournament. Anderson, who put Andy Murray out in the fourth round in 2015, has gone largely unnoticed until the later stages here, even in the half of the draw that had been laid bare by injury and upsets, but he had gone about his job without fuss. He had been broken only three times in 87 service games, saving 15 of 18 break points, until he cracked in the first set on Friday. He regrouped quickly enough and was all over his opponent at the end of the second set, getting stronger in the third before being pushed to the limit in the fourth. He struck 58 clean winners, alongside 43 unforced errors as he strove time and again for the quick point. In a tense finish, there were precious few of those. His defence and returning formed the foundations of his victory, although his foe proved stubborn all the way. Carreño Busta saved two break points in the seventh game of the fourth set, and was 40-love up serving to stay in the tournament moments later. He battled through five deuce points before holding, saving one point with a between-the-legs tweener on the baseline. Strong, fit and seasoned at 31 after surviving years of injuries, Anderson got to use his biggest weapon, his mighty serve, to put the finishing touches to his effort in just under three hours, but not before Carreño Busta won a 38-shot rally, the longest of the match, then another of 24. The Spanish wall finally collapsed, as even a shanked second serve could not stop the man from Johannesburg. He looked as relieved as his opponent was spent when Carreño Busta’s last tired effort billowed the net. It was not a classic, but it did not want for total effort by both men. Anderson, who dropped to 80 in the world after missing the Australian Open with a hip injury, will lift him for one final effort in Sunday’s final. He said immediately afterwards, “It’s been a long road. We’ve been privileged to play in these tournaments against some of the game’s great players; it was nice for some of them to give us the opportunity to do this [by the absence]. It’s why we worked so hard. It was an unbelievably tough match for both of us. I really had to dig deep there. I’m just over the moon. I’ve given myself one more shot. “Last year, I was told I probably needed surgery on my hip, but here I am just nine months later. This means the absolute world to me.” He also name-checked his British coach, Neville Goodwin, “who’s been with me for years”. Earlier, after a match that could not have provided a bigger contrast in style, Hingis said of her undefeated mixed doubles run with Murray, “Jamie carried me pretty much for an hour and half. I’m the older player. But he did great.” Asked what their secret was, Murray smiled and said, “I picked the best partner. We’ve fought through some super tough matches. She made some great shots at the end there, off the baseline. We’re looking forward to the final.” It was ideal preparation for Saturday’s final, where they will be favoured to win a second slam title when they play the third seeds, Taipai’s Hao-Ching Chan and the New Zealander Michael Venus, in the final on Saturday. While reaching for glory, they will not lack for financial incentive. Murray and Hingis, who are unbeaten since pairing up at Wimbledon this summer, would have shared a relatively puny $US30,000 if they had lost on Friday [$20,000 less than a first-round loser in the men’s and women’s singles draws; the singles champions each take home $3,700,000], but are now guaranteed a $70,000 pot as finalists and would split $675,000 if they won the title. It was not easy. Murray gifted their opponents set point when he butchered a drop shot in the second-set tie-break, and Vandeweghe – who was devastated after losing in the singles semi-finals to compatriot Madison Keys on Thursday - grabbed another with a sublime lob. Tecau turned villain, netting a simple volley. Hingis grabbed match point with an uncompromising drive down the middle and Murray stepped up to do the rest, forcing a final wide return from Tecau. Hingis, who came out of a six-year retirement in 2013, is also in the women’s doubles final on Sunday, but said her body “was holding up OK”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/09/sunderland-sheffield-united-championship-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T17:11:42Z","webTitle":"Sheffield United soar after Clayton Donaldson downs wretched Sunderland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/09/sunderland-sheffield-united-championship-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/09/sunderland-sheffield-united-championship-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Sheffield United soar after Clayton Donaldson downs wretched Sunderland","bodyText":"Clayton Donaldson endeared himself to a new public by scoring two splendid goals on his Sheffield United debut as Chris Wilder’s side continued to suggest they could yet prove capable of challenging for a second successive promotion. On this early evidence, avoiding successive relegations may be the extent of Sunderland’s ambitions this season. Simon Grayson had hoped to preside over his new team’s first home win since December but the power and unerring accuracy of Donaldson’s left foot ensured the wait goes on. Although Jack Rodwell headed in a stoppage time consolation from Callum McManaman’s free-kick, this was a frequently awful Sunderland performance leavened only by some promising moments from Crystal Palace loanee Jonny Williams. Damningly that goal represented their sole effort on target. It threatens to be a long winter for Grayson, who was so distressed by Sunderland’s previous display – a 3-0 defeat at Barnsley last month – that he cancelled plans to watch his favourite rock band, Kasabian, in concert that evening. He seemed similarly downcast on Saturday night. “It’s frustrating for everyone,” said Grayson who, after this defensive horror show, will surely find the title of Kasabain’s latest album, For Crying Out Loud, particularly evocative. “But we always knew it was going to be a tough season. It’s a big job but there’s still a long way to go. Things can change very quickly.” He had endeavoured to alter the long-running winless home ground narrative by matching Sheffield United and setting Sunderland up with a back three. This switch failed to make an impact, leaving Lamine Koné and company with no answer to the 21st-minute counter-attack that concluded with Donaldson collecting Billy Sharp’s delivery, dodging Marc Wilson and squeezing a left-foot shot just inside the near post from the edge of the area. Wilder’s deadline day signing from Birmingham City continued to pose Sunderland problems and might have scored again had Robbin Ruiter not tipped his looping header from Mark Duffy’s cross over the bar. Released by Utrecht this summer, the goalkeeper is one of 10 Grayson signings recruited for a grand total of £1.25m. If that sum would almost certainly not afford one of Neymar’s toenails, it also highlights the scale of the challenge facing Sunderland’s latest manager. As Rodwell, among others, endured chants of “You’re not fit to wear the shirt,” it was often hard to recognise that United, for whom Chris Basham impressed defensively, had been a League One side last season and Sunderland Premier League residents. Donaldson duly delighted in amplifying the crowd’s unhappiness by springing the home offside trap and scoring again. Accelerating onto David Brooks’s fine through ball the 33-year-old extended that menacing left foot to shoot beyond the advancing Ruiter and on into the top corner from outside the area. “A great day for Clayton and a fantastic day for our football club,” said Wilder. “Clayton is underrated. We looked a dangerous team.” The nearest Sunderland had come to scoring before that was when, with half-time approaching, James Vaughan met Lewis Grabban’s cross and volleyed fractionally wide of the far post. Sheffield United very nearly celebrated a third when Ched Evans, on for Donaldson, saw a shot deflected onto the top of the bar. Judging by the boos that greeted the final whistle, Rodwell’s subsequent contribution deceived no one. “Are you watching Ellis Short,” chorused the suitably disillusioned Wearsiders. Right now, they seem to regard the American financier’s stewardship of their club with the sort of distaste Newcastle fans reserve for Mike Ashley’s regime."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/08/jamie-murray-martina-hingis-us-open-mixed-doubles","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T22:58:53Z","webTitle":"Jamie Murray and Martina Hingis reach US Open mixed doubles final","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/08/jamie-murray-martina-hingis-us-open-mixed-doubles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/08/jamie-murray-martina-hingis-us-open-mixed-doubles","fields":{"headline":"Jamie Murray and Martina Hingis reach US Open mixed doubles final","bodyText":"All in all it has been a mixed week for the Murray family. On Wednesday Andy confirmed he would probably miss the rest of the season to let his hip heal; on Friday his elder brother Jamie combined with Martina Hingis to reach the final of the mixed doubles with a tense but convincing 6-4, 7-6 (8) win over Horia Tecau and Coco Vandeweghe. Murray and Hingis, the Wimbledon champions, got the job done in a tight tussle on the intimate, half-filled Grandstand court but they were not complaining. While mixed doubles is on the outer periphery of the competitive game, it has its devotees and there was much to admire in the touch and artistry on show, especially from Murray.Hingis, the 37-year-old Swiss who won five slams in singles and whose late career has blossomed since she returned four years ago to shake up the doubles scene, said: “Jamie carried me pretty much for an hour and half. I’m the older player. But he did great.” When asked what was the secret of their success, Murray, smiling broadly, said. “I picked the best partner. We’ve fought through some super tough matches. She made some great shots at the end there, off the baseline.

Hingis, who came out of a six-year retirement in 2013, is also in the women’s doubles final on Sunday, but said her body, “was holding up OK”. Earlier the Dutchman Jean-Julien Rojer, who partnered Tecau to win the men’s doubles title, beating the Spaniards Feliciano and Marc López 6-4, 6-3 on the Arthur Ashe court, celebrated with a passionate denunciation of racism and explained the significance of the Statue of Liberty shirt he has been wearing throughout the tournament. Rojer said the image of the New York statue bound in red, white and blue, signified his commitment to justice and democracy.It struck a chord with the crowd and then with journalists unaccustomed to hearing players stray into social commentary. Tennis, like golf, is assertively apolitical, here and elsewhere. “It’s funny. In the beginning I wasn’t getting questions,” Rojer said of his T-shirt. “Once we made the semi-finals you get a little bit more attention and more press. I’m glad it worked out that way, because I have Lady Liberty on the front of the shirt and a jacket that I wear with the Statue of Liberty on the front and a peace symbol on the back. “I have been here since I’m 12 years. It’s where I started playing tennis and it gave me my opportunity to play. I just wanted to get the conversation going, promoting freedom and justice, liberty for everybody on gender issues, on racial issues, which we deal a lot with in this country. “In tennis we don’t say much about it. But this is just tennis; we deal with real life issues out there. And especially I think it’s symbolic to be here. This is New York City. I heard a story of a gentleman who saw my jacket, a firefighter. He liked it. “I’m not like a political symbol here, [but] I come from Curacao [a former Dutch colony 40 miles off the coast of Venezuela], different races and ethnicgroups that live together. First time I noticed colour was when I came to the US, sad to say. I see a lot of unfair stuff going on. Some of these people don’t have a voice to defend themselves. “It really came about after Charlottesville [where neo-Nazis clashed with anti-fascists last month], and I thought [the T-shirt] was a good message. You can never say too much stuff for equality for everybody in this country. That message needs to be passed on constantly. Maybe I change five people’s minds. It’s a step in the right direction.” Tacau, who has played with Rojer for four years, endorsed Rojer’s comments. “Jules is an outspoken guy,” Tecau said. “He’ll talk more than other players but I think, as role models for the generations behind us, the young generation, it’s important to say that. We’re not just athletes competing for slams and prizemoney and glory. We try to compete in sports and get better and improve and all that. In the locker room, everybody is the same.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/sep/10/bernard-dunstan-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T10:47:06Z","webTitle":"Bernard Dunstan obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/10/bernard-dunstan-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/10/bernard-dunstan-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Bernard Dunstan obituary","bodyText":"The artist Bernard Dunstan, who has died aged 97, was an admirer of Pierre Bonnard’s dictum that: “The thing must start with a vision, with a moment of excitement. After that, you study the model.” His own luminous paintings, so evocative of the intimisme of Bonnard and Édouard Vuillard, combined an impression of spontaneity with a rigorous technique founded on direct observation and meticulous drawings. Among his best works were pictures of orchestras, derived from extensive sittings during rehearsals. As well as creating subtle, tender images of the human figure, Dunstan was a dedicated teacher and author of systematic guides to painting. His publications, in Studio Vista’s Pocket How to Do It series, range from Composing Your Paintings (1971) to books on genres such as portraiture and still life (1966 and 1969 respectively). They offer a detailed analysis of the formal aspects of art, together with practical tips that range from the cleaning of brushes to the importance of financial correspondence with patrons. He also produced, in 1976, a book on Painting Methods of the Impressionists, a group of artists who, like him, were less spontaneous in practice than in appearance. Dunstan clearly saw himself as part of the mainstream of western art, and all his books switched confidently from analysis of old masters to examples of his own work. His edition of Ruskin’s Elements of Drawing, published in 1991, includes his pastels of cloud studies, which demonstrate Ruskin’s doctrines as effectively as any of the more celebrated pictures that they accompany. The book is not only a lucid version of Ruskin’s text but also shows how important close observation of his subjects was to Dunstan himself. Much of the charm of his compositions, especially the nudes, comes from their accidental quality. While Dunstan did sometimes construct pictures in his studio using a hired model, he seemed happiest to “come across” a motif or pose. This often happened when he left his home in Kew, south west London, to travel with his wife, the artist Diana Armfield, or to stay in their cottage in Wales. Scenes of Nude Waking (1988) or Diana sitting in contemplation on her bed (Winter Morning: Nude, 1990) have an informality that makes them come alive, even though, as Dunstan put it, “there is a lot of geometry hidden away under the casual appearance”. Dunstan was not primarily a landscape painter, unlike his wife, but he did become something of a specialist in the scenery and people of Venice. He gave this most popular of themes a personal inflection, reflecting the circumstances in which he worked. One example, On the Riva (1990), succinctly captures a specific historical moment: the first year in which eastern European tourists could visit La Serenissima in numbers. Carefully managing their budgets, the visitors picnic informally on the Riva degli Schiavoni (the Slavs’ waterfront, one of the city’s main streets). Such images exemplify the career of a man who did not seek to redefine art but produced a distinctive response to the traditions of western painting, rooted in his particular experiences and perceptions. Born in Teddington, south-west London, Bernard was the son of Albert Dunstan, a successful petrochemical engineer with BP, and his wife Louisa (nee Cleaverley). He attended Colet Court school, where art instruction consisted of copper-plate writing, and St Paul’s boys’ school, west London, before being rejected by the RAF at the beginning of the second world war on account of his eyesight. As the camouflage department was somewhat oversubscribed, in 1939 he began his artistic training at the Byam Shaw School of Art in London. Soon afterwards he entered the Slade School of Fine Art, which had been evacuated from London to Oxford, and after the war he taught art until 1949 at the Royal West of England Academy in Bristol. It was at the end of this period, in 1949, that he married Diana, whom he had met a few years earlier at the Slade. The post in Bristol was followed in the 1950s by appointments as a lecturer at Camberwell School of Art in London, his alma mater, Byam Shaw, and Ravensbourne Art College, also in London, while he weathered the avant garde storm of the 60s with a job at City &amp; Guilds of London Art School. In these institutions he promoted a method of figurative painting that shared something of its step-by-step approach with the “basic design” espoused by abstract artists, however different the results were. For all his apparent obliviousness to fashion, Dunstan remained reasonably successful, exhibiting regularly with Roland, Browse and Delbanco in London from 1952 to 1970, and then with other galleries, including Agnew’s. He showed annually in the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition and eventually became the longest serving Royal Academician thanks to his election in 1968. He also served as president of the Royal West of England Academy in the early 80s. Crucially, Dunstan was a member of the New English Art Club, the society that had been founded in the 1880s in opposition to the RA, as a bastion of new-fangled impressionism. As Dunstan himself said, by the time he joined the Art Club in 1947, it was already middle-aged, but it provided a link with Walter Sickert and other historic figures on whom he drew heavily. At his death some of the warmest tributes have come from NEAC members, who found him a source of instruction and inspiration as an exponent of the “poetry of paint”. He is survived by Diana, two sons, Andrew and David, and two grandsons, Mark and Wade; another son, Robert, died in 2007. • Bernard Dunstan, painter, born 19 January 1920; died 20 August 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/09/pr-execs-behaving-badly-what-else-would-you-expect-bell-pottinger","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T23:04:21Z","webTitle":"PR execs behaving badly...

What else would you expect?","bodyText":"Thanks to Newsnight’s Kirsty Wark, when she interviewed Tim Bell about the disgracing of his former PR agency, we have enjoyed a glimpse of the charms that still captivate politicians and celebrities, long after he nurtured the reputations of, among many others, Mrs Thatcher, Ernest Saunders, David Mellor, Rolf Harris and Neil and Christine Hamilton. Mr Hamilton, who now identifies as Ukip, took envelopes of cash from Mohamed Al Fayed, in exchange for covert lobbying duties, then lied about it. “I really enjoyed working with people like them,” Bell writes in his memoir, Right or Wrong. “But the downside was that I often became a target by association.” Mercifully, he is able, he confides, to “not to give a fuck about what people think of me”. Now that Bell finds himself targeted by association with his former company, Bell Pottinger – though possibly more imperilled, to judge by Newsnight, by association with himself – his friends must hope that sublime indifference remains intact. Since potential future clients of Lord Bell may wonder if it was wise, appearance-wise, for the senior PR to allow his mobile phone twice to interrupt the Wark interview, which duly paused for the professional to establish if it was anything he should prioritise over his own reputation for competence. Between calls, Bell’s masterclass in reputational self-laundering may have failed to convince all viewers that he was without any responsibility for the contract that led to Bell Pottinger being expelled by the UK PRs’ trade body, the Public Relations and Communications Association (PRCA). He had, as Wark pointed out, initially sent an email endorsing the deal. PRs at Bell Pottinger, the PRCA found, had promoted the interests of the powerful Gupta family, which is closely linked with that of President Jacob Zuma, by suggesting their critics represented “white monopoly capital”. They should have known, the PRCA said, “that the campaign was at risk of causing offence, including on the grounds of race”. The PRCA’s director general, Francis Ingham, said the company had “brought the PR and communications industry into disrepute with its actions and it has received the harshest possible sanctions”. For his part, Bell Pottinger’s founder, Lord Bell, departed the agency in August 2016 (some months after it began working with the Guptas) to start a new business, Sans Frontières, which would never dream of inflaming racial tensions in South Africa. But potential clients requiring the more understanding sort of PR support should not repine. One of Sans Frontières’ senior consultants, formerly of Bell Pottinger, has valued experience, it says, at “advising UHNW (ultra-high-net-worth) individuals on extremely sensitive issues concerning cross-border transactions, criminal wrongdoing and cultural heritage”. And before he decided that the Gupta business looked a bit, in the PR jargon, “smelly”, Bell himself had chosen to help, in no particular order, General Pinochet, Rebekah Wade, Imperial Tobacco, the government of Belarus, David Davis (in his leadership campaign) and the Sultan of Brunei, “a lovely man”. In fairness, this was before the sultan imposed sharia law. Even with his recent olfactory trouble, Bell has yet to retract an ethical position he advanced at a legendary PR event held, naturally, in Dubai: “Everyone has the right to representation.” If this argument tends to align PRs’ less fragrant clients, unflatteringly, if not always inaccurately, along with accused serial murderers entitled to legal representation, it seems to have caught on, possibly because it also elevates PRs for payday lenders to the status of disinterested, highly trained human rights professionals, pretty much indistinguishable from Amal Clooney. Maybe Bell was right, given the number of rivals who would have happily taken on his clients, to complain of tall poppy martyrdom. “It’s much more fun to attack me,” he has said, “or the Saatchi brothers, or Matthew Freud, or Max Clifford.” Obviously that was before Clifford was sentenced to eight years for indecent assaults and Charles Saatchi was photographed with his then wife, “holding her head by the neck to make her focus”. Given the number of PR companies whose fortunes rely upon a Bell-style addition to the charter of fundamental human rights, possibly the most surprising aspect of the PRCA’s decision was that revelation about a code of conduct. Who knew, bearing in mind the deals that meet with zero condemnation, that it had gone to the trouble of making one up? As it is, the sacking of Bell Pottinger offers useful pointers on what, in the industry’s view, does not bring it into disrepute. It’s fine, for instance, for PRs to use Victoria Pendleton to sanitise gambling company Betfair; for Portland, with its staff of ex-Blairites, to help out Putin, then Qatar; for the picked-on Matthew Freud, lobbyist for the junk food industry, to double as adviser to the Department of Health on healthy eating. As grotesque as it may be for a journalist to criticise members of any other trade, there is, along with the arrival of patchy, much of it Leveson-induced, press self-regulation, evidence of healthy public suspicion about the business and political interests behind, for instance, the Sun’s pro-Sky stories and the Times’s Trump promotion. Similarly, at George Osborne’s Standard, with its unrivalled George Osborne coverage (which is widely predicted to take the coveted Editorial Intelligence George Osborne award for writing about George Osborne, judged by an industry panel composed of George Osborne). Had he taken on an expert PR, as opposed to a newsroom apprenticeship, newspaper testimonies to his brilliance might have appeared as spontaneously unsought as was Vogue’s “Rose in the Desert” tribute, when Bell “helped” Asma al-Assad. If it expects people not to laugh when Ingham describes it as “overwhelmingly ethical”, the PR industry might want to extend its concept of disrepute beyond Bell Pottinger’s offence and spend a few years evicting members grubbing in London’s profitable reputation laundry, ditto the revolving door that remains as active as it was in 2011, when exposed by Leveson and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. The previous year, David Cameron promised a purge of lobbyists. His zeal for transparency was, of course, so effective that, within six months of his self-imposed humiliation (after which he borrowed a house owned by a PR friend, Alan Parker) five of his leading advisers had been offered jobs in corporate lobbying. Supposing we rule out pity for individuals whose collective failure on Brexit might resemble something of a CV-blighter, their value lies in covert access: to politicians who might themselves, whether from politeness or a care for the future, be minded to indulge former colleagues now paid to advance the case for laissez-faire on anything from – one imagines – gambling and sugary drinks to payday lending, energy prices, Rupert Murdoch and health and safety. For this system to continue untroubled, nothing could be more helpful than the identification of Bell Pottinger, by some of the industry’s sternest ethicists, as the unforgivable, surpassingly rare, quite unacceptable face of PR."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/08/northern-ireland-james-brokenshire-power-sharing","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T21:41:22Z","webTitle":"Northern Ireland secretary puts pressure on assembly to reach power-sharing deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/08/northern-ireland-james-brokenshire-power-sharing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/08/northern-ireland-james-brokenshire-power-sharing","fields":{"headline":"Northern Ireland secretary urges assembly to reach deal","bodyText":"The British government will consider whether to stop paying members of the Northern Ireland assembly if Ulster politicians fail to reach a deal to restore power-sharing government in the region. The Northern Ireland secretary raised the possibility on Friday that individual salaries of more than £50,000 per annum being frozen in the absence of the Stormont assembly getting up and running again. James Brokenshire also warned that while London prefers to see the restoration of devolved government in Belfast, the Westminster government could be forced back into direct rule. In a speech to the British Irish Association at Cambridge University on Friday evening, Brokenshire said: “In the continuing absence of devolution, the UK government retains ultimate responsibility for good governance and political stability in Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom and we will not shirk from the necessary measures to deliver that. “At the same time we will need to consider carefully a range of other issues reflecting public concern, including whether it can continue to be justified to pay assembly members who have not met for several months now.” Brokenshire acknowledged that it would be “a hugely retrograde step, a massive setback after so many years of progress and hope” if the government in London had to take back direct charge of Northern Ireland. He continued: “If things don’t change we are on a glide path to greater and greater UK government intervention. But we can still change course.” The Northern Ireland secretary urged the assembly parties, in particular Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionists, to reach a compromise aimed at bringing back power-sharing government in the region. Britain’s commitment to the 1998 Good Friday agreement remains “steadfast” according to Brokenshire. The government would continue to defend the common travel area between the UK and Ireland after Brexit, he said. Brokenshire said he was concerned that without a functioning power-sharing executive in Belfast, Northern Ireland’s voice was severely weakened in the debate about Brexit and its implications for the region and the entire island. Power-sharing government in Northern Ireland has been suspended since the beginning of 2017, after the late Martin McGuinness withdrew from the post as deputy first minister of Northern Ireland. McGuinness resigned after Arlene Foster refused to temporarily stand down from office while an inquiry was held over a controversial and costly renewable energy scheme which the DUP championed in government. Under the rules of devolved power-sharing, if the leading representative of one section of the community resigns from office the entire administration falls."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/09/journeys-end-review-sam-clafin-toronto-film-festival-2017-tiff","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T08:30:03Z","webTitle":"Journey's End review – Sam Claflin first world war drama proves run-of-the-military","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/09/journeys-end-review-sam-clafin-toronto-film-festival-2017-tiff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/09/journeys-end-review-sam-clafin-toronto-film-festival-2017-tiff","fields":{"headline":"Journey's End review – Sam Claflin first world war drama proves run-of-the-military","bodyText":"When a filmmaker sets out adapting a stage play, their first order of business is usually divorcing the text from its intrinsic play-ness. Saul Dibb’s new treatment of RC Sherriff’s celebrated first world war drama Journey’s End goes to great lengths to obscure the fact that the action was almost entirely constrained to a dimly lit dugout shelter, visualising the trenches and battlefield originally left offstage. The great pathos of Sherriff’s 1928 work unspools in this pressure chamber of near-death anxiety, as soldiers drink and fight and sullenly sit in silence while waiting for the heat of battle to come to them. The trouble is that during the considerable amount of time spent in that cramped subterranean hideaway, the audience can feel Dibb fidgeting to get out so he can do and show more. In this respect, his behaviour mirrors that of the young troops itching for action. What makes for a good serviceman, however, doesn’t necessarily make for a good director. Dibb is working at cross purposes with himself, trying to communicate the claustrophobia of the dugout while simultaneously escaping it at every opportunity. For the men of C Company that inhabit it, the primary setting functions as a grim limbo, a liminal space where oblivion may not be present, but is definitely imminent. An introductory title card informs us that each squadron of infantry was required to spend six days of every month on the front, and the film plays out over the course of four such days. It’s a time of unease, and perhaps Dibb is angling to capture that restlessness through his constant diversions: dream sequences and treks through the foxholes that feel aimless aside from proudly displaying the lads’ workmanlike efficiency. (This adaptation, the fifth cinematic rendering of Sherriff’s play, was commissioned as part of the United Kingdom’s WWI Centenary Commemoration. To Dibb’s credit, he evokes the somber spirit of nationalism more vividly than, say, a bronze statue.) The chaps of C Company fulfill all the classic war-picture stock roles, though Journey’s End is old enough that one could probably credit it with creating those clichés in the first place. Our boy is Lieutenant Raleigh (Asa Butterfield, whose childlike face is a crucial asset in his performance), a wet-behind-the-ears recruit getting his first taste of combat and offering the audience a surrogate in this unfamiliar environment. Marked for tragedy from the moment he naively describes the hell of war as “frightfully exciting,” his innocence gets eradicated in brutal fashion, and Butterfield acts with studied terror. Captain Stanhope (Sam Claflin, a far cry from the young Laurence Olivier who originated the role) is Raleigh’s school chum and a picture of his dark future, shell-shocked and self-medicating with pre-noon boozing. He’s a cauldron of painful emotions: self-loathing over his slide into profligate alcoholism, angry at Raleigh for subjecting himself to a nightmare the boy can’t yet comprehend, and haunted by the memories of fiery annihilation from an earlier skirmish. The character dynamics are still as rich as when Sherriff first realised them, and C Company’s supporting servicemen add a few complementary hues to this portrait of militarised despair. (As a forgetful staff cook, Toby Jones brings a more accessibly civilian viewpoint to the foreign terrain of war.) And yet Dibb’s direction doesn’t leave the actors enough room to breathe. His camerawork is indifferent in moments of repose, and when he shifts into intensity mode, his close-ups go individual moustache hair-levels of extreme. A drab colour palette and run-of-the-military score contribute to an all-around lack of distinction, too. It’s almost as if Dibb doesn’t trust the script, an odd hangup to have with material so thoroughly enshrined in the British dramaturgical canon. It is to this film’s great misfortune that it has to exist in such close proximity to Dunkirk, a film that tackles, if not the same war, at least the same historical milieu and key ideas — the gutting effect trauma has on young men, the distinctly British propriety of stiff-upper-lipped combat — far more effectively. Like Dibb, Nolan understood that the anticipation of an unseen enemy can be far more excruciating than the immediacy of a firefight. Nolan made this approach work through a confident comfort with silence and stillness, two elements of which Dibb seems fearful. As a result, Journey’s End winds up a restless film, searching for a way out of what should be its destination. Keep calm and carry on, right past the marquee."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/09/hurricane-jose-storm-almost-category-five-as-it-follows-irmas-destructive-path","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T14:37:31Z","webTitle":"Hurricane Jose: storm nearly 'category five' as it follows Irma's destructive path","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/09/hurricane-jose-storm-almost-category-five-as-it-follows-irmas-destructive-path","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/09/hurricane-jose-storm-almost-category-five-as-it-follows-irmas-destructive-path","fields":{"headline":"Hurricane Jose: storm nearly 'category five' as it follows Irma's destructive path","bodyText":"Hurricane Jose has weakened slightly, but remains a “dangerous category four hurricane” as it heads towards the eastern Caribbean islands ravage by Hurricane Irma. Jose was about 160 miles (260km) east-southeast of the northern Leeward Islands on Saturday morning and was forecast to hit the outlying Caribbean islands later in the day. The US national hurricane centre issued hurricane warnings for the eastern Caribbean islands of Sint Maarten, St Martin and St Barthelemy, and tropical storm warnings for Barbuda and Anguilla and Saba and St. Eustatius. A troprical storm watch is in effect for British Virgin Islands, St. Thomas and St. John and Antigua. In the Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Katia made landfall north of Tecolutla, Mexico early on Saturday. The storm has since been downgraded to a depression near the Sierra Madre mountains, but officials are warning of “life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.” Many of Irma’s victims have already fled their devastated islands on ferries and fishing boats for fear of Jose, which could punish some places all over again this weekend. “I don’t think it takes a rocket scientist to know that further damage is imminent,” said inspector Frankie Thomas of the Antigua and Barbuda police. Authorities said about 90% of Barbuda, a coral island rising just 125 feet (38 meters) above sea level, had been devastated by Irma. Its 1,400 inhabitants were ordered to evacuate on Friday to neighboring Antigua, where Stevet Jeremiah was reunited with one son and made plans to bury another. Jeremiah, who sells lobster and crab to tourists, was huddled in her wooden home on Barbuda this week with her partner and their two- and four-year-old boys as Irma ripped open their metal roof and sent the ocean surging into the house. Her younger son, Carl Junior Francis, was swept away. Neighbors found his body after sunrise. “Two years old. He just turned two, the 17th, last month. Just turned two,” she repeated. Her first task, she said, would be to organize his funeral. “That’s all I can do. There is nothing else I can do.” The dead included 11 on St Martin and St Barts, four in the US Virgin Islands, four in the British Virgin Islands and one each on Anguilla and Barbuda. Laura Strickling, who lives with her husband Taylor on St Thomas, said they had huddled in a basement apartment along with another family as Irma storm raged for 12 hours. “The noise was just deafening. It was so loud we thought the roof was gone,” she said, adding that she and the three other adults “were terrified but keeping it together for the babies”. “We’re obviously worried by the thought of having to do it all again with Hurricane Jose. It’s not good,” she said. In Mexico, which is also dealing with its most powerful earthquake in a century, Katia was expected to weaken rapidly over the next day, the USNHC said. Category 1 is the NHC’s weakest hurricane designation while category 5 is the strongest. Storms of category 3 and above are defined as major hurricanes. Veracruz state officials said in a statement that the storm could cause landslides and flooding, and urged people living below hills and slopes to be prepared to evacuate. Luis Felipe Puente, head of Mexico’s national emergency services, said this week that Katia has “worrying characteristics” because it is very slow-moving and could dump a lot of rain on areas that have been saturated in recent weeks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/09/connie-johnson-breast-cancer-awareness-advocate-dies-at-40","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T00:37:35Z","webTitle":"Connie Johnson, breast cancer awareness advocate, dies at 40","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/09/connie-johnson-breast-cancer-awareness-advocate-dies-at-40","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/09/connie-johnson-breast-cancer-awareness-advocate-dies-at-40","fields":{"headline":"Connie Johnson, breast cancer awareness advocate, dies at 40","bodyText":"Cancer fundraiser Connie Johnson has died, a day after being made a member of the Order of Australia. Johnson, 40, survived cancer twice as a child and in her early 20s before being diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 33. When she was told the cancer was terminal, she founded the charity Love Your Sister along with her brother, actor Sam Johnson, with the aim of raising money for cancer research and encouraging women in Australia to be aware of the early signs of breast cancer. The charity has now raised $5.6m for cancer research and Sam Johnson, who won the Gold Logie award for best actor in 2017 for his portrayal of Australian television icon Molly Meldrum, has said he will not return to acting until they raise $10m. In a statement on the Love Your Sister Facebook page on Friday night, Sam Johnson said: “We lost Connie today. Or, as she asked me to say, she died of cancer today….She went so richly, and with such grace. “I’m sad and sorry to be the one to tell you this, yet at the same time, as the chief custodian of my sister’s legacy, I also feel extremely grateful and proud,” he said. “I’m off to cuddle the fam and warmly embrace an exquisite whisky, in memory of my sister, who did so bloody well, from start to finish. Thanks for everything, Connie Cottonsocks. It was my pleasure to be your Sammy Seal.” In a 2014 TedX Talk in Brisbane, Connie Johnson explained how she and her brother concocted a plan for him to ride 16,000 km around Australia on a unicycle to raise awareness of breast cancer, breaking the world record for a solo unicycle journey and raising $1.8m for cancer research. “(We) cooked up a way to give me a long-lasting legacy,” she said. “Something that would be around long after I was gone. Something my kids could read about and say: wow. That was our mum.” Johnson said raising money and awareness about breast cancer had become the top item on her bucket list, beyond spending time with her partner, Mike, and two sons. “The reality of the rest of my life is I will be in and out of hospitals on a never-ending regime of medication to keep me alive for another month,” she said. She spoke about surviving cancer at the ages of 12 and then 22, only to be told, at 33, that “this time I would not be a survivor.” “Me and cancer, well, we have a love hate relationship,” she said. “I absolutely hate cancer, but unfortunately cancer loves me.” She received the Medal of the Order of Australia on Thursday from governor-general Peter Cosgrove, who visited her in the hospice where she was getting palliative care. “Her eyes danced like when we were kids,” Sam Johnson said. “She looked so alive. “Afterwards, she looked at me sideways, coz she can’t move her head too well, and she kept saying, in her weak and raspy voice: ‘Can you believe it? Can you believe it? Look what we did. We did something!’” Supporters of Love Your Sister have left tributes on the foundation’s website, saying Johnson was an “inspiration” and thanking her for sharing her experience."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/09/leicester-city-chelsea-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T16:18:43Z","webTitle":"Chelsea hold on as N’Golo Kanté goal edges them past Leicester City","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/09/leicester-city-chelsea-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/09/leicester-city-chelsea-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Chelsea hold on as N’Golo Kanté goal edges them past Leicester City","bodyText":"After spending the international break reading up on how to improve his understanding of English football’s vocabulary, Antonio Conte swapped a book and the Italian sunshine for three points and grey skies in the Midlands, as Chelsea continued their resurgence with a third successive Premier League victory.

The Spaniard scored for the third time since his club-record transfer from Real Madrid, expertly guiding a header beyond Kasper Schmeichel to set Chelsea on their way, and N’Golo Kanté marked his return to his former club with a rare goal as Leicester slipped to a third defeat in four matches. Chelsea did not have everything their own way, however, and there were a few anxious moments for Conte and his players to endure after Jamie Vardy converted a penalty shortly after the hour mark to bring Leicester back into the game. A spell of late Leicester pressure ended with Vardy stretching every sinew but not quite managing to get a touch to a cross from the substitute Andy King that flashed across goal. Chelsea should have been out of sight by that point. Davide Zappacosta could easily have marked his debut with a goal, but dragged a low shot inches wide of the far upright and Willian, another second-half substitute, ought to have scored in the closing stages when he had only Schmeichel to beat. In the end, that profligacy never mattered as Chelsea held on for a win that Conte seized on as evidence that the champions are heading in the right direction. “It’s very important to follow our way and this way is to work,” the Chelsea manager said. “Despite our bad start against Burnley, and then a bit of difficulty, to do three wins in a row is important. “The mentality was very strong, very positive, until the penalty because we were in total control. After the penalty, Leicester tried to put a bit of pressure but, despite this, we created many chances to improve our scoreline. We must be satisfied with that. “We are trying to involve new players with the old players of last season and this is a process. We need time.” Morata seems to be adapting quicker than anyone and is proving lethal in the air. His three Chelsea goals have been scored with his head and there was something particularly impressive about the way he steered César Azpilicueta’s superb centre into the bottom corner after drifting away from his marker, Wes Morgan. “A good day for the team and a good day for Álvaro,” said Conte. The Chelsea manager also saw positive signs in the performance of Tiemoué Bakayoko, who lined up alongside Kanté in a midfield that overpowered Leicester in the first half. Leicester, though, still had their chances, in particular just before Morata’s goal, when Chelsea were hit on the counterattack as Riyad Mahrez released Islam Slimani. The Algerian was one-on-one with Thibaut Courtois, but the Chelsea goalkeeper came out on top, blocking the striker’s shot with his right hand. “The big moments aren’t going our way,” said Craig Shakespeare, alluding to that opportunity. Leicester had only themselves to blame for Chelsea’s second, which arrived five minutes into the second half and just after Shakespeare had made a couple of substitutions to try to change the game. Kanté, who is not exactly renowned for his goalscoring ability, had so much time and space to look up and strike a 30-yard shot, which took a slight deflection and almost seemed to find the far corner of the net in slow motion. To their credit, Leicester never surrendered and the home team got their reward when Vardy dispatched a penalty after he had been tripped by Courtois. But they had left themselves too much to do. “We showed a lot of character and resilience,” said Shakespeare. “But we couldn’t quite find that breakthrough once we got the penalty.” Chelsea condemn Morata ‘yids’ chant Chelsea have condemned the antisemitic language used by a section of their supporters at the King Power Stadium in a terrace chant about Álvaro Morata, with the Spaniard and the club demanding the fans stop with immediate effect. The song, linked to their bitter rivalry with Tottenham Hotspur, contains a reference to “Yids”and was heard during Chelsea’s 2-1 victory at Leicester, when Morata scored his third goal for the club. Chelsea said the language was “not acceptable”. Steve Atkins, Chelsea’s head of communications, said: “The club and the players appreciate the fans’ passionate support away from home, of course. But the language in that song is not acceptable at all. “We have spoken to Álvaro after the game. He does not want to be connected with that song in any way and both the player and the club request that the supporters stop singing that song with immediate effect.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/09/how-australias-warner-and-lyon-found-patience-to-rescue-bangladesh-series","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T22:14:10Z","webTitle":"How Australia's Warner and Lyon found patience to rescue Bangladesh series","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/09/how-australias-warner-and-lyon-found-patience-to-rescue-bangladesh-series","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/09/how-australias-warner-and-lyon-found-patience-to-rescue-bangladesh-series","fields":{"headline":"How Australia's Warner and Lyon found patience to rescue Bangladesh series","bodyText":"How often does a Test series reach the end and demand another match? South Africa and Australia in 2011 is a standout but there are few others. Perhaps the greatest achievement of an evolving Bangladesh and an out-of-season Australia was the lure of a decider. That won’t happen now, but a series full of moments to savour and stoushes to chew over have at the very least merited consideration of a fuller encounter next time around. For that, credit goes to local administrators, who had to push for this tour to remain a red-ball affair when the Australians would rather it had been white. After that was settled, through their deeds they showed how much this mattered. Not least through sophisticated security arrangements that ensured they were largely left unremarked upon of once the cricket started. Meanwhile, back in Australia, no one was meant to care, with it being the pointy end of the footy season and all. Not forgetting either that senior players were happy enough for it to be discarded altogether as part of the protracted pay dispute with the Cricket Australia board. For the series to then confound expectations so comprehensively, the legacy of this fortnight is legitimising Bangladesh in Australian eyes as a worthy Test adversary. Even if they did falter when the chance came for them to create more history and deny Australia a series-equalling win in Chittagong. Next time, perhaps. Hopefully after a gap of four years or so, not 11 as it was last time. Turning to Australia’s on-field showing, their most important learnings come via the examples provided by Nathan Lyon and David Warner. It was John Maynard Keynes who (probably) said “When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do?”. He wasn’t talking about cricket, but his thinking matches that deployed by the joint men of the series. The candour central to the Keynes’ statement is the same the pair required in order to finally prevail in this part of the world. At home, both their games were more suited to success. In Asia, the facts proved differently, their ordinary records over long periods proof of that. The onus was on them to change. So they sucked it up and did just that. In Warner’s case, this began with a dedicated meditative process to quieten his busy mind in order to make better decisions. This is consistent with the specialist coaching he receives from Trent Woodhill, who has drilled into him that his best form of defence is taking a positive conviction into each delivery through more pronounced movements forward and back than what is necessary on the truer tracks of Oz. When Bangladesh altered their approach to Warner after his punishing Dhaka ton by spreading the field to cut off his boundary options, he decided instead to score by calmly knocking the ball around. But the century that followed, his slowest by far in Tests, was still governed by that same aggressive footwork process. His commendable commitment to something new is the bedrock of this success. Most impressively, it is a consequence of a choice rather than repeating the old and crossing his fingers. Then there is Lyon. How he bowled in Asian climes always suggested a nagging lack of belief. Each delivery was ripped hard in a quest for perfection; an implicit attempt to validate that with his own off-breaks he had just as much to offer as whichever flashy wrist-spinning alternative was being talked up to replace him at Australia’s primary slow bowler at the time. Call it his own version of Impostor Syndrome in the post-Warne world of googlies and flippers and all the rest. As a result, put simply, he seldom bowled a straight one. This was despite watching teammates file back after being routinely beaten on the inside edge by finger spinners doing just that – even those who have the skills to turn it a couple of feet. This is all integral to their art but it wasn’t for the Australian. Until now. On this, Lyon was never more instructive than in his comments after bagging five wickets on the first day at Chittagong. He beamed, noting the hosts’ top order had been done by balls that weren’t turning, reckoning that he had spun “about two all day”. Bowling ugly was how he characterised it, describing this as a key difference to how it was before for him in Asia. Six years after his maiden tour to the region, the vital clue was unlocked. Namely, that to triumph he doesn’t require them all to drop beautifully then rip at right angles. Wickets from deliveries that don’t turn may not go viral on YouTube, but they have played a major hand elevating Lyon to the list of top ten-ranked bowlers on the planet for the first time. A cricketer reborn, just at the age (he’s 30 in November) when spinners historically peak. The relative comfort of Australia’s victory in Chittagong didn’t moderate post-match dismay over middle-order batting collapses that are as much the calling card of this side as Steve Smith’s thirst for runs. Both the captain and coach Darren Lehmann are convinced this is a product of mindset rather than skill. For the batsmen in question to find their own way to a better place, they could do a lot worse than seeking out their Bangladesh standard-bearers. The pair who accepted the facts, transformed their thinking and reset their course."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/14/exodus-begins-as-swifts-muster-for-migration","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T04:30:32Z","webTitle":"Exodus begins as swifts muster for migration","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/14/exodus-begins-as-swifts-muster-for-migration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/14/exodus-begins-as-swifts-muster-for-migration","fields":{"headline":"Exodus begins as swifts muster for migration","bodyText":"Through these last weeks of summer, the autumn migration has played out in the skies, though it goes largely unnoticed by most below. A trickle of an exodus began over the bank holiday with three dark specks, way, way up in the blue. Specks, yes, but you could see, from the wings curved like taut bows, that they were unmistakably swifts. Hatched on northern ledges they had become citizens of heaven. They deviated on insect-chasing sallies in all directions, but were overall tracking south-west. The swifts were almost lost over the horizon when three more materialised in the same spot as the first trio. And then, when those birds had nearly gone from sight, another cluster appeared, and then, when they too were at vanishing point, yet another. For half an hour, until I was summoned back to my paint brush, I watched this loose but connected procession of travellers traversing the sky. I regretted afterwards that I had not stayed to see whether the chain stretched over tens or hundreds of miles. Whenever waves of humidity roll in and the clouds bank up, the air is salted with the frenzied chatter of house martins. Most people must hear them, but no one looks up. Maybe it is just background noise. I watched one of these pop-up flocks the other day, the birds cutting across each other against an ominous blue-black backdrop. All but two of the birds were purposeful in their “fast flap, glide” fly catching, the old and the young milling together in the currents. There was an errant pair in their midst. House martins are noted for their antagonism towards rival birds close to the nest site, but it seemed these two had carried their dispute into the departure lounge. They broke from the crowd to engage in a fierce beak-to-tail chase, tracing loops, bows and chicanes, bodies flashing light-dark-light-dark as they turned. A passive observer, I nevertheless felt the speed, exhilaration – and also pointlessness of the pursuit. Why waste so much energy instead of fuelling for the journey of their lives? It seemed that, for this pair, there was time enough to bicker.

City go top of the Premier League, at least for a couple of hours, with a five-goal skelping of Liverpool. They were already leading when Sadio Mane clattered into Ederson and received his marching orders; the game was only heading one way after that. Kevin De Bruyne, Gabriel Jesus, Leroy Sane and Benjamin Mendy were magnificent. And Ederson is back on the touchline, with a plaster on his jaw but otherwise looking healthy, which is the most important thing of all. Scrub that! There’s time for Sane to pick up possession just to the right of the Liverpool D. He takes a touch and curls one into the top left! A beauty, and this is now officially a rout. 90 min: Everyone would be happy to hear the final whistle now, if the keep-ball going on in the middle of the park is anything to go by. That’ll be sounded in two minutes’ time. 88 min: De Bruyne, quarterbacking from deep, slides a pass down the inside-left channel for Sane, who crosses low. Aguero slides to meet the ball at the far post, and guides it goalwards, but Mignolet spreads himself to save well. 86 min: Solanke sprays a fine ball down the right for Henderson to chase. Out comes Bravo to smother. Henderson thought about going in for the 50-50, but opted out of the challenge, understandably so in the circumstances. 85 min: Sane comes straight through the back of Moreno. Not sure how he’s escaped a booking for that, but it’s just a wee chat. 84 min: 4-0’s Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has a run down the left. It doesn’t lead to much. Liverpool have had no outlet in this second half. Was it such a good idea to take Mo Salah off? 83 min: Fernandinho curls in a cross from the right. Can tries to trap it with his buttocks, perhaps not the wisest idea. The ball clanks to Aguero, who turns Can on the outside and smacks a shot into the side netting on the right. 81 min: Can is booked for a frustrated slide on Aguero. The resulting free kick comes to nothing. 79 min: More keep ball from City, whose fans are now in Party Mode. Penny for erstwhile Arsenal player Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s thoughts, now facing two 4-0 defeats in a row with different clubs. If not something even worse. This had been coming. Another powerful run by Mendy down the left, and another peach of a cross. He slips it inside to Sane, who fires a first-time effort into the bottom left. Mignolet was beaten at his near post, though in truth he’d have done very well to stop that crisp shot, with Liverpool all over the shop at the back. 74 min: Mendy is rampant right now. He strides again down the left and Henderson does very well to swivel and hoick his cross away while standing in front of goal. The away fans are making the most noise right now, as supporters so often do when their team are in an awful pickle like this. 72 min: A brilliant reaction save by Mignolet, from his own player! Mendy whips a low cross in from the left. Matip hangs out a leg, and the ball flashes towards the bottom left. Mignolet does very well indeed to keep the effort, such as it is, out with a strong arm. 70 min: Eliaquim Mangala comes on for Nicolas Otamendi. 69 min: Solanke’s first contribution is to win the ball in midfield with some determined scrambling. He sets Milner off down the right. Milner is clipped by Danilo, and is happy to sit on the turf awhile, running down the clock. The resulting free kick comes to naught. 68 min: Alexander-Arnold is forced to tap out for a corner under pressure from Mendy, pressing hard down the left. From the set piece, Silva and Sane nearly open Liverpool up with some pretty quick-fire passing down the wing, but the offside flag goes up after a crisp one-two. 67 min: Firmino hasn’t stopped chasing, despite the desperate situation Liverpool find themselves in. But his race is run: he’s replaced by Dominic Solanke. 65 min: But suddenly City spring into life, Sane turning on the jets out on the left. He pulls back a cross for De Bruyne, who, breaking news, finally does something that isn’t superb! He leans back and blooters a shot miles over the bar, with the goal at his mercy. 64 min: City with more of the sterile keep-ball. Liverpool will take this, in the hope of avoiding a cricket-score thrashing. Meanwhile here’s Rory Craig again: “After letting myself calm down, and confirming that my unbridled bias towards the Reds got the better of me, that probably was a red card really. But it might not have been. I don’t know. Hardly matters, we probably would have still lost.” 62 min: City play a bit of keep ball in the middle of the park. Walker threatens to break free down the right but Klavan just about manages to keep him away from the danger zone. 60 min: Liverpool can’t get out of their own half. The home crowd are enjoying this. 58 min: James Milner comes on for Georginio Wijnaldum. The City fans give their former player the bird. Always time for a bit of panto in the Premier League. 57 min: The brilliant Gabriel Jesus, who has scored two and had another goal disallowed, won’t be getting his hat-trick. He’s replaced by Leroy Sane. 56 min: ... some intricate triangulation which releases Mendy into space. He rolls a ball across the six-yard box, with Jesus again hovering. Mignolet smothers. Yes, Liverpool have to watch themselves here. 55 min: This could get embarrassing for Liverpool. David Silva slips a pass down the left for Mendy, who hooks towards the near post, where Jesus lurks. The ball’s deflected out for a corner by Klavan. And from the set piece... City have the ball in the net again, and it’s another disallowed goal, Aguero clipping a right-wing cross home but from an offside position. No matter! Seconds later, they intercept a Liverpool hoof upfield. Fernandinho slides a pass down the middle, splitting Liverpool’s new back three, and Aguero is away! He unselfishly passes to Jesus on his left, and the young man finishes with Mignolet utterly stranded! 51 min: ... nothing occurs. 50 min: Firmino has a couple of runs at the City back line, clearly not of a mind to let this one go yet. The second earns a corner down the right, from which ... 48 min: All a bit quiet at the Etihad, however, with a general sense that this is pretty much over, unless Otamendi, for example, manages to get himself sent off. Meanwhile in the interests of balance, which everyone loves on the internet, here’s Rory Craig: “Yes, Mané’s boot is high, but is he not allowed challenge for the ball? Calling the keeper defenceless is a bit of an overstatement I think; his half-hearted challenge for the ball put himself in more danger than if he had dived for it, but that’s just from my view of the challenge.” 46 min: Gary Neville is still standing his ground, incidentally, in his belief that the Mane-Ederson incident was unfortunate, but just a yellow. I guess we’ll be hearing more of it. People like talking points, huh? Adults with differing points of view? Still, how football has changed. This wasn’t even a free kick! Here we go again, then! And what a moment for Alex-Oxlade Chamberlain to make his Liverpool debut, as he comes on for Mo Salah. The home side get the ball rolling for the second half. Hats off to Jon Moss. Because, yes, that’s a red card. On first viewing, it looked an innocent coming together. But Sky have run a few other angles, and while Mane was clearly fixated on controlling the ball, he had his boot recklessly high, and poor Ederson paid the price. Plenty of you agree... Peter Van: “Mané doesn’t intend to harm Ederson, but he lunges recklessly into a defenseless opponent. You might argue he doesn’t know Ederson is there, but that’s just not true; the way he extends his leg lets you know he is aware of the keeper’s presence. He didn’t intend to harm Ederson, but he did not do all he could to avoid a clash that might have - did have - dreadful consequences. It should be a red.” Leo Carroll: “It’s disingenuous to suggest Mane didn’t know the keeper would be there or thereabouts, so at best he was reckless putting his foot that high in that situation, and people tend to forget about peripheral vision when they talk about whether a player has his eye on the ball or not. Players at that level know where the ball is and where other players are around them. So in short, it was a red, and an easy one.” Matthew Wheythorpe: “I’ve never seen a clearer red card.” Lorraine Berry: “On NBC, they have shown an angle that shows Mane’s boot catching Ederson in the chin with a very high boot. Regardless of whether Mane saw him, his boot head high has to be dangerous play. I think the red was justified.” Well that escalated quickly. City were already leading when Sadio Mane was sent off for a high-footed attempt to round Ederson that went horribly wrong. They’re now two goals and a man to the good. The result is theirs for the taking. Back soon! 45 min +8: Salah embarks on another fine dribble down the right, but once again his decision making is poor and he delivers neither cross nor shot. No mistake this time! De Bruyne tries a cross from the left, and it drops on the head of Jesus, who plants a fine header past Mignolet! That was another peach of a cross! City are in control now. 45 min +5: Liverpool are desperate to hear the half time whistle. They can’t get hold of the ball. “I thought it was harsh at first bust looking at the replay I think Moss has got it spot on,” writes Kasete Skeen. “Mane’s foot was high, high enough to hit Ederson in the head and the fact they converged so forcefully makes it all the worse.” Yes, you might be right. Who’d be a referee? 45 min +3: De Bruyne, deep on the right, curls a glorious ball into the middle. Jesus rises and plants a header past the flapping Mignolet. That was some cross, he couldn’t miss! But the flag goes up, correctly, for offside. 45 min +2: Mendy whips a gorgeous cross into the Liverpool box from the right. Aguero, at the far post, seems surprised and can only force a corner. From which... 45 min: Ederson departs, and Claudio Bravo comes on. There will be eight extra minutes added to this half. 43 min: Was Mane unlucky to be sent off? Maybe. Maybe not. Certainly, poor Ederson has come off worst in physical terms, and he’ll take no more part in the game. He’s being carefully loaded onto a stretcher. 40 min: Ederson is down getting a bit of treatment. To be fair, he did take an awful clatter in the face there. But it looked like an honest coming together in an innocent 50-50. I guess folk will have different opinions on the decision, but on Sky both Gary Neville and Thierry Henry think it’s harsh on Mane, regardless of Ederson’s injury. On the touchline, Jurgen Klopp is beside himself with anger. Moss comes over to calm Klopp &amp; Klopp down. 37 min: A long hoick down the middle. Mane springs the offside trap and goes after the ball. Ederson comes out of his area. Mane looks to nick the ball past the keeper on the left. His raised leg connects with the keeper, who goes down. It’s a free kick, sure. But there’s shock in the air as Jon Moss brandishes red. Nobody expected that! That looks a slightly harsh decision, with Mane looking at the ball as the pair collided. Having said that, the keeper did take an unfortunate one in the face. 36 min: City were looking nervous before that opening goal, but now it’s Liverpool who appear jittery. Passes aren’t sticking any more, and the home side are beginning to win most of the battles in midfield. 34 min: Liverpool have been awfully ponderous in defence. Now it’s Klavan’s turn to faff around unnecessarily, and he’s closed down by Jesus, who races off with the ball. Klavan does pretty well to get back and blocks Jesus’s shot from a tight angle. From the resulting corner, the ball drops to Stones, six yards out! He must score, but hits his effort straight at Mignolet, who kicks away well. 33 min: That goal means Aguero has become the top-scoring non-European in Premier League history. How’s that for a contrived stat? He’s got 124 now, one more than Dwight Yorke. 31 min: A wonderful spin by Mane in the midfield, and he slips a pass down the right for Salah. He’s clear. He steps into the box, but telegraphs his intent, opening his body and looking to curl one past Ederson and into the bottom left. The keeper reads it and claims. Salah has been getting in plenty of decent positions, but his final ball has been woeful so far. 29 min: Not much. Can tries to curl one round the wall and into the top right, but gets way too much on it. Goal kick. Maybe Alexander-Arnold will get the next one. 28 min: Mane embarks on a speedy stroll down the inside-left channel. Stones backs off and backs off. Mane prepares to enter the area and shoot. Fernandinho takes matters into his own hands with a clip of Mane’s heel, just to the left of the City D. That’s a booking, and what can Liverpool do with this free kick? 27 min: Firmino slides a pass down the inside-right channel for Salah, who once again is in the City area with time, and once again plays a poor ball. His low, aimless cross is flopped on by Ederson, and the danger is gone. A poor clearing header from Henderson in the midfield. De Bruyne, in the centre circle, slips a perfectly weighted ball down the middle, releasing Aguero who was just onside. A wonderfully timed run, and he rounds Mignolet on the right and rolls the ball into the empty net. So simple! But that’s a very pretty pass and finish. 23 min: Now Mane has a gander down the right. His low fizzer is hacked out by Stones for a corner. From the set piece, Henderson takes a fresh-air screamer from the edge of the box. The home fans enjoyed that. There’s a bit of scrappy head tennis, and finally the flag goes up for offside. 22 min: Can and Moreno exchange passes down the left. Can tries to open up City with a scoop over the back line, but Mane hasn’t read it and Ederson claims. Then another Liverpool attack, as Salah skins Otamendi down the right and bombs towards the byline. He’s got Firmino in the middle, screaming for a tap-in, but decides to flick a shot towards the bottom right, hoping to surprise Ederson at his near post. Nope! 20 min: Alexander-Arnold plays himself into trouble, delaying a simple hoick upfield. He’s closed down by De Bruyne, who races off towards the box. Alexander-Arnold yanks him down just outside the box, and he’s in the book. The free kick, in a dangerous position, is nothing to write home about. 18 min: Can has a smack from 25 yards, but he was falling backwards at the time, and the pea-roller, aimed for the bottom left, is easily claimed by Ederson. 17 min: The first lull of an open game. Stones, under no pressure whatsover as City stroke it around in midfield, blooters a pass high into the stand out on the left. That wasn’t in the brochure. 15 min: Otamendi is off wandering, and Salah is afforded way too much time down the right. Salah cuts inside and shapes to shoot Stones comes across to block brilliantly. The incident gives Liverpool confidence. Mane has a wander down the left and nearly works space to shoot. Then Henderson swings a ball in from the right. Firmino meets it at the far post, but can only flick a leg out from a tight angle. Ederson gathers. This surely won’t be goalless, but good luck guessing who’s going to open the scoring. 13 min: Fernandinho takes up possession 30 yards from goal, and he’s got a little time and space. He threads a low shot towards the bottom left. It’s going in, but it’s not hit with pace, and Mignolet is able to tip the ball around the post. Another corner, another non-event. 12 min: Alexander-Arnold is bollocked by the referee for taking too long over his throw-ins. Rattled, the young full back then concedes a corner from miles out, overcooking a backpass under a little pressure. Fortunately for Liverpool, the City corner comes to nothing. 10 min: After a slow start, City are beginning to impose themselves. Silva and Otamendi combine down the left and nearly release Jesus, but the striker loses control just inside the Liverpool area. 8 min: This is a breezy start all right. Matip is forced into a rushed clearance and concedes a corner down the City right. The corner’s hit deep. Aguero shapes to hit a bicycle kick from the edge of the box, but Klavan crowds him out and Liverpool clear their lines. 7 min: Moreno batters the set piece straight into the wall, looking for the bottom right. Alexander-Arnold gets on the rebound and curls deep, but Firmino can’t get his head on it at the far post. City break upfield, De Bruyne striding down the inside-right channel with great purpose and fizzing a low shot towards the bottom right. Mignolet smothers. 6 min: Otamendi makes an awful hash of clearing a long Matip ball. His mistake allows Salah to zip off down the right. Salah threatens to break into the box, so Otamendi, only half recovering, checks him cynically. He’s booked, and this is a free kick in a dangerous position, just to the right of the City box. 4 min: City have a wander up field for the first time, and Walker is clipped by Mane out on the right wing. A free kick, 35 yards from goal, and a chance for City to load the box. De Bruyne curls the free kick into the mixer. Jesus rises above a static Wijnaldum, who is in Clearing Header (Watford) Mode. The City striker eyebrows an effort wide left; Mignolet was watching it glide harmlessly out of play. But both teams are showing much attacking intent already, pretty much as expected. 2 min: Liverpool are on the front foot early doors. Salah sits on Otamendi’s shoulder and nearly bursts down the right. Then Moreno has a crack from distance, and his effort rebounds out for a corner on the left. The set piece, whipped in by Firmino and dipping by the near post, is snaffled by Ederson. A warm handshake between the two managers ... wide smiles ... a blast of Hey Jude (1968, the year of City’s second title) from the speakers ... and we’re off! Liverpool get the ball rolling. Wijnaldum tries to find Salah down the right wing and possession is lost. City’s turn to get a feel of the ball. The teams are out! City are in their famous sky blue and white shorts; Liverpool in their equally storied all-red strip. There’s a rare old atmosphere at the Etihad; we’ll be off in a minute! These two clubs have had a strange relationship of late. Liverpool have won four of the last five league fixtures, drawing the other one. They’ve handed out a couple of big skelpings: 3-0 at Anfield in March 2016, 4-1 here at the Etihad in November 2015. But on the flip side, Manchester City bested them in the 2016 League Cup final and the 2013-14 title race. So Liverpool may have the recent bragging rights in terms of cold stats, but it’s City who won when it really counted and extended their roll of honour. So does this mean today’s result doesn’t really matter? No. So does that mean this paragraph was a pointless waste of time? Hm. Pep Guardiola speaks! “This kind of game, against top players, is why we are in this world. We have gone with two strikers, because we are going to try to score goals. We have options at the back: we can play a back four, or three and one in the middle. It is not easy to stop Liverpool, they are so quick. But it is not only that, they are well organised, and it is Liverpool. But we are going to minimise their strength points, and try to play our game.” While we’re waiting to hear from Pep ... here’s Barney Ronay, who has high hopes for this match. Jurgen Klopp speaks! “It is 100 percent sure that this will be a high-intense game. City have a very offensive line-up but they have adapted to the speed we have in our team. They have a high-quality defence, and up front they have quality. We need to be brave, but it is difficult against City. Dejan Lovren is not injured, but he has felt the intensity, so Klavan is in. Trent has fresh legs.” Both teams make three changes to their pre-break starting XIs. Of the Manchester City selection sent out at Bournemouth, Vincent Kompany is injured, Raheem Sterling is suspended, and Bernardo Silva drops to the bench. Stepping up: John Stones, Kyle Walker and Sergio Aguero. Liverpool meanwhile shake up the side that worked Arsenal over. Simon Mignolet returns at the expense of Loris Karius, Trent Alexander-Arnold takes Joe Gomez’s slot at right back, and Ragnar Klavan replaces Dejan Lovren. All three of the replaced are on the bench, alongside the new boy Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Manchester City: Ederson, Danilo, Stones, Otamendi, Fernandinho, Walker, De Bruyne, David Silva, Mendy, Aguero, Gabriel Jesus. Subs: Bravo, Gundogan, Mangala, Delph, Sane, Bernardo Silva, Foden. Liverpool: Mignolet, Alexander-Arnold, Matip, Klavan, Moreno, Can, Henderson, Wijnaldum, Salah, Firmino, Mane. Subs: Karius, Lovren, Milner, Gomez, Sturridge, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Solanke. Referee: Jon Moss (W Yorkshire). OK, so I think we’re all agreed: Nicolas Otamendi, John Stones, Dejan Lovren and Simon Mignolet aren’t the second coming of Franco Baresi, Franz Beckenbauer, Bobby Moore and Lev Yashin. But hey, there are worse crimes. And just look at the attacking talent likely to caper across the green grass of the City of Manchester Stadium at some point this afternoon: Kevin De Bruyne, David Silva, Gabriel Jesus, Bernardo Silva, Sergio Agüero, Sadio Mané, Mo Salah, Roberto Firmino, Daniel Sturridge. Say what you like about the balance of these two teams, but Manchester City and Liverpool aren’t short-changing anyone. This could be a cracker. Can you feel the crackle of anticipation? Oh yes, and that’s because after a week of international football, the Premier League is back, back, back! And with a rollicking end-to-end goalfest if previous recent meetings between last season’s third and fourth-placed teams are anything to go by. It’s on! Having been built up thus, the inevitable 0-0 kicks off at: 12.30pm BST."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/09/england-win-series-west-indies-third-test-day-three-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T16:46:00Z","webTitle":"Jimmy Anderson’s career-best seals series win for England over West Indies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/09/england-win-series-west-indies-third-test-day-three-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/09/england-win-series-west-indies-third-test-day-three-report","fields":{"headline":"Jimmy Anderson’s career-best seals series win for England over West Indies","bodyText":"Just think how many wickets he would have got here if he had bowled at the right end. Jimmy Anderson, ever more relaxed now that there were no landmarks in sight, polished off the West Indies’ second innings with career-best figures of 7 for 42, thus enabling England to win the match by nine wickets and to retain the Wisden Trophy. Anderson, operating from the Nursery End, the one less favoured by England’s most prolific bowler, added five more wickets to his overnight tally in 11.1 overs so that the West Indies were bowled out for 177. The target of 107 was knocked off with ease by 4.30pm. Anderson might have expressed his gratitude to umpire Marais Erasmus, one of the most cheerful men in the world, as he left the pitch parading the ball that captured wickets 500-506 in his catalogue. On Friday night Anderson was engaged in a grumpy conversation with Erasmus after receiving his second warning for running on the pitch when bowling from the Pavilion End. But as a result of those warnings Anderson was switched to the Nursery End, where he was far less likely to offend because of the gradient of the famous Lord’s slope. This has always been a subject dear to the heart of our former colleague, Mike Selvey, a Lord’s expert, who always maintained, usually as Anderson was marking out his run in front of the Pavilion, that he should bowl from the Nursery End. The slope enhances his away-swinger – just as it did for Ian Botham in his pomp – he would say before elaborating in some detail upon how the flightpath of planes from Heathrow would give an accurate insight into the wind direction at Lord’s. Often Anderson would proceed to take wickets aplenty from the Pavilion End anyway. But here on a sunny Saturday morning he was far too good for the West Indies when running towards the Pavilion. Late movement down the slope produced the vital wickets. Anderson’s fourth ball of the day moved just enough to find the edge of Roston’s Chase’s bat after which England wily old pacemen turned the screw. Oddly Stuart Broad looked perfectly comfortable from the Pavilion End from where he seldom operates and he began to reel off five maidens in seven overs. His fielding was less assured. Broad has often been a victim of dropped catches this summer but here he missed a relatively easy chance – for a professional cricketer – at mid-off as Jermaine Blackwood drove airily, as he often does. Broad banged his fist into the ground three times in exasperation while Anderson, the bowler, remained more sanguine. It was not a costly drop since the reliable Jonny Bairstow soon collected another edge off Anderson. Moreover, when Broad failed to hold on to a hard return catch from Shane Dowrich this was no source of alarm either. Dowrich has not been a threat with the bat throughout the series and it was not long before he miscued a pull shot off the bowling of Toby Roland-Jones into the now safe hands of Broad. Only Shai Hope offered resistance, mostly passive throughout a morning session when England’s seamers gave him no gifts. The blossoming of Hope is the most encouraging advance for the West Indies on this tour. He now looks a player of the highest quality, who is visibly growing in self-belief and patience. So his dismissal, edging another beauty from Anderson straight after lunch, realistically signalled the end of West Indies’ hopes. In the same over Anderson bowled Devendra Bishoo. There was a little flurry but then Jason Holder’s mis-pull to mid-on gave Broad another wicket – the catch to Anderson at mid-on was undroppable even by the standards of 2017. Then Anderson himself was on hand to bowl Shannon Gabriel to finish off the innings from the end he has usually spurned. Next summer he might have a rethink and perhaps the summer after that as well. Anderson is not immortal but he has never bowled better than throughout the 2017 season. He remains the leader of the attack and his determination “to go on and on” may be more realistic than that of some of our leaders in other fields. It is certainly too early for him to seriously consider an official coaching position with England rather than the unofficial role he provides when fielding at mid-on. The target of 107 was too small to be taxing and by now the sun was out and the odd champagne cork was intruding on to the outfield. In this match the pacemen have prevailed but it fell to Bishoo, with his first ball of the match, to become the first wicket-taker among the spin bowling fraternity – the first game in all Test cricket in which neither side has registered 200 runs in an innings since the 2007 Test between South Africa and Pakistan in Cape Town. Bishoo dismissed Alastair Cook lbw playing around his front pad. It was a soft dismissal and an indication that Cook has been below his best here – his catching has been unusually trustworthy as well. He has been nursing a dodgy knee during the last two Tests – the giveaway is no pre-match football. With the Test season over he will be eager to play for his beloved Essex in the Championship run-in, but someone may have to tell him that this is not such a good idea. So this left the rookies, Mark Stoneman and Tom Westley, at the crease with 72 more runs required. They appeared to relish the challenge against a West Indies side that knew deep down the game was up. The two newcomers knocked off the runs without much bother. However the tourists had rejuvenated the series with their triumph at Headingley, where Shai Hope established that he was the discovery of the year. The odd thing about England’s Test summer, which has a healthy ledger of two series victories and a 5-2 win-loss ratio, is that we have reached the end of it and in so many areas we are none the wiser."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/13/harvest-songs-replaced-by-midnight-combines","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T04:30:02Z","webTitle":"Harvest songs replaced by midnight combines","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/13/harvest-songs-replaced-by-midnight-combines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/13/harvest-songs-replaced-by-midnight-combines","fields":{"headline":"Harvest songs replaced by midnight combines","bodyText":"Two white ponies were grazing on the high slopes above Carding Mill Valley. A mare and colt, white in the soft light, which felt more autumnal than was usual for the turn, grazed on a hidden lawn surrounded by bracken and heather. Up there, they seemed still, absorbed in feeding, but whenever a dog barked in the distance, they became watchful. A pair of ravens flew across the valley and landed nearby. The ravens watched the ponies; the ponies watched the ravens. When the birds flew off, the ponies shook themselves from their reverie. They seemed to become present in the landscape, actors in the moment, no longer passive. There was a strength about them; rough, stocky and yet elegant with a sense of purpose as they stepped across the steep hillside and shook their manes. This felt like a declaration. There have been ponies on the Long Mynd since Bodbury Ring hillfort opposite was occupied in the iron age. My understanding is that the true Long Mynd breed was one of the earliest in Britain but is now extinct, and the present horses are descended from Welsh mountain ponies, often described as pit ponies, used in local industries for centuries. The Long Mynd is high heath, the heather was still a vivid purple, the ravens called back to a long ago and the ponies walked in a place apart, an island in a changed world. Reading September from John Clare’s Shepherd’s Calendar is to become aware of how unpeopled the working countryside has become at harvest time. The “rude groups” who toiled the valleys are gone, the “rush bosomed solitudes” no longer disturbed by workers but visitors, the harvest songs of the fields are replaced by the wuwuwuwu of midnight combines. The first hands-free harvest – using only remote machines – was accomplished at Harper Adams University in Shropshire this year. The link between the people and the land has changed radically and this gives the presence of the Long Mynd ponies a mythic status. Their declaration of existence now has more to do with the future than the past.

A Roman cavalry barracks has been unearthed near Hadrian’s Wall, complete with extraordinary military and personal possessions left behind by soldiers and their families almost 2,000 years ago. A treasure trove of thousands of artefacts dating from the early second century has been excavated over the past fortnight. The find is significant not just because of its size and pristine state, but also for its contribution to the history of Hadrian’s Wall, showing the military build-up that led to its construction in AD122. The barracks pre-dates the wall: the Romans already had a huge military presence in the area, keeping the local population under control. “The native Britons took an opportunity, when the emperor Trajan died in AD117, to rebel,” says Andrew Birley, who heads the archaeological team. “The soldiers stationed in the north before the wall was built became involved in fighting and were very vulnerable. The evidence we have from this [find] shows the incredibly rich and diverse lifestyle these people had.” Archaeologists stumbled on the site by chance and have been taken aback by finds in a remarkable state of preservation. These include two extremely rare cavalry swords – one of them complete, still with its wooden scabbard, hilt and pommel – and two wooden toy swords. One has a gemstone in its pommel. As well as other weapons, including cavalry lances, arrowheads and ballista bolts – all left behind on the floors – there are combs, bath clogs, shoes, stylus pens, hairpins and brooches. Sections of beautifully woven cloth have also been unearthed. They may have come from garments and have yet to be tested. There are also two wooden tablets covered in marks made in black ink. They are thought to be letters, but their contents have yet to be deciphered as they were rushed into a conservation laboratory to ensure their survival. The barracks, which dates from AD105, was found beneath the fourth-century stone fort of Vindolanda, south of Hadrian’s Wall near Hexham, Northumberland. It is one of the site’s earliest barracks. Hadrian did not begin his 73-mile defensive barrier – to guard the north-western frontier of the province of Britain from invaders – until 122. The artefacts survived because they were concealed beneath a concrete floor laid by the Romans about 30 years after the barracks was abandoned, shortly before 120. The concrete created oxygen-free conditions that helped preserve materials such as wood, leather and textiles, which would otherwise have rotted away. Birley said: “The swords are the icing on the cake for what is a truly remarkable discovery of one of the most comprehensive and important collections from the intimate lives of people living on the edge of the Roman Empire at a time of rebellion and war. What’s exciting is that [they] are remarkably well-preserved … There is a huge range of stuff – their hair combs, pots, wooden spoons, bowls, weapons, bits of armour, and their cavalry bling. “Even for us, it’s very unusual to get things like complete Roman swords, sitting on the ground in their scabbards with their handles and their pommels. We were slightly dumbfounded by that. Then, to find another complete sword in another room next door only two metres away, two wooden swords and a host of other cavalry equipment, all in beautiful condition, is just terrific. “Archaeologists would never expect to find a Roman cavalry sword in any context, because it’s like a modern-day soldier leaving his barracks and dumping his rifle on the floor … This is a very expensive thing. So why leave [it] behind?” He recalled feeling “quite emotional” over the discovery: “You can work as an archaeologist your entire life on Roman military sites and never expect, or imagine, seeing such a rare thing, even at Vindolanda. It felt like the team winning a form of archaeological lottery, and we knew we had something very rare and special before us.” Archaeologists lifted up a piece of concrete flooring while exploring the foundations of the fourth-century stone fortress. They were struck by a layer of black, sweet-smelling and perfectly preserved anaerobic soil in an area where it was completely unexpected. Hidden in this soil, they went on to find, were the timber walls and floors, fences, pots and animal bones from the abandoned barracks. To their astonishment, excavating about 3.5 metres down, they uncovered eight rooms, with stables for horses, and living accommodation, with ovens and fireplaces. They believe that the base was home to more than 1,000 soldiers and probably many thousands more dependants, including slaves. The Romans had covered over this early barracks with concrete and heavy clay foundations before building another above it. At Vindolanda, garrisons would arrive, build their forts and destroy them when leaving. Birley said: “We have got successive barracks above them, some of which are also cavalry, but they’re much later and not preserved with anything like the range of material that has come from within the anaerobic conditions. What you’re seeing here is the full range of stuff, and all those little details that normally rot away completely.” Cavalry swords are very rare, even across the north-west provinces of the Roman empire, he said, partly because they are so thin. “They’re very light, a couple of feet long, designed to slash somebody as you’re riding past, with a wickedly sharp blade and a point.” Other finds include copper alloy cavalry fitments for saddles, strap junctions and harnesses. They are in such fine condition that they still shine and are almost completely free of corrosion. The strap junctions are preserved so beautifully, he said, that they have all their alloy links – incredibly rare survivals. Much of the pottery has graffiti, from which the archaeologists hope to work out the names and stories of some of the people who lived here. The discovery is all the more emotional for Birley, as his archaeologist father, Robin, headed the team that discovered the famous Vindolanda writing tablets in 1973. The new tablets may give further insights. They are letters either sent to, or written by, the people living in those buildings. Birley said: “So, as a collection of stuff, it doesn’t really get better than that. Some of the documents will hopefully give the names, the characters, what they’re thinking about, what they’re doing.” Quite why so much valuable material was left behind has yet to be discovered. One theory is that the barracks was abandoned in a hurry. Birley said: “There was strife. This is the precursor to Hadrian coming to the UK to build his wall. This is the British rebellion. So you can imagine a scenario where the guys and girls at Vindolanda are told: ‘We need to leave in a hurry, just take what you can carry.’ If it’s your sword or your child, you grab the child.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/sep/09/stuart-broad-england-dropped-catches-improvement-needed-fielding","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T17:20:10Z","webTitle":"Stuart Broad’s drops underscore need for England to improve in the field | Ali Martin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/09/stuart-broad-england-dropped-catches-improvement-needed-fielding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/09/stuart-broad-england-dropped-catches-improvement-needed-fielding","fields":{"headline":"Stuart Broad’s drops underscore need for England to improve in the field","bodyText":"The target was small and the pressure light but it was nevertheless encouraging that a summer of Test cricket dominated by talk of three England batting spots should end with two newcomers, Mark Stoneman and Tom Westley, walking off unbeaten. As the pair strolled up the pavilion stairs at Lord’s to join the dressing‑room celebrations they were replaced on the outfield by Henry Blofeld who, resplendent in a lime green jacket and pink linen shirt, said farewell to just a fraction of the listeners from his 45-year career on Test Match Special, one that has at times made buses and pigeons central to the action. Stoneman and Westley, who helped their averages with scores of 40 and 44 not out, are not exactly London buses in terms solving the issues of England’s top-order. Along with Dawid Malan, they will still endure a nervous wait ahead of the selection meeting for Australia that takes place during the final round of County Championship matches this month. Ah, the Ashes. England have played down such talk wherever possible this season, respectfully and professionally meeting questions about the impending defence of the urn with flat bats in the main and reminders about the job at hand against South Africa and West Indies. But with the Basil D’Oliveira and Wisden Trophies secured and Joe Root’s reign starting with two wins from two – albeit with a couple of bumps in the road along the way – thoughts can now turn to the winter guilt-free, both for the players and those trying to tease them into an early war cry. For Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad, this time will be spent in sanctuary of their figurative bubble-wrapped cocoons as they sit out the remainder of the domestic season and rest the weary legs that have charged in for seven Tests in just over eight weeks – a run of fixtures that appeared distinctly fast-bowler unfriendly beforehand but have been survived. Anderson will be snugly content inside his (even if part of him would no doubt fancy aiding Lancashire’s title challenge), able to reflect on a vintage time of it with the Duke in hand that returned 39 wickets at 14 runs apiece and, to cap it all off, career-best figures of seven for 42, during which he became the sixth member of the 500 Test-victim club. Australia’s pitches will doubtless be closer to the ones seen in 2013-14 (when Anderson’s 14 wickets came at 43 runs apiece), than the juicier 2010‑11 surfaces (when he claimed 24 at 26), while the Kookaburra is unlikely to have changed in nature from the ball that goes unresponsive after the lacquer comes off and the seam dies from 20 overs onwards. But the 35-year-old is in a fine groove at present and has proved to himself, and others, that the niggling injuries of last year, including a stress fracture to the shoulder blade and the curious “body soreness” in India, were not a sign of some physical decline but simply anomalous occurrences in a butcher’s dog of a fitness record. Broad, on the other hand, may be slightly more prickly about 2017 to date, knowing that 20 wickets at 33 is a more middling stash. Has he bowled badly? No, and yet only twice has he threatened one of his hot streaks, in the fourth innings at Old Trafford when he looked on with the new ball and while passing Sir Ian Botham’s 383 career Test wickets at Edgbaston. Lady luck has not exactly been on his side, such that even a light gambol up the stairs of the Lord’s pavilion on the first day meant he slipped and jar his Achilles, and his bowling has suffered from eight dropped catches against West Indies and 11 across the two series. Twice he has been culprit, even if the second – a diving effort on the final morning here, when Shane Dowrich punched one back on nought – would have been stupefying. The less said about the duff at mid-off from Jermaine Blackwood to deny Anderson before this, one that left him punching the ground repeatedly, the better. The management will not concern themselves too much about Broad, knowing encounters with Australia always get the 31-year-old’s juices flowing. Tally up the wickets across the three most recent series against Australia from 2013 to 2015 and his names sits top of the lot. But for the fielding-obsessed head coach, Trevor Bayliss, that 16 catches have gone to ground in three Tests against the West Indies – completed when Alastair Cook shelled Shai Hope at slip off Root’s off-breaks in the last over before lunch – will be as vexing as those pesky batting spots."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/08/talking-horses-saturdays-best-bets-haydock-kempton-ascot","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T23:01:51Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Saturday’s best bets for Haydock, Kempton and Ascot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/08/talking-horses-saturdays-best-bets-haydock-kempton-ascot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/08/talking-horses-saturdays-best-bets-haydock-kempton-ascot","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Saturday’s best bets for Haydock, Kempton and Ascot","bodyText":"The certainty of soft ground for the Group One Sprint Cup at Haydock has prompted Brando’s price to collapse in recent days and he could be challenging Harry Angel at the top of the market by the off. He has something to find with Clive Cox’s three-year-old on their July Cup form, however, though he was not suited by the way that race was run and Harry Angel (2.25) also has more room for improvement. The memory of Harry Angel’s blitzing of the field in the Temple Stakes over this course and distance in May also remains strong. He coped with good-to-soft ground in the Mill Reef Stakes last season and, while going as soft as this is an unknown, 9-4 is a fair price for the July Cup winner to add a second Group One to his record. Haydock 1.50: Dark Acclaim improved significantly to win in a good time on soft ground at Doncaster last time out, and the second and third both went in next time. He will be a tough opponent for Dee Ex Bee, a big disappointment at the Ebor meeting. Kempton 2.05: Midterm has the talent to win a Group Three on his day but looked quirky last time out and Chemical Charge, third home in the Hardwicke at Royal Ascot, makes more appeal to follow up a recent win at Musselburgh. Ascot 2.45: A fiercely competitive handicap, but Mjjack has form at track-and-trip when second in a valuable race on King George day and also goes well with some cut in the ground. Haydock 3.00: Soie D’Leau was below form last time but is generally consistent and took this race from a 3lb higher mark on similar going last year. A repeat performance is on the cards. Kempton 3.15: Brilliant Vanguard is in the form of his life with two wins in August, stopping the clock in a good time on both occasions. He should make a bold bid for the hat-trick from a 5lb higher mark. Haydock 3.35: Plenty are in with chances in an open race, but Benbatl is a Group Three winner already and was not disgraced behind Enable in the King George last time out. Flaming Spear, an impressive handicap winner at York last month, may give him most to do. Ascot 3.55: The form of To Dibba’s close second at Hamilton last time was franked when the winner went in again, and he is a confident pick with another step up in trip likely to suit.

It had been that sort of rain-wrecked week in Division One and Somerset were the only side able to force a win; on the final morning they waited three hours for the chance but clinically mopped up the last four wickets in 90 minutes. With three games to go they are 30 points clear of Warwickshire, who are destined for the drop, and 13 behind Yorkshire and Middlesex, who drew damply at Headingley. Somerset’s game against Middlesex in the final week at Taunton, surely to be played on a spitting spinner at Ciderabad, looms large. Scores remain unsettled. Dom Bess took the final wicket at Edgbaston to continue the superb start to his career; Bess has something all 20-year-olds would want – a first-class average that matches his age. With two games left at home and one at The Oval, he and Jack Leach are Somerset’s key players in their survival scrap. Estimable old Tim Groenewald was the fourth-innings hero here, taking five for 58 including two on the last morning, Chris Wright bowled and Jeetan Patel, who was swinging from the hip, caught brilliantly at cover. Craig Overton set the tone, pinning Tim Ambrose in front. This was some turnaround after a horrid performance at Chelmsford and, happily, was 23-year-old Abell’s best game of a tough season in which he was dropped to the second XI and recalled only last month because Adam Hose left. “It got to no one more than myself when I wasn’t performing,” said Abell. “Time in the second team trying to find some form did me the world of good and I went through a patch where I honestly didn’t know where my next run was coming from. I’m starting to find that enjoyment of batting and confidence in my own game.” Warwickshire’s relegation may well be televised, as Sky’s annual dalliance with Championship cricket takes place at Edgbaston against Essex next week. Barring a maddening change of heart from England (always a possibility), Warwickshire should have Chris Woakes available, which is a boon. After their draw against Lancashire brought nine points apiece, a 36-point lead means Essex can seal the title at Edgbaston – should they win handsomely and results elsewhere fall favourably. Either way, 37 points from three games would do it. Hampshire are third, 23 points behind Lancashire, after they were unable to dislodge Surrey’s Ben Foakes (83 not out) and Ollie Pope, who smote a cover drive to bring up his maiden century off the match’s final ball. With a remarkable eight-wicket victory at Nottinghamshire, Worcestershire opened up breathing space in the race for promotion. Daryl Mitchell scored his sixth century – becoming the second man after Kumar Sangakkara to 1,000 Championship runs – of a vintage summer, and shared an unbeaten partnership of 106 with Joe Clarke. Worcestershire are 15 points behind Notts, but play both their remaining games at New Road, while Notts are away twice. Northamptonshire beat Sussex by six wickets and both sides sit 36 points behind Worcestershire, having played a game fewer. Having come to the crease with Sussex still 31 behind, Jofra Archer made 81 not out as Sussex set Northants 140 to win. Richard Levi then made an unbeaten 54 to keep Northants in the promotion hunt. Kent’s hopes of promotion remain after they survived for a draw nine down at Durham but they are a further four points back. After Tom Latham’s ton Durham gave themselves 56 overs to bowl Kent out and in their way stood Sam Northeast (67) and Sam Billings, who batted brilliantly for 70 not out having been bed-ridden with migraines for much of the match. In the second most anticipated wicket-based milestone of the day Graham Onions became Durham’s leading first-class wicket-taker (with 519) when he dismissed Adam Milne.

British Youth Opera’s resourceful and very thoroughly rehearsed production of The Vanishing Bridegroom, directed by Stuart Barker and conducted by James Holmes, is the first full staging here since that premiere. Its revival provides a reminder of how ingenious Weir’s musical storytelling can be, and how her music can suddenly alight on moments of shining transcendence, even if narrative and characterisation are never fused completely convincingly. Sometimes, it seems as if the mechanics of presenting the narrative matter more to Weir than packaging it in a way that involves and rewards her audience. The Vanishing Bridegroom telescopes three Scottish folk tales, two from the Outer Hebrides, one from Sutherland, into a compact family saga, in which the protagonists themselves provide the links between the stories. The husband whose bride is returned to him in the first tale becomes the bridegroom who is spirited away by fairies in the second; his daughter is then the central character of the third, in which she resists the advances of a rich man who turns out to be the devil, and asserts her independence as a woman. It’s all ingeniously dovetailed and packed into a single, 80-minute span, with a score in which references to Scottish folk music, psalm singing and work songs ghost through the textures. But despite the compactness there are moments when the dramatic pulse falters, and it’s hard to remain engaged with characters who inhabit a world poised between realism and fairytale enchantment. Barker’s production, in Andrew Riley’s semi-naturalistic designs, keeps the action as lucid as it can be, but hearing more of the words might make the narrative easier to grasp, though Weir’s solo vocal lines and the density of her choral writing don’t always aid clarity. The student cast, all on the stage throughout the opera, work hard, and the best of the soloists make the most of the opportunities the multiple roles in the score prescribe. Standout contributions come from soprano Alexandra Lowe as the bride in the first story, the bass Timothy Edlin in all three parts, and the mezzo Ida Ränzlöv, who takes the role of the daughter in the final story with immaculate diction and tremendous dramatic presence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global/2017/sep/09/obesity-brexit-prison-suicides-natural-disasters-slow-radio","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T23:05:21Z","webTitle":"Obesity costs lives – we have to alert people to the dangers | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2017/sep/09/obesity-brexit-prison-suicides-natural-disasters-slow-radio","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2017/sep/09/obesity-brexit-prison-suicides-natural-disasters-slow-radio","fields":{"headline":"Letters: obesity costs lives – we have to alert people to the dangers","bodyText":"Sonia Sodha decries medical professionals’ “special sort of cruelty” in rationing treatments for the overweight (“Must we really be a nation of fat-shamers?”, Comment).

The Conservatives were elected in May 2015 on a clear manifesto commitment: “… we will negotiate a new settlement for Britain in Europe and then ask the British people whether they want to stay in the EU on this reformed basis or leave.” Surely democratic precedence demands that the British people should be asked if they want to leave the EU on this reformed basis or stay?

Emeritus professor Keith Barnham Frome, Somerset Prison suicides are avoidable On World Suicide Prevention Day, we are calling on the government to take urgent action to prevent the loss of life among people in prison, where last year more than 100 people took their lives. Research by the Centre for Mental Health and the Howard League for Penal Reform shows that preventing this loss of life requires major changes to the way prisons work. So many prisoners have poor mental health and are at risk of suicide and serious self-harm that we need to make systemic changes to save lives and make prisons places of rehabilitation. The prison system must be built around the understanding that nine out of 10 prisoners have at least one mental health difficulty and many have been through traumatic events in their lives. Prison staff need effective training in working with people who have experienced trauma. They also need support for their own wellbeing in such a stressful environment.

At the start of his naughty new book about her, he attributes it to Margaret’s Zelig-style appearance – ubiquitous, if not exactly chameleon-like – in just about every other memoir, biography and diary written in the second half of the 20th century. It is, he writes, like playing Where’s Wally? or a super snobby form of I-spy: everyone seems to have met this prickly and parenthetical figure at least once, from Kenneth Williams to Evelyn Waugh, Ken Tynan to Elizabeth Taylor – a fact all the weirder when you know that the same people were often frequently desperate to avoid her. But perhaps Brown’s obsession has another, more – how to put this? – Freudian source. He dishes up a Margaret-related encounter of his own. At school, he tells us, he had a friend called Michael, the second son of a lord and a nice, diffident chap to whose family houses – among them a castle in Yorkshire and a stately home in Norfolk – he was often invited to stay. It was in the hallway of their grandest place that the incident occurred. Asked to sign the visitors’ book, Brown leafed nosily through it, at which point he discovered a photograph of Margaret, posing in the same hallway in which he stood, resplendent in a blue frock and fixed smile. Beside her was Michael’s older brother, William, looking unremarkable save for one thing. The “downward trajectory” of the fabric of his trousers was, his pal couldn’t help but notice, being “sent askew by a bluff diagonal”. It seemed that at the moment the camera’s shutter clicked, poor William had been struggling to contain a teenage erection. When people write of how this or that book made them laugh out loud, I’m suspicious; even in the presence of Pooter or Jim Dixon and his madrigals, my hoots tend to be inward. But as I read Brown’s riff on the unfathomable appearance of this image in a toff family’s social record – “did she [William’s mother] notice that something was awry, but decide to go ahead and paste the whole photograph in regardless – lock, stock and, as it were, barrel?” – I honked so loudly the man sitting next to me on the train dropped his sandwich. Partly, this was simply because it was funny: never before has a bulge in a pair of chinos been on the receiving end of so searching an analysis. (Brown’s disquisition ranges from the natural reticence of the English upper classes to their stubborn pragmatism in the matter of wasting precious pages in visitors’ books: “They had left a large space… for a photograph of William and Princess Margaret, and they had no alternative detumescent photograph up their sleeves to put in its place.”) But mostly it was because Ma’am Darling is fascinating. In its tiara-ed grip, I was unbound, released; total absorption left me as wanton and unselfconscious as Tony Armstrong-Jones – AKA Lord Snowdon, HRH’s preening, spiteful husband – after too many martinis. Which was probably just as well, given my head was stuck, for all to see, inside an improbably huge book about Princess Margaret. Brown has done something amazing with Ma’am Darling: in my wilder moments, I wonder if he hasn’t reinvented the biographical form. Subtitled 99 Glimpses of Princess Margaret, it is described by his publisher (which, infuriatingly, hasn’t given him an index) as “kaleidoscopic”. But this doesn’t do it justice. It is a cubist book, a collection of acute angles through which you see its subject and her world (and, to an extent, our world) anew. As Brown notes, Margaret wore her rudeness as Tommy Cooper did his fez: it was her trademark – the bitchier of her showbusiness friends actively longed for her to parade it at their parties so that they could roll their eyes afterwards. (“I hear you’ve completely ruined my mother’s old home,” she once said to an architect who’d been working on Glamis Castle. Of the same man, disabled since childhood, she also asked: “Have you ever looked at yourself in the mirror and seen the way you walk?”) But if she is ghastly, her court is worse. The groupies, the servants, the lovers. What a bunch of creeps. Brown’s 99 glimpses comprise essays, lists, catalogues, diaries, palace announcements, newspaper cuttings and interviews, as well as parodies (one is a pastiche of Lytton Strachey; another echoes Susan Sontag’s Notes on “Camp”; yet another, in which Brown imagines how things might have gone had Margaret married her admirer Picasso, is written in the style of the artist’s biographer, John Richardson). His reading has been prodigious: not only the diaries of everyone from Chips Channon to AL Rowse, but dozens of gruesome royal biographies and memoirs, up to and including My Life With Princess Margaret by her former footman, the slithering David John Payne. Oh, how the sinister Payne loathes the arrival in Ma’am’s life of the slugabed snapper Armstrong-Jones – a character whom Brown introduces, incidentally, with a list of the contents of his Rotherhithe bachelor pad (golden cage containing three lovebirds; miniature brass catafalque; stand in the shape of a Nubian boy). Together, these things conjure Margaret in all her dubious glory. Nancy Mitford likened her to a “hedgehog covered in primroses”, but the reader will come to feel this is unfair to hedgehogs. The relationship with Group Captain Townsend is deliciously done: Brown doesn’t buy the schmaltz, lining himself up instead with Prince Philip, who said sarcastically, when the Queen Mother worried about where a future Mrs Townsend might live, that it was “still possible, even nowadays, to buy a house”. So, too, is the peculiar union with Roddy Llewellyn – “[like] the put upon hero of a picaresque novel”, he writes, Margaret’s hapless young lover having, in quick succession, joined a commune, recorded an album and pranged his Ford Transit. But best of all is his portrait of Snowdon, hair and all, whose baiting of Margaret comes close to gaslighting at times. What a cast this book has. I cannot say whether I was more fascinated by Jeremy Thorpe’s conviction that he would marry Margaret, or the notion that, in the Mustique years, she frolicked with a criminal, John Bindon, who was said to have been able to either – take your pick – balance a small sherry schooner on or dangle five half-pint glasses off his erect penis. However peculiar, though, none of these things comes close to the eerie penumbra cast by Margaret herself. How to explain the utter rottenness of her character? In the end, one feels it must go back to her relationship with her mother, the stench of which brings to mind scent left too long in the bottle. As Hugo Vickers, that most smoothly diligent of royal biographers, noted, the Queen Mother’s “demonic” appearance at Margaret’s funeral in 2002 suggested a just hint of triumphalism. Even after she’d decided to cling to her royal privilege, her daughter always had more in common with the Duke of Windsor than ever she realised. • Ma’am Darling by Craig Brown is published by Fourth Estate (£16.99.

This is a wake-up call","bodyText":"“I need you to see this patient now,” a nurse whispers, her quiet tone masking a mountain of concern. “I am an oncologist,” I introduce myself to the stricken stranger. “We haven’t met before, but you don’t look so well so I am going to help.” He nods. For weeks, he has been in the grip of nausea, pain and insomnia. His six-hour wait in A&amp;E culminated in being sent home. He has been bed-bound since, too weak to move, eat or drink. “I am so sorry,” I offer, wondering for the umpteenth time how patients deteriorate like this before our very eyes. Tears form and he shrugs. “Dad just wants to feel better, he knows things are bad.” My heart melts at the plea of his daughter, barely out of her teens. “We’ve got this,” I reassure her. “He’ll feel better soon.” The nurse, ever attentive, flicks the chair to recliner mode and catches his wrist. “You are safe,” she says simply. At this, he dissolves into sobs that rack his whole body. As I take in the heartrending sight of a grown, burly man reduced to the helplessness of a child, I try to imagine the affronts that have led him here. The patients differ but the underlying themes don’t – months of chemotherapy, failed drugs, countless appointments, perpetual uncertainty, endless waiting, lost income, tired relatives, disappearing friends and on top, the existential questions, “Why me? Why my family? Why anybody?” I chart fluids and drugs and arrange for a hospital bed, feeling discomfited that the family is so dramatically relieved at such a basic intervention. Later, in clinic, I see patients ranging from a stoical university student to a devastated father to the frail octogenarian who can’t remember the day, let alone that he has cancer – each patient an illustration of a recent Macmillan Cancer Support UK finding that it is more common for an individual to be diagnosed with cancer than to get married or have a first child. One in two people will encounter a cancer diagnosis in their lifetime, which is why the report says that, alongside marriage, parenthood, retirement and the death of a parent, cancer is now “a common life milestone”. I bear witness to this “milestone” every day, yet I confess the report is a wake-up call because it has prompted reflection on the chasm between what medicine delivers and what patients desire. Even a cursory search will reveal the leaps of imagination and discovery that have made cancer medicine fascinating, and indeed life-changing, for so many patients. In the short time that I have been an oncologist, I have gone from ruing that no effective therapy exists, to deciding how best to sequence an array of choices. Sure, not all therapies have delivered stunning results, unacceptable toxicity looms large, costs are prohibitive and our successes are largely confined to the rich world. These are problems to ponder but they don’t diminish the genuine, incremental gains in cancer care. Every day, I see the human face of these gains and whisper thanks to the researchers who empower clinicians like me. But as nearly every cancer patient observes, what cancer medicine has failed to keep up with is the needs of the person behind the patient. Though there are many diseases with no good treatments and far worse outcomes, the very mention of cancer invites terror like no other. A common rejoinder to the statement, “You have cancer” is, “Am I going to die?” to which a common, and unhelpful, response is: “We can’t say.” For what patients are really asking is not for oncologists to be fortune tellers but for reassurance that we will be there to see them through the whole cancer experience, of which chemotherapy is just a part. They want doctors who are not only proficient but also humane, as capable of consoling as treating. Most oncologists aspire to this, but two things get in our way. The first is medical training, which has an outsized focus on “defeating” disease at any cost and struggles to take into account patient choice. For all the rhetoric around patient-centred care, it has not been easy to put into practice. Cancer is a heterogeneous disease and the people who get cancer are a diverse lot too. A champion athlete, a vulnerable refugee, a youthful retiree and a frail elderly person all need care but each merits special consideration. The athlete wants to avoid nerve damage and the executive begs to keep her hair so her colleagues won’t know. The refugee doesn’t own a car and can’t travel to have intravenous infusions and the elderly man trembles at the thought of his inability to care for his disabled wife. He values quality of life over extent; he values staying together over being forced into care, but finds this a nearly impossible conversation to interest anyone in. Faced with an ageing population for whom a cancer diagnosis is but one of several serious challenges, this particular problem will test us all. Studies show that the frail elderly are willing to forego aggressive treatments in favour of preserving their quality of life, provided they are offered the choice. We will need to be realistic about what defines successful cancer treatment. It will mean looking beyond the tumour at the whole person. Now let me be the first to admit how difficult it can be to do this, even for the most well-intentioned oncologist. Given patients’ myriad needs – from rehabilitation and nutrition to financial, social and emotional welfare – it is obvious that one doctor cannot come close to fulfilling them all. Cancer patients need team support but on any given day, it is far easier to prescribe a £50,000 drug with dubious benefit than find a physiotherapist or social worker. It takes months to access aged-care services in the community until the same patient falls and fractures a hip, after which services swing into place. There is no reason to bunch together cognitively impaired, mentally ill and non-English speaking patients except that they consistently receive inadequate care across all parts of the healthcare system. Palliative care has value for patients and oncologists, yet the nexus between oncology and palliative care remains weak in many places due to a lack of education, collaboration and resources. If the emphasis, and hence funding, stays determinedly on finding a cure for cancer (which, as we are now realising, is not one disease) the manifold supportive care needs of patients will continue to go unaddressed. We will keep identifying the gaps without filling them. Oncologists need to appreciate the broader needs of their patients but they also need access to help. When people reach this sobering “milestone”, the science and art of medicine must coexist. My next patient is late because there is no parking and the scarce wheelchairs are all in use. While waiting, I duck out to see my patient in the chemotherapy chair but stop at a distance. Saline courses through his veins and a crisp white blanket protects his stretched body. His nausea is gone, his pain has settled, and finally he is asleep, his agitated tears replaced by rare calm. Amid the low-level hum, he is fast asleep, his son dozes, and my heart can’t help but skip a beat at how far a measure of kindness goes. The nurse comes over to join me and we look on, feeling like proud parents who have averted a crisis. “What did you give him?” I ask quietly, although I know the drugs that I charted. “Nothing more. He just needed to know he was safe.” • Dr Ranjana Srivastava is an oncologist and an award-winning author"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/08/england-west-indies-third-test-day-two-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T19:40:55Z","webTitle":"England hit back at West Indies as Jimmy Anderson reaches 500 mark","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/08/england-west-indies-third-test-day-two-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/08/england-west-indies-third-test-day-two-match-report","fields":{"headline":"England hit back at West Indies as Jimmy Anderson reaches 500 mark","bodyText":"For everyone who endured the dank drizzle of the morning when only 20 balls were possible there was the reward of more rich, helter-skelter entertainment. England swashbuckled to a first-innings lead of 71 and then there was Jimmy Anderson making a bit of history. To start with the history. Anderson glided in to Kraigg Brathwaite; the new ball jagged down the hill and splattered the stumps. The crowd leapt to its feet and Anderson indulged in a modest celebration plus a rare on-field smile. He took the ball from the umpires to acknowledge the applause and then tossed it back to them before contemplating how to take his 501st. One might expect any bowler, especially a fast one, to be in decline once he reaches 500, but this does not apply to Anderson. He has seldom bowled better than he has this summer It was a lovely moment. After the greyness of the morning it was the highlight of a technicolour afternoon. The sun even deigned to make an appearance on another compelling, flawed day of a Test match, in which England are just ahead. The West Indies lead by 22 runs with seven second-innings wickets remaining. But after Headingley nothing is being taken for granted and Shai Hope is still batting. Given that England started the day on 46 for four, reaching 194 all out represented satisfactory progress. Once again they were indebted to Ben Stokes, who is having a storming match. After his six for 22 on a muggy Thursday a brisk 60 in a low-scoring game represented a very good Friday. So far it is the highest score of the match. Those 20 balls that were possible in the morning were long enough for Dawid Malan to play a crisp cover drive before nibbling at another away swinger from Kemar Roach and being caught behind by Shane Dowrich. Twenty is a score of some significance in this match, so Malan has not lost too much ground in his quest to go to Australia. When play resumed at 2.15pm Stokes was immediately dropped off Shannon Gabriel when on 24. It was a tough chance as Kyle Hope at second slip dived to his left. The ball declined to stick in his outstretched hand, like so many other chances in this series. On this day it was the most costly drop since Stokes was inclined to take the attack to the West Indies bowlers, as highlighted by a dismissive pull off Jason Holder soon after his escape. Stokes raced to 50 from 51 balls and a rare 50 partnership was registered alongside Jonny Bairstow, who was soon lbw to Roach, a fitting reward for the most persistent and skilful of West Indies’ pacemen throughout the series. Roach would end the innings with five for 72. There were more aberrations by West Indies but they were not costly. Stokes was bowled through the gate by a fine delivery from Gabriel who was operating from around the wicket. But even as the bowler saw the stumps being disturbed he cast a wary eye back at the umpire. He sensed what was soon confirmed: he had overstepped by several millimetres. Gabriel, unsmiling, ploughed on and two balls later produced an identical delivery, which also dumbfounded Stokes. But this time part of his front foot was behind the line. Even now he declined to smile. Gabriel is a tank of a fast bowler, who expends a lot of energy to generate his pace. It is time to resolve the no-ball problem before everyone loses patience and he wastes too much precious energy. Moeen Ali barely flickered; Dowrich then dropped a sitter – for the second time in the series – to give Toby Roland-Jones a reprieve. But this did not matter either, since Roland-Jones was soon caught in the gully when driving at Holder. There followed an important (for England) and infuriating (for West Indies) little stand between Stuart Broad and Anderson, which added 31 runs at a rapid rate. Broad is now a diminished batsman but he still likes batting at Lord’s. There was an unbeaten 57 against South Africa here earlier this summer and an equally skittish 38 on Friday, which contained two sliced sixes over the off-side boundary against Roach. Anderson’s most memorable contribution was a silky cover-drive. Soon the old firm were back in action in their stronger suit. Anderson moved in from the Pavilion End as rhythmically as has been the case all summer and his 12th ball dispensed with Brathwaite, thereby avoiding another agonising wait for a landmark; it took him a while to pass Ian Botham’s 383. Then there was another surprising dropped catch to add to Broad’s frustrations. Stokes, of all people, spilt a relatively straightforward chance at fourth slip to give Powell a life. Broad has suffered more than most from fielding lapses this summer. If the precise figures are not readily available the suspicion is that Broad himself could reveal chapter and verse. However, he soon dealt with the lesser Hope (Kyle), who was palpably lbw once again. Soon he will be the lesser-spotted Hope since it is hard to see how he can retain his place in the side for much longer. That does not apply to the major Hope (Shai), who was still battling away elegantly under the floodlights as the sun made its descent. By then Kieran Powell, bowled by a trimmer from Anderson, had departed for a plucky 45. It was poetry in motion from the Pavilion End, except that Anderson was soon disgruntled to be warned twice by umpire Erasmus for running on the pitch. He is not satisfied yet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/09/bath-saracens-premiership-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-09T17:29:17Z","webTitle":"Rhys Priestland inspires Bath to an impressive victory over Saracens","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/09/bath-saracens-premiership-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/09/bath-saracens-premiership-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Rhys Priestland inspires Bath to an impressive victory over Saracens","bodyText":"Rhys Priestland squatted in the shadows at Bath for two years as the light danced on George Ford, but one of the game’s more reserved playmakers has this month emerged unblinking to offset the loss of the England outside-half. He set up a victory that went from routine to remarkable when, in the final four minutes, Semesa Rokoduguni scored two tries out of nothing. Few sides find time to breathe when confronted by Saracens’ suffocating defence but under Priestland’s gentle prompting Bath regularly worked the ball wide. They so discomfited the European champions that by the end of the first half Schalk Brits was remonstrating furiously with the officials after Kahn Fotuali’i milked the hooker for a penalty. Saracens were 14-0 down and rattled: twisted in the scrum, hounded at the breakdown by Francois Louw and vulnerable to the understated orchestrating of Priestland, the former Wales outside-half whose international career ended prematurely following a loss of confidence. Never the most demonstrative of 10s, Priestland’s move to Bath seemed at the time rehabilitation therapy. If so, it has worked. Freddie Burns traded places with Ford, who returned to Leicester in the summer but had to sit on the bench for 138 minutes before making his debut. Bath are less showy and flamboyant than they were last season when they too often failed to assess risk, but with Priestland at the helm they scented opportunity against a side whose staple diet is opposition mistakes. Priestland looked to give himself options either side to help thwart Saracens’ rush defence. He varied his kicking and tended to make up his mind late as he scanned for space. He was the game’s most influential figure until he was taken off after 58 minutes, by which time Sarries had salvaged Owen Farrell from the bench having brought on Mako Vunipola immediately after the interval. Priestland opened the scoring with a 20-metre drop goal after 17 minutes and secured a second from longer range after 53 minutes to leave Saracens needing to reflate their revival having created Bath’s first-half try by floating a long pass to Rokoduguni and then instigating a swift handling move that gave Louw the space on the left wing to fend off Michael Rhodes and then run through Alex Goode. Two Priestland penalties gave Bath a 14-0 lead at the interval. Saracens, so expressive against Northampton last week, were lost for words in possession, muted by a furious rush defence and the retrieval qualities of Louw. They found their voice after Farrell replaced Alex Lozowski, a move that allowed Goode, whose first half was mired in mistakes, to roar. Lozowski was denied a try in the first half by Anthony Watson’s challenge after the outside-half had caught his own chip. Watson’s earlier counterattack, when he took advantage of the speed of Duncan Taylor’s kick chase to elude the centre and start a 60-metre run, was one of a tight, feisty game’s highlights but he left the field six minutes from the end with his left arm in a makeshift sling. By that stage Bath had used all their replacements and were a man short as well as four points behind having been inexorably ground down by Saracens, who were awarded a try on 58 minutes when Taulupe Faletau collapsed a rolling maul to prevent Jackson Wray from scoring. The Lions No8 was sent to the sin-bin and when Farrell kicked a penalty under the posts 13 minutes from the end to cut Bath’s lead to a point, Sarries were poised for their seventh victory here in nine league visits. They took their lead when Goode, who had earlier been thwarted by Matt Banahan, stepped into space and set up Ben Spencer. Bath looked lost when Watson trudged off, but Rokoduguni, until then only a casual visitor to the game, made his decisive intervention. Saracens looked in no danger when the Fijian received the ball from a scrum 30 metres out, running down the outside-half’s channel from the right wing. He wrong-footed Spencer before sidestepping Chris Wyles and sprinting to the line. Burns’s conversion from the touchline gave Bath the cushion of a three-point lead, but Saracens had 90 seconds to salvage something more than a losing bonus point. They were on the attack in Bath’s 22 when Mako Vunipola attempted to find an unmarked Wyles. Instead, his pass landed in the large hands of Rokoduguni, who ran in from 80 metres to maintain his side’s winning start to the campaign while condemning Saracens to a third Premiership defeat in four. “We were extremely poor in the first half,” said their director of rugby, Mark McCall. “We were transformed in the second and looked to have done enough to win.” Then came the Roko KO."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/08/mark-felt-the-man-who-brought-down-the-white-house-review-toronto-film-festival","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T19:24:38Z","webTitle":"Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down The White House review -","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/08/mark-felt-the-man-who-brought-down-the-white-house-review-toronto-film-festival","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/08/mark-felt-the-man-who-brought-down-the-white-house-review-toronto-film-festival","fields":{"headline":"Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down The White House review – Deep Throat story is an anticlimax","bodyText":"It’s hard to watch any film in the current political climate and not look for parallels to the Trump administration, but Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down The White House arrives seeming less like a coded message than a direct plea. The FBI needs to remember that they are independent of the White House, and have an obligation to do right by any means necessary. Obviously, this movie, directed by Peter Landesman and produced by Ridley Scott, was in production well before any current investigations concerning inappropriate Russian meddling with the 2016 election. Moreover, the actions taken by Mark Felt (Liam Neeson) during Watergate weren’t quite as altruistic as one might think. Felt, known better to the world as Deep Throat (the slightly risque sobriquet given by Washington Post editors to reporter Bob Woodward’s secret, well-placed source), didn’t initially begin leaking information to the press because he had it in for Richard Nixon. He did it because he was passed over for a job. When J Edgar Hoover, who ostensibly created the FBI, died after maintaining a chamber of secrets for almost 40 years, Richard Nixon appointed an interim chief who was loyal to the White House instead of promoting Felt, the longtime second-in-command. The new boss Pat Gray (Marton Csokas) knows where his bread is buttered, but he also knows that Felt is untouchable. Things come to a head not so much because the dirty tricks group bungled a bugging job at the Democratic HQ at the Watergate Hotel, but because Gray asks Felt to ease off digging into it at the White House’s behest. It isn’t so much that the White House crossed the line – it’s that they crossed the Bureau. It’s this distinction that prevents this film from being a total bore. It is, instead, only a somewhat bore. The problems include Landesman’s drab shooting style (so many washed-out gray and light blue offices) and the preposterous background music, which crashes down on piano keys whenever anyone says anything important. Then there’s the inarticulate script that drew some chuckles during the press screening. Worst example: “Can you get this out before November 7th?” “That’s Election Day!” Liam Neeson certainly looks cool when he gazes through blinds at the White House, and we’re meant to wonder “what’s he thinking?” But every time anyone opens their mouth all subtlety is smashed to bits. It’s as if Landesman watched Tomas Alfredson’s Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and set out to do the same thing, but only managed a heavy-handed rehash. A secondary story about Felt’s troubled marriage is given no room to breathe and all poor Diane Lane has to do is look sad in period clothing with a drink in her hand. The Felts’ daughter has run off to a far-left hippie commune and this perhaps is why Felt takes such a hard (and knowingly illegal) line against domestic terrorist groups like The Weather Underground. Much of the time Felt is shown as distancing himself from the dirty tricks of Hoover’s earlier years, and Tom Sizemore’s cartoonish “bad G-man” Bill Sullivan is repulsive compared to the broad-shouldered and noble Felt. The implication is that the unconstitutional acts Felt approved in this specific arena were done to “save” his daughter. Maybe they’d never even make it into this biopic (based on Felt’s own book, and likely approved by his estate) if he didn’t eventually get indicted. (President Reagan quickly acquitted him.) The worst thing, though, is that there’s already a masterpiece of a film telling this story from the other side, Alan J Pakula’s All The President’s Men. (Hell, even Oliver Stone’s Nixon is better.) It’s surprising that a film about Deep Throat could be such an anticlimax."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/08/jimmy-anderson-500th-test-wicket","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T18:18:03Z","webTitle":"Jimmy Anderson’s 500th Test wicket bore all the hallmarks of his first | Andy Bull","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/08/jimmy-anderson-500th-test-wicket","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/08/jimmy-anderson-500th-test-wicket","fields":{"headline":"Jimmy Anderson’s 500th Test wicket bore all the hallmarks of his first","bodyText":"When Jimmy Anderson’s 500th Test wicket finally came it had a very familiar feel to it, though you would need a long memory to say precisely why. It was late on Friday afternoon when he bowled Kraigg Brathwaite, the batsman stuck half-forward and beaten by an inswinger that whipped by the bat and knocked over his middle stump. Cut back 14 years, three months and 16 days ago, to Anderson’s debut and his first Test wicket, in a match against Zimbabwe here at this same ground. It was late on Friday afternoon when he bowled Mark Vermeulen, the batsman stuck half-forward and beaten by an inswinger that whipped by the bat and knocked over his middle stump. If the setting was the same and the dismissal looked similar, the teams have changed out of all recognition. Anderson is the only man who played on either side in that match who is still in Test cricket today, and even he has changed almost beyond recognition. He was 20, had not even lost his puppy fat and was still sporting the kind of haircut that only a young man could imagine was a good idea. He was so nervous back then that he did not even feel able to speak to anyone in the dressing room. He has said himself that he had not even figured out what kind of player he wanted to be, whether he should try to bowl as quick as he could or slow down a touch and swing the ball instead. Anderson says himself that these days he could not bowl a 90mph delivery even if he wanted to. But age has its compensations. He has an expert understanding of his game and the batsmen’s. His 500th wicket was his 33rd in Tests this season, and they have come at a cost of only 15 runs each. There have been only two summers in his career where he has taken more wickets than that, and none at all when he has finished with a lower average. At 35, he is playing as well as ever, so comfortable with his action, so clear in his intentions, that he seems to find bowling as easy and familiar a thing as other men do their favourite slippers. Anderson is only the third fast bowler to take 500 Test wickets. Courtney Walsh was the first, when he had Jacques Kallis lbw in a Test at Port of Spain in 2001. If there is a similarity between the two of them, it is that Anderson shares some of Walsh’s remarkable stamina and fitness. They used to call Walsh “Duracell” when he played at Gloucestershire, because he bowled forever. In the past decade, Anderson has not only taken more wickets than any other bowler, he has also got through many more overs, over 4,000 altogether. Stuart Broad is the only other fast bowler to have delivered even 3,000 in that time. Then there was Glenn McGrath, who also got his own 500th wicket here at Lord’s. That was in the 2005 Ashes Test, when he had Marcus Trescothick caught at slip. Anderson would not necessarily appreciate the comparison, but he has just a touch of McGrath’s orneriness about him too. He may well go on to beat them both. He needs 563 to pass McGrath and become the most successful Test fast bowler of all time. Not bad for a shy kid from Burnley. Though he will, as Fred Trueman memorably said, be “bloody tired” if he does break the record. Ready, perhaps, to hang up his boots for good."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/10/journey-to-all-electric-car-future-shorter-than-thought","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T06:00:29Z","webTitle":"Global shockwaves from electric cars will be here sooner rather than later","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/10/journey-to-all-electric-car-future-shorter-than-thought","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/10/journey-to-all-electric-car-future-shorter-than-thought","fields":{"headline":"Global shockwaves from electric cars will be here sooner rather than later","bodyText":"When Jaguar Land Rover followed in the tracks of Volvo last week with its shift to an electric-powered future, the car maker didn’t just talk about hybrids and batteries. Its chief executive also showed that his company, like governments and oil firms, is finally waking up to the global shockwaves electric cars will bring about. They are far more profound than whether drivers top up via a pump or a plug. Ralf Speth cited the impact battery-powered cars will have on oil demand, and the “considerable stress” that could have for major oil-producing countries’ budgets. “Many [governments] could be forced to impose substantial spending cuts within the next five years, straining living standards and so creating unrest in areas already suffering from instability. So changes in mobility, in technology, will change the geopolitical map of the world,” he said. Those changes seem a lot closer after this summer’s rush hour of electric car announcements. Carmakers have queued up to pledge that soon all their new models will be either hybrids or electric. Elon Musk’s Tesla delivered the first production versions of its mass market Model 3. The UK and France said sales of petrol and diesel cars would be banned from 2040, while a bank predicted all new car sales in Europe would be electric five years before that. On Friday, the ride-hailing behemoth Uber said all its cars in London would be fully electric or a plug-in hybrid by 2025. And with the Frankfurt motor show this week, we are guaranteed more commitments and more competition between carmakers over who is electrifying fastest. Sceptics will say there is a need for a reality check on the high-voltage hype about battery cars. They will point to the fact there are just 2 million of them in a world of more than 1 billion cars. Or that, even with subsidies they are still more expensive than petrol and diesel alternatives. Like Jaguar Land Rover, they will also question whether there are enough charging points or electricity generation. Unsurprisingly, big oil is in this camp. BP said earlier this year that electric cars would not be a “game-changer” for oil demand because of rising prosperity in the developing world. Last week, Shell argued that the fuel savings from the efficiency improvements in internal combustion engines would outweigh those from electric vehicles threefold. The Anglo-Dutch company believes oil demand will not peak until the mid-2030s, despite expecting electric and plug-in hybrids cars to make up 35% of new car sales by then, up from 1% now. “To come radically earlier than the early 2030s [peak oil demand], there has to somehow be a demand change, and it’s not going to come from electric cars,” said Guy Outen, Shell’s executive vice-president of strategy and portfolio. But the company’s actions may tell a different story. It is hedging by shifting its portfolio increasingly away from oil towards gas, which can also supply the new power stations that electric cars will need. And the oil giants’ record on predicting the growth of disruptive technologies has not always been stellar – for example, BP’s projections have consistently underestimated the rate at which wind and solar power have grown. Other authorities, such as the influential Carbon Tracker thinktank, predict the rapid ascent of electric cars could stem growth in oil demand as soon as 2020. Experts such as Bloomberg and Aston University’s David Bailey predict a tipping point in the 2020s in some parts of the world, when electric cars simply make more financial sense for drivers than those powered by a combustion engine. And while the oil companies are right that increasingly affluent Chinese and Indians will want cars, they seem to ignore the fact that electric ones offer a fix for those countries’ air pollution problems, which their citizens are pushing further up the political agenda. So the world is driving towards the destination of profound change that Speth touched on. It’s just a question of when – and the answer increasingly looks sooner than anyone thought. It was Ashley versus the big investors: and he won too easily Mike Ashley may be treating himself to a decent pint, or 12, this weekend. In the great showdown at Sports Direct last week, the founder and chief executive confounded his critics and won. His tame chairman, Keith Hellawell, was returned with 53% of the independent votes, a margin Ashley might regard as satisfyingly slim. Sports Direct broke a promise to hold an independent review of boardroom governance but the irate crew of fund managers still couldn’t muster a majority. How did it happen? One direct answer is that Standard Life, one of the leading rebels of a year ago, has sold its shares while Schroders returned to the register and voted its 5% stake in favour of Hellawell. Schroders’s reasoning seems woefully weak – it may have eased the chairman into the post, but that was eight years ago – but it’s fact of life that shareholders can disagree. The result, though, is an embarrassment for the Investor Forum, the lobbying group of big shareholders that secured the pledge from Sports Direct to hold a governance review and then saw it broken. The bizarre detail of the tale is that the forum didn’t shout complaints when Sports Direct effectively closed down communication in January. There wasn’t a squeak of public protest. Events were allowed to run their course, culminating in Hellawell’s survival. It is impossible to know if a loud lobbying campaign would have made a difference, but there was clearly potential to convert a few of the pointless abstentions into active votes. The forum may feel it did all it could, and be happy it has more teeth at firms where there isn’t a belligerent owner with 60% of the shares. Even so, it’s one thing to lose a vote: it’s another to do so without being seen to try, especially in these circumstances. Retail investors may fairly wonder if they’re getting value for money from the investment industry, which claims great insight and influence alongside the promotion of good governance. When those princely fund fees next come under the spotlight, Ashley can line up the vodka chasers and laugh. Unions still matter. This conference could prove it Trade unions are a diminished force in British politics but they still have the ability to shape public opinion and government policy. Union membership has more than halved from its peak of 13 million in the mid-70s, yet the installation of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader will give them renewed heft should the left win the next election. The TUC’s annual gathering in Brighton, which starts on Sunday, represents an opportunity to set the political agenda for the remainder of the year at least. It will be difficult to shift Brexit from the headlines, but there are important issues to discuss. So let’s hear about inequality, high energy bills, stagnant pay, low productivity and a shrinking manufacturing base. And some solutions a wider electorate will support."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/09/super-size-me-2-holy-chicken-review-toronto-film-festival-tiff","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T03:18:51Z","webTitle":"Super Size Me 2: Holy Chicken! review – smug sequel swaps insight for ego","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/09/super-size-me-2-holy-chicken-review-toronto-film-festival-tiff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/09/super-size-me-2-holy-chicken-review-toronto-film-festival-tiff","fields":{"headline":"Super Size Me 2: Holy Chicken! review – smug sequel swaps insight for ego","bodyText":"Morgan Spurlock is his own worst enemy. Ever since he bottomed out America’s collective stomach in 2004 with the fast food exposé Super Size Me, Spurlock’s films have gradually nudged his public persona into the foreground at the expense of the trenchant reportage that originally endeared him to us. Though his vanity hit its nadir with the male-grooming documentary Mansome — a feature-length ode to Spurlock’s trademark handlebar ‘stache — that narcissism still threatens to eclipse the subject at hand. And by revisiting his breakout pet topic of cheap food’s steep costs, Spurlock’s made his own self-absorption more abundantly present than ever. Super Size Me tracked one man’s masochistic descent into a hell made of Big Macs, his suffering illustrating what would have otherwise been left as talking points. His latest endeavor, awkwardly titled Super Size Me 2: Holy Chicken!, places Spurlock at the center of the film once again. But this time, his journey doesn’t send him to the ends of experience. Instead, he goes on a smug odyssey of know-it-all-ism that yields a scant few factoids we didn’t already learn from his first film. Worse still, the entire concept revolves around Spurlock’s own celebrity. The film begins with a montage of talking-head news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio all reporting on the same odd story, that that rascally documentarian Spurlock’s latest stunt is an all-new chicken-to-go restaurant in town. Lines are out the door on opening day, as curious parties wait to figure out what his game is. With this brief snippet of footage, he undermines his own point in two minutes flat: Spurlock wants to figure out if a regular guy with no idea what he’s doing can start his own chicken shack, but the deck is already stacked in his favor. He’s not some quixotic yokel on an underdog mission to bring poultry to the people, he’s an extremely rich and well-connected figure who can afford to spend his money and time with elite branding consultants in plush office buildings. The fat cats of Big Chicken are surely guilty of an unfair advantage, but Spurlock’s not entirely innocent of the same sin. Mostly, however, we’re reminded that fast food is still bad for you and that big-box eateries are very crafty about convincing consumers otherwise. The first forty minutes play like an intro-level media analysis class, as a crack team of marketing experts walk Spurlock through the subtle deceptions of fast-food advertising. Bandying about meaningless buzzwords like “artisan” and “responsibly sourced” has gotten the likes of Subway and Wendy’s pretty far, and Spurlock takes to the hucksterism like a fish in dirty water. As he and his image-management sidekicks survey their newly purchased domain, one points to a wall that would be perfect for “propaganda.” Nothing especially mind-blowing here, save the minor detail that using dark food dye to make imitation grill marks is an age-old trade secret. The film only has the impact Spurlock clearly wants it to when it’s pulling back the curtain on patently evil practices from the seemingly nefarious folks at Purdue and Tyson. Among the more shocking revelations mined from industry nitty-gritty: that the terms “all natural” and “free-range” mean bupkus, that it is absurdly easy to con the USDA into certifying subpar meat (mostly because they don’t give a damn), and most affecting of all, that chicken manufacturers are systematically suffocating the farmers that purchase and raise the birds. To his credit, Spurlock simply and thoroughly explains the infuriating “tournament system” through which Big Chicken chooses which farmers will receive which fowl. The complicated process essentially enables distributors to keep the salt-of-the-earth types spreading the feed in permanent debt, a no-win situation one farmer compares to indentured servitude. If the fearsome totality of Purdue’s power wasn’t clear, a disgruntled ex-employee only speaks out when his face and voice are disguised, for the sake of his personal well-being. Spurlock’s urge to follow up on Super Size Me didn’t have to be a bad idea. He makes fleeting mention of a sea change in fast food culture early on in the film, sharply observing that fast-casual burger chains like Five Guys and Shake Shack have got the old guard running scared and rethinking their business models. (After twelve years away from McDonald’s, Spurlock is shocked to find upon his return that the place now resembles an actual restaurant, and not a building-sized children’s toy.) Unfortunately, he blows right past it so that he can get back to the Morgan Spurlock show. That’s what this is all really about, not chicken but ego. When Spurlock gets wind of a menacing email from a head-honcho chicken executive, he puts on a face like he’s disturbed that such a large corporation has targeted little old him. But Spurlock’s a much worse actor than documentarian. We can tell he loves it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"culture/2017/sep/10/chef-come-dine-with-us-review-hilarious-and-utterly-meaningless-culinary-showdown","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T18:00:43Z","webTitle":"Chef: Come Dine With Us review – hilarious and utterly meaningless culinary showdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/sep/10/chef-come-dine-with-us-review-hilarious-and-utterly-meaningless-culinary-showdown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/sep/10/chef-come-dine-with-us-review-hilarious-and-utterly-meaningless-culinary-showdown","fields":{"headline":"Chef: Come Dine With Us review – hilarious and utterly meaningless culinary showdown","bodyText":"From the opening minutes of Chef: Come Dine With Us, the audience members know that they are unlikely to get away with sitting quietly in their seats. A chef in a green apron is looking for a “beautiful lady” and he is determined to find her in the crowd. When the lucky (or unlucky, depending on how you view audience interaction at the theatre) young woman is found, she is sat on a chair in the centre of the stage in front of five currently unmanned cooking stations, at which point the chef proceeds to serenade her with a heavily accented rendition of Only You while fashioning a rose out of a napkin. This is only the first of many moments in which the audience will be called upon to play a role in this ludicrous and hilarious South Korean production from Persona Inc and Atobiz Ltd, showing at Brisbane’s Powerhouse arts centre as part of Brisbane festival. Insofar as a plot exists, it is this: Green Chef (Taemin Jung) and his older, fatter, moustachioed rival Red Chef (Seongmin Oh) are in a culinary showdown. After taking orders for various cuisine from the audience – chicken noodle soup, pizza, bibimbap – the chefs compete with each other to concoct the tastiest and most impressive version of each dish. Red Chef and Green Chef are assisted in their ostentatious, absurd and increasingly dramatic efforts by the lace-clad Sexy Chef (Minyoung Lim), perpetually flatulent Rookie Chef (Jaehong Park) and Cutie Chef (Jooha Song), whose frilly dress and giant pink bows belie the murderous rage that she occasionally unleashes on the hapless object of her affections, the bicep-flexing Iron Chef (Seungkoo Baek). This cast of caricatures has a video-game quality about it, which is only amplified by the cartoonish and exaggerated manner in which everything on stage occurs. The assistant chefs have other talents too – mainly in the realm of singing and dancing, puppetry and slapstick. Audience involvement is required to stage everything from awkward first dates to a noodle-dough-pillow assault – a clear favourite with the large number of children in the audience for the Saturday night show I attended. One particularly memorable sequence involving glow-in-the-dark sock-puppet fish is a reminder of just how effective simple visual tricks can be when done with slick professionalism. The stagecraft on show here is not particularly complex – there are a lot of swift prop substitutions under tables and so on – but the smoothness of the delivery and the sharply timed slapstick takes the performance to another level. Two beatboxers, Rhythm Chef (Seongjun Park) and MC Chef (Daehan Wii), provide the vast majority of the sound effects for what is essentially one long musical food fight. They are both extremely talented – they are the glue that holds this top-notch ensemble performance together – and their encore solo is a satisfying indulgence for the pair. In spite of all the on-stage chaos, Chef: Come Dine With Us runs at a lean 75 minutes – which is just enough utterly meaningless, totally absurd and thoroughly entertaining fun for one evening. • Chef: Come Dine With Us is showing at Brisbane Powerhouse as part of Brisbane Festival until 16 September • Guardian Australia was a guest of Brisbane Festival, Brisbane Marketing and Treasury Brisbane"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/10/john-legend-review-hydro-glasgow","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T10:25:16Z","webTitle":"John Legend review – soul's starry-eyed charmer imparts irresistible rhythms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/10/john-legend-review-hydro-glasgow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/10/john-legend-review-hydro-glasgow","fields":{"headline":"John Legend review – soul's starry-eyed charmer imparts irresistible rhythms","bodyText":"His beguiling 2016 album Darkness and Light may not have made a dent in the UK charts – it was released, rather bizarrely, amid the retail overload of December – but neo-soul superstar John Legend somehow seems bigger than ever. It is not just because of the 10 Grammys, an extended cameo in La La Land or his best song Oscar in 2015, from Selma. Alongside his wife, model Chrissy Teigen, Legend is one half of social media’s least grating power couple, transmitting witty and woke content to millions of followers worldwide. As he kicks off the European leg of his world tour in Glasgow more than a few sections of the Hydro’s enormous bowl have been discreetly curtained off, but this intimate set-up feels like it should work in Legend’s favour. If there is an overarching theme to his career – in which he has finessed pop, soul, hip-hop and R&amp;B into alluring new shapes with his limber, creamy voice – it is a desire to connect, spiritually and physically. Over the course of almost two hours, Legend and his surprisingly mobile 11-piece band thunder through an energised revue filled with verve and movement. Even if it seems to take a very long time for the crowd to match Legend’s prodigious energy, his twirling showmanship never wilts. A passing but pointed reference to “Trump’s bullshit” interpolated into the soul throwback Slow Dance does get an appreciative cheer. He also tells an endearingly rambling story about his role as laptop DJ during the birth of his daughter, Luna, before launching into a cover of the Curtis Mayfield classic that was playing as she was born. Legend seems to relish his role as sex genie, striving to make bedroom wishes come true with a stream of matchmaker patter to go with his back catalogue of make-out music. But as this slightly overstuffed show swaggers towards its conclusion, it becomes clear that for all the lascivious talk, his true calling is in crafting pedestal pop: those potentially timeless songs that elevate and idolise women. You and I (Nobody in the World) has every couple in the room swaying in tandem, while his encore-launching All of Me – the tender, open-heart ballad that finally knocked Pharrell’s Happy off the US number one spot – is so rapturously received that it retroactively lifts the entire gig.

In the past week, the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) has issued guidance on managing endometriosis in a bid to decrease the current average diagnosis time of eight years. In Australia on Saturday, more than 300 women and men gathered at an auditorium at the University of Sydney to hear the latest research and advice on endo. On Monday, two members of the Australian parliament will meet the peak endometriosis associations from around the country to hear a list of demands, which they have agreed to take to the health minister and shadow health minister for consideration. Those two MPs, Labor’s Gai Brodtmann and the Liberal party’s Nicolle Flint – who have formed a bipartisan parliamentary endometriosis awareness group – stood before the second patient-centred conference on endometriosis, run by the patient advocacy group EndoActive, and vowed to end the silence about endometriosis. All this follows the state of Victoria’s release of evidence-based guidelines for the treatment and diagnosis of endometriosis last November. I’m calling this a tipping point. A lot of people with endo will tell me I’m dreaming for making that claim. Endometriosis is, after all, a disease that affects 10% of women of reproductive age and has a profound quality-of-life impact on people who have it. It’s a disease that costs the economy about the same as diabetes but receives 5% of the research funding. The personal financial cost of endometriosis can be devastating. It’s a disease still shrouded in myth where women are still fed old wives’ tales as treatment options by their doctors. It’s a disease with no known cause or cure. It’s a disease that takes so much of a person’s life. It’s a disease that lacks a single proven effective treatment plan. The pathology of this disease is still so much a mystery. But ... doctors in the UK now have a best-practice guide that encourages them to listen to patients who complain of painful periods. It’s guide that doctors can turn to, in which they will hopefully, once and for all, realise that neither pregnancy nor hysterectomy are cures for endometriosis. They will have to acknowledge that period pain that interferes with a person’s quality of life is not normal and needs to be investigated. Two years ago, when the Guardian launched a global investigation into endometriosis, many people I spoke to did not know what endo was. Lena Dunham had not spoken about it. There were no guidelines for healthcare professionals in the UK or Australia. It was barely, if ever, mentioned in the mainstream media. So much has changed. We now have 176 million women worldwide being given permission to speak about a very shared experience. And we’re not just speaking, we’re angry. We’re not putting up with the dismissals from doctors, the poor corporate support, the silence. We’re educating ourselves, taking treatment into our own hands, we’re learning about our bodies and our disease and we’re demanding more. More awareness, more education, more funding for research and public healthcare that covers proven treatments. This disease has taken part of my life. It’s definitely taken my savings. In the past two years alone I’ve spent $40,000 on endo-related medical costs. I spend my savings on staying well enough to work. And I’m lucky. Many women don’t stay well enough to work, they drift from job to job and sink into poverty during long periods of unemployment. We heard from one girl at the EndoActive conference who couldn’t finish school. What life chances have passed her by because of this disease? The treatments available are not perfect for everyone but there are treatments that work. Unfortunately, people using the public system are mostly locked out. Many can’t even guarantee that they’ll get a surgeon who can perform advanced laparoscopic excision surgery, which is the gold standard treatment for endometriosis. But Brodtmann now stands in Australia’s Parliament House every sitting week and delivers a speech on endometriosis. The government can’t come up with a cure but it can recognise endo as a chronic disease with severe economic and health costs. It can make sure Medicare and the PBS supports proven treatments so that having endo doesn’t mean having no financial security. It can fund research on causes, treatments and cures up to a level comparable with other chronic diseases. It can educate young people and healthcare professionals. It can make sure doctors with the right qualifications are recognised and reimbursed properly for the complicated surgeries they perform. It can stop doctors performing substandard surgeries. I gave up long ago wondering what my life could have been if I’d had the energy that the people around me seemed to have. I gave up seeing myself as a weak person, a flake, a hypochondriac. But I will never give up the fight to make sure younger women with endometriosis are able to access better care at a cheaper cost. So tell me I’m dreaming. But, as I looked around the room on Saturday as 300 people affected by endometriosis gave a standing ovation to an MP vowing to fight for them, what I saw was a moment of critical mass. And that’s where round two of this fight begins."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/09/i-love-you-daddy-review-louis-ck-toronto-film-festival-tiff","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T01:33:45Z","webTitle":"I Love You, Daddy review – Louis CK's brazen comedy is a screwball success","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/09/i-love-you-daddy-review-louis-ck-toronto-film-festival-tiff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/09/i-love-you-daddy-review-louis-ck-toronto-film-festival-tiff","fields":{"headline":"I Love You, Daddy review – Louis CK's brazen comedy is a screwball success","bodyText":"I Love You, Daddy is a screwball comedy, written, directed by and starring Louis CK who financed it entirely himself, shot in New York in lustrous black-and-white; it contrives to be a very funny and recklessly provocative homage to Woody Allen, channelling his masterpiece Manhattan and brilliantly finding a fictional way to tackle his personal reputation head-on. Maybe only Louis CK could have got away with such a controversial subject - that’s if he has got away with it - and done so with such elegant wit. With his hang-dog expression, the gloomy eyes behind the heavy glasses (which he occasionally removes to rub his face, wearily) he looks eerily like any actor in a later Woody Allen movie who is tacitly called upon to ventriloquise the Woody role. But he is notably less romantic; there is a hint of Larry David there, too. Louis plays Glen Topher, a guy who in mid-career has found sensational success in television, writing and directing smash-hit comedies. He is extremely wealthy, with a huge apartment and fancy offices in New York. Edie Falco plays his long-suffering production manager and Charlie Day is the wacky comedy star and best buddy that hangs out with him. He has tense relationships with his ex-wife (Helen Hunt) and ex-girlfriend (Pamela Adlon). But the most important person in his life is his outrageously sexy and spoiled 17-year-old daughter China, played by Chloë Grace Moretz. She is now living with him in his palatial apartment, slinking about the place in a bikini and asking him for Spring Break trips to Florida and use of his private jet. And he can refuse her nothing. At the end of almost every sentence she coos: “I love you, daddy.” Her heart, to quote the old song, belongs to daddy. But it’s not entirely creepy. There is genuine affection. Yet having allowed us to see the resemblance to Woody and Mariel Hemingway, the film springs another comparison on us: like Woody, Louis is discontented with the world of TV, and hero-worships an ageing movie director, who has worked a lot in Europe - played with self-satirising elegance by John Malkovich. This man has the toxic reputation of being sexually obsessed with young girls - but Glen angrily rejects any criticism of him on these grounds, insisting that this ill-informed gossip has no relevance to the work. But then he and China are invited to an A-list party hosted by a star Glen might now be in love with (played by Rose Byrne) and the great man is there. Glen is as tongue-tied and awkward as any fan. But to his rage, he realises the awful truth: his lovely daughter China has caught this man’s hooded eye - and she is mesmerised by his seductive charm. They are about to have an affair, breaking Glen’s heart into the bargain, twice over, both as dad and fan-worshipper, and there’s not a thing he can do about it. The two quasi-Woodies come into horribly ironic conflict, a generational dispute of patriarchal ownership, and it is a duplication that Louis has crafted with his own kind of insouciance. Both the famous film director and famous TV writer have a good deal in common: they have a patronising way with young women. And Louis CK provocatively, even outrageously, allows his heroes to talk down to China - “mansplaining”, to use the term that Glen just about concedes is accurate. Glen presumes to tell his daughter that she doesn’t understand what feminism is. Malkovich’s auteur lectures her on the same subject - and she listens politely. Later, Rose Byrne attempts to mollify the furious Glen, telling him that she had a relationship with an older man when she was a teenager. “Well you were raped,” says Glen. With any other comic, or actor, you might wince at a moment like this, at its sheer male presumption, and to be honest I did wince. But Louis CK carries it off with his strangely artless, almost maladroit sincerity. And it is very funny.

Ruddock, Australia’s second-longest serving federal politician, came out of retirement on a Liberal ticket to snatch the mayorship of Hornsby by a convincing margin. He secured 48.44% of the vote with all the formal votes counted on Saturday evening, eclipsing the second-placed candidate by almost three times as many votes. “I’ve come back into [politics] with a very clear focus,” Ruddock said. “Hornsby Shire is not known as bushland shire for no reason. We’re between major national parks. We have a particular heritage which is important for Sydney. I often make the point we are the city’s lungs. You need to maintain them. There are a whole range of development issues which people will be looking to voice concerns on.” In Newcastle, Labor candidate Nuatali Nelmes was re-elected with 43.86% by the time all formal votes were counted. The race tightened in Wollongong, however, with Gordon Bradbery leading David Brown by only a few thousand votes. It was still too close to call on Saturday night.

But, in Andy’s absence, it was the elder Murray who made more tennis history here on Saturday, in front of a decent-sized crowd on the US Open’s main court, Arthur Ashe, when he combined with 36-year-old Martina Hingis to win their second mixed doubles slam of the season by beating Taipei’s Chan Hao-ching and the New Zealander Michael Venus 6-1, 4-6 (10-8) in 69 breezy minutes. Murray said courtside: “She’s an amazing player, had such a great career. We’ve had a lot of fun, and three times have won 10-8. Hopefully we’ll play more.” Hingis, on the 20th anniversary of beating Venus Williams here in the singles final, said: “My love for the game is my motivation. He’s a great partner to have, carrying me a lot of the time with his wing span.” They are unbeaten in 10 matches since they got together at Wimbledon and there is no reason to think the partnership will not endure alongside Murray’s combination with Bruno Soares in the men’s doubles. In all, he has two slam titles with the Brazilian, two with Hingis and one, his first in 2007, with Jelena Jankovic. On a mild Saturday afternoon at Flushing Meadows, all went like a Swiss clock in the first set as Hingis and Murray obliterated the limp, nervous challenge of Chan and Venus in 22 minutes for the loss of 13 points. It was too easy. The crowd grew restless. However, Chan and Venus put up stiffer resistance in the second set, forcing the championship tie-break, where Murray regained his touch at the net and hit the spots with a couple of crucial serves. He finished the job with an exuberant crosscourt smash."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/09/arakan-rohingya-militants-watch-refugees-myanmar","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T07:41:24Z","webTitle":"Myanmar: Rohingya insurgents declare month-long ceasefire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/09/arakan-rohingya-militants-watch-refugees-myanmar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/09/arakan-rohingya-militants-watch-refugees-myanmar","fields":{"headline":"Myanmar: Rohingya insurgents declare month-long ceasefire","bodyText":"Rohingya insurgents declared a month-long unilateral ceasefire last night, saying it would allow aid to reach north-western Myanmar. The Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (Arsa) had launched attacks on police posts and an army base last month, prompting retaliation by Myanmar’s military. The violence led to more than 270,000 refugees from the persecuted Rohingya Muslim community fleeing to Bangladesh over the last two weeks, according to the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR). “Arsa strongly encourages all concerned humanitarian actors to resume their humanitarian assistance to all victims of the humanitarian crisis, irrespective of ethnic or religious background during the ceasefire period,” the organisation said in a statement. In some areas, Arsa militants seemed to have been operating without opposition. Dhaka Tribune journalist Adil Sakhawat told the Observer he had seen black-clothed Arsa militants in control of a Myanmar border outpost at Kutkhali on the Naf river, on the frontier with Bangladesh. The free hand given to Arsa has led to fears that the government is encouraging refugees to flee across the border into Bangladesh, by providing safe passage through rebel-held crossing points. According to Sakhawat, who had just returned from the Myanmar side of the border, the militants were armed only with wooden clubs as they watched a steady stream of refugees pass. From Kutkhali, it had been possible to see another border post controlled by Myanmar forces. “They are just watching,” he said. That the Myanmar military had been allowing Arsa to operate freely in Kutkhali leads to the suspicion that they have opened at least one, if not two, corridors for the refugees to flee down safely, in an attempt to rid north Rakhine state of as many Rohingya as possible. With the Rohingya terrified of Myanmar forces, Arsa’s presence might be aimed at reassuring the refugees that Kutkhali is a safe way out of the country. Observers suggest the rebels are too weak to seriously challenge the Myanmar armed forces. “Many members of the group have fled and, despite the casualties, they aren’t a very well-armed force,” said Matthew Smith of Fortify Rights, an NGO that has been documenting human rights abuses in Rakhine. “Rohingya know that this group has no capacity to defeat or even fight the Myanmar security forces.” Yangon, which appears to be waging a campaign against Rohingya villages that many claim bears the hallmarks of ethnic cleansing, is intent on portraying its military campaign in north Rakhine as a response to attacks against nine border posts on 25 August. Speaking to the BBC on Saturday, Myanmar’s minister for social welfare, relief and resettlement, Win Myat Aye, said: “Only those who prove they have lived in Rakhine and are citizens would be accepted to come back.” To the fleeing Rohingya, Arsa is little more than a phantom force or they do not want to talk about it. “I don’t know about Arsa,” said farmer Abdul Kalam, 33, from a village called Sita Porakka in Maungdaw, as he lay in a dirty hospital in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, 25 miles from the border. “I don’t know why the military attacked our village,” said Kalam, also from Sita Porakka. Around him, Bangladeshi military intelligence officers milled. Fleeing Rohingya speak of the Myanmar military murdering civilians with impunity, aided by local ethnic-Rakhine militiamen. In the past few days, the first Rohingya from Rathedaung, 25 miles (40km) from the Naf river, have begun to cross into Bangladesh. Their stories suggest that in central Rakhine the military is waging an even more systematic and brutal campaign against civilians. In a mud hut in Kutupalong refugee camp, new arrivals from Rathedaung have found shelter with relatives. “In every family, there are two to four people who have been killed by the Burmese military,” says Neyamullah, 21. According to the UNHCR, the refugees now face increasingly dire conditions as they attempt to rebuild their lives. Thousands of Rohingya are spilling down the road that links Ukhia and Gumdum, waiting for local Bangladeshis to give them food or building materials. Local truckers, who have plied a brisk trade ferrying Rohingya to the refugee camps, occasionally lob a sack of puffed rice onto the road as a gesture of support. “We need food urgently,” said Jaheed Hussain, 45, crouched in a shelter that he has been building. Beside him, a plastic bag with Burmese characters was stuck in the mud. “I have nothing left,” he said. Jaheed’s shelter hugs the side of the highest hill in Teing Kali. From the top he can see the smoke still billowing from the village in Myanmar that he fled from on 25 August. “The Rohingya need food, medical support and shelter,” said Nur Khan Liton, a Bangladeshi human rights activist. “The international community is ignoring people’s basic needs.” Many of those crossing into Bangladesh arrive destitute. “They want 10,000 Bangladeshi taka ($122) to take us,” said one new arrival, bemoaning the price that Bangladeshi fisherman are asking to take them across the river."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/09/were-over-it-bigsound-turns-up-the-volume-on-gender-gap-in-music-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T23:34:01Z","webTitle":"'We're over it': Bigsound turns up the volume on gender in the music industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/09/were-over-it-bigsound-turns-up-the-volume-on-gender-gap-in-music-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/09/were-over-it-bigsound-turns-up-the-volume-on-gender-gap-in-music-industry","fields":{"headline":"'We're over it': Bigsound turns up the volume on gender gap in music industry","bodyText":"Brisbane’s grimy entertainment district, Fortitude Valley, is home to a slew of live music venues, bars and clubs – and each year, the Australian music industry descends for annual conference Bigsound. Tagging itself as a global gathering of musicians, media, brands and music lovers, Bigsound is at once a showcase for local talent, and a forum for discussion about an industry that’s in a constant state of flux. And two of the big issues on the table this year revolved around gender: sexual assault and antisocial behaviour at festivals and in live music venues; and gender equality and diversity within the industry itself. The former issue was brought to the fore recently via a number of alleged assaults at the Tasmanian leg of Falls festival. Helen Marcou, co-owner of Melbourne’s Bakehouse Studios, chaired a panel that argued for preventative, rather than reactive, measures. Marcou is a co-founder of Your Choice, an initiative launched in Melbourne in July and heavily backed by industry heavyweights, which aims to curb sexual assault, violence and discrimination at live music events by making promoters, venue owners, artists and managers aware of the issue; and by giving them the tools and information they need to stop toxic behaviour. As Marcou’s fellow panellist and PR head Stacey Piggott said, the only way culture will change is if people within the industry talk to each other about it: “The conversations need to be peer to peer,” she said. The issue of gender equality was also on the table. In late July, the Skipping A Beat report was released by the University of Sydney, which assessed the state of gender representation in the industry. It found that women were poorly represented across festival lineups and industry boards; on stages and backstage. The same week, industry copyright licensing body APRA/AMCOS released their own report which found that female members share in only 10% of the total royalty pool, and that more women are represented in cricket than songwriting in this country. To many, these statistics come as no surprise. “We’ve acknowledged there’s a problem; this is about how to deal with it,” Leanne de Souza said. De Souza is the executive director for the Association of Artist Managers, but also runs Facebook group MEGA (Music Equity Group for Action), advocating for a more inclusive industry. “I think the conversation around gender equity has been so focussed on calling it out that we’re over it, women who’ve been working in the industry now for 20, 25 years are tired of that,” she tells me later. “We’ve heard those stories, so now it’s time to turn the narrative – what’s working?” As a result of the research undertaken by RMIT, APRA/AMCOS have committed to a 25% increase in female members over the next three years. From October, the body will invest each year in the mentoring of female artists across a range of genres; and they have called for the entire industry to take action and eradicate gender disparity. “So now there’s this energy for change,” de Souza said, “and there are some great things happening. There’s the Listen movement, safe spaces, there are youth mentoring services – there’s all this good stuff.” Listen, based in Melbourne, is a diverse and inclusive feminist music collective whose focus is on giving a voice to minorities in the industry. It’s co-organised by Elspeth Scrine, who spoke on two panels at Bigsound and whose flyers could be found at venues across the Valley: “Top 5 Cop Outs For Booking A Lineup That Is Not Diverse” read one – no doubt a direct response to the Days Like This festival booking an all-male lineup in March. Other fliers listed simple things everyone could do to make for a more inclusive industry: respect people’s pronouns; avoid reducing an artist to one part of their identity, like their gender; make sure your workplace has toilets that everyone can use. They are deliberately easy ways to rebalance an industry that for decades has been seen as a boy’s club; a recent study by Triple J program Hack showed an overwhelming male bias within the majority of aspects of Australian music. “It’s about individual accountability,” said de Souza. “There’s a sense in the industry that we’re moving towards a positive focus.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/08/something-big-has-to-change-could-australia-afford-a-universal-basic-income","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-08T02:51:12Z","webTitle":"'Something big has to change': could Australia afford a universal basic income?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/08/something-big-has-to-change-could-australia-afford-a-universal-basic-income","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/08/something-big-has-to-change-could-australia-afford-a-universal-basic-income","fields":{"headline":"'Something big has to change': could Australia afford a universal basic income?","bodyText":"It seems everyone from Richard Branson to researchers at the Green Institute has an opinion on universal basic income (UBI), the idea that all citizens should be paid an unconditional monthly allowance. The benefits of putting a floor beneath earnings so that no one falls into poverty are obvious – but the inevitable question is, can we afford it? At a recent two-day workshop at Melbourne University, academics, union representatives and individuals from the private and welfare sectors were presented with modelling that suggests we can. Although at first blush, UBI sounds like some idealistic, leftwing idea, the reality is it has long had support in rightwing politics and economics. Richard Nixon nearly introduced a type of basic income when he was the US president, while Milton Friedman – one of the most influential champions of “free” markets and small government – promoted a basic income scheme known as a negative income tax. Even today, right-of-centre organisations such as the Adam Smith Institute argue for the introduction of such a scheme. This rightwing pedigree makes many on the left suspicious of UBI, and former union head Tim Lyons speaks for many when he says he is “deeply unconvinced by the push for a universal basic income”. What the left fear, not without some justification, is that instead of UBI being used as a supplement to other forms of service provision, it would be used to replace them. Citizens would then be forced to use their UBI to buy health, education and pension services from private providers. This sort of rightwing UBI would simply be a transfer of public wealth to private businesses, a further marketisation of democratic society. Of course, a UBI needn’t work that way, but such concerns mean the design and implementation of a scheme – the politics – are as important as the economics. Speaking at the workshop, John Quiggin, professor of economics at the University of Queensland, described the implementation of a UBI in Australia as “challenging but possible”. He calculated the cost at between 5-10% of GDP, and he rejected outright earlier claims by the Labor MP Andrew Leigh that the cost would reach 23% of GDP. Quiggin argued the introduction should be gradual, saying “UBI is not a short-term policy option but a vision to be realised over coming decades.” He also said a UBI would need to be large before it could be useful. Although a UBI of $6,000 a year would cost as much as the existing welfare budget, he said an amount that small would not enable anyone to live independently. To get the payment high enough to be serviceable, the effective marginal tax rates would need to be adjusted. Rather than beginning with a payment that is universal and unconditional, Quiggin said Australia could start with “an income-contingent guaranteed minimum income implemented with a combination of a clawback rate, and a marginal tax rate equal to 40% over the relevant range, and a 40% marginal tax rate on incomes above that level”. In other words, the country could move towards a UBI financed by a 40% tax on market income. Political economists Troy Henderson from the University of Sydney and Ben Spies-Butcher from Macquarie University set out what they called a “stepping-stone approach” to implementation. This would involve two initial stages: redesigning Australia’s pension system to make it genuinely universal (by removing means testing), and then introducing a new youth allowance. They noted the current cost of the pension is $42bn. Making it available unconditionally to all 3.74 million eligible citizens “would cost around $78.5bn”. The increased cost would, according to their modelling, be met by a combination of removing or reducing the concessional tax treatment of superannuation and the capital gains tax exemptions for the family home. For simplicity, their calculations were based on paying those eligible the maximum basic single rate ($21,015 per annum), but they noted costs would be substantially further reduced by continuing with single and couple rates for the age pension, and by removing a number of tax offsets and exemptions targeted at older Australians. By eliminating the exemption for the family home from capital gains tax, they argued, significant distortions in the Australian housing market would be addressed and potentially assist younger households currently locked out of the market. Furthermore the amount of tax funding available in general would also be increased. This could then be used to fund the other step in their approach to UBI – a youth basic income (YBI). A YBI would be targeted at people aged between 20 and 24, a group that research by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare shows is overrepresented in terms of insecure work and low pay. They often experience financial insecurity as they move between paid work, education and training. Henderson and Spies-Butcher calculated a YBI on the basis of a payment of around $14,000 per annum for those not working or studying and those in full-time study, and around $11,000 for those in part-time work or combining work and study. Although they conceded that both are relatively small amounts, they said their proposal would increase the incomes of the lowest-income young people. They calculated that a YBI of between $11,000 and $14,000 per annum would cost approximately $17.5bn, that is, around 4% of federal government outlays or around 1% of Australia’s GDP. Once the redesigned pension and YBI are in place, the path to full UBI is achieved by gradually increasing the number of people entitled to each benefit. “Creating universal payments for younger and older Australians creates a framework for a transition to a full basic income. It becomes economically feasible for governments to make incremental extensions, say lowering the pension age to 60 or increasing the YBI to 30, and it creates real constituencies of voters who can see the benefits of the scheme and mobilise behind expansion,” Spies-Butcher said. These schemes have much to commend them, not least putting actual numbers against what until now has tended to be a very theoretical public discussion of UBI. Still, the stepped, or gradual approach favoured by these economists potentially works against one of the great strengths of UBI, namely, the enthusiastic support it receives from ordinary voters. “There’s a definite mood for big, radical ideas to put control back in the hands of the people,” said workshop participant Tim Hollo, executive director of the Green Institute. “Moves to a UBI have to be designed to support that rather than stifle it.” Another argument against incremental implementation was raised in discussion of trials of UBI, such as the one currently under way in Finland. Karl Widerquist, former co-chair of the Basic Income Earth Network (BIEN), the world’s biggest advocacy group for a UBI, told the workshop that such trials were a “bad choice”. He said the universal and unconditional aspects of a UBI are difficult to replicate at the level of a trial and that looking at how it works for a thousand people would be different to what would happen if everyone had it. He drew the comparison with the herd effects of immunisation, adding “you need everyone involved to gain the benefits and see the results”. Another key question frequently arises in this debate: even if we can afford a UBI and find a way to implement it, does that mean we should we do it? Given that all wealth is socially generated, that is to say, is totally dependent on investments in infrastructure, healthcare, education, a legal system etc that citizens have all contributed to over many generations, then it follows that every member of society has a right to share in that wealth. This “common wealth” argument is greatly strengthened, too, as we continue to transform into an information economy. Increasingly, businesses rely on access to data in order to succeed, to the extent that some have called data the new oil. Most of that data is self-generated every time we do something online, use a store loyalty card or turn on our phones. Indeed, companies like Google and Facebook rely entirely on the free labour we provide every time we update our status or do a search. The argument, then, is that just as mining companies pay a royalty recognising the common ownership of the products they extract from the earth, a UBI would be a way of recognising the common ownership of the data that tech companies extract from us. The consensus at the Melbourne workshop was that the current welfare system is broken. With inequality demonstrably increasing, automation in the labour market likely to keep downward pressure on wages and a growing problem of reduced home ownership among young people adding to intergenerational inequality, it seems reasonable to suggest something has to change. Something big. Under such circumstances, UBI presents itself as a way to totally reimagine the nation’s approach to social security and address the structural inequities that are making Australia a less fair society.

Inevitably, he was even hailed as the new Dylan. World domination appeared assured. Half a decade down the line, Jake Bugg’s career trajectory is noticeably less spectacular. His record sales have slumped; there have been missteps. His third album, On My One, saw him unwisely dabbling in dance beats and even hip-hop. His latest, the country-hued Hearts That Strain, was recorded in Nashville with veteran studio musicians who backed Elvis and Wilson Pickett. Such creative restlessness would usually be laudable, but in Bugg’s case the effect seems to have been to shear off the urgency and the rough edges that initially made him such a compelling artist. His new record is largely dreary, and nearly all of the highlights of this solo acoustic benefit show for Nordoff Robbins and Grenfell Tower fire victims are drawn from his first two albums. Has he done too much, too young? There must be a downside to a life spent making an album a year and living on the road since his late teens. Where once he was all vim and brio, Bugg now cuts a world-weary figure, sighing his way through country-tinged songs of regret and reminiscence as if he has entered his twilight years at 23. It’s a marked shift for a tyro performer who emerged snarling feral tales of a misspent youth watching drug dealings on a Nottingham council estate. Taciturn and black-clad beneath a tousled mop, Bugg remains fresh-faced but croons the languid, sparse Hearts That Strain and Southern Rain with the bruised fatalism of a grizzled resident of the Grand Ole Opry, or like Glen Campbell reincarnated. It’s soporific and more than a little boring, and the night only comes alive when Bugg fires into the sprung rhythms and dextrous lexical gymnastics of his brilliant early roustabouts Trouble Town and There’s a Beast and We All Feed It. They embody the urgency the evening has lacked. An obvious message is reinforced by a provocative set-closing first-album triumvirate of Two Fingers, Broken and the 21st-century skiffle of Lightning Bolt.

Law’s sin was to take aim at News Corp’s reporting of the Safe Schools program in the 25,000 word essay. It returned fire, not by debating the substance of the essay, but by highlighting an explicit tweet he posted on 31 August about the marriage equality debate. “They’ve done it with Safe Schools, they’ve done it with Yassmin Abdel-Magied, they’ve done it with Gillian Triggs, so I was expecting it with the Quarterly Essay that attacks them,” Law said. “They have a lazy MO where they identify an enemy, they scan their social media and they manufacture an outrage about it. That’s what we see time and time again. That proves my thesis. “One of the reasons I’ve gotten so many followers is my sense of humour. I am happy to keep tweeting how I always have. If you Google ‘hate fucking’ it tells you that it’s not sexual assault. The Australian Christian Lobby has called me a rape advocate now which is pretty appalling; anyone would know that rape is not something I would joke about.” Sky’s CBS jitters Sky News Australia has launched a publicity campaign this week with the slogan “News you can trust, opinions you can’t ignore”, featuring slick portraits of presenters David Speers, Chris Kenny and Andrew Bolt. “To find out what is really going on you can rely on Sky News,” the full page ads in News Corp papers say. “The best award winning journalists with unique and exclusive insights. Fearless opinions from the big names who are passionate about the country we live in … That’s why Sky News is Australia’s News Channel.” Except it isn’t, as viewing numbers are very low and falling. The PR blitz comes as the Murdoch media empire launches a last-ditch attempt to block the US network CBS from taking over the Ten network. If Lachlan Murdoch and Bruce Gordon’s bid to buy Ten had been successful it would have been good news for Sky, giving it access to the free-to-air network and a bigger audience. Ten’s newsroom would most probably have been merged with Sky’s. There are some nervous journalists at Sky wondering what the future holds for them now that CBS is the likely winner. Where there’s a quill there’s a way Following the Walkley advisory board’s decision to drop the category of international reporting there are moves afoot to restore the award but under a different banner. A petition signed by almost 500 journalists including ABC foreign correspondents Philip Williams, Sally Sara and Matt Brown, ABC presenters Leigh Sales, Virginia Trioli, Michael Rowland and Chris Uhlmann, former Gold Walkley winners Adele Ferguson, Liz Jackson and photojournalist Andrew Quilty failed to move the Walkleys chair, Angelos Frangopoulos, who upheld the decision. Weekly Beast understands the Melbourne Press Club is now discussing the merits of instituting an award for international reporting which would be open to all Australian journalists. The MPC, the home of the Victorian Quill Awards, already runs the Graham Perkin award for Australian journalist of the year which is a national award. In November the MPC is holding a gala dinner in Sydney to formally inaugurate the Australian Media Hall of Fame and induct more than 50 late and living legends of journalism in New South Wales. You can expect a lot of lobbying for a new international award at that event. Is it really game over for Bauer’s Rebel hell? Lawyers for Bauer Media are trawling the Rebel Wilson v Bauer Media judgment to see what avenues of appeal there are to contest the extraordinary amount of damages awarded to the Australian actor by Justice John Dixon this week. Barrister and blogger Natalie Hickey says she is not confident that Dixon’s judgment, which awarded the Hollywood star $4,567,472 in damages for defamation, would survive an appeal. Hickey says he awarded the record sum “despite any direct evidence showing that this famous actor’s career had dried up because of the impugned articles”. “A court of appeal of three judges might be less inclined to accept the holistic approach applied by Dixon J,” Hickey said on her Social Litigator blog. Media law expert Mark Pearson says he won’t be surprised if other celebrities decide to take action given the success of Wilson’s claim in an Australian court. “Just because someone enters public life does not mean you can make up damaging allegations against them and get away with it,” Pearson said. “It can only be a good thing if magazine editors work within basic journalism principles and then we might start to use the term journalism to describe them. At the moment I just describe them as infotainment.” Overington singled out Dixon reserved his harshest criticism for the Australian’s associate editor Caroline Overington, a reporter for the Australian Women’s Weekly at the time, saying her article was malicious. Overington wrote one of the three articles he deemed “most serious”. The other two were written by Shari Nementzik. “The third article, written by journalist Caroline Overington … merits special mention,” Dixon said. “Ms Overington is herself a well-known and respected Australian journalist who holds herself out as specialising in investigative journalism. The jury found that it conveyed that Ms Wilson is so untrustworthy that nothing she says about herself can be taken to be true unless it has been independently corroborated. Such a meaning is, self-evidently, very serious. “Publicly branding a person who has, over the course of their life, enjoyed a reputation for honesty and authenticity, as a serial liar and so untrustworthy that nothing she says about herself can be taken to be true unless it has been independently corroborated, was an extremely serious thing to put against the plaintiff not just without a legitimate basis, as the jury verdict made clear, but with malice. Bauer Media published material by an award-winning investigative journalist as part of its campaign against the plaintiff. Ms Nementzik explained that Ms Overington’s standing was very significant for her when material Ms Overington had written was used in her research.” Contacted by Weekly Beast, Overington asked that questions be referred to Bauer. Bauer has been asked for comment. ‘I’ve cried myself to sleep’ For RUOK Day Triple J Breakfast duo Liam Stapleton and Ben Harvey spoke openly about mental health awareness and dealing with online trolls and harassment. Stapleton’s heartfelt words have resonated with the ABC’s young audience – some of the trolls even apologised for the impact their negativity had had. “When people send things in, when people put things online, there’s no repercussions of people’s words – or at least they feel that way,” Stapleton said. “I think there’s almost like a magic filter, but you know, we see it. We see when people text into our workplace, we see all the posts, we see all the comments. I can honestly say I’ve had nights where I’ve cried myself to sleep because of stuff like that. “I’ve had times throughout the last eight months where I’ve opened messages to my personal account, and people are quite explicitly telling me to take my own life. And it knocks you around, especially as a young bloke. I’ve felt things in the last eight months that I’ve never felt before. I’ve felt properly worthless, honestly, for mornings, for days, for weeks sometimes. It’s not just online, it’s happened in person before, we do have to wear this sort of stuff.” • Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14; Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78; Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/14/labour-considers-legal-challenge-over-tuition-fees-increase","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T11:51:16Z","webTitle":"Labour considers legal challenge over tuition fees increase","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/14/labour-considers-legal-challenge-over-tuition-fees-increase","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/14/labour-considers-legal-challenge-over-tuition-fees-increase","fields":{"headline":"Labour considers legal challenge over tuition fees increase","bodyText":"Labour is examining its legal options to challenge the government’s decision to raise the student tuition fees cap, after ministers refused to allow a parliamentary vote. The Conservatives did not allow government time for a debate and binding vote amid fears MPs would have blocked the proposed increase in fees from £9,000 to £9,250 a year. Labour passed a non-binding motion against the measure on Wednesday with the support of other opposition parties including Theresa May’s political partners in the Democratic Unionist party. However, the government has no legal obligation to take the motion into account and the time limit for stopping the changes has already passed. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said it amounted to a “constitutional crisis”, as ministers had promised before the election to abide by convention and allocate government time for a formal vote in the House of Commons. She said it set a worrying precedent for scrutiny of the deluge of statutory instruments that the government will push through as part of Brexit. A senior Labour source said the party was consulting lawyers and there was a slim possibility of bringing a judicial review. It was also examining options for trying to reverse the regulations through the House of Lords. Regulations by negative statutory instrument are allowed to pass without a debate and vote if there is no formal objection, but Labour “prayed against” the changes to register its discontent. The government had initially promised a vote. In March the then leader of the Commons, David Lidington, said: “Slots have been provided for debates on the prayers against the statutory instruments concerning tuition fees and the personal independence payment.” However, the debate was delayed by the election and no new vote was given time by the government during the 40 days until the regulations came into force. Labour suspects ministers refused time for a vote after the election because they knew May only had a majority with the support of the DUP, which opposes raising student fees. The DUP signalled that it backed Labour’s non-binding motion against the rise on Wednesday, so the government allowed it to pass without a vote to avoid defeat. During the debate, Rayner said raising tuition fees by another £250 a year was “unsustainable for students and completely unfair”. She told the Guardian afterwards: “Just days ago the government told us that we could trust them with the powers in the Brexit bill because ministers could not change the law without parliament agreeing to it. Yet today they are changing the law despite the House of Commons voting against it. “In the space of a week the Tories have gone from Henry VIII to Charles I, simply ignoring elected MPs and ruling by decree. If they want to avoid a constitutional crisis, they must accept this vote and immediately confirm that they will abandon this rise in tuition fees.” Justine Greening, the education secretary, ignored the criticism about a formal vote being denied and focused instead on Labour’s student finance policy, which she said was “a cold, calculating con-trick on young people”. Greening told MPs that Labour’s policy was to have no tuition fees, which she said would lead to “fewer students at worse universities” and amounted to “anti-social mobility policy writ large”. She said: “Far from being the friend of students and universities, their policy would destroy opportunity and destroy our world-class universities. This house, Mr Speaker, should see straight through it – frankly, this motion isn’t even worth the paper it’s written on.” A Conservative source said the government believed it had given Labour enough opportunity to oppose the regulations for a rise in tuition fees, and the party had not taken the most recent chance to lay a motion against it in the House of Lords. Andrea Leadsom, Lidington’s successor as Conservative leader of the Commons, said the usual process had been “interrupted” by the election and confirmed that the time limit for reversing the regulations had expired."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/14/apple-face-id-didnt-fail-at-iphone-x-launch-staff","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T09:38:04Z","webTitle":"Apple: Face ID didn't fail at iPhone X launch, our staff did","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/14/apple-face-id-didnt-fail-at-iphone-x-launch-staff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/sep/14/apple-face-id-didnt-fail-at-iphone-x-launch-staff","fields":{"headline":"Apple: Face ID didn't fail at iPhone X launch, our staff did","bodyText":"Apple has offered an explanation for an embarrassing glitch at the launch of its most expensive iPhone ever, arguing that the phone didn’t make an error – the company’s staff did. During the first ever public demonstration of the £999/£1,149 iPhone X, Apple executive Craig Federighi attempted to unlock the device using the company’s new Face ID feature, which scans a user’s face to ensure only they can unlock their phones. But the feature failed, bumping Federighi to an old-fashioned passcode entry screen and forcing him to switch to a backup phone. Many assumed that the problem was that Face ID system failed to recognise Federighi. That would be a concerning prospect for a feature that is due to replace the company’s tried-and-tested Touch ID fingerprint reader on its flagship smartphone. But Apple says this was not the issue at all: instead, the company said far too many people were messing around with the phone backstage. “People were handling the device for stage demo ahead of time,” an Apple spokesperson told Yahoo, “and didn’t realise Face ID was trying to authenticate their face. After failing a number of times, because they weren’t Craig, the iPhone did what it was designed to do, which was to require his passcode. Face ID worked as it was designed to.” The news will reassure those concerned that Face ID may not recognise their unique visage, but remains a warning sign for users who fear the feature won’t live up to Touch ID, since more chances for accidental activation means Federighi’s experience may be a common one. While analysts seem bullish on Apple’s chances with the iPhone X against stiff competition from rivals Samsung and others, whether the lack of Touch ID will be seen as a step back for the iPhone X remains to be seen.

The Italian artist Francesca Sanna, however, who has won the 2017 Klaus Flugge prize for most exciting newcomer to children’s picture book illustration, chose a rather tougher trek for her debut title: that of a mother and her two children who are fleeing a war. Sanna’s The Journey opens with an ordinary family playing on a beach by the city, using images that are redolent of classic fairytales, and simple text told from a child’s perspective. But “one day the war took my father”, and eventually the mother takes her children away to what she tells them will be a “safe place”. They face hurdles – an angry border guard, magnified to the size of a monster, turns them back; they hide in the forest; they cross the sea. “There is not much space and it rains every day, but we tell each other stories. Tales of terrible and dangerous monsters that hide beneath our boat ready to gobble us up if the boat capsizes!” Speaking in London before receiving her £5,000 award, Sanna said she was inspired by her conversations with several refugees, in particular two young girls she met in a refugee centre in Italy. “Meeting them really made me think that being a refugee is a situation you find yourself in, not who you are,” she said. “I took inspiration from the real stories of people I met around Switzerland [where she was studying for a masters’] and Italy.” She didn’t know, immediately, that her story would be a children’s book, but when she settled on the idea of a journey, it was clear to her that the medium was perfect. “I didn’t think about writing a book that is issue-based. But children are exposed to the topic – they see pictures from the news of refugees, and of the tragedies in the Mediterranean. So, the space for a discussion about this is important.” Translated into 14 languages, The Journey has also been shortlisted for the CILIP Kate Greenaway medal and won the US Society of Illustrators’ gold medal, the Amnesty Cilip Honour and Spain’s Premi Llibreter. Sanna beat four other illustrators to take the latest award, which was established to honour the children’s publisher Klaus Flugge. Judge and Gruffalo illustrator Axel Scheffler said it was “the most inventive and original” of the entries. “The fear the family experiences is strongly expressed in the graphic language of the book, which is beautifully designed,” said Scheffler. Julia Eccleshare, the chair of judges, said that Sanna’s words and pictures work perfectly together to tell a story that “will move all readers, whatever their age”. Sanna herself said that children and adults reacted in very different ways to her story – in particular to the image of the mother weeping while her children sleep, alongside the child’s thoughts that: “Mother is with us and she is never scared.” “For me it is important to play with what the pictures and the text can say – a picture can illustrate what the text says, but it can also do the opposite,” said Sanna. “Children explain to me here why she’s scared. It’s quite obvious to them that the mother is scared, that she is protecting her children.” Parents, however, have been surprised that she has revealed the mother’s true feelings to children. Sanna is now planning to tackle the topic of integration for refugees in her next book. “That’s a huge aspect of the topic of immigration, which I couldn’t cover in The Journey,” she said. Eccleshare said that the judges were all excited to see what Sanna does next. “Over his long career, Klaus Flugge has always been ready to publish groundbreaking books, and many of those, though deemed challenging on publication – Not Now Bernard by David McKee for example – are today recognised as classics. It is fitting that the prize in his name is this year going to Francesca,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/14/northern-rock-investors-theresa-may-compensation","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T10:33:37Z","webTitle":"Former Northern Rock investors ask Theresa May for compensation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/14/northern-rock-investors-theresa-may-compensation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/14/northern-rock-investors-theresa-may-compensation","fields":{"headline":"Former Northern Rock investors ask Theresa May for compensation","bodyText":"Former shareholders in Northern Rock are asking Theresa May to listen to their moral case for compensation after their investment in the Newcastle-based lender was wiped out when it was nationalised 10 years ago. A delegation of investors will arrive at 10 Downing Street on Thursday to hand in a letter to the prime minister to set out their claim that it is unfair that the government has received all of the proceeds from sales of Northern Rock’s assets. Thursday marks the 10th anniversary of the run on Northern Rock, when nervous customers seeking to withdraw their money queued at branches around the country after news broke that the bank had received emergency funding from the Bank of England. Dennis Grainger, who worked at Northern Rock for 10 years, has led the campaign and will head the delegation to argue that there is justification to make payments to about 150,000 private shareholders who lost their equity when the bank was nationalised in February 2008. Grainger said: “Three times I tried to get a meeting with David Cameron to ask him to review the unfair handling by the previous disingenuous administration. Now may be an appropriate time for the prime minister to apply the ‘fairness’ in which she clearly believes.” The group he leads has continue to work on their claim despite a decision by the European court of justice in 2012 to dismiss their argument that they were entitled to a payout. Part of Northern Rock was sold to Virgin Money in 2012 and since then other mortgages have been sold off and parts of the business managed alongside the mortgage book of Bradford &amp; Bingley. The government has estimated it will make about £9.6bn from Northern Rock and the parts of Bradford &amp; Bingley with which it has been combined, the campaigners said. The former shareholders argue that have an “overwhelming case that the entire Rock handling and outcome clearly demonstrates discriminatory treatment, injustice and unfairness toward the shareholders who were ‘wiped out’ unjustly”. Among their arguments is that the shareholders in banks that were rescued the following year – Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds TBS and HBOS – were not wiped out in the same way. In his letter to the prime minister, on behalf of the Northern Rock Small Shareholders Association, Grainger said: “As the UK marks the 10th anniversary of the Northern Rock crisis in 2007 may we suggest to you that it would be appropriate now to try and achieve a just closure on an equitable, morally sound and fair basis.” The run on Northern Rock began on 14 September 2007 after the BBC reported that the Newcastle-based lender had received emergency funding from the Bank of England. It was the first run on a high street bank in the UK since Overend &amp; Gurney in the 1860s."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/14/mercury-music-prize-2017-is-won-by-samphas-process","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T21:20:37Z","webTitle":"Mercury prize 2017 is won by Sampha's Process","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/14/mercury-music-prize-2017-is-won-by-samphas-process","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/14/mercury-music-prize-2017-is-won-by-samphas-process","fields":{"headline":"Mercury prize 2017 is won by Sampha's Process","bodyText":"Sampha, the south London singer-songwriter who for a long time was better known as a guest vocalist on other people’s songs, has won one of the UK’s most prestigious music prizes. The artist, full name Sampha Sisay, won the Hyundai Mercury prize for his critically acclaimed debut album Process. At the ceremony, Sampha performed, to silence then wild cheers (No One Knows Me) Like the Piano, which, for emotional types, was one of the most heartbreaking and beautiful singles of the year. Afterwards, he said it was an amazing feeling to win. “It’s taken me quite a while to feel like I was emotionally stable enough to write my own record and people have just been incredibly lovely and understanding … it feels like a weight off my shoulders.” Sampha’s gorgeous, distinctive, soulful voice has appeared on songs by some of the biggest names in US hip-hop and R&amp;B including Beyoncé, Drake, Solange and Kanye West. But it has taken some time for the 28-year-old to blossom into a notable recording artist in his own right, with an album heavily influenced by the death of his mother from cancer and fears for his own health. Sampha was one of five south London artists nominated for this year’s prize and is probably the most unassuming of all the nominees. Asked what he would do with the prize money he gave the most un-rock‘n‘roll answer it’s possible to give. “Put it away? Save it up? Saving is always good.” How would he celebrate? “I just want to see my family and friends, have a couple of drinks.” He said artists always struggled with self-esteem, so to win the Mercury “definitely does give you a boost”. Sampha had been among the bookmakers’ favourites to win, up against artists including Kate Tempest, Stormzy, and Ed Sheeran who, with the best will in the world, no one expected to pick up the prize. Another debutant, J Hus, had been heavily tipped too. The actor Idris Elba gave Sampha his £25,000 prize at a ceremony with performances from the shortlisted artists at the Eventim Apollo in Hammersmith, London. The long time favourite to win had been Tempest for her angry, melodic, state-of-the-nation album Let Them Eat Chaos. But it was not to be and Sampha’s victory continues the run of men winning the album award. Since PJ Harvey won her second Mercury prize in 2011, the only artist to win two, it has been won by Alt-J, James Blake, Young Fathers, Benjamin Clementine and last year, Skepta. Alt-J were again nominated, for their album Relaxer, although it’s fair to say they did not hold out much hope of repeating the win. Singer Joe Newman admitted before the ceremony that even his family were not optimistic. “My sister has put a bet on J Hus, which is reassuring,” he said. If they were to win they would give the money to the mental health charity Mind, but they did not expect it. “There are a lot of great acts here and we’re just happy to be part of it really.” There was similar pessimism among the four former Oxford schoolfriends who make up Glass Animals, although at least singer Dave Bayley’s mum had put a bet on them winning – £5 at odds of 33-1, which was before a late flurry of betting propelled them to a price of 11/4. Drummer Joe Seaward said: “It is very nice to be asked at all, I don’t think we’ve got that far down the road of thinking about winning. We’ve got a song to play.” They were looking forward to the evening and then a 7am flight on Friday to the US to begin their tour. The prize is decided on the night by a panel of judges who this year consisted of musicians Ella Eyre, Jamie Cullum, Marcus Mumford and Lianne La Havas, the Guardian’s deputy music editor Harriet Gibsone, DJ MistaJam, critic Will Hodgkinson, Mojo and Q magazine editor-in-chief Phil Alexander, the head of music at Radio X, Mike Walsh, and the head of music at BBC 6Music and Radio 2, Jeff Smith. How their discussions went will no doubt emerge, although Mumford gave a glimpse into the shortlist meeting, telling the BBC: “We were only allowed to talk about positive things. So I shut up quite a lot.” Last year the judging panel were split between giving the award posthumously to David Bowie, or to Skepta for his album Konnichiwa. Whatever the merits of deciding the best album from such a diverse range of genres – jazz, folk, grime, indie rock, although as yet no death metal in the prize’s history – one thing is certain. It dramatically boosts sales. In the case of jazz, trumpet-led Dinosaur, they rose by more than 38%, according to an analysis of Official Charts Company data. The average increase across the 12 albums was 15% in the six weeks between the shortlist announcement and last Friday’s chart. The prize began in 1992, won by Primal Scream for Screamadelica. Since then it has been won by bands including Pulp, Gomez, Arctic Monkeys, Elbow, and solo artists including Talvin Singh, Ms Dynamite and Dizzee Rascal. The full list of this year’s nominees was Alt-J, Relaxer; Blossoms, Blossoms; Dinosaur, Together, As One; Ed Sheeran, ÷; Glass Animals, How to be a Human Being; J Hus, Common Sense; Kate Tempest, Let Them Eat Chaos; Loyle Carner, Yesterday’s Gone; Sampha, Process; Stormzy, Gang Signs &amp; Prayer; The Big Moon, Love in the 4th Dimension; and the xx, I See You. The culture secretary Karen Bradley said the Mercury prize reinforced the UK’s claim “to be the most exciting place for music in the world”. She added: “Britain’s vibrant music scene contributes billions towards our economy, but it is also deeply engrained in our cultural DNA and loved by millions of people.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/15/fridays-best-tv-marc-bolan-cosmic-dancer-the-crystal-maze","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T05:00:01Z","webTitle":"Friday’s best TV: Marc Bolan – Cosmic Dancer; The Crystal Maze","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/15/fridays-best-tv-marc-bolan-cosmic-dancer-the-crystal-maze","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/15/fridays-best-tv-marc-bolan-cosmic-dancer-the-crystal-maze","fields":{"headline":"Friday’s best TV: Marc Bolan – Cosmic Dancer; The Crystal Maze","bodyText":"Marc Bolan: Cosmic Dancer 9pm, BBC4 Forty years after his death, this profile of the T Rex star is narrated using his own words.

The Guardian joined Beaumont in Lisbon on Wednesday, where he arrived on an overnight flight from Halifax in Canada to start the final leg of his record-breaking challenge. Despite cycling an average of 240 miles over 16 hours every day since 2 July, he looked fresh and sounded upbeat as we ticked off more miles on our way to the Spanish border. Yet he admitted the ride has taken its toll on him, both mentally and physically. “I’ve been to some very low places and it’s reduced me to tears on four occasions, which has never happened on any of my other expeditions,” said Beaumont, who started his long-distance cycling exploits at the age of 11 when he rode 145 miles across Scotland. “It’s taken me to some strange places mentally,” he said. “I didn’t want to have any excuses to fail, that’s why I made the rule that I would ride four blocks of four hours every day without any breaks during them. It makes life a lot simpler when you don’t have any exit doors like that.” Barring disaster, Beaumont will smash the previous record of 123 days set by New Zealander Andrew Nicholson, but still grapples with doubts about how he is viewed by the “mainstream cycling” fraternity. “I’m still not sure it has accepted me,” he says. “I know that my main fanbase is 40-year-old males in lycra and that’s great, but I still get complaints that I’ve sold out with all my corporate sponsorship, or that I’m not doing it in the proper spirit because I’ve got two support vehicles and am racing through at 240 miles a day. “But when I originally cycled around the world unsupported 10 years ago [setting a then-record of 194 days], I described myself as an adventurer. These days I’m an athlete. It’s all about the performance, it’s about making a livelihood from what I do and being able to support my family, just like Chris Froome makes his living from cycling. Yet he couldn’t do what I’m doing, and I couldn’t do what he does.” Beaumont’s support team has varied from continent to continent, but the key figures have been team leader and Falklands veteran Mike Griffiths, performance director and trans-Pacific rower Laura Penhaul, and mechanic/navigator Alex Glasgow, a veteran of unsupported cycle trips around the world. Penhaul had sent detailed instructions about personal hygiene in advance of the Guardian’s arrival, not wanting to risk exposing Beaumont to any infections while his immune system is vulnerable. She takes daily swabs of saliva to monitor his health. At one point Penhaul handed the Guardian a couple of paracetamol, saying: “Can you give these to Mark – he’s suffering a bit. His body is going into recovery mode.” Upon catching up with Beaumont, who rides each day at a steady 15mph, he said: “My whole body has been protesting since I got off the plane, especially the pressure points on my hands and feet. Laura had to dig out a callus on my foot in Canada. She also had to replace the filling in my tooth [the consequence of a crash in Moscow], and I’m so tired that I fell asleep while she was doing it.” While Penhaul has been overseeing Beaumont’s physical and mental welfare, with duties ranging from nutritionist and masseur to GP and counsellor – Griffiths and Glasgow have been constantly fine-tuning the route so that it satisfies Guinness World Records requirements. “It’s been an emotional rollercoaster, a living, breathing project that has constantly flexed its muscles,” says Griffiths. “We keep revising the route so that we’ll hit the target of 18,000 miles without any waste. It’s alright to say, ‘Put in a fudge factor’, but it’s Mark who has to ride it. When he rode around the world last time he added an extra 300 miles just to be safe. Well, he can’t do that in 80 days.” As of Wednesday, the team’s projected mileage total was eight miles short – so Griffiths improvised a detour to make up the shortfall. At one point during the ride, Beaumont’s phone buzzes. It’s Nicci, his wife and mother of their young daughters, Harriet and Willa, who he hasn’t seen since 2 July. “She told me she’s coming out to Paris on Sunday,” says Beaumont, before adding: “That suddenly sounds very close.” His next big challenge will be resuming “a normal, family life”. After living a daily routine defined by numbers – 16 hours cycling, 9,000 calories consumed, five hours of sleep – his team have prepared an extensive “decompression” strategy. “I’ve done very little walking during the past 75 days. I walked up some stairs at the airport and it really hurt. But I’m looking forward to getting on my bike without any targets or deadlines.” He also fully expects others to have a go at his record. “I sincerely wish them well,” he said. “There’s no reason it couldn’t be broken. After all, I’m hardly your typical cyclist – I’m 6’3” and 90 kilos. Someone who is 75 kilos and a ‘proper’ cyclist might do it faster. We shall see. “But I’ll always be the first who did it [in under 80 days]. No one remembers who was second up Everest.” • Mark Beaumont is an ambassador for Visit Scotland.

A new study has shown that lightning strikes occur nearly twice as often above busy shipping lanes than in the regions to either side. It turns out the belching fumes from ship exhausts are helping to trigger extra lightning. While analysing data from the Worldwide Lightning Location Network, a web of sensors around the world that track lightning strikes, researchers noticed nearly straight lines of lightning strikes across the Indian Ocean and South China Sea. By comparing the lightning data with maps of ships’ exhaust emissions they were able to show that there were nearly twice as many lightning strikes along the main shipping routes between Sri Lanka and Sumatra, and between Singapore and Vietnam. This enhanced level of lightning was visible at least as far back as 2005. Writing in Geophysical Research Letters, the researchers explain how the ship exhaust fumes add more particles to the air, which encourages more cloud droplets to form. Because the cloud droplets are smaller and lighter than they would otherwise be they travel higher into the atmosphere and are more likely to reach the freezing line, so creating more ice particles. Collision between ice particles causes storm clouds to electrify, and lightning is the atmosphere’s way of neutralising the built-up electric charge. “It’s one of the clearest examples of how humans are actually changing the intensity of storm processes on Earth through the emission of particulates from combustion,” said Joel Thornton, from the University of Washington, in Seattle, the lead author of the study."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2017/sep/14/brexit-talks-are-not-going-in-the-way-we-might-hope-says-former-bank-of-england-chief-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T17:32:38Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson trying to overcome red tape stopping aid to UK territories hit by Irma - politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/sep/14/brexit-talks-are-not-going-in-the-way-we-might-hope-says-former-bank-of-england-chief-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2017/sep/14/brexit-talks-are-not-going-in-the-way-we-might-hope-says-former-bank-of-england-chief-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson trying to overcome red tape stopping aid to UK territories hit by Irma - politics live","bodyText":"Here are the main points from the Johnson/Tillerson press conference. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, said the government was actively investigating how the aid budget can be used to help British territories devasted by Hurricane Irma. He was responding to a question about whether he accepted the current assessment, which is that the £13bn aid budget cannot be used because the territories are too rich to qualify for help under under official international aid criteria. Johnson said: Anybody who has seen the effects of the hurricane, it’s absolutely catastrophic - I’ve never seen anything like it. It’s destruction which you see in images from the first world war. And I think anybody with an ounce of compassion would want to see spending by our government in getting those people back on their feet and indeed on getting those British - and I stress British - overseas territories helped in the long term. And of course we are looking now across Whitehall at ways in which we can make sure that our aid budget can be used in that way, and I know that Priti Patel [the international development secretary], all my colleagues, are looking at how we can do that. That is absolutely natural and we are on that right now. He said the Burmese leader Aung San Suu Kyi should use her “moral capital” to stop the massacre of Rohingya Muslims and to ensure that they are allowed to return to Myanmar in safety. Asked if regretted praising her recently in the light of her inaction over this, he said that 370,000 Rohingya had fled the country in desperation. He went on: Let’s be clear. [Aung San Suu Kyi] led Burma [Myanmar] after a period of decades of repression by a military junta. And I yield to no one in my admiration of what she stood for, and the way she fought for democracy. I think many people around the world share that admiration. I think it is now vital for her to use that moral capital and that authority to make the point about the suffering of the people of Rakhine. Nobody wants to see a return to military rule in Burma. Nobody wants to see a return of the generals. But it is also vital that the civilian government, and that is [Aung San Suu Kyi], for whom, as I say, I have a great deal of admiration, but it is vital for her now to make clear that this is an abomination and that those people will be allowed back to Burma and that preparation is being made and that the abuse of their human rights and the killings will stop. Rex Tillerson, the US secretary of state, said America thought Iran was in breach of its obligations under the nuclear deal (the JCPOA - joint comprehensive plan of action). The Trump administration was still reviewing its Iran policy, he said, and had not come to a conclusion. But he went on: But I think it is worth noting, as the administration continues its review of the JCPOA, President Trump has made it clear to those of us who are developing this policy that we must take into account the totality of Iranian threats, not just Iran’s nuclear capability. That is one piece of our posture towards Iran. And if one revists the preface to the JCPOA, that preface reads that the participants “anticipate that full implementation of this JCPOA will positively contribute to regional and international peace and security”. That was one of the expectations of the JCPOA. And in our view Iran is clearly in default of these expectations of the JCPOA, through their actions to prop up the Assad regime, to engage in malicious activities in the region, including cyber activity, aggressively developing ballistic missiles. And all of this is in defiance of UN security resolution 2231, thereby threatening, not ensuring, threatening the security of those in the region, as well as the United States itself. So we have to consider the totality of Iran’s activities and not let our view be defined solely by the nuclear agreement. He said Brexit presented “unique challenges to the British people”. (See 4.55pm.) That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. The press conference is over. Here is a clip from Tillerson’s opening remarks. Johnson says the North Korean crisis shows the value of arrangements like the JCPOA in relation to Iran. It is important that Iran sees there are economic benefits from the JCPOA. The British want to “keep it alive”, he says. He says that is a point he has been making to the Americans. Tillerson says the US views the UN security council resolution on North Korea as a “small step”. It had hoped for a stronger resolution, he says. Johnson says there was a wide measure of support for the US/UK position. The Chinese have done more than some people expected. But there is scope for them to do far, far more, especially in relation to Chinese oil exports to North Korea. Q: What is your policy on Iran? Tillerson says US policy towards Iran is being reviewed. No policy has been set yet, he says. But he says President Trump has stressed they must take into account the totality of Iranian threats, not just the threat posed by Iran’s nuclear programme. He says Iran is in default of expectations because of the destabilising influence it is exercising in the region. On Myanmar, he says the US appreciates the difficult position Aung San Suu Kyi is in. He says the US needs to support her against the military. Q: Should the government be able to use its aid budget to help people in the Caribbean? Johnson says the destruction by Hurricane Irma was awe-inspiring. He says he wants to see those British overseas territories helped. He stresses the word British. He says in Whitehall Priti Patel and others are looking at how the aid budget can be used to help? Q: When do you think elections can be held in Libya? Johnson says next year sounds about right. But the political framework has to be in place. There is wide support for elections in Libya, he says. Q: Do you regret saying Aung San Suu Kyi was one of the world’s most inspiring leaders? Johnson says what is happening to the Rohingya is a tragedy. He says Aung San Suu Kyi led Myanmar out of decades of oppression. He says she should use her moral capital and authority to make the point about the suffering of the Rohingya. No one wants to see a return to military rule, he says. He says the killings must stop. Here is a speech Tillerson gave earlier today to US embassy staff in London. Rex Tillerson is speaking now. He says the new US ambassador, Woody Johnson, arrived in London 18 days ago. It is a bit confusing having a Secretary Johnson and Ambassador Johnson, he says. But it means that, on any day, a Johnson will be to blame for something, he jokes. He says Brexit presents “unique challenges to the British people”. But it has a steadfast ally in the US. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, is now holding a press conference with Rex Tillerson, the US secretary of state. Johnson starts by running through the topics the two men discussed, including Hurricane Irma, North Korea and Libya. This seems to be what everyone in Westminster wants to read - the prime minister’s Florence speech on Brexit. It’s a tweet from Political Pictures, an account belonging to a photographer who covers Downing Street. Unfortunately, about the only thing it tells us is that the speech, in current form, is long - almost 5,000 words. The Scottish government has confirmed that it hopes to get a “consensus” in the Scottish parliament on possible tax increases. Derek Mackay, the Scottish government finance secretary, used the term in a letter sent to opposition parties in the Scottish parliament about the review of tax options the Scottish government is conducting. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, unveiled the plan when she announced her programme for government earlier this month. She said she wanted the other parties to contribute ideas to a paper on tax options to be published before the draft 2018/19 budget comes out in November and she hinted the exercise would result in taxes going up to fund better public services. In his letter, Mackay says he hopes some sort of agreement will emerge. This is the start of a cross-party discussion around how we continue to fund high quality public services across Scotland, and I want to ensure that proposals from all parties are represented ... The paper will set out the current distribution of income tax liabilities in Scotland, analyse a variety of policy options, explain the interaction between tax policy and the fiscal framework, consider the trade-offs involved in making any proposed changes, any interactions with HMRC and the DWP and provide international comparisons. It is the Scottish government’s intention that the paper will inform discussions on taxation ahead of this year’s budget and may enable a consensus position to emerge. The Scottish parliament’s power to vary tax rates was initially somewhat constrained. It got new powers under the Scotland Act 2016, but the SNP government has been reluctant to diverge much from tax policy for the rest of the UK. Tax policy only started to differ in April this year, when the Scottish government froze the higher-rate income tax threshold while it was being uprated elsewhere. This resulted in Scottish higher-rate tax payers paying up to £180 a year more. But in the Scottish elections in 2016 Scottish Labour and the Scottish Liberal Democrats both proposed increasing income tax by 1p. The SNP seems to be hoping that if some of the opposition parties in the parliament unite around a consensus tax plan, that might minimise any electoral penalty for getting taxpayers to pay more. Here is the statement that Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, has issued about the new school funding formula announced by the government this afternoon. Rayner said: Today’s announcement on the national funding formula follows years of pressure from the Labour party as well as schools, teachers and parents across the country, forcing the government to abandon millions of pounds in outright cuts to schools. However, it does not go nearly far enough to meet the Tories’ own election promises and is far less than Labour pledged in our manifesto. For many pupils and schools, funding will fall in real terms between now and 2020, which comes on top of a £2.7bn in real term cuts since 2015. There is no new money for education at all, and this funding for schools is coming from other cuts to education budgets. Only months ago, ministers guaranteed that the healthy pupils fund would be protected – now it is being cut by over 75%, and the Education Secretary can’t even tell us where else the axe will fall. The next Labour government will give our schools the resources they need, reversing funding cuts and increasing the schools budget in real terms, as we build a national education service that allows every child to fulfil their potential. Alex Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, is going to host his own Sunday afternoon radio show on LBC, the channel has announced. It will start this weekend and go out every Sunday from 3pm to 6pm. LBC said Salmond had “already proven himself as a popular broadcaster and re-joins LBC, the home of political debate, following the success of The Alex Salmond Phone-in which aired during Iain Dale’s show in 2016.” It is not just in professions like nursing, teaching and the police where the public sector pay squeeze is creating problems, MPs were told this morning. In evidence to the Commons justice committee, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, the lord chief justice, said the pay squeeze was causing problems for the judiciary too. Referring to judicial pay, pensions, and terms and conditions, Thomas said: “There is no doubt there is a problem.” Asked what risk there would be to the quality of the judiciary if action was not taken in these areas, he replied: There is a really serious risk. We are short of High Court judges. At the High Court bench we still have a serious, serious recruitment problem. One thing we can’t do is compromise on quality. And I think the [senior salaries review body], I’m pretty certain, fully understands the problem, and I hope will be able to find a solution to address it. But there is a serious problem at the level of the High Court. It is clear that the administrative court is being slightly affected by a shortage of High Court judges. Officials from HM Revenue and Customs were giving evidence to the Commons Treasury committee this morning. They told MPs that a crude estimate suggested they might need between 3,000 and 5,000 more staff after Brexit. Jim Harra, HMRC’s director general of customer strategy, said the organisation would have to deal with an additional 130,000 new companies after Brexit that import and export within the EU but do not currently come into contact with British customs. He told MPs: It is based on a crude extrapolation. If your customs declarations are multiplied five fold, if you multiplied your resources five fold, what would that come out at. It would come out at an extra three to 5,000 people. Do we believe that is what we really need? No, I don’t think we do, because we know that even if the number of declarations grow a large number of those will be made by existing international traders whose compliance we already manage. On the other hand there are probably about 130,000 new businesses that will be dealing with customs for the first time and there is a big challenge in reaching them, supporting them and getting them to be able to comply with their obligations on a transitional basis as well as on an ongoing basis. John Bercow, the Commons speaker, has issue a public warning to the Conservatives, saying it would be “very worrying” if, as has been reported, they start routinely ignoring the results of Commons votes staged by Labour. (See 1.32pm.) James Murdoch has issued a stark warning to the government not to turn its back on 21st Century Fox’s bid for Sky as the UK prepares to leave the European Union, claiming Brexit makes it more important than ever that the country attracts investment. Justine Greening, the education secretary, has published details of a new school funding formula for England. She claimed the new national funding formula (NFF) amountd to “the biggest improvement to the school funding system for decades” and that it would ensure “that for the first time funding is based on the individual needs and characteristics of every school in the country”. The proposals were condemned by the National Education Union, the new union formed by the merger of the ATL and the NUT. Kevin Courtney, the NEU’s joint general secretary, said: Justine Greening has failed schools, pupils and parents in her announcement today. The government has been promising ‘fairer funding’ for years but has instead been cutting schools’ funding per pupil in real terms. This has resulted in larger class sizes, a reduced curriculum, fewer teachers, resources and materials. This clearly is detrimental to children and young people’s education. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative backbencher, has said the existence of food banks is “uplifting” because it shows “what a good, compassionate country we are”. Ministers have been accused of “tinkering with the technicalities” in a bid to fix the UK’s housing crisis after they unveiled new plans to assess demand. As the Press Association reports, the communities Secretary Sajid Javid said the plans would provide a “proper understanding” of exactly how many homes are needed and where they should be built. In a Commons statement he added the existing system is an “opaque mishmash” of figures, telling MPs the government has developed an “honest, open, consistent” approach to assessing housing need. But the approach drew criticism from Labour, with shadow housing secretary John Healey telling the Commons: “The country has a housing crisis and ministers are tinkering with the technicalities of the planning system.” The Bank of England left interest rates on hold at their record low of 0.25% amid sluggish pay growth and a squeeze on household spending, while hinting that a rise may come sooner than expected. John Lewis has said rising prices and weaker consumer demand prompted by Brexit will continue to hit the business in the remainder of the year, as it revealed profits had more than halved in the first six months. Labour is examining its legal options to challenge the government’s decision to raise the student tuition fees cap, after ministers refused to allow a parliamentary vote. The Commons Brexit committee has announced that its first inquiry of this parliament will be into the progress of the Brexit negotiations. Hilary Benn, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said: The Brexit negotiations are the most complex our country has ever faced. They are dealing with fundamental questions about the future of our economy and our country. What will our trading relationship with the EU be? Will we still have access to the single market and the skills and labour we need for economic growth? To what extent will we still co-operate on policing, security and the fight against terrorism and on science, research and the safety of new medicines? Our first inquiry in this new parliament will scrutinise the progress of these negotiations and the position of the UK government and our negotiating partners in the EU. Mervyn King, the former governor of the Bank of England, has said the Brexit talks are not going “in the way we might hope”. (See 9.03am.) The number of people arrested for terrorism-linked offences rose 68% to a record 379 in the 12 months to June, one of the most intense periods for terrorist attacks in recent history. Asked by Channel 4 News’s Michael Crick if he would be disappointed if Tory MPs routinely stop voting in opposition days debates, Bercow says it would be a matter of concern if that were to happen. But he repeats his point about Andrea Leadsom denying this in the Commons earlier. (See 1.32pm.) He says, as a matter of courtesy, he wants t hear what the government has to say before commenting further. Bercow says MPs should treat each other with respect. Referring to what George Osborne reportedly said about Theresa May, he says the comments reported in today’s papers were “quite extraordinary”. Bercow condemns what Osborne reportedly said about wanting Theresa May “chopped up in bags” in his freezer. Bercow says he would like to have a “yellow card” system that would enable him to throw out rowdy MPs during PMQs. He says when he became speaker he hoped he would be able to improve behaviour at PMQs. He says the speaker could suspend a sitting. But that would be written up as the speaker losing control of the chamber. He says behaviour will only improve if one of two things happen. First, the whips offices could order their MPs to stop catcalling. That has not happened. That must be because the whips want MPs to create a wall of noise, he says. Second, giving the speaker the power to remove people would make a difference, he says. He says that when he became speaker he decided to chair the session when the youth parliament came to the Commons. A veteran MP complained to him, saying they would behave badly. Bercow says he told the MP they would behave better than MPs. And they did. Bercow says it is “frankly, patently absurd” that the House of Lords is significantly larger than the House of Commons. The Commons is the elected chamber, he says. There is a good case for having a second chamber that can ask the Commons to think again. But should it consist of 800 plus members? Absolutely not. It could most definitely be halved in size and I think most fair-minded people would say that it should be. There are 650 MPs, and currently 798 members of the House of Lords. Bercow has taken a swipe at the Daily Mail. This is what he said about his support for LGBT causes. It is not an accident, as you know, that I have in my coat of arms the rainbow symbol, the equality symbol, and the pink triangle. I’m a straight ally of the LGBT cause and I’m not embarrassed about that. The fact that it upset the Daily Mail is obviously an additional gain. Bercow says it would be “a good thing” if PMQs were to last an hour. Bercow says he would like to see PMQs last an hour. He says he asked David Cameron about returning to having PMQs twice a week. Cameron had been opposed to Tony Blair twice-weekly PMQs with weekly PMQs in 1997, Bercow says. But he says Cameron told him that he was opposed to returning to having it twice a week. That was because he would have to devote two days to PMQs planning. He says he does allow PMQs to over-run. Partly that is because he is giving “extra time” to allow for the fact the PM uses the occasion to make announcements. He says, to his credit, Cameron rarely complained about Bercow letting PMQs over-run. And Theresa May has never complained about it, he says. Asked about the Tory decision not to vote in yesterday’s opposition day debates, Bercow says he cannot recall a recent example of this happening. He says opposition day debates can be effective even without votes. As for the Tory proposals, he says Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, told MPs this morning not to believe everything they have read about the government’s plans. (See 11.59am and 12.42pm.) He says it might be best for him to talk to the government about this issue, rather than discuss it further in public. Motions can produce orders or resolutions or sometimes both, he says. An order is something that allows the Commons to direct for something to happen. But lots of votes in parliament are expression of opinion, and not necessarily binding, he says. We are in difficult terrain, he says. He should be cautious commenting on this, he says. But he goes on: Parliamentary votes do matter and I think it would be a very worrying development if they were to be treated lightly or disregarded. Bercow issued a warning to the Tories, saying it would be ‘very worrying’ if they ignore Commons votes. He said he did not want to comment directly on reports that the Tory MPs will be told not to vote in opposition day debates in future. He said Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, had told MPs not to believe these reports, and he said he would be taking this up with the government in private. But he also said that, if the government were to routinely ignore how the Commons votes on opposition day motions, that would be “very worrying”. Asked if referendums are compatible with parliamentary democracy, Bercow says they are not incompatible. It helps if the rationale for a referendum is clear. He says he thinks he is on the record as saying, at some point in the past, that there was a case for an EU referendum. At the time all the main parties backed EU membership. But a substantial number of voters were not in favour. He says he will leave it to others to judge whether that was the reason for the referendum, or whether it to was held for party political management reasons, to stop one party being crowded out by another. He says the former provide a good reason for a referendum; holding one for the latter reason would be less reasonable, he says. Bercow suggests David Cameron may have called the EU referendum for party political reasons, to protect the Conservatives from the Ukip challenge. He says generally he does not favour referendums. And he defends David Cameron’s decision to stand down afterwards. Cameron was decisive, he says. Bercow says he had three objectives when he became speaker; to increase scrutiny and backbench representation; to modernise the Commons and make it more family friendly; and to serve as an ambassador for parliament. John Bercow, the Commons speaker, is taking part at an event at the Institute for Government. He is being interviewed by Bronwen Maddox, the IfG’s director. You can watch a live stream here. Andrea Leadsom faced more questions about the Tories’ proposed new “no show” approach to voting in opposition day debates. (See 11.59am.) In response to question from a Conservative, she said that while the government would always engage in debates, “we won’t always take part in the political point scoring that was the objective of [Labour’s] particular subjects yesterday.” That prompted the Labour MP Diana Johnson to say she did not know how Leadsom could give that answer with “a straight face” given that some think political point scoring is the whole point of a debate in the House of Commons. Then the Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft asked if it was true, as HuffPost UK’s Paul Waugh said in a tweet yesterday, that Tory MPs have been told not to vote in future opposition day debates. Leadsom replied: Well, I certainly think we should consider changing standing orders to suggest to honourable members that they don’t take their facts from Twitter. The honourable lady’s information is from Twitter. So it is by definition not government policy and not therefore to be relied upon. Leadsom’s argument that, if it’s on Twitter it can’t be government policy, is a bit odd because only this morning she used her own Twitter feed to make a government announcement. She also regularly uses her MP’s twitter feed to post images and videos defending the Conservative party’s record. In the light of Jacob Rees-Mogg’s comments about food banks, ScottishPanda has posted BTL links to two briefing papers that challenge his claim that more people are using food banks because they are getting more publicity. This is from a Trussell Trust briefing on 11 food bank myths. 9) Foodbank figures have only increased because more and more foodbanks are opening This is not wholly true. The rate of new foodbanks opening has dropped significantly within the past year, and now stands at roughly two a month, but numbers helped have continued to increase: in 2014/15 the total numbers of foodbanks launched rose by five percent, whilst numbers of people helped by foodbanks rose by 19%. And this is from a House of Commons briefing paper on food banks and food poverty from 2014. A variety of factors may have contributed to the growth in food bank usage. High global food prices have made food proportionately less affordable for low-income households in the UK whilst the recession saw unemployment increase significantly and earnings stagnate or decline. A number of significant changes to the benefits system have also been made including: the abolition of the Social Fund and the introduction of local welfare provision, the reassessment of incapacity benefit claimants, measures to control Housing Benefit expenditure and the introduction of a new benefits “conditionality and sanctions” regime. Many speculate that such welfare reforms are having the biggest impact on the growth of food banks but the Government maintains that there is “no robust evidence” to link the two. Since September 2011, Jobcentre Plus has “signposted” people to food banks, but the Government does not officially track food bank usage. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs commissioned research in March 2013 to review evidence on the UK’s food provision and access. The resultant report (February 2014) highlighted that there is limited information on UK food aid provision and the reasons for it. Yesterday, after the Conservatives decided to abstain in two votes on Labour motions because they knew that without DUP support they would lose, Tory sources let it be known that they intended to use this tactic in future opposition day debates. Tory MPs will be encouraged not to take part in any votes, effectively rendering any divisions pointless. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, is taking business questions now and opposition MPs have been complaining bitterly about what this means for the House of Commons. Valerie Vaz, the shadow leader of the Commons, said the Tory approach was “jaw dropping”. She said that, after the Labour motions yesterday rejecting the recent tuition fee increase and calling for NHS staff to get a pay rise were passed unanimously, students and nurses had a legitimate expectation that these things would happen. Commenting on the new Tory strategy, she said: “It makes parliament look ridiculous”. Pete Wishart, the SNP parliamentary business spokesman, was even more critical. He accused the Tories of behaving like “a dysfunctional tinpot dictatorship”. He told MPs: Mr Speaker, this has been an absolute stinker of a week for the democratic arrangements of this House. First the repeal bill with the grotesque Henry VIII powers. Then the manipulation of standing committees of this House to the government’s favour. And now the degrading of opposition day debates to little more than adjournment debates. This government is behaving little better than a dysfunctional tinpot dictatorship, and it is doing it so ineptly they’ll probably end up oppressing themselves. This is a government that singularly fails to accepts its minority status and delusionally asserts that it has a majority even when their £1bn friend desert them. Leadsom brushed aside the criticism. She said the government took the issues raised in the opposition debates yesterday “incredibly seriously”. And she said the government intended to continue fully engaging with opposition day debates. (That may be partly true. There was never any suggestion that the Tories would not put up ministers and MPs to speak in the debates. The plan is just to stop these debates concluding with meaningful votes.) Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative backbencher and, according to at least one survey, Tory members’ preferred next party leader, took part in an LBC phone-in earlier. He was on characteristic form. Here are the main points. Rees-Mogg said the existence of food banks was “uplifting” because it showed how charitable people were. Asked about the huge increase in food banks in recent years, he said: To have charitable support given by people voluntarily to support their fellow-citizens I think is rather uplifting and shows what a good, compassionate country we are. Inevitably, the state can’t do everything, so I think that there is good within food banks. The real reason for the rise in numbers is that people know that they are there and Labour deliberately didn’t tell them. He said that George Osborne was becoming like Edward Heath, a figure consumed by “bitterness and bile”. It was sad to witness, he said. Asked about the revelation that Osborne has reportedly told colleagues at the Evening Standard that he willl not rest until Theresa May was “chopped up in bags in my freezer”, Rees-Mogg said: The sadness of George Osborne is that he is a formidably able man. He served with distinction as chancellor of the exchequer, and he has decided since leaving parliament to emulate a rather less successful Edward Heath. I think this type of bitterness and bile ends up making the person who has that bitterness and bile feel resentful and sad, and it has no effect on broader politics. His firepower diminishes with every bitter outburst. And for so able a man that is something we should be sad about, rather than particularly condemn. Rees-Mogg said the UK could leave the EU without having to pay anything. If we leave under article 50 without a deal, under UK, EU and international law, we owe no money at all. Not a brass farthing. And there was an excellent House of Lords report in March this year that went through the whole legal situation with great clarity, and nobody has disputed it. He said that “no one serious” thought he was a credible candidate for the Conservative leadership. He also said that he had “no wish” to become party leader, and that he was fully supporting Theresa May. He dismissed the prospect of May offering him a cabinet job. Asked about this, he replied: “That’s not going to happen.” He also said that when the idea was put to May in a recent interview, “she laughed for the longest amount of time she has laughed since the general election.” He said he supported the actions of the parents whose child has been going to a primary school on the Isle of Wight dressed sometimes as a boy and sometimes as a girl. As it happens, I think that is a choice for the parents, and the school should be as accommodating as possible. Asked if he would be bothered if this happened at his children’s school, he replied: I doubt I would notice, to be perfectly honest ... But if I’m just dropping the children off at school - I don’t do the school run often, it’s normally done by my wife or nanny - it wouldn’t bother me. It’s a matter for the boy’s parents or the girl’s parents. He said he would be happy to eat chlorine-washed chicken. He had been to the US many times and eaten chlorine-washed chicken there. And he had looked into a New Zealand report into this issue which concluded there had been no negative health effects from chlorine-washed chicken for consumers. He went on: The US is the most litigious society in the world. If chlorine-washed chicken was dangerous, there would have been $1bn lawsuits going on. US regulations are very high. And I quite like the idea of germs on chickens being killed. I think that’s broadly a good idea. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, is asking broadcasters in the capital to provide regular information about air quality in their reports. Bus countdown signs already provide alerts when there are high levels of pollution in the air, but Khan wants to do more to raise awareness of the problems. In a statement he said: London’s filthy air poses a significant threat to our health including harming the development of children’s lungs, and I’m committed to tackling this issue so Londoners can breathe the clean air they deserve. Broadcasters are already doing excellent work covering the threat to public health posed by the capital’s filthy air and I’m asking them to go even further and help empower Londoners to reduce their exposure to harmful pollution. They can do this by providing regular daily air quality information as part of their weather broadcasts. I hope that the growing number of weather apps that many Londoners now use will also follow suit and provide air quality information. The Labour MP Barry Sheerman has accused the new Today programme editor, Sarah Sands, of “destroying” the programme. Speaking during culture questions in the Commons, he also took at swipe at Nick Robinson, the former BBC political editor who is now one of the programme’s presenters. Sheerman said: Mr Speaker, I love the BBC, even when Sarah Sands, the new editor of the Today programme, and Nick Robinson seem to be destroying that programme at the moment. But Matt Hancock, the culture minister, leapt to their defence. He replied: As for the Today programme, I thought that Nick Robinson’s broadcasts from Silicon Valley yesterday were superb. It was all about the interesting changes that are going on in the world and in the economy through AI and digital. And I thought it was another excellent direction for the BBC [to be going in.] (As a devoted Today programme listener, I find Sheerman’s verdict a bit harsh. Since Sands took over as editor, the programme is certainly featuring a lot more arts, culture and lifestyle, and probably less politics, which does not always suit me but might make the programme more appealing to others. For example, one of those Sands-style interviews generated the line yesterday that the original Charlie in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was black. And, in my book, Robinson is one of the most forensic and interesting interviewers on the BBC.) Two alternative business views of Brexit were heard on the Today programme this morning. Sir James Dyson, the inventor who backed the Leave campaign, said that not enough progress had been made on Brexit talks but said Britain had put forward “positive suggestions” that had “not been reciprocated” by the EU. He said he thought the UK would end up leaving the EU without a deal. But Brexit still offered an opportunity, he said. I suspect that we will have to leave without a deal and we will trade under WTO regulations, which frankly, are going to hurt the Europeans more than the British. Business is about uncertainty and I think uncertainty is an opportunity and the opportunity here is that the rest of the world is growing at a far greater rate than Europe. But Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, said Brexit had hit business confidence. He said: We should be under no illusions, Brexit is having an effect on the economy, no question. The main effects are sterling and confidence. Uncertainty is one of the consequences of this. Businesses never like uncertainty because it makes it hard to plan for the future. I think we need to do justice to that uncertainty and there needs to be a serious parliamentary debate to figure out what kind of Brexit we are going to have in the best interests of the country and the economy. Yesterday Downing Street released an online video arguing that planning for Brexit was going well. But Mervyn King, the former governor of the Bank of England, isn’t convinced. In an interview on BBC’s Newsnight last night, he argued that the Brexit talks were not going well and that the government should be doing more to show that it could cope if the UK has to leave the EU without a deal. He told the programme: If you’re going to enter a negotiation, it’s actually very important to make sure that the other side of the table knows that you have a fallback position that you’re capable of delivering. That requires you to make clear publicly what the fallback position is. We’ve been waiting for over a year now and I must say that I’m not terribly impressed by how much of that fallback position has actually been stated, been implemented, and whether it’s actually being managed properly within the civil service and the government. I don’t think this is a statement about the potential impact of Brexit but I don’t think that the negotiations are going in the way that we might hope. And I think that you need a separate team who are responsible for ensuring that if the negotiations do break down in some way, and we cannot control that, that depends on the other side. We have no influence over that. Then what we are capable of doing is saying, well if you don’t want an agreement then we are capable of leaving and trading with you, for example under World Trade Organisation terms. It’s not our first preference but we can do it, and we need a team of people who are capable of delivering that. Many leading economists and business figures are critical of Brexit. But King’s comments are significant not just because he used to head the Bank of England, but because he is unusual among establishment economists in being well relatively pro-Brexit. He has not revealed how he voted in the referendum, but before it took place he suggested he could vote leave. And after the vote he said, although Brexit would create “great political difficulties”, it also offered “many opportunities”. Here is the agenda for the day. 8.30am: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the backbencher and Tory grassroots favourite, takes part in an LBC phone-in. 9.45am: G4S gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee about abuse claims at Brook House immigration removal centre. 10.30am: The Grenfell Tower public inquiry opens with a statement from the chairman, Sir Martin Moore Bick. 10.45am: Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, the lord chief justice, gives evidence to the Commons justice committee. Around 11.30am: MPs begin a debate on the intimidation of candidates during the election. 12pm: Prof Carl Baudenbacher, chairman of the European Free Trade Association court, gives a briefing at Chatham House. 1pm: John Bercow, the Commons speaker, speaks at an Institute for Government event. 2.40pm: The committee on standards in public life takes evidence as part of its inquiry into the intimidation of election candidates. Some witnesses will give evidence on security issues in private, and then, at 3.30pm, Sir Patrick McLoughlin, the Conservative party chairman, Cat Smith, the shadow minister for voter engagement, and Lady Brinton, the Lib Dem president, give evidence in public. 4.45pm: Boris Johnson holds a press conference with the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here.

James Ward, who was given a sentence of imprisonment for public protection (IPP) with a minimum of 10 months to be served for arson in 2006, will be released within weeks, according to his family. They told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the Parole Board had agreed to his release once suitable accommodation and care support was found. They have previously said Ward, whose parole hearings had repeatedly been delayed, had been “left to rot”. He was said to have lost a significant amount of weight in prison and to have self-harmed, meaning he would need care upon his release. Ward’s sister, April Ward, told Today that his solicitor had told the family about the decision, but James might not yet know. “So, it’s very exciting.” She said she felt overwhelmed by the news. “I cannot explain the relief of the decision. It’s overwhelming with all emotions; quite bittersweet this morning.” April Ward said she was confident her brother would get the mental health care he needed upon his release. She said: “We, as a family, will make sure that James’s release is successful; [that] the self-harm he gets help with. It’s very bittersweet that it’s taken 10 years for a Parole Board to finally see what we’ve been shouting for over 10 years: that James is not a risk to the public. “The decision of the Parole Board isn’t down to a course or any difference in James’ behaviour, it’s down to the fact that – finally – they’ve seen that James is not a risk to the public.” A spokesman for the Parole Board said: “We can confirm that a three-member panel of the Parole Board has directed the release of James Ward following an oral hearing on 4 September 2017. The Parole Board is unable to comment on the specifics of individual cases.”. Its chair has previously told the government to “get a grip” on the issue of prisoners serving indeterminate sentences and IPPs, which were given to prisoners judged to be a risk to the public and were abolished for sentences passed after December 2012. Thousands of people in England and Wales remain in jail on them, with no release date. Nick Hardwick, the chair of the Parole Board and a former chief inspector of prisons, has previously said: “The levels of suicide, assault, and self-harm [in prison] is unacceptably high. It’s the fault of political and policy decisions that should have been put right two years ago.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/15/jacinda-ardern-new-zealand-election-campaign","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T20:00:52Z","webTitle":"'I've got what it takes': Jacinda Ardern interview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/15/jacinda-ardern-new-zealand-election-campaign","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/15/jacinda-ardern-new-zealand-election-campaign","fields":{"headline":"'I've got what it takes': Jacinda Ardern interview","bodyText":"It is a week before the New Zealand election and the Labour leader, Jacinda Ardern, is raising her voice above the cacophony at the Tahunanui community centre in the coastal town of Nelson where a crowd has come to meet the 37-year-old woman hailed as the latest saviour of the left. Just weeks ago her prominence on the general election campaign trail was unthinkable. Ardern, then deputy leader, had declared that every colleague would have to be hit by a bus before she would step up as the “designated survivor”. Yet here she is, following the surprise resignation of her predecessor and Ardern’s swift promotion, promising to end child poverty to a roomful of women who, along with young people, are her greatest champions. “I thought it was an awesome opportunity to come down and see a fabulous, vibrant young leader,” says Kerry Cooper, who spends her evenings phoning everyone she knows to talk them into voting for Ardern. “I thought it was an opportunity to see history in the making.” Empathy and approachability are Ardern’s stock-in-trade and they are on full display as she campaigns along the working-class west coast of the South Island, encouraging juvenile offenders to pursue their plan A and laughing with locals at the Blackball Hilton pub, where everyone wants to buy her a whisky. Her famous smile dropped as she spoke with the bereaved families of the Pike River miners. But it was back the next day for a rally of 400 in Greymouth. It is an impressive performance from a politician who said for years that she was not interested in leading the Labour party, let alone the country. She has given multiple reasons, including a desire to have a family; a concern that her anxiety would preclude her from the top job, the condition having “ballooned” during her time as deputy; and a wariness about the demands of the job, something she observed working for the then prime minister, Helen Clark, in 2005. But now her reticence has vanished, and when she talks – unwaveringly meeting your eye, her body bent forward in earnest concentration – a steely ambition is evident. Yes, she misses hanging out with her partner, Clarke Gayford, and their rescue cat, and renovating their Auckland home, but the former Mormon who once aspired to be a police officer has decided she wants the top job and is working relentlessly to claim it. “You can’t ask other people to believe you and vote for you if you don’t back yourself,” says Ardern, sitting in the Blackball pub, sipping water and swatting away a hovering media manager who keeps tapping his watch. “Every day is the proof point that I’ve got what it takes to do this. And I did believe that when I said yes [to be leader], I did believe that.” ‘For what I do, is the anxiety normal? Probably’ Ardern has frequently spoken of her anxiety. As recently as June, she said she was not cut out to be Labour leader: “When you’re a bit of an anxious person, and you constantly worry about things, there comes a point where certain jobs are just really bad for you.” So how is she managing now? “I am a thinker and I do muse over things a lot and am constantly assessing whether I am doing enough, or what I should be doing more of to make sure I am not letting anyone down,” Ardern tells the Guardian. She has stopped reading media coverage of herself, she says. “I set quite high expectations. So do a lot of people. For what I do, is the experience that I have [of anxiety] normal? Probably. Probably. “But as with every stage of this job that I’ve been in, I’ve simply thrown myself into it and every time just had the belief that I’ve got what it takes and just powered through, and that will take me right through to the top job.” It is hard to dismiss Ardern as “stardust”, as the incumbent prime minister and National party leader Bill English did. Her persona is that of a serious politician: intense, devoted and with “no personal life”. But her political nous is leavened by a generous dollop of uncultivated charm and humour. In New Zealand politics, this is a rare combination, and one that has spawned “the Jacinda effect” , which has seen Labour surge by 19 points in the polls since she took over. For the first time in nine years it seems possible that the opposition could unseat National. This is a woman whose favourite film is The Dark Horse, a gritty drama about a Maori chess player with bipolar disorder trying to escape gang life; an “acceptable nerd” whose bedside table is stacked with political biographies and whose interests include Antarctic explorers and do-it-yourself plumbing. She manages her own social media accounts – “That’s been quite important to me” – and told an audience in Nelson that her mother had slipped snacks and a note of encouragement in her bag that morning – something she hadn’t done since Ardern was 10. In Nelson, a man heckled Ardern for failing to answer the “real questions”, but she remained focused on the woman in front of her, clasping her hands and telling her that grandparents who are primary carers for their grandchildren would be treated as foster parents and receive financial aid under a Labour government. Ardern pulled the crying woman into a hug. “Thank you,” said the woman. “I believe you when you say you’ll help me. It’s been 15 years we’ve had them and we need help.” ‘I have to respect the people who chose Trump’ The election of Donald Trump and Britain’s vote to leave the EU, combined with the resurgence of the far right, has seen the global community lurch from one upheaval to another, creating a political climate of uncertainty Ardern sees evidence of in New Zealand. “What Brexit and the Trump outcome really said to me is, we do have a sense of financial insecurity that really exists in a number of countries, and politicians have the choice to either respond to that financial insecurity with messages of hope, and a plan around how we are going to, in the face of ongoing globalisation and automation, make sure that there is a future for our workforce and our young people; or we can respond to the fear that exists. “And I think that fear has legitimately come through in those elections, and that really was a message to me about what we need to be talking about to allay those fears.” On 21 January, the day after Trump’s inauguration, Ardern joined thousands in Auckland as part of the global women’s march. How would she reconcile her public opposition to Trump with dealing with him as the potential new prime minister? “I will be a diplomat,” says Ardern, with a broad smile. “Despite us coming from different parts of the political spectrum, that is not new for world leaders and I have to respect democracy and the people who’ve chosen their leader in the United States.” Labour’s former deputy leader Annette King first met Ardern when she was working for Tony Blair’s office in London in 2006 – a job Ardern says she took out of financial desperation, never meeting Blair in her time there. “Many of us recognised a long time ago she’s actually got the X factor,” says King. “She’s incredibly intelligent, compassionate and you can see how she can empathise with people in a way that I haven’t seen in a politician for a very long time.” ‘Prove them wrong every time’ Hours after being elected Labour leader, Ardern faced a barrage of questions about whether she intended to have children. She responded directly and clearly, calling the questions “unacceptable”. But, she tells the Guardian, she has grown used to sexism during her nine years in parliament, in which she was twice voted New Zealand’s sexiest politician and faced endless queries about the status of her womb, her diet, and how she feels about her body (for the record: she’s fine with it). “I definitely try not to get too caught up in putting too much of a gender or age assessment on everything – I’ve just got to get on with it,” says Ardern. “It is tricky. All I can say is the way I’ve always tried to handle it is just prove them wrong every time – and that means playing the long game sometimes.” It would be wrong to give the impression that Ardern is universally loved. Her critics say she is inexperienced and vague on policy details – a politician who appeals because of her youthful glamour. She has also faced criticism from across the political spectrum for plans to cut immigration by 20,000-30,000, arguing that record levels under the National government have put pressure on housing, hospitals and schools. But possibly her greatest asset – and the most serious threat to English’s campaign – is that people seem to trust her. “Jacinda has reached out and touched every age group and every community,” says Lorna Crane of Murchison, who travelled to the Blackball Hilton to meet Ardern. “Labor’s policies will reduce the inequity between the rich and the poor, and we know that these divisions are the same worldwide now: that the rich have got richer and the people on the ground have been struggling.” These are big demands for a leader, especially one who has had less than two months to prepare. But although it is her face plastered on billboards, nailed to fences beside Auckland motorways and hammered into muddy paddocks in Canterbury, “Jacindamania” has largely been ignored by Ardern herself; she insists she has her eye squarely on the prize. “Do it for all of us,” the UK Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, recently urged her, reflecting the hopes of Labour supporters inside and outside New Zealand. “I am certainly going to try to keep positive momentum for the progressive movements from around the world,” says Ardern, when asked if she has been passed the torch from Corbyn and Bernie Sanders. “But I can only be myself. I am never going to replicate any other leader. They’ve done amazing things in and of their own right, but I’m Jacinda Ardern, and I hope that I can bring it home this election.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/14/corporate-regulator-to-investigate-liberal-national-mp-stuart-roberts-businesses","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T08:18:00Z","webTitle":"Corporate regulator to look into Liberal National MP Stuart Robert's businesses","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/14/corporate-regulator-to-investigate-liberal-national-mp-stuart-roberts-businesses","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/14/corporate-regulator-to-investigate-liberal-national-mp-stuart-roberts-businesses","fields":{"headline":"Corporate regulator to look into Liberal National MP Stuart Robert's businesses","bodyText":"The business dealings of LNP MP Stuart Robert will now be the subject of inquiries from Australia’s corporate regulator. Australian Securities and Investments Commission commissioner John Price has told a parliamentary committee he will be looking into allegations that the 80-year-old father of LNP MP Stuart Robert was made a director, without his knowledge, of a private investment company that held shares in his son’s IT service business. It follows a report in Fairfax Media that Robert Snr was unaware that he and his wife had been registered as directors of Robert International Pty Ltd between 2010 and 2016. Robert International Pty Ltd owns shares in Robert’s IT service business GMT Group, which has won tens of millions of dollars in government contracts, according to Fairfax Media. Robert offloaded his shares in GMT Group and resigned his directorship in 2010, three years after being elected to parliament. Price told a parliamentary committee on Thursday he was aware of the allegations, and had concerns about them. “I think we’ll make some inquiries into that,” Price said. He admitted there was no ID requirement for someone to become a company director in Australia, and it was possible for someone to be signed up as a company director online, without their knowledge. It was a criminal offence under the Corporations Act to appoint somebody a company director without their consent, he said. “It can happen ... if it is happening it may indicate some misconduct,” Price said. “Asic has been indicating for some time that while it’s a matter for government, we think that the adoption of the director identification number would be something worthy of consideration.” Robert rejected Fairfax’s story on Thursday, telling parliament it was “a complete load of rubbish.” “Fairfax ... alleges that my father was not running our family company when the directors changed; that I was, even though the trust wasn’t doing very much,” he said. “I will seek to table the copies sourced from our chartered accountant of annual trust resolutions signed by the directors, my parents, for multiple years during this period. “My father is a sophisticated investor and even today runs a very successful business. Fairfax names him at 80 years of age, of which his age is irrelevant, unless Fairfax is trying to make an ageist point about competence. “All of this is based on a single call last night by a Fairfax journalist asking opaque questions to my father who is currently caring for mum, who was just discharged from hospital after her second heart attack.” In 2016, Robert was part of a group of Coalition MPs, including Tony Abbott and Ian Macfarlane, who faced heavy scrutiny for accepting designer watches worth over $250,000 from a visiting billionaire from China, which they were assumed were fakes. Robert also faced intense political pressure last year after it emerged he had travelled to Beijing in 2014 for “personal” purposes to celebrate a mining deal involving Nimrod Resources, an Australian mining company headed by major Liberal party donor Paul Marks. Robert, who was assistant defence minister the time of the trip, said he had attended the event “in a private capacity” but a media release issued by China Minmetals Corporation said Robert had extended his congratulations “on behalf of the Australian Department of Defence” and had presented “a medal bestowed to him by Australian prime minister in honour of remembrance and blessing”. Robert disputed the media release. The head of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Martin Parkinson, later investigated the trip, and during the course of his investigation Robert disclosed he had a shareholding in Metallum Holdings at the time, which had an interest in Nimrod Resources. Mark Dreyfus, Labor’s shadow attorney general, referred the matter to the federal police for investigation, but the AFP dropped the investigation in July last year. Robert retained his Queensland seat of Fadden at last year’s election on a large margin of 19,752 votes despite a 3.31% swing against him. On Thursday, Labor continued to pursue Nationals senator Barry O’Sullivan in question time over allegations he had a commercial interest in the Toowoomba second range crossing and two other projects. Section 44 of the constitution forbids MPs from holding an “office of profit under the Crown” through “any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with ... the commonwealth”. “I’ve not now nor have I ever had a contract or an interest in a contract with the public service of the commonwealth of Australia, either directly or indirectly,” O’Sullivan told the Senate. “Nor have I had a share in a company that has a share in another company, even through multiple structural relationships, where those [other companies] have had a contract with the public service of Australia.” Labor believes that because the Toowoomba second range crossing is funded by Queensland with some federal funds under a national partnership agreement with the commonwealth that O’Sullivan may have an indirect interest in that agreement which could render his eligibility subject to challenge."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/15/his-death-still-hurts-the-pfizer-anti-smoking-drug-ruled-to-have-contributed-to-suicide","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T00:21:39Z","webTitle":"'His death still hurts': the Pfizer anti-smoking drug ruled to have contributed to suicide","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/15/his-death-still-hurts-the-pfizer-anti-smoking-drug-ruled-to-have-contributed-to-suicide","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/15/his-death-still-hurts-the-pfizer-anti-smoking-drug-ruled-to-have-contributed-to-suicide","fields":{"headline":"'His death still hurts': the Pfizer anti-smoking drug ruled to have contributed to suicide","bodyText":"When the retired Queensland schoolteacher Phoebe Morwood-Oldham started an online petition following her son’s suicide in April 2013, she could not have known that her insistence on asking hard questions of one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies would lead to an Australian-first finding by a state coroner. On Thursday in Brisbane magistrates court, coroner John Hutton found that a commonly prescribed drug named Champix – manufactured by Pfizer and sold internationally under the name Chantix – contributed to the death of a 22-year-old Brisbane man, Timothy John, who died by suicide soon after he began taking a medication that he had hoped would cut his smoking habit from eight cigarettes a day down to zero. For Morwood-Oldham, the finding was a satisfying outcome for a lengthy process that began with a Change.org petition that she started four years ago, which asked for on-the-box warning labels on Champix packaging. It has been signed by 49,000 people. “His death still hurts so deep,” she wrote at the top of the petition. “After taking the anti-smoking drug marketed as ‘Champix’ for just 8 days, my beautiful boy hung himself. But despite reports of 25 suicides linked to Champix in seven years – there still aren’t proper side-effect warnings.” Every Sunday for four years Morwood-Oldham and her older son, Peter, have visited Timothy’s grave at Cleveland cemetery. The weekly routine involves the laying of lillies and turning their minds toward a young man who was, as his headstone says, “much wanted and loved”. Morwood-Oldham tells Guardian Australia that Timothy’s death “was so sudden” and it affected her deeply. “I lost the person I love the most in the world, in eight days. I never expected it.” Talking about Timothy, Morwood-Oldham warns that her emotions are “all over the place”. He is never far from his mother’s mind, nor her gaze: when she opens her laptop to share some photographs, there he is, her screensaver. A cute, blond boy aged six, aiming a cheeky smile at the lens. Timothy had suffered mental health issues, something his mother speaks of in terms of grades out of 10. He had for a time been a 4/10, then, after cognitive behaviour therapy, he was back to 9/10. “How did he go from a 9/10 to a 1/10 in eight days on Champix?” she said. “The autopsy showed there were no alcohol or drugs in his system other than Champix and Ibuprofen.” The inquest heard that, on a drive back from the Gold Coast just hours before his death, Timothy asked, “Mum, do you think I should give up the Champix? It’s making me feel strange.” Morwood-Oldham told the original two-day inquest in November last year: “I said to him, ‘Timothy, if it’s helping you to give up smoking maybe you keep it up’.” She had not been part of the consultations with her son’s GP when he was prescribed the drug and the Champix packaging did not contain warnings for any potential adverse effects. The night before, his behaviour had been disturbing. Morwood-Oldham found Timothy sitting on the floor with an electric chainsaw plugged in, talking about people coming to get him. She stayed with him all night and made sure he was safe. But the next day he left a taped message on a voice recorder for his mother on the kitchen bench: Mum, I love you with all my heart. Peter, you’re the best brother I could ask for. I know it doesn’t make sense right now but it’s for the best, trust me. I’m losing my mind. I’m going crazy. I love you both. According to Morwood-Oldham, he had never expressed suicide ideation before. Now Hutton’s findings are a kind of vindication. “I find that Champix contributed to Timothy’s death,” the coroner said. “However, I am unable to determine the level of contribution that Champix had on Timothy’s death due to his pre-existing mental health condition.” In addition, the coroner found that “certain aspects of the product labelling and instructions provided with Champix are inadequate and some improvements can be made”. Hutton noted that the drug “does in fact increase the risk of suicide in patients such as Timothy, with a history of a psychiatric disorder, compared to people attempting to quit smoking without a medical aid”. Accordingly, the coroner stated that “it is therefore important to closely monitor people with a history of psychiatric disorders, such as Timothy, whilst they are taking Champix”. In the US, Pfizer made out-of-court settlements to 2,700 complainants totalling US$273m after a 2013 class action that claimed the drug Chantix raised the risk of suicide. In 2014, there was a strengthening of the “black box” warning on the drug packaging alerting users to serious side effects, which the FDA has since removed. In Australia, Champix was approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration as “an aid to smoking cessation in adults over the age of 18 years” on 15 February 2007. Data provided by the TGA to Guardian Australia show that 1,717,066 prescriptions for Champix were dispensed nationwide in the five years between 2011-2012 and 2015-16. The drug has been listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme since 1 January 2008. Up to May 2010, according to the TGA, there were reports of 206 suicide-related events in people taking varenicline – the chemical name for the drug, which assists with smoking cessation by blocking nicotine receptors in the brain, reducing cravings and decreasing the pleasurable effects of tobacco products. There are no external or internal warnings on the packaging in Australia. When Hutton asked Pfizer’s legal counsel why there was no consumer medicine information leaflet included with in the packaging, he was told: “It’s to ensure the currency of the document, your honour. It’s available in electronic form.” The coroner interrupted: “When I get my drugs I don’t go to the computer and start looking up the drugs. I rely on the manufacturer to put the updated version of the warnings in the box.” It was only after her son’s death that Morwood-Oldham went to her pharmacist and asked for a print-out of the consumer medicine information relating to Champix. The most recent version of this document, updated by Pfizer in March 2017, notes that “Your family and friends should be asked to monitor any changes in your behaviour, thinking or mood that are not typical for you e.g. if you develop suicidal thoughts or actions, anxiety, panic, aggression, anger, mania, abnormal sensations, hallucinations, paranoia or confusion. Discuss with your doctor the benefits and risks of taking Champix to decide if it is right for you.” Other state coroners have examined suicides where Champix was present, such as the Victorian state coroner finding that a 36 year-old Frankston man, Benjamin David Johnston, died by suicide in February 2015. In that case, the coroner found that “the evidence supports that his death was an adverse reaction to varenicline”. In May 2011, a Tasmanian coroner found it was “impossible to say” whether Champix was a direct causal link to the suicide of a father of three, “Mr P”, who died by a self-inflicted shotgun wound at his home in November 2009. At Timothy John’s inquest last year, two sets of parents of young men who had killed themselves while taking Champix attended, having travelled from WA for the hearing. None of these cases was subject to inquests. In a 24-page submission to the inquest dated 31 July 2017, and seen by Guardian Australia, the American pharmaceutical company gave a forthright, pre-emptive rejection of coroner Hutton’s findings. The document begins: “At the outset, it is submitted that a) there is a robust body of scientific evidence which demonstrates that the risk of neuropsychiatric adverse events with varenicline does not differ significantly when compared to placebo, and b) this body of scientific evidence outweighs likely coincidence in a single case.” In addition to asserting that “there is no reliable evidence to allow the coroner to reach such a conclusion” that Champix was a present factor in Timothy John’s death, Pfizer noted – in bold type – that “Mr John’s behaviour at and around the time of his tragic suicide was consistent with prior behaviours he had demonstrated and the prescription of Champix was merely coincidental”. In the same document, the deceased was described as “a very troubled young man with a lot of anger and interpersonal problems”. Page 15 of Pfizer’s submission to the coronial inquest referred to a statement from the TGA, which noted that 2.8 million prescriptions for the drug were filled nationwide between 2008 and 2014. A statement attributed to the Therapeutic Goods Administration within Pfizer’s submission read: “The TGA is of the view that there is currently insufficient evidence to date that provides a direct causal connection between Champix and serious neuropsychiatric adverse events and that there are a number of confounding factors which may have contributed to these adverse events.” When Guardian Australia queried the TGA as to whether it had made any statements or submissions in relation to the Timothy John inquest, a spokeswoman for the federal health department replied via email: “The TGA was not involved in any inquest and provided no public statements on this issue.” Currently, Victoria is the only state in Australia wherein toxicology screening for the presence of varenicline is undertaken in all suicides and suspected suicides. This recommendation was made by the Victorian state coroner, Jacqui Hawkins, in December 2015 as part of the findings into the death of Benjamin David Johnston. Now as a result of the Timothy John inquest, Hutton recommends that all state and territory forensic pathology services follow Victoria’s lead and routinely screen for the drug to create a national data set that “may assist in terms of a closer examination of the extent that varenicline can be linked to suicide in the future”. In its submission to the inquest dated 31 July 2017, the Champix manufacturer wrote: “Whilst Pfizer has no objection to such a course it points out that such data will only indicate varenicline as a present factor … Thus, undertaking testing for varenicline where there are other confounding factors may be of little if any value.” Outside the Brisbane magistrates court, moments after hearing the coroner’s findings, Morwood-Oldham’s mood was buoyant. “I never thought that would happen,” she said. “How are you going to fight a corporation that’s got so many resources? “My motivation is to save other people from going through what I’ve gone through. Nothing’s going to bring my son back. All I can do is try and help somebody else – and I’ve achieved it. I’m just so pleased.” • Readers seeking support and information about suicide prevention can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14. Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467.

You’ve checked your enrolment details, you’ve familiarised yourself with this weird thing called a postbox, been to the rallies, changed your avatar to a rainbow flag and share articles supporting marriage equality on your social media. Everyone you know supports marriage equality – even your parents! You’re going to vote yes. Of course you are! Who are these no voters anyway – apart from weird religious people that you hear being interviewed on the ABC in an effort to get a bit of balance. You’ve even made attempts to understand the no position – reading no opeds in the papers. But none are particularly compelling. You hate-share them on Twitter. It’s like the no people are scratching around for an argument, and the only thing they illuminate is their own prejudice. Welcome to my bubble – this is how I think, and according to a survey by the ABC it’s a view shared by many in the inner city. In fact their statistics on marriage equality show a very stark inner city v country and suburban divide. In Australia, with the gentrification of our inner urban areas, this divide also indicates a split between knowledge and culture workers in the inner city who tend to be progressive and left-leaning, and the conservative swathe of voters in the suburban and country areas. Spending time recently in a small Victorian country town I’ve observed that the bars and restaurants that attract cashed-up city people as well as local knowledge and culture workers, are festooned with rainbow flags and marriage equality posters. While the more working-class watering holes where the tradies drink don’t carry or fly the rainbow flag. There is a certain amount of campaign fatigue already. Which way do you vote when you’re outside the bubbles that keenly feel a personal and/or political stake in this issue? The DNA encoded in this divide between inner city and outer suburban presents a risk for the yes camp. That is that a group of rightwing, largely religious-inspired establishment figures in church and politics can find their way to persuading the larger “silent majority” and bring about a win for the conservatives. We’ve seen it before. Globally, in recent years this progressive class has experienced a pushback in its ideals and interests when it comes to the ballot box. Take Brexit. The vote to leave took many, in both the remain and leave camps, by surprise. Commentators trying to do a post-mortem on the situation, which of course means doing a post-mortem on Britain, framed the story as a fight between a global elite, many of whom reside in the capital, and those who lacked transportable skills, education and a certain type of swagger. Think of it as a battle between the readers of the Daily Mail and the Economist. Or as UK academic David Goodhart put it – the Somewheres (people who have a local, regional identity) and Everywheres (globalists, more likely to live in the capital). Then there was the US election – where the right accused Hillary Clinton of a liberal agenda with a focus on identity politics and rights. She was defeated not only by evangelical Christians but by a swathe of conservative voters in the rust belts – some of whom were economically struggling and felt left behind by progressive ideals. The reality is that a large portion of Donald Trump voters are actually economically well off. Guy Rundle, exploring the popular pushback against a progressive agenda, wrote in the Saturday Paper: “The progressive class has taken its formative values – radical openness, borderlessness, cosmopolitanism, ungroundedness – as unreflected upon virtues. They have marked any resistance to them as political evil … This class has rolled over the old Marxist delusion – that the working class are necessarily internationalist – into gender and race issues, and then dispensed with economic class altogether. Those outside the progressive class have held on for a decade or more waiting for real recognition of their demands. Denied it, a chunk of them broke off and voted Trump into power.” JD Vance, author of Hillbilly Elegy – a must-read book for anyone who wanted to peer outside their liberal bubble – wrote after Trump was elected: “The feeling that so many of America’s opinion leaders see your concerns as the product of stupidity at best, or racism at worst, confirms the worst fears of many. They already worry that the coastal elites don’t care about them, and many among those elites seem happy to comply.” Could this backlash against progressives happen with the marriage equality vote? And could the vote be perceived as a narrow identity politics issue that for many voters doesn’t speak to their anxieties about rising house and electricity prices, or a dwindling resources boom? There is no doubt that Tony Abbott and co want to cast themselves as anti-establishment figures who represent the silent majority, in the mould of such Men of the People as Trump and Nigel Farage. This silent majority they appeal to, according to the former opposition leader John Hewson are a “great mass of the electorate that are rarely polled accurately, rarely let their views known, yet determine electoral outcomes”. The conservative Australian pundit David Flint also believes in harnessing the potential of a silent majority. In 2013 in Give us Back our Country he argued that if you want conservative values to prevail in Australia, the winning strategy is direct democracy because he believed the silent majority are essentially socially and politically conservative. The only way that progressives would win, according to his thesis, is by controlling the power structures. We do live in an essentially a conservative country – where according to my colleague David Marr “change only comes with a great deal of pain”. This is a country where even when the ostensibly more progressive Labor party was in power and had the chance to bring in marriage equality, squandered the opportunity to satisfy the conservative trade unions. The politicians are scared, pensive and cautious of change. But what about the people? Are we ready now? It is wrong to assume the silent majority would really say no to marriage equality. In the Australian conservative mainstream there is a strong element of a fair go that travels beyond the usual progressive/conservative battlelines. This fair go translates as “as a heterosexual I can get married to my husband/wife – so why shouldn’t everyone?” The fairness argument is logical and very hard to counter. That’s why the most effective campaigning for marriage equality is persuading soft voters – heterosexual, instinctively conservative, perhaps slightly nervous – that a yes vote is a vote for them too. That it’s not for others leading lives they don’t lead but about healing pain and unfairness across society. A better, more generous, Australia where this issue just isn’t an issue any more."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/11/school-shoes-girls-boys-hobbling-life-chances-flimsy-sturdy-sexism-gender","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T09:23:59Z","webTitle":"Girls’ school shoes are hobbling their chances in life | Anna Kessel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/11/school-shoes-girls-boys-hobbling-life-chances-flimsy-sturdy-sexism-gender","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/11/school-shoes-girls-boys-hobbling-life-chances-flimsy-sturdy-sexism-gender","fields":{"headline":"Girls’ school shoes are hobbling their chances in life\r\n","bodyText":"Last week, like many parents, I walked into a shoe shop to buy my daughter some school shoes. Outside it was raining, and all I wanted was a nice, stylish, practical pair of shoes for my daughter to start the new school year. We went over to the girls’ section and, as usual, found 25 pairs of Mary Jane or ballet pump style shoes. Just five pairs of shoes on display actually covered the whole of a girl’s foot. Out on the street adult women wore shoes that protected their feet from the heavy rain, but on the school run little girls stomped along with half covered feet, grey tights darkening in the damp. Forget all the rowing about “gender neutral” and boys wearing dresses; whether you are ideologically invested in your daughters’ footwear and clothing or not (and by that I mean concerned by the evidence that shows overly gendered influences hold back girls in Stem subjects and beyond), surely we all just want our kids’ feet to be warm and dry? Think about it. Boys have sturdy shoes that cover their whole foot and are suitable for running, climbing and adventuring. Girls have Mary Janes that are suitable for … a party. (A party where you get soggy feet if it rains.) And this is the picture up and down the country. It’s insane. We’re pumping millions of pounds into trying to get girls active – the brilliant This Girl Can campaign cost £10m – and yet every damn day we’re sending them out in school shoes that they cannot be properly active in. And then we wonder why only one in 10 of all 14-year-old girls do the right amount of exercise to be healthy, or why 2 million fewer 14- to 40-year-old women than men play sport regularly. Sport England’s research that led to This Girl Can revealed that 75% of women want to be more active but that fear of judgment by others is the primary barrier holding them back from participating in sport. Where does this judgment come from? I think I know. Because I already see it rearing its ugly little head at my five-year-old daughter. She’s already being told that “football’s for boys” – she can see that in the shoe shop where the football motifs only appear in the boys’ section – and she’s well used to the colour coding and messaging telling her which toys/activities/careers/hobbies she should be interested in according to her sex. It is good to see retailers such as John Lewis and Clarks beginning to redress some of this in their labelling, but as long as the products themselves remain so gendered it’s all just decoration on a big old sexist cake. It’s no surprise how that translates in the playground – with girls rarely playing ball games at lunchtime – or PE lessons and after-school sports clubs, where coaches complain that boys won’t pass girls the ball, or girls are reluctant to attend. Education specialists describe school playgrounds being dominated by boys playing active games, while girls occupy the outer edges of the space, taking up less physical room. This at a developmental stage where boys and girls are still the same size. It’s the childhood precursor to “manspreading” and all that it symbolises. Of course discussing the gendered state of clothes and toys is seen as ideological brainwashing, loony leftism taken a step too far. But the reality is that toys and clothes in the 21st century are more gendered now than they were for my generation growing up in the early 1980s. In the Sears catalogue advertisements from 1975, for example, less than 2% of toys were explicitly marketed to either boys or girls. Why? It all comes down to profit. Why sell one box of Lego when you can sell two just by gendering the colours and themes on the box. In Jacques Peretti’s excellent BBC documentary The Men Who Made Us Spend (2014), he examined the way in which children are increasingly targeted by marketers as mini consumers – with the average British child seeing 10,000 TV adverts a year. Any parent who’s ever sat through just one ad break on a children’s channel will be able to tell you that it’s the most explicitly gendered thing you’ve ever seen – with boys and girls typically appearing separately, in a whirl of pink and high-pitched voices or blue with a backdrop of angry guitar music. Why does this matter? All the studies tell us that being physically active is good for our children, in particular for girls who frequently struggle with body image issues and self-confidence. Sport and exercise have the power to change our daughters’ lives – bringing enhanced career opportunities, biting back at the gender pay gap, and boosting their self esteem. Who wouldn’t want that for their kids? This morning my daughter told me that she doesn’t want to wear trousers to school any more because they’re “for boys”. Other parents often tell me the same thing. It was almost a century ago that women in this country won the battle to wear trousers. It is enormously troubling to think we might be raising a generation of children increasingly exposed to regressive ideas about gender, sold down the river for a bit of profit. • Anna Kessel is a sports writer for the Guardian and Observer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/13/top-10-contemporary-short-stories","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T11:57:46Z","webTitle":"Top 10 contemporary short stories","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/13/top-10-contemporary-short-stories","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/13/top-10-contemporary-short-stories","fields":{"headline":"Top 10 contemporary short stories","bodyText":"This summer, I read the entries for this year’s BBC National short story prize, and discussed with my fellow judges the vexed question of how the “best” might be identified. This was both a pleasure and a serious challenge: the form of the story is so capacious and diverse that at times we were comparing apples and pears, or at least looking at an unfamiliar fruit and arguing over whether to call it an apple or a pear. (Rest assured, though: the challenge is not impossible. An apple is always better than a pear.) You can assess our choices after the shortlist is announced this Friday evening on BBC Radio 4. All five finalists will then be broadcast on successive afternoons on BBC Radio 4 (and made available on iPlayer) starting on 18 September. But this challenge has been nothing against the request to choose stories to fit the title for this piece. Guardian, please! There are approximately 17m to choose from. Where do I even begin? Where are all the stories I haven’t read, or have loved and then unfaithfully forgotten? (I am a fickle and forgetful reader.) This list, then, is not hierarchical or canonical. My choices are, simply, 10 tales from this century that I have read and that I think do something interesting or startling or just downright swoony with the form of the short story. Clicking on the titles will lead you to the stories themselves, if you haven’t already read them. I look forward to having my reading horizons broadened in the comments. 1. Victory Lap by George Saunders Sorry to be so predictable, but I do love George Saunders. With this story, and the rest of the collection it comes from, Tenth of December, he was clearly taking his gifts for voice, character, and satire, and pushing himself to do something much harder and more humane. This story starts awkwardly, in tune with its two gangly teenage protagonists, and stutters through a lovely character study to suddenly burst into an action tale and an unlikely outbreak of heroism. It also offers a dazzling response to the writer’s dilemma of whether to move to a happy ending or a sad ending. On the last page, you can see Saunders looking at the options he has created for himself and simply opening his hands a little wider and saying, ‘Yes, we’ll have both of those.’ 2. Pee on Water by Rachel B Glaser This was my personal standout in the already very strong New American Stories, edited by Ben Marcus. I’m increasingly drawn to any story that has a more expansive sense of a story’s possibility than the “snapshot of life” model insisted upon by the Carver/Hemingway school. This story begins at the dawn of time and ends round about now, which is expansive enough for anyone, I feel. It also has beautiful sentences, and there are not enough of those in the world. 3. Then Later, His Ghost by Sarah Hall This does one of my favourite things in a story: something you weren’t expecting. It’s an apocalypse tale, of which we seem to have had many lately and for which I am quite the sucker, but it’s a whole other and new form of apocalypse, wherein a howling wind rips everything loose from the ground. A real feat of imagination, and all the more terrifying for being set in the made-newly-strange streets of my Norwich childhood. 4. Fjord of Killary by Kevin Barry Barry is great at drawing you quickly into the confidence of his voice; the first few sentences of any of his stories have that quality of strapping you in for the ride. “So I bought an old hotel on the fjord of Killary,” the narrator tells us at the outset of this one, and we can already hear the sigh in his voice. “It rained two hundred and eighty-seven days of the year, and the locals were given to magnificent mood swings.” We lean in, and listen on. 5. The News of her Death by Pettina Gappah Five women talking in a hair salon while one of them has her braids done: this is all the narrative structure Gappah needs to build a complex social landscape, telling these women’s stories through perfectly pitched dialogue and delicately measured details. The recurring refrain that “Kindness is late” is brilliantly deployed, and the whole story quietly makes the point that hair is always political. 6. Thank You by Alejandro Zambra, translated by Megan McDowell As is usually the case, I’ve only just started reading Zambra after years of being urged to do so. This story, of a robbery that starts off violent before fizzling out into a chat about football and a lift home, is told in a jarringly languorous and anecdotal tone, which both draws you in and leaves you uncomfortably dissonant. 7. The Green Zone Rabbit by Hassan Blasim, translated by Jonathan Wright This story, from The Iraqi Christ, published by the excellent Comma Press, is by turns terrifying and wonderfully banal. In Baghdad’s Green Zone, Hajjar keeps a rabbit while waiting to be briefed on an operation. The rabbit lays an egg. Things get stranger and darker, and Blasim lays his tale out with a wonderfully dry bar-room simplicity that makes the ending all the more explosive. 8. Track by Nicole Flattery This recently won the White Review short story prize, and it’s not hard to see why. Written in a misleadingly offhand deadpan, Track covers seemingly familiar ground – an abusive relationship, a young woman adrift in the big city, the pitfalls of fame and money – at such an oblique angle that it demands repeated reading. It’s also very funny, and very sad. 9. Finishing Touch by Claire-Louise Bennett I could have chosen any of the stories from Bennett’s debut collection, Pond – and in fact I would urge you to read the collection as a whole, its sum being, unusually, greater than the parts. I have plumped for this simply because it is so painfully funny. The narrator, “determined to host a low-key, but impeccably conceived, soirée”, details at great length her preparations and in the process reveals almost everything about her own hurt and loss. Bennett’s language is an ornate and long-winded riposte to all those pared-back minimalists, and I love it. 10. The Emerald Light in the Air by Donald Antrim This is a stone-cold masterpiece, as you will see by following the link above. It proceeds with the strange and relentless quality of a dream or fable, while being almost macabre in its realism, and feels like the story Antrim has been writing towards for his whole career. The beauty of it is hard to pin down, but it has a finished and inevitable quality – which it’s occurring to me now could be called soul.

The Belgian central defender is reported to be unhappy with his current weekly stipend of £50,000 and is refusing to sign a new contract. His agent, Stijn Francis, said last week that Alderweireld deserves “either a correct contract from Tottenham or a transfer”. Interestingly, the Mirror reports that City manager Pep Guardiola is angry with Kompany for exacerbating the calf injury that ruled him out of Saturday’s thrashing of Liverpool by playing a full 90 minutes on international duty with Belgium. How could anyone stay cross at the big friendly Belgian for long, eh? With Arsenal having failed to wrap up the deadline day signing of Monaco midfielder Thomas Lemar, who was inconsiderately playing a World Cup qualifier for France at the same time Emirates suits thought he should be undergoing a medical with them instead, the north London club will step up their efforts to sign the 21-year-old in the January window. British tabloid reports say that Arsenal have agreed a £100m deal in principle with Monaco, for a player who will earn £250,000 a week when he moves to London. Reports in today’s papers also suggest Atlético Madrid have sent a “delegation” to Stamford Bridge to sort out the inevitable return to the Spanish capital of Diego Costa for once and for all. Unable to sign new players until January due to a well documented transfer embargo, these briefcase-toting representatives of the Spanish club will up their bid for the sulking, striking striker to £32m and are already reported to have agreed a deal worth £175,000-per-week with Costa, who is believed to have moved his family to Madrid in preparation for his return from his extended summer holidays in Brazil. Having had their efforts to bring Antoine Griezmann to Old Trafford torpedoed by the aforementioned Fifa-imposed embargo, Manchester United will renew their efforts to sign the France international striker next summer, according to the Daily Star, but will have to fend off interest from Chelsea, who are also interested. Despite sacking his former agent Donato di Campli to go into cahoots with Mino Raiola, Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Marco Verratti failed to secure a move to Barcelona this summer. Verratti ended his association with Campli after his former advisor described him as “a prisoner” at Paris Saint-Germain but remains at the club despite feverish speculation he’d leave during the last window. As for the Italian’s next move? Nobody seems to know, not least his new representative. “Verratti will stay at PSG, at least for the moment,” said Raiola. “I can’t say about the future because I am not a magician,” he added, before disappearing in a puff of smoke."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/12/celebrity-art-dealer-jonathan-poole-stole-works-worth-500000-court-hears","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T18:20:52Z","webTitle":"Celebrity art dealer jailed for stealing works worth £500,000","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/12/celebrity-art-dealer-jonathan-poole-stole-works-worth-500000-court-hears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/12/celebrity-art-dealer-jonathan-poole-stole-works-worth-500000-court-hears","fields":{"headline":"Celebrity art dealer jailed for stealing works worth £500,000","bodyText":"An art dealer who worked and socialised with rock stars, Hollywood A-listers, supermodels and wealthy investors has been jailed for stealing paintings and sculptures over three decades. Jonathan Poole, 69, was sentenced to four years after being compared in court to the protagonist of the Hollywood art heist film The Thomas Crown Affair. Poole, who worked out of two galleries in the Cotswolds, specialised in selling artworks created by music stars such as John Lennon, Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood and jazz great Miles Davis. The prosecution suggested that Poole, from Poulton, Gloucestershire, may have been using the money to fund a gambling habit, service debts or was stashing it away for his future. Poole admitted 26 offences of theft and fraud against nine victims involving artworks worth about £500,000. James Ward, prosecuting, asked Gloucester crown court to imagine his clients’ shock when they realised the international art dealer they trusted was a “professional thief of some ability”. Ward said: “His life’s work has been as artist and art dealer. He was trusted by the wealthy individuals who invested in art. “He was trusted by internationally acclaimed celebrities such as Ronnie Wood, Miles Davis and John Lennon.” Ward quoted Picasso – “We all know that art is not truth” – and compared Poole to the leading character in The Thomas Crown Affair. He said: “Both Thomas Crown and Jonathan Poole stole the paintings in broad daylight. Whilst Thomas Crown stole as a challenge because his world had become too safe, Jonathan Poole stole either to fund a gambling habit, or to stash away money for later life. “Some of the artwork involved is still missing. Where is the money or the artwork he stole? Is it, like the Nazi gold train, hidden – only to be utilised in years to come?” Court two was turned into a makeshift modern art gallery during the hearing to display some of the paintings connected to the case that police have recovered. They included large works by German artist Sebastian Krüger, including one of the beat generation writer William Burroughs dressed as a gunslinger. Also exhibited in court were four pieces by Lennon, including one called Peace and Love. Poole, who was representing himself after sacking his defence team, said that at the peak of his 40-year career he was organising an exhibition almost every week, name-checking actor Anthony Hopkins as someone he worked with. He said his business had started to struggle with the advent of the internet. “People would come and if they liked something they would look on the internet and find a better price for it.” Poole has a degenerative condition and mobility problems. He said for the last five years he had been living in a single room and insisted he had none of the missing pieces. “I don’t have any art apart from my own,” he said. Judge Michael Cullum said Poole had clearly had a successful career. “Your professional credentials and knowledge were highly regarded,” he said, but added that an aggravating feature was that he had clearly been trusted by those he had stolen from or defrauded. Cullum seemed to take a swipe at some of Poole’s wealthy clients, saying many people would be surprised they did not always appear to keep careful track of the artworks they owned. He also said the prices of works painted by celebrities – and featuring famous people – were “inflated”. The court was also told about a client called Richard Fenton, who had inherited three bronze horses from his aunt, Beryl Ellis. Fenton took the pieces to Poole because he also specialised in animal sculptures. Poole promised to sell them and subsequently told Fenton they had been taken to Singapore. “To this day the pieces have never been returned and their location is not known,” Ward said. Poole’s known victims include the Dire Straits bass guitarist John Illsley. Poole sold two paintings by Miles Davis, owned by Illsley, but never passed the proceeds of the sale to his client. Poole’s own brother Nicholas was also a victim. Poole was born in London but brought up in Zimbabwe. His own work, usually wildlife studies, has been exhibited at the Royal Academy in London and in galleries worldwide. As well as creating his own work, Poole had a sparkling 40-year career as a dealer during which he won the trust of the rich and famous. While art by rock stars was his niche, he also specialised in work by the French sculptor Auguste Rodin (1840-1917) and Krüger. Much of his business was legitimate and he was well-respected but police found that he would also promise to sell some pieces for artists, collectors or investors but not pay them the proceeds or return the works. Poole told some clients their art had been destroyed in a flood. He strung others along for months or years with excuses. Some wealthy clients appeared to simply forget he was supposed to be selling their work. DC Steve Crilley of Gloucestershire police’s major crime investigation team said many of the artworks had been reunited with their owners – though it is understood that Yoko Ono was approached about the Lennon works whose ownership is not known and did not want them returned. Crilley said: “Poole was once a successful man and his victims trusted him to take care of their valuable artwork. “Sadly, he has now tarnished his good name and he will have to live with that shame for the rest of his life.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/27/the-giant-is-coming-the-true-cost-of-amazon-to-retailers-and-workers","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T18:00:11Z","webTitle":"The giant is coming: the true cost of Amazon to retailers and workers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/27/the-giant-is-coming-the-true-cost-of-amazon-to-retailers-and-workers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/27/the-giant-is-coming-the-true-cost-of-amazon-to-retailers-and-workers","fields":{"headline":"The giant is coming: the true cost of Amazon to retailers and workers","bodyText":"Down Dandenong way, on the outskirts of Melbourne, Amazon is staking out a beachhead for the invasion. Strategically located near freeway connections to Australia’s busiest cargo seaport, the US$465bn retail superpower’s cavernous new fulfilment centre is gearing up to house hundreds of thousands of products shipped in from all over the world. Citibank analysts predict Amazon will hit Australia in October, although the business itself is tight-lipped about the details. In the lead-up this 24,000 square metre warehouse is shedding the red-and-green branding of former tenant Bunnings for Amazon yellow, as it gears up to serve as a staging ground for a highly automated online retail operation that has deftly outmanoeuvred competitors, unions and tax authorities all over the globe – and promises to unleash the biggest disruption to the Australian market since the rise of department stores. The incoming arrival of Amazon has seen the share value of major Australian retailers plunge, with local business leaders only helping fuel the panic. Amazon this year has been variously described as “the worst possible corporate citizen”, “Attila the Hun”, “a parasite” that “pays no tax” and threatens to “send everyone broke” – and that’s just by Gerry Harvey, the chairman of the electrical retail chain Harvey Norman, which in May had its profit forecasts downgraded by 30% by Citibank after analysis of Amazon’s impact in the US. The colourful entrepreneur’s rhetoric has struck some as a little rich: the Retail Global founder, Phil Leahy, observed that Harvey’s “contradictions are breathtaking, given he has beaten competitors in building his own empire”. Formerly the backbone of the Australian economy, small businesses were eaten up during the latter half of the 20th century by franchise-packed shopping centres and towering superstores like those of Harvey Norman that offered lower prices and greater range in a single location. Back then it was a matter of profits being sucked from communities out to Sydney head offices. Harvey’s warning is that Amazon might just whisk the earnings out of Australia entirely as it undercuts local rivals by producing at greater scale – just as Australia’s big retailers once did to independent stores. The e-commerce giant generates nearly as much revenue as Australia’s supermarket duopoly of Wesfarmers-owned Coles and Woolworths combined, and Morgan Stanley estimates the company will generate $12bn of Australian sales by 2026. Just as a single superstore visit suited consumers more than visiting a medley of small businesses, Amazon’s all-encompassing product range and rapid response time represents another level of convenience again: the company guarantees delivery in some areas of the US within two hours of customers clicking through to the online checkout. Underpinning it all is Amazon’s pioneering of the latest technologies – robots that whisk shelves around warehouses, delivery drones that could soon zoom out of beehive towers and scan the properties of customers to see if there is anything else they might need, a voice-activated virtual assistant that can recommend what to buy (not to mention critique the outfits of users) and an Amazon Prime membership package that comes with a streaming video service to rival Netflix. Harvey says his company is up for the fight and that Amazon’s roll out cannot be as quick as expected but many Australian retailers aren’t aware there is going to be a fight in the first place. In March a Commonwealth Bank survey of more than 600 retailers found only 41% thought Amazon would be a threat to their business. The consumer behaviour analyst Barry Urquhart, the Perth-based managing director of Marketing Focus, is embarking on a speaking tour about the scale of the Amazon challenge. He says: “Australian retailers are unprepared, ill-informed and don’t know what they are going to address. I don’t think they appreciate what Amazon is. A lot of people are confused. They think, ‘I’m protected, I don’t sell books and CDs.’ But Amazon is a platform, like Uber, and we saw what Uber did to taxis.” The complacency might be to do with Amazon’s existing presence in Australia, where it has sold a limited range of entertainment-related products since 2012. Amazon’s full suite of offerings cover just about any product imaginable, from auto parts to furniture to sports gear. In June the company even committed to the bricks-and-mortar supermarket world with the US$13.7bn purchase of organic food chain Whole Foods – a sign that it will be ready to take part in the supermarket wars of Coles v Woolworths v Aldi. Amazon took on half of all e-commerce sales growth in the US last year and has piled huge pressure on American retailers, which are closing at record pace: 2017 is on track for over 8,500 store closures, dwarfing the 6,200 that shut their doors during the recession-hit turbulence of 2008. With American brands such as Sears and Macy’s shuttering hundreds of shopfronts alone, malls are struggling to find tenants. In a sign of the times, an Ohio mall that was the largest in the world is being transformed into an Amazon fulfilment centre. An Institute of Local Self-Reliance report – published late last year before the 2017 retail apocalypse – calculated that Amazon has eliminated about 149,000 more jobs in retail than it has created in its warehouses. The company’s embrace of automation is anticipated to further increase that gap, including the roll out of cashier-free physical stores where customers can walk out with their shopping while the payment is taken care of automatically through their Amazon account. A UBS survey found that Amazon’s arrival in Australia is predicted to eat up 16% of retailers’ discretionary earnings within five years, including 31% of department store giant Myer. The company is undertaking new measures as Amazon arrives, including the trial of a new yellow-branded clearance section in stores and enhancing its online marketing by leveraging data collected on shoppers via its loyalty program. In June the Myer chief executive, Richard Umbers, revealed the company would focus on offering unique brands. “I reckon that really dialling up the newness, the uniqueness of our range and in particular products that aren’t available on Amazon anyway … is the right way to defend ourselves against Amazon,” he told the Australian. Union hostility Amazon says it will create hundreds of jobs in the Melbourne fulfilment centre and thousands of jobs across Australia nationwide but what kind of jobs will they be? The National Union of Workers’ national secretary, Tim Kennedy, says the union wrote to Amazon in mid-August seeking a meeting to discuss plans for Australia but never heard back. He says a failure to engage will fit with Amazon’s record of poor labour practices. “These include the electronic monitoring of workers and harassment to the detriment of safety,” he says. “There is a well known case of the warehouse in Allentown, Pennsylvania, where workers are forced to work in extreme heat and when people drop they are whisked into ambulances that are stationed in the car park to remove them and replace the worker with standby workers on site ready to fill the hole. Quite shocking really. No respect for the essential humanity of people.” The scandal, which was reported in 2011, came about because the facility did not have air conditioning and Amazon did not want to leave the doors open for fear of merchandise being stolen. The company has since invested in air conditioning across a number of fulfilment centres, including at the planned Melbourne facility. Asked to respond to Kennedy’s concerns, Amazon spokesman James Lewis told the Guardian in an email that Amazon’s fulfilment centres are “a great place to learn skills to start and further develop a career”. Lewis said the safety of workers was the company’s top priority and that “as with most companies, we have certain expectations regarding the performance of associates. Productivity targets are set objectively, based on previous performance levels achieved by our workforce and evaluated over a long period of time. The vast majority of our fulfilment centre associates perform very well. If an associate is not meeting these performance levels, managers will work in consultation with associates in an endeavour to find a solution.” Amazon has a long and successful track record of pressuring employees to avoid unions, going right back to the year 2000 when leaked company documents detailed strategies to warn workers that unions are an expensive waste of time and telling supervisors to watch out for union activity signs such as “hushed conversations” among workers and “dawdling in the lunchroom and restrooms”. Lewis did not respond to the Guardian’s question about whether Amazon would meet with the NUW. Asked if Amazon would allow employees the option to join unions – as required by Australian law – Lewis said: “We respect the individual rights of our associates and have an open-door policy that encourages associates to bring their comments, questions and concerns directly to their management team. We firmly believe this direct connection is the most effective way to understand and respond to the needs of our workforce.” Investigations in the US and Europe have painted a detailed picture of what working at Amazon can entail. Half-hour unpaid breaks are partly eaten up by the time it takes to enter and exit fulfilment centres, which at some locations require queuing up to be searched for stolen contraband as nearby televisions loop a rogue’s gallery of silhouetted former employees fired for stealing. Employees are discouraged from using the bathroom and allocated demerit points for taking too long. They also lose points for taking sick days – examples include a worker penalised for being hospitalised with a kidney infection and another who was put on performance review for allowing breast cancer treatment to impede her work. At the corporate end, white-collar workers are pitted against each other and encouraged to rat on their peers via an anonymous assessment tool that ranks employees for the purposes of an annual cull. Workers have reported receiving midnight emails immediately followed by text messages asking why there hasn’t been a reply. Big revenues, low taxes Aside from the issue of fewer retail workers meaning fewer people paying taxes, Amazon itself has been questioned over its own tax contributions around the world. The most recent controversy came from the company paying just €16.5m in tax on European revenues of €21.6bn in 2016 through the low-tax jurisdiction of Luxembourg. The multinational tax avoidance expert Antony Ting, an associate professor at the University of Sydney Business School, says: “This kind of structure is common among e-commerce multinational enterprises such as Google, Facebook, Uber and Airbnb. The core of these tax arrangements is to locate intellectual properties (eg the digital platforms) to a low-tax jurisdiction (eg Bermuda), thus justifying shifting profits to that country. For these digital companies, these intangible assets, which are extremely mobile, are often their most important and valuable assets.” Ting notes Amazon will be encountering some specific challenges to its business model in Australia in the shape of the multinational anti-avoidance tax law (MAAL), introduced in January 2016, and the diverted profits tax (DPT), which came into force in July. He says the MAAL has had some success in securing tax revenues out of Facebook and Google, with the former increasing Australian profits by a factor of 10 and Google more than doubling local profit. Ting notes the MAAL appears to still fall a significant way short of securing tax revenues in line with the global profit margins of these companies – Facebook Australia’s net profit margin was 1% compared with a global net profit margin of 37%. As for the DPT, he says it might further improve tax intakes from multinationals like Amazon but, as it has only just been introduced, it is difficult to predict the outcome. “As the MAAL has been in place for over a year, it is likely that the corporate structure of Amazon in Australia will be designed in accordance with MAAL,” he says. In response Lewis said: “Amazon pays all the taxes we are required to pay in every country where we operate. Corporate tax is based on profits, not revenues, and our profits have remained low given our heavy investments and the fact that retail is a highly competitive, low-margin business.” Opportunities for consumers and small businesses Gigi Foster, an associate professor at the University of New South Wales business school, says she is “broadly optimistic” about the impact Amazon will have on Australia. “There is the potential for positive effects on Australian consumers, who have languished because of restrictions on imports,” she says. “I think it’s great you will have the option to buy a lot more stuff, people will be happier because of that. The more you can buy, the happier you can make yourself and your family.” Foster acknowledges there could be problems for Australian retailers, suggesting that small enterprises need to make sure they stock niche products not available on Amazon. Independent retailers that have survived through the era of big department stores are now bracing themselves for this new challenge. That includes Warren’s Menswear, an independent store in Fremantle that has been trading since 1931. The manager of Warren’s Menswear, Teresa Serafini, says: “Competition is great but not when Amazon can undercut you so you can’t compete. But we offer service that Amazon can’t and people remember that. We’ve survived through the great depression, a world war, the rise of retail chains. We get people who come in and say, ‘Oh my dad and before him my grandfather used to come here’.” Back at Marketing Focus, Urquhart says that kind of community relationship could see small businesses cope better with Amazon than the very retail chains that used to threaten their future. “You look at a big retailer like Officeworks where people are buying consumables,” he says. “If customers can go on to Amazon and get something functional for cheaper, they will start buying their USBs, calculators and pens from there. Small businesses, however, can easily live with and beat Amazon simply by providing personal interactive experiences – loyalty to the individual rather than the product.” Analysts have also noted that small enterprises offering unique products could benefit by selling their products through Amazon, using its formidable logistics capability to deliver to a huge global user base. The lack of awareness among Australian retailers about what Amazon actually represents is a major obstacle to this happening, however, as seen by the case of the 175-year-old Oliver’s Taranga Vineyards in South Australia, one of the country’s oldest family businesses. The Oliver’s Taranga Vineyards sales manager, Nicky Connolly, recently attended a marketing industry seminar in Sydney where Amazon was a hot topic but she left the conference still unaware that the American giant sells wine, with all the competition and potential supply opportunities that represents. “Oh, I didn’t know Amazon do wine now,” she tells the Guardian, pausing for a moment. “They’re not just books anymore, are they?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/11/former-europe-minister-caroline-flint-to-defy-labour-whips-on-eu-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T07:38:25Z","webTitle":"Former Europe minister Caroline Flint to defy Labour whips on EU bill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/11/former-europe-minister-caroline-flint-to-defy-labour-whips-on-eu-bill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/11/former-europe-minister-caroline-flint-to-defy-labour-whips-on-eu-bill","fields":{"headline":"Former Europe minister Caroline Flint to defy Labour whips on EU bill","bodyText":"Labour’s chances of defeating the EU withdrawal bill in parliament on Monday were dealt a blow after a leading backbencher said she would defy a three-line whip and instead support the government on the issue. Caroline Flint, formerly Europe minister, who represents the strongly pro-leave Don Valley constituency, said she believed it was an error to oppose the bill at second reading, rather than seek to amend it later. “I believe Labour’s job is to improve this bill, not kill it as it begins its passage through parliament,” Flint told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “I have to make a decision on this, and these decisions aren’t easy. I have never broken the whip at all but I do believe that in respecting the outcome of the referendum, in respecting what I said to my electors in a general election just a few months ago, it’s important that we get on with the job of making sure we can have as smooth an exit from the European Union as possible.” The withdrawal bill, which will be debated in the House of Commons until midnight on Monday before a vote on whether it should proceed, is a central piece of Brexit legislation that will bring EU laws and regulations into the UK statute book. While the government describes it as a vital but largely technical piece of legislation, Labour and the Liberal Democrats argue it gives ministers huge discretionary powers to amend legislation without seeking the approval of parliament. Under the terms of the bill, ministers can use what is called secondary legislation to change laws unilaterally. Flint was the first Labour MP to say she would defy the party whip on the vote. She was later joined by Frank Field. Speaking in the Commons during the bill debate on Monday afternoon, Flint was heckled by Labour MPs when she said she did not regard the bill “as hugely controversial”.She said she accepted the bill’s scope of powers would need attention but said it was not Labour’s job to kill it. “If it was abolishing workers’ rights, abandoning paid holiday and ending pollution control, that would be different but it does not,” she said. “Whoever was in government we would have to pass a bill of this kind. There can be little disagreement on that unless your ambition is to thwart the result and prevent or delay the UK leaving the EU. I believe Labour’s job is to improve the bill by amending it, not killing the bill at the beginning of its passage through parliament.” Flint said it was time both leave and remain supporters accepted that their perfect vision of Britain inside or outside the EU was impossible.”Since the referendum vote I have argued leave and remain supporters should bury our difference and get on with it.... We either work to make the best of it or damn it for not being perfect,” she said. During the first day of the debate on the bill last Thursday, a number of Conservative MPs expressed concern that the bill was handing too much power to ministers, prompting the Brexit secretary, David Davis, to indicate he was willing to offer some concessions. Flint, who has previously expressed concern at the idea Labour could back the UK remaining in the EU’s single market after Brexit, argued it would be better for Labour to join efforts to try to amend the bill rather than seek to vote it down on Monday. “Whoever was in government would have to have a bill like this, and I do believe it’s our job to make sure we can improve this bill – it certainly needs improving,” she said. “But if we were to vote this bill down, if we were to somehow get the votes tonight to kill it, it would cause huge problems. It would end the session of parliament, we’d probably have to prorogue, and they would have to come back with a new bill. “I don’t believe that affecting that is what the British public want. I think they want us to make sure that we deal with the complexities of this, that we recognise that at the end of the day there will have to be compromises on all sides, whether people voted leave or remain. “But we need an orderly exit, and part of that is making sure we have the legislation on the statute books that enables us to leave smoothly in March 2019.” Also speaking on Today the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said the withdrawal bill was vital for a smooth Brexit. “If we don’t do that then the whole thing will be disorderly and chaotic,” he said. “People who vote against it will effectively be voting to frustrate Brexit by producing a completely chaotic result.” But Jenny Chapman, a shadow Brexit minister, said the government needed to rethink the bill entirely. “What the government ought to do is take our point about how dreadful this bill is and come back with something more appropriate, that it needs to do the job of Brexit,” she told Sky News. “We accept that we need to repeal the 1972 act [European Communities Act] and we need to bring EU law into UK law for a smooth exit. What you don’t need, though, which the government is helping itself to, is these sweeping powers for ministers to change primary legislation.” Chapman added: “It can change anything it fancies with very little justification, and we think it’s wrong, and we don’t think you need it for a smooth Brexit.” Speaking later on Today, Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, which is holding its annual conference this week, said the government needed a wider rethink of its approach to Brexit. “I’m concerned that the prime minister is being held hostage by her hardliners,” she said. “What has become increasingly clear is that we need a transition period so that we don’t go off the cliff edge, and that we need to play by the rules during that period so that we can focus on the long-term deal that protects jobs and rights.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2017/sep/11/how-was-your-weekend-running","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T06:29:07Z","webTitle":"How was your weekend running?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2017/sep/11/how-was-your-weekend-running","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2017/sep/11/how-was-your-weekend-running","fields":{"headline":"How was your weekend running?","bodyText":"I managed to miss all the TV coverage of the Great North Run by going out for a 20 mile long run yesterday morning, but I did at least contribute to it - in a way.

It lasted only two years, and was repealed amid much fanfare by the Abbott government in July 2014. During its time, Australian companies and industries exposed to the carbon pricing mechanism took a long hard look at the emissions liabilities embedded within their supply chains and worked to reduce them. Barely three years later, Australia is in danger of being the kid that gets picked last for the soccer team. With China set to launch its national emissions trading scheme (ETS) before the end of the year, and several other Asia-Pacific nations either doing the same or already in the game, so-called ‘carbon clubs’ are forming and Australia isn’t invited. So what will it mean for Australian companies when our biggest trading partner – China – introduces their ETS? “Our energy-intensive exports sit directly in the supply chain of the world’s largest carbon market, where their customers are going to have a liability around the carbon price,” says Peter Castellas, chief executive of the Carbon Market Institute. “That will send a market signal of real significance.” Supply chain emissions – known as Scope 3 emissions under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol – refers to those generated outside the direct control of a business. These could be from the extraction and production of products purchased by the business, third-party transport and distribution, and the end use of its products. For many companies, these Scope 3 emissions are likely to be the largest part of their carbon emissions, compared to those generated by the company itself. For example, US company Kraft Foods found its Scope 3 emissions represented more than 90% of its total emissions (pdf). Supply chain emissions are already being targeted by many multinationals around the world; US retail giant Walmart recently asked its suppliers to help it achieve their goal of removing one gigatonne of carbon dioxide from its Scope 3 supply chain sources by 2030. Chinese companies operating under an ETS may well undertake similar initiatives to reduce their carbon footprint, which could put Australian companies in that supply chain under pressure. The recent announcement has added a few more details to the scope of the scheme. Chinese government adviser Zhang Xiliang from Tsinghua University told the AFR that it will begin with power generators and expand to encompass eight key sectors by 2020, including steel making and aluminium. The national scheme was first announced by Chinese president Xi Jinping in September 2015, during a visit by then-US president Barack Obama. At that time, China had been testing the waters since 2013 with pilot schemes in seven cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong and Shenzen. Incorporating power generation into the scheme is another step in China’s ongoing shift to a low carbon energy mix. It also raises further questions over the future of Australia’s coal exports to China, worth $4.2bn in 2015. “Anyone exporting coal to China needs to be worried; they should simply expect that China will not import coal,” says Prof Frank Jotzo, director of the Centre for Climate Economics and Policy at the Australian National University. However Tom Luckock, partner in law firm Norton Rose Fulbright’s Beijing office, says China has been moving away from coal-fired power long before the national ETS was announced. “China has and uses a number of tools to control emissions and it has done so very successfully for a number of years, and in many cases they will have a much larger impact than a carbon market,” Luckock says. “If you combine an ETS plus this very clear policy in terms of shutting down coal-fired power stations, plus you add in unofficial restrictions on new bank lending for coal fired power stations, plus you add renewables targets for power companies and local officials, together with tax incentives and high tariffs for renewables; all of this will have an impact back in Australia,” he says. Coal is a small part of the many goods and services that Australia exports to China. That export market, worth $93bn in 2016, includes metals and metal ores – iron, gold, aluminium and zinc, for example – as well as a huge range of other products, from wool and wheat to medicines and machinery parts. Elisa de Wit, partner and head of climate change at Norton Rose Fulbright, says any Australian business that deals with China could be affected. “Our sense though is that … perhaps there hasn’t been sufficient attention directed towards the impacts for that supply chain arrangement, and particularly for Australian business,” de Wit says. The launch of China’s national carbon market could also harm the competitiveness of Australian products. Jotzo suggests one effect of the scheme will be to encourage Chinese firms to invest in newer, more efficient production facilities, and pressure out the older, less efficient installations. This could be helped by incentives, like those built into the European Union ETS, which shield domestic industries from competitive disadvantage abroad because of the additional impositions of the carbon pricing mechanisms. “So once that all works its way through, China will have a more efficient heavy industrial sector as a result of this, and in the longer term will be able to better compete with international competitors,” he says. China is not the only nation in the Asia-Pacific region to take steps towards emissions trading schemes. South Korea launched one in 2015, Japan has a cap-and-trade program for Tokyo, New Zealand launched an ETS in 2008, and Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam are looking at reducing emissions through a pricing and trading schemes. Australia’s lack of a carbon pricing mechanism could see it lag behind in the region, says Castellas, as countries that do have them begin to link their carbon trading markets. “When you have Japan, [South] Korea and China having discussions around a north Asian carbon club; when you’ve got China and Korea having discussions around how do we treat emissions across borders and what’s the lowest cost to our economies to meet our emissions targets; when you have China and New Zealand having those conversations about establishing direct engagement because they both have a functioning carbon market with a price; those conversations and those emerging what’s being called ‘carbon clubs’ is something that Australia should be participating in,” he says. Jotzo also warns Australia could be more subtly frozen out as a trading partner with China. “Quite irrespective of the specific provisions for shielding Chinese industries and all the rest of it, China will then tend to say ‘well hang on …we’re doing the right thing for the global climate, why should we accept imports from countries like Australia or the US where industries are not under any similar obligation’, and that will be an argument in favour of trade restrictions of one form or another,” he says. A Chinese national ETS is not all bad news. Despite our lack of a national carbon pricing mechanism, de Wit says Australia still has something to offer countries that implement them. “We do see that there’s the potential opportunity for the learnings that have come out of our own offsets market, which has now been in operation for over six years, for some of that expertise to be exported as well into China,” she says. It is also possible China might exhaust its domestic carbon offset credits, and Australia could find an opportunity in exporting those to China. “It’s an interesting dynamic in terms of thinking about what happens under the Paris agreement, and once the emissions reduction opportunities have been completely extinguished, how you then look at offsetting and where those offsetting opportunities are actually going to come from,” de Wit says. One thing is certain: there are more questions than answers about China’s ETS, and the details are eagerly awaited. A spokesperson for the department of foreign affairs and trade said it will be paying close attention to the effects of policy developments on Australian business. “Once the details of the scheme are made available, we will continue to engage closely with Australian exporters to ensure our advocacy with the Chinese authorities is targeted and appropriate.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"books/2017/sep/15/toni-jordan-on-her-favourite-new-writer-you-should-be-reading-briohny-doyle","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T18:00:11Z","webTitle":"Toni Jordan on her favourite new writer: ‘You should be reading Briohny Doyle’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/15/toni-jordan-on-her-favourite-new-writer-you-should-be-reading-briohny-doyle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/15/toni-jordan-on-her-favourite-new-writer-you-should-be-reading-briohny-doyle","fields":{"headline":"Toni Jordan on her favourite new writer: ‘You should be reading Briohny Doyle’","bodyText":"Two weeks after my 20th birthday I married a man – a boy, really – who was a little older than me. We would not be married for very long of course, but I didn’t know that then. I didn’t even suspect it . I felt for him the kind of love where it seemed the very beat of my heart stopped when he was around. I couldn’t sleep, I didn’t eat. Today, though, when people ask why I married so young, I struggle to answer. Usually I say: “That was just what you did.” “That was just what you did,” is my feeble explanation for most of the big decisions of my late teens and 20s. At 18, I left home and worked full-time in a mail room and thought I was blessed – as a child, I’d imagined I would be a barmaid. I bought my first house at 23, with my then-boyfriend. No travel, anywhere. That was just what you did. Limited options and low expectations go some way to explain the exhilaration and relief I’ve found in ageing. Exhilaration, because I can hardly believe my good fortune. I’m still alive, somehow, and healthy. Is this really my job? My beautiful house, my wonderful husband, my very own dog? And relief, because those grinding years of poverty and worry and vulnerability are over and I stand now, clear-eyed, on the other side. Being 20 again, in a world of inter-generational tension, diminishing resources and boundless yet unsatisfying choices, would be a kind of nightmare. Unpicking this feeling is why I love the work of Briohny Doyle. Doyle’s brilliant non-fiction book Adult Fantasy, published this year, asks the question: what does it mean to be an adult, right now? Do the priorities of previous generations – marriage, children, mortgages, education – even rate in a world facing climate catastrophe? Those of us who own homes are quick to respond to millennial concerns as though we’re Monty Python’s Four Yorkshiremen: “We lived for three months in a brown paper bag in a septic tank.” And it’s gold, gold, gold for Australia, in amateur competitive suffering. Instead, the question should be: if someone in their 20s now chose to make the same sacrifices as we did, would they achieve the same result? The answer, by all accounts, is no. Yes, this is the conversation that launched a thousand avocado toast jokes. In Doyle’s hands, though, it’s nuanced and engrossing – and it’s not just about our current intergenerational social context. In essence, all good writing asks: How should I live? Doyle’s work is important because this question must be continually asked and continually answered, throughout all of our lives – otherwise we’re prey to the gasping, sitting-up-in-bed existential crisis and resultant sports cars and tummy tucks, broken marriages and burned bridges. That’s what significant birthdays are for, and funerals of parents and dear friends, and those rare moments we stand, mid-point, and see our lives clearly both behind and in front of us. Our past pattern of failures and future logical extrapolations along a bone-wearying railway track of years. A writer who asks questions like these must get her own hands dirty, and there are intimate parts of Doyle’s life exposed here. Adult Fantasy begins with Doyle’s third-life crisis and her awareness that she’s achieved none of the traditional markers of adulthood. Along the way, she meets with young adults with such a variety of lifestyles and priorities it almost seems as though the very term “millennials”, and the way we bandy it about as shorthand for “self-absorbed and entitled”, is like any other form of generalisation: lazy and stupid. (Imagine.) She’s intrepid and brutal, but only towards herself. She spills her doubt and angst yet she sallies onward, never judging or whining, always entertaining, open-hearted and open-minded. In The Island Will Sink, her 2016 debut cli-fi novel, she’s more playful, though still wry and blackly humorous. Ostensibly it’s the story of Max Galleon – a husband, father and maker of blockbuster disaster movies – and his life as the world careens toward its conclusion. It’s equally a field for her ideas to play out: the way technology and digital projections replace both genuine relationships and an intrinsic sense of self; the nature of memory and reality; and even our pop culture obsession with all things apocalyptic and the way this engagement substitutes for global action on the coming real thing. One of her many perfect details is Pow-Wow the Power Saving Panda, whose holographic image pops up everywhere and becomes angry or teary if the shower runs too long or the recycling is neglected. Orwell meets Disney; even our good intentions are used to manipulate us. Recent government policy toward millennials seems too malevolent to be real. In 2015 treasurer Joe Hockey advised that, if they wanted to buy a house, young adults should “get a good job that pays good money”. But if they agree, and go to university, they’re left with a debt of tens of thousands of dollars to be repaid at a lower earning threshold (changes legislated by, mostly, men who’ve benefitted from their own Whitlam-era free education). Okay, the young people think. I won’t run up a bigger debt than absolutely necessary. So they work part-time, making coffee and clearing plates, in shops and behind bars. Not so fast! says the government. We’re slashing your penalty rates and giving the money to our rich mates in business tax cuts. It’s as if these clowns have a strategic goal to Make Australia Dumb Again. At the same time, we’re using up resources like drunks locked in a cellar, swigging as fast as we can with both hands and with one eye on the door. We think we are somehow exempt from this basic law of existence: an ever-growing colony consuming and excreting on a finite petri dish will eventually drown in its own shit. Doyle’s two explorations, non-fiction and fiction, are two sides of the same coin. Our lack of basic literacy in both science and media studies has lead us here. The fact that we can’t tell real news from fake lies at the feet of our disdain for the humanities. If anything, her novel is the more important because it’s wonderful storytelling and provides a philosophical and emotional context to understand the science. If I were a millennial, I’d be fucking furious. Doyle, by contrast, is smart and compassionate enough to look beyond the personal to the systemic. Look at the world we’re bequeathing them. If you’re a millennial, or you love one, or you hope to live long enough to see the world governed by them, you should be reading Briohny Doyle. • Briohny Doyle’s Adult Fantasy is out in Australia and the UK through Scribe.

The public commitment came after a meeting between the AGL chief executive Andy Vesey, the prime minister, and senior government ministers, in Canberra on Monday, where the company was asked to take a proposal to the board to either sell the plant, or keep it open for another five years. In a statement issued after the meeting, the company made it clear it had agreed to the government’s request to take a sale or extension proposal to the board very reluctantly. “I was asked to take to the AGL board the government’s request to continue the operation of Liddell post 2022 for five years and/or sell Liddell, which I agreed to do,” Vesey said in a statement. While acknowledging it would manage a proposal to sell or extend Liddell’s operating life up to the board – the company also made it clear it was inclined to stick with a previously telegraphed plan to develop gas peaking plant, pumped hydro and batteries, as well as a demand response, to deal with the shortfall in NSW once the plant closes. Vesey said the company did not see new development of coal as “economically rational, even before factoring in a carbon cost”. In a pointed observation, AGL said it was complying with the government’s Finkel review requirements to give advanced notice when it intended to close power plants. “AGL is meeting one of the 49 recommendations in the Finkel report that have been accepted by the Commonwealth government,” Vesey said. “The long notice period we have given reflects our commitment to managing carbon risk for shareholders and avoiding the volatility created by recent sudden withdrawal of capacity.” The energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, hailed the meeting a success, and he told reporters the company had not made any request for government assistance in the development of alternatives, like gas and renewables, to replace Liddell’s capacity. Frydenberg said AGL’s alternative plan for power to replace the electricity supplied by Liddell “would be firm dispatchable capacity and have no adverse impact on consumers both in terms of price and the reliability of the system.” The government has indicated there would be buyers for Liddell in the event AGL was prepared to sell, and Delta Electricity, a company headed by the coal barons Trevor St Baker and Brian Flannery, has expressed an early interest. The meeting with AGL came as the Nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce, acknowledged earlier on Monday that ongoing subsidies for renewable energy were “essential” if the government was to comply with Australia’s international climate commitments. The National party’s federal conference this past weekend passed a motion calling for subsidies for renewable energy to be phased out within five years, but Joyce said on Monday his party would chart its own path. Joyce said he would be guided by the federal conference, but not “instructed by it” and he said his view was Australia needed to comply with the commitments we gave in the Paris agreement. He said the National party would formulate its own position on the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist in his review of the national electricity market, and then would work out how to come to a common proposition with the Liberal party on the government’s energy policy. Joyce characterised coalition with the Liberals as “a business arrangement”. The government has also asked the Australian Energy Regulator to examine the bidding practices of New South Wales power generators, responding to reports that generators have been selling their electricity in manner which inflates spot prices. In a statement, the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, said the request to the regulator is an extension of a project already underway examining behaviour by bidders across the national electricity market following the closure of Hazelwood power station earlier this year. The regulator will report to the energy council of the council of Australian governments in November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/11/battle-of-the-sexes-review-toronto-film-festival-tiff","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T14:03:52Z","webTitle":"Battle of the Sexes review – Emma Stone serves up rousing, timely tennis drama","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/11/battle-of-the-sexes-review-toronto-film-festival-tiff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/11/battle-of-the-sexes-review-toronto-film-festival-tiff","fields":{"headline":"Battle of the Sexes review – Emma Stone serves up rousing, timely tennis drama","bodyText":"Lurking behind the crowd-pleasing veneer of 1970s set drama Battle of the Sexes is a depressing reminder that unequal pay remains a shamefully unresolved problem 44 years later. In the film, 29-year-old Billie Jean King is frustrated by the disparity between what male and female tennis players are paid, and it’s her annoyance at this injustice that acts as a propelling force for the plot. King (Emma Stone) has just been triumphant at the 1972 US Open, but before she can finish celebrating, she finds out that the United States Lawn Tennis Association has announced a new prize fund, offering eight times less for women. In an act of rebellion alongside manager Gladys Heldman (Sarah Silverman), she launches the Women’s Tennis Association, designed to provide a more equal working environment for female tennis players. It irks the old boys of the sport, including misogynist ex-pro Bobby Riggs (Steve Carell), who challenges her to the ultimate test, a match between the pair that will, in his mind, prove that women are lesser players than men. There’s an unavoidable comparison to recent US politics to be made here. On one side we have the hard working, respectable woman, and on the other, there’s a chauvinistic, showboating man, eager to prove masculine superiority. It certainly adds an extra spikiness to the rivalry, our all-too-fresh experience of watching an attention-seeking buffoon try to bring a woman down on live television helping us root for King even more. Oscar-winning Slumdog Millionaire screenwriter Simon Beaufoy gives us more than enough reasons to gasp throughout with everyday sexism casually falling out of almost every male character’s mouth (“It’s not your fault, it’s biology!”). It’s a film filled with necessary reminders that will bait an insecure male audience (there’s a reason the film has a 4.5 rating on IMDb before even being released) but there’s not quite enough within the mechanics of a plot to justify a two-hour running time. It’s a decent tennis movie, solidly told and choreographed, but it’s in the film’s depiction of a same-sex romance between King and her hairdresser, played beautifully by Andrea Riseborough, where things truly comes alive. At the time, King was married to a man, but when the pair meet, there’s an instant connection. There’s a clandestine electricity that radiates from their interactions, and also a genuine tenderness that develops in a time when such a relationship was almost impossible, at least within the public eye. It’s a finely handled dynamic, and Beaufoy deserves kudos for avoiding the easy route of lazily turning King’s husband Larry (no, not that one), into a villain. We feel for him as much as we do for the woozily romantic women. It comes from Little Miss Sunshine directors Valerie Faris and Jonathan Deyton, who bring a similar rousing vibe to the proceedings (the less said about their twee misstep Ruby Sparks the better). Stone is strong in a steely, unshowy role and it’s rewarding to see her outside of her comfort zone; Carell is an annoying and cartoonish presence but, well, so was Riggs. The attempts to flesh out his character via scenes at home, struggling with a gambling addiction and a disintegrating marriage with his beleaguered wife, don’t quite cut as deep as they could, but it does give a small opportunity to Elisabeth Shue, who nabs one of the film’s many nifty supporting roles. There’s also room for Fred Armisen as a redundant vitamin doctor, Bill Pullman as an odious sexist tennis champ, and the aforementioned Silverman as King’s commanding manager. It’s a shame, though, that the other women who make up King’s tennis tour are so interchangeable, not one possessing any particularly notable characteristic other than “plays tennis”. Like any great sports film, everything is leading towards one final confrontation and after a slightly saggy middle section, things do pick up just in time. It’s an ending that will soar for many, a vital victory for those who need a lift, and a lingering shot of a “Billie Jean for president” poster acts as a reminder that the film was made with a contemporary grand slam in mind that didn’t quite take place as planned.

I gave 12 years of my life to playing the game professionally. But those years were also marked by the pain of being trapped in a culture that condoned racism through a combination of ignorance, habit, and arrogance. In the end, the message to a young, black man like me was clear: I was only of value if I didn’t challenge the status quo. In the past few weeks, I have re-lived the events that marked my final years of football. I have been repeatedly questioned about my experience – nine years of working in a culture where I was called “black cunt”, a “ni**er”, and a “slave” – all in the name of “fun”. I’ve been painted as mentally unwell, and once again my experiences have been dismissed by the institutions who have a duty to address them. I find it worrying that both Collingwood and AFL officials have continually cast direct and and indirect aspersions on my mental health and wellbeing. I have been upfront about my struggles with depression in the past. It’s not unusual that a professional athlete might struggle under the enormous stress of performing at such levels. To see this history weaponised as a reason to now dismiss or discourage reporting on my story is deeply troubling and a dangerous precedent in a society where we are trying to encourage people to speak out about their difficulties. My desire to see young Indigenous players and young players of colour come up through the sport that profits from their talents without being subjected to environments that belittle and humiliate them is not the result of ongoing or unresolved mental health issues. In the past few days, the AFL has also responded to my story by announcing that it is a “national leader” with a strong record in the fight against racism, all while refusing to address or dignify the substance of my claims – despite former team-mates coming forward to confirm that they either witnessed or experienced the culture I have described. What kind of “leading” anti-racist organisation would allow Adam Goodes, its highest profile Indigenous player, to be subjected to racist bullying without immediately condemning it? Or allow a club president like Eddie McGuire to compare that same player to an ape with no substantial sanctions or penalties such as those which are swiftly applied by sporting codes overseas? The AFL’s reactions in these situations were more than incompetence. Their silence and inaction created dangerous public precedents for what kind of behaviours are deemed acceptable and appropriate. There’s also a healthy degree of hypocrisy when the AFL preaches multiculturalism and inclusion on one hand, but continues to promote its brand via a program like the Footy Show which has been notorious for years of crude and gratuitous racism and sexism. It is naive to think that this is simply entertainment; it is a platform where powerful and influential personalities teach young people – particularly young men – how to behave and what kind of attitudes are acceptable. I will never forget watching Nicky Winmar being humiliated on the Footy Show in 1999. In a single, crude act of blackface, Newman robbed him of his humanity and reduced him to a cruel punchline. To me, this was the same psychology that would lead to the horrific mob behaviour that ended Adam Goodes’ career. You only need to watch Newman’s bitter, lengthy, televised rants about Goodes in the middle of the booing saga to see how such attitudes might have been encouraged. It remains a permanent mark on the AFL’s history that they were unable to immediately and unequivocally condemn racism, and that they allowed a champion of the game to be bullied out of it forever. As a victim of racism, I had nowhere to turn. I spoke to multiple coaches and club management about how I was affected, informed my player agent and the AFL Player’s Association, and chose not to speak with the league because of their history of failures. When I spoke out about McGuire’s comments on Goodes, I was told I had “gone rogue” and “thrown the president under the bus”. When I made complaints about needing to create a safer club culture, I was told that I was “not in line with the Collingwood Football Club.” There was a concerted campaign to push me out, despite still being contracted. It was clear that none of these people had the skills or education to recognise the significance of the problem. Officials have dodged recent questions from media as though they were not aware of the compound effect that ongoing discrimination had on me, hiding the fact that I brought the situation to their attention multiple times. What happened to me happens to people every day: at work, in classrooms, on public transport, and on the playground. I’m merely using my story to illustrate that even at the level of elite sports, individuals are not immune to being trapped in a culture that normalises racism. I am grateful to former team-mates who have come forward to support me despite the risk to their future opportunities in football, and to the numerous football fans (including Collingwood fans) who have expressed their support for me. No institution is immune to change or accountability. The AFL is a major, multi-million dollar operation. It has the resources available to improve itself and its clubs if it wants to. It’s time to decide whether it wishes to be a true cultural leader or not. Eventually, the tide will turn. It always does.

The use of disinfectants is linked to a higher risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), according to research looking at incidence of the disease in more than 55,000 nurses in the US. The 30-year study by Harvard University and the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (Inserm) found that those who used the products just once a week had as high as a 32% increased chance of developing the condition. COPD, which affects an estimated 1.2 million people in the UK, describes a group of lung conditions such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis that make it difficult to move air in and out of the lungs because the airways have been narrowed. Nearly 25,000 people per year die from the disease in England, which is the third highest death rate in Europe. Disinfectant use has previously been associated with an increased risk of respiratory problems such as asthma. However, the new study is thought to be the first to identify a link between COPD and specific cleaning chemicals known as quaternary ammonium compounds (quats). “The potential adverse effects of exposure to disinfectants on COPD have received much less attention, although two recent studies in European populations showed that working as a cleaner was associated with a higher risk of COPD,” said Inserm researcher Orianne Dumas. “To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report a link between disinfectants and COPD among healthcare workers, and to investigate specific chemicals that may underlie this association.” The everyday use of bleach currently has no specific health guidelines, but the researchers hope this will be investigated. “Some of these disinfectants, such as bleach and quats, are frequently used in ordinary households, and the potential impact of domestic use of disinfectants on COPD development is unknown,” Dumas said. “Earlier studies have found a link between asthma and exposure to cleaning products and disinfectants at home, such as bleach and sprays, so it is important to investigate this further.” The researchers analysed data from a mass study on female US nurses commenced by Harvard in 1989. In 2009, they looked at those who were still working as nurses who had no history of COPD and tracked them until May this year. During that period, 663 were diagnosed with the condition. The nurses’ exposure to disinfectants were evaluated via a questionnaire and other factors that could have distorted the results, such as the age, weight and ethnicity of the subjects, were taken into account. On Monday, Dumas will tell a meeting of the European Respiratory Society International Congress in Milan that certain tasks involving frequent exposure to disinfectants, such as cleaning surfaces, as well as specific chemicals in disinfectants, were associated with a 22-32% increased risk of developing the disease. Dumas will say: “We found that nurses who use disinfectants to clean surfaces on a regular basis – at least once a week – had a 22% increased risk of developing COPD ... There was a suggestion of a link with the weekly use of disinfectants to clean instruments but this was not statistically significant. “In our study population, 37% of nurses used disinfectants to clean surfaces on a weekly basis and 19% used disinfectants to clean medical instruments on a weekly basis.” She says the findings highlight the need for guidelines for cleaning and disinfection in healthcare settings such as hospitals to be updated to take the occupational health risks into account."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/11/brexit-workers-rights-best-secured-by-staying-in-single-market-says-tuc-chief","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T23:00:49Z","webTitle":"Brexit: workers' rights best secured by staying in single market, says TUC chief","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/11/brexit-workers-rights-best-secured-by-staying-in-single-market-says-tuc-chief","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/11/brexit-workers-rights-best-secured-by-staying-in-single-market-says-tuc-chief","fields":{"headline":"Brexit: workers' rights best secured by staying in single market, says TUC chief","bodyText":"Continued membership of the European Union single market is the best way to protect British workers after Brexit, the TUC’s general secretary, Frances O’Grady, will say on Monday, increasing the pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to shift Labour’s policy. Speaking at the TUC’s annual congress in Brighton, as MPs in Westminster prepare for a debate on the EU withdrawal bill, O’Grady will say: “We have set out our tests for the Brexit deal working people need. Staying in the single market and customs union would deliver it.” Her speech comes after the TUC’s general council, which represents about 50 trade union organisations, officially stated that it was in favour of remaining in the single market after a meeting on Thursday. On Sunday night the Brexit secretary, David Davis, urged MPs not to vote for “a chaotic exit from the European Union” ahead of a vote on the repeal bill on Monday. “The British people did not vote for confusion and neither should parliament,” he said. Corbyn and the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, recently announced Labour would back continuing membership of the EU single market and customs union for a transitional period, which should last as long as it takes to strike a new trade deal. Since that announcement, Corbyn’s spokesman has stressed the disadvantages of the single market – including state aid rules which Labour believes prevent governments from rescuing ailing businesses; and procurement rules preventing them favouring domestic firms. But unions are a key support base for Corbyn’s leadership and have become increasingly vocal about the risks of plunging out of the single market. Some of his party’s backbenchers, including former shadow health secretary Heidi Alexander and Progress chair Alison McGovern, have set up a “Labour campaign for the single market” in a bid to influence the party’s policy. In her keynote speech in Brighton, O’Grady is expected to say: “The prime minister is sticking to the same old script that she can get whatever she wants, that we can all have all the same benefits of the single market without playing by the rules. “This isn’t a grown-up negotiating position. It’s a letter to Santa. My challenge to all political parties is this: when it comes to Brexit, don’t box yourselves in. Don’t rule anything out. Keep all options on the table. And put jobs, rights and livelihoods first.” She will be speaking as Theresa May gears up for her toughest parliamentary challenge since her majority was wiped out in June’s general election. On Monday, a second day of debate in Westminster on the EU withdrawal bill is being held, followed by a series of tough late-night votes, expected after midnight, with Corbyn imposing a three-line whip on his MPs to reject legislation he regards as a power-grab. The bill will allow the government to transpose EU law on to the UK statute book, but critics say it places too much power in the hands of ministers to make sweeping changes in the process. Davis said in a statement released on Sunday night: “A vote against this bill is a vote for a chaotic exit from the European Union. The British people did not vote for confusion and neither should parliament.” May is expecting to scrape through the votes on Monday, because senior Tories who have expressed concerns about the bill, including Dominic Grieve and Anna Soubry, are expected to hold their fire until the committee stage later in the autumn, when Davis has signalled he will be willing to listen to amendments. The prime minister will face a series of further challenges in parliament later in the week over the Conservatives’ bid to pack crucial Commons committeesand a Labour motion aimed at lifting the pay cap for public sector workers, an issue that has become increasingly controversial. The EU withdrawal bill is one of seven pieces of legislation the government has said it needs to pass to facilitate Brexit by the end of this two-year session of parliament. On Sunday, Tony Blair urged MPs to speak out against Brexit if they had doubts about it. “Brexit is a distraction, not a solution, to the problems this country faces,” said the former prime minister. “If members of parliament really believe that, then their obligation is to set out solutions that deal with the actual communities and problems people have, and not do Brexit which is actually going to distract us from those solutions.” In the first of a series of interventions he plans this autumn as Brexit talks intensify, Blair’s Institute for Global Change published a paper setting out a series of ways in which the UK could restrict immigration within existing EU free movement rules. Speaking on BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show, Blair said: “If, for example, the anxiety is downward pressure on wages as a result of an influx of EU migrants coming and doing work, say in the construction industry, we have it within our power to deal with that through domestic legislation.” He suggested the mood within the EU on the meaning of free movement was changing, with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, backing a directive that would crack down on using migrants to undercut the wages of domestic workers. “If we want to deal with those questions, we can deal with them without the sledgehammer that through Brexit destroys the EU migration that we’ll actually need,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/10/the-guardian-view-on-the-economy-the-city-is-now-too-big-for-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T19:10:49Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the economy: the City is now too big for Britain | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/10/the-guardian-view-on-the-economy-the-city-is-now-too-big-for-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/10/the-guardian-view-on-the-economy-the-city-is-now-too-big-for-britain","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the economy: the City is now too big for Britain","bodyText":"The report released last week by the centre-left thinktank IPPR commission on economic justice comes not a moment too soon. In hosting a commission bringing together public intellectuals, representatives of industry, finance and tech, the IPPR seeks to publicise our failures as an economy on the cusp of a “decade of disruption”. The topography of the economy features some very low valleys: as a nation, the UK is not generating rising prosperity for a majority; a high employment rate masks an increasingly insecure “casualised” labour force; and Britain remains a pretty unequal place. The UK is damned as a low productivity economy, investing less than our rivals, with an overall current account deficit that ranks the largest of all the G7 countries. While a picture can be painted that Britain is doing all right, this does not reflect many people’s experience. Although GDP has risen about 10% since the crisis, disposable income per person has been roughly flat. For some, hope is draining away: a survey by the Resolution Foundation found that 48% of respondents think millennials will have a worse standard of life than their parents. While the scale of the analysis is to be praised, the commission has not outlined the scale of the solution. This is about big vested interests. At the root of the UK jobs crisis is the City’s role in the decline of the absolute number of middle-skilled positions. The financial industry is just too big for the good of the economy – leaving Britain bereft of an industrial base and unable to generate millions of jobs. Finance’s cartel-like tendencies have stunted the growth of business by charging exorbitant fees for raising capital – thereby robbing companies of the cash to invest. We need labour-absorptive industries to create decent jobs. Regulatory action to stop finance siphoning off capital for itself is a necessary step to take."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/10/musical-heroes-and-sporting-legends","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T17:12:18Z","webTitle":"Musical heroes and sporting legends | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/10/musical-heroes-and-sporting-legends","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/10/musical-heroes-and-sporting-legends","fields":{"headline":"Musical heroes and sporting legends","bodyText":"How sad that The guide, Somme (Travel, 9 September) merely registers that Butterworth Farm, Pozières, “is named after a missing British soldier”.

Scoring after 21 seconds was more like ecstasy. But shortly after his side had sewn up a 1-0 home win over Doncaster to lift themselves off the foot of League One mere joy could be measured in his voice. “It’s a while since I’ve been screaming,” he croaked. Hasselbaink is used to flying starts. In his first managerial appointment in England he carried on Gary Rowett’s good work at Burton, keeping them top of League Two and leaving them top of League One to go to Loftus Road. Since he left QPR in mid-table in November his voice has been recovering. Now it is the Cobblers who need repair. Justin Edinburgh left them where he found them in 20 games last season and started this with four defeats looking as wet behind the ears as England’s Lionesses in their Euro semi-final against Holland. Edinburgh became the league’s first casualty of the season. Northampton, who were close to being wound up two years ago, are ambitious now with a chairman, Kelvin Thomas, formerly at Oxford United, and Chinese owners. The financial mess is still unresolved and the skeletal erection along one side remains “a piece of evidence”, not to be touched. Sixfields might as well be called Threestands. The Cobblers, driven by Chris Wilder on his way from Oxford to Sheffield United, got out of League Two in 2016. Hasselbaink spoke to him before going for the job. Appointed after the transfer window closed, he also needed reassurance on the quality of players in the squad. Due diligence is two-way and at first active sight he was well satisfied. “I saw they are willing to suffer,” he said. “Willingness is important. Confidence was low, so we had to make sure they know they’re good players. But scoring so quick made it harder as they wondered, ‘What do we do now?’” He also admitted he was more visible than usual. “The players had to see you, to feel your energy,” he said. Their own was not in doubt. “I’m happy they tried to do what I asked,” he added. Criticism beforehand had observed they had six central midfielders and one wing. The answer could not have been swifter. George Smith, signed from Gateshead without a league start, flew down the left and fed Matt Crooks, from Rangers, to score. Smith thought he was a wing-back but not now. “The manager had us better organised,” he said, and better briefed on their own roles and the opposition. With the loanees Matt Grimes (Swansea) and Chris Long (Burnley) a parting tribute to Edinburgh, Northampton never looked back. Darren Ferguson, Rovers’ manager, was appalled at how “sloppy” his side were. With a Blair and May in their ranks there was no reason to expect respectable leadership but he did put on James Coppinger at half-time. “He at least was creative,” he said, and Matt Ingram, the Cobblers’ keeper on loan from QPR, had a chance to show his worth. Ferguson may since have rung for his father’s hairdryer while Hasselbaink is ready to continue his mission that “people around me enjoy the journey”. Portsmouth visit on Tuesday. Talking points • Just as there are soft goals and wonder goals, so there are minimal assists and mega ones. Britt Assombalonga’s two goals for Middlesbrough at Bolton were tap-ins from well-timed trust in the same provider, Adama Traoré. Both were solo efforts of astonishing resilience, trickery and speed. Either would be a candidate for assist of the season, if such a prize existed. Perhaps it should. • In one fell swoop, besides Northampton above, the EFL lost its other no-pointer, Oldham, also in League One and close to winning at Fleetwood, as well as its last 100-percenter, Cardiff in the Championship, held at Fulham. Cardiff and Leeds continue to fly the unbeaten flag in that division, with Shrewsbury and Scunthorpe doing so in League One and Exeter in League Two. • Shrewsbury’s start is one of the more unexpected features of the season. Having appointed Paul Hurst in October, when they were last, they were seldom far from the relegation places but stood by him as they finished in 18th place, two points above relegated Port Vale. And look where Vale are now – propping up League Two below Chesterfield, who also went down from League One. • The Sunderland malaise goes on, seemingly beyond explanation, with another manager of proven substance foundering. Simon Grayson’s record shows successive promotions with Blackpool, Leeds and Preston to the Championship. Is the Stadium of Light really too high or bright for him? Or is an exorcist needed to expel an evil spirit? At least he has Steve Bruce’s Aston Villa and Harry Redknapp’s Birmingham in close proximity. Like most of the rest they all go again tomorrow."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/11/washington-vancouver-portland-rally-protest","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T15:32:28Z","webTitle":"Man arrested for driving truck towards anti-fascist protesters in Washington state","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/11/washington-vancouver-portland-rally-protest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/11/washington-vancouver-portland-rally-protest","fields":{"headline":"Man arrested for driving truck towards anti-fascist protesters in Washington state","bodyText":"Late on Sunday, immediately after an “alt-right” Patriot Prayer rally in Vancouver, Washington, a man aggressively reversed a truck towards a crowd of people who had been counter-protesting. Later, the same driver was apprehended by police. The incident came less than a month after the car attack that killed Heather Heyer in Charlottesville, Virginia, after an alt-right rally which she had protested against. Video from local journalists showed the truck reversing down the street towards counter-protesters, blaring the Confederate battle song Dixie on a novelty airhorn. The truck, which had been circling the town, was reportedly pelted with water bottles and other missiles. When the truck, which sported a Confederate battle flag decal as well as American flags, sped through the intersection of West 6th and Washington Streets, it was followed by a motorcyclist who had been seen leaving the Patriot Prayer rally. Both were stopped by police. The motorcyclist tore off his protective gear and made for counter-protesters before he was stopped. The driver of the truck was apprehended and cuffed. Vancouver police reported two arrests. Protesters claimed that a second truck, white and carrying four passengers – one wearing the black polo-shirt uniform of the “Proud Boys” group, another wearing a Donald Trump cap – was also driving at high speed through the streets, reversing and veering dangerously close to protesters. Greg Liascos, who attended the event, said he saw occupants of the second vehicle “throwing things from the truck” at counter-protesters. Occupants reportedly also used pepper spray. When a plastic bottle and a tennis ball were thrown back, the driver reportedly commenced revving the vehicle and “driving up and reversing down streets” at up to 40mph. Later, a white truck with four occupants matching the eyewitness description was seen being protected by police until it was able to attempt a safe exit. It struck a police vehicle as it pulled away. That truck also carried a Confederate flag decal. Those incidents were the culmination of protests in Vancouver and just across the Columbia river in Portland, Oregon, which Patriot Prayer organizer Joey Gibson had billed as “peaceful”. In Portland, from about 1pm, a token contingent of 10 Patriot Prayer supporters, minus Gibson, paraded inside a barricaded area protected by dozens of riot police. They were outnumbered about 40 to one by antifascist counter-protesters, some wearing masks and black clothing, who ringed the park on its north and west sides. A pushed-over barricade led to an arrest and a police deployment of gas weapons. As a larger contingent of counter-protesters marched on the park from nearby Schrunk Plaza, under the banner of Portland Stands United Against Hate, the Patriot Prayer group left under police escort. As counter-protesters converged on a park further into the downtown area, several were arrested and police deployed “flash bang” stun grenades and gas weapons. In a statement, Portland police said they made seven arrests. After advertising the Portland rally for months, Gibson announced late on Saturday that the main part of his event would move to his home city of Vancouver. He cited concern for the safety of his supporters. The second rally went ahead at Vancouver Landing Ampitheater from 2pm, and a large contingent of police kept apart approximately 100 members of Gibson’s contingent and a group of counter-protesters whose numbers reached around 300. Confrontations began as Gibson’s contingent left the venue around 4pm. They continued intermittently for the next hour as police officers from Vancouver and Portland struggled to contain them. Police tactics in Portland were much more interventionist than at the previous two Patriot Prayer rallies, where a hands-off approach allowed evenly matched groups of protesters and counter-protesters to become involved in running brawls. Gibson’s last-minute switching of venues was reminiscent of his approach in the Bay Area last month, when Patriot Prayer cancelled a permitted event in San Francisco and then confronted a large counter-protest the next day at an unpermitted event in Berkeley. The Portland rally was the latest in a series of 13 events by Vancouver-based Patriot Prayer in liberal cities including Portland, Seattle, Berkeley and Olympia, Washington."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"inequality/2017/sep/10/how-to-tackle-the-power-of-the-aristocracy","type":"article","sectionId":"inequality","sectionName":"Inequality","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T17:33:06Z","webTitle":"How to tackle the power of the aristocracy | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/sep/10/how-to-tackle-the-power-of-the-aristocracy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/inequality/2017/sep/10/how-to-tackle-the-power-of-the-aristocracy","fields":{"headline":"How to tackle the power of the aristocracy","bodyText":"A propos Chris Bryant’s article (How the aristocracy preserved their power, 7 September), it is worth observing how the aristocracy actually preserve their day-to-day relevance. Aristocratic society has access to private schools (7% of all students), private hospitals and health care, private banks and other private financial arrangements. They are ably mentored by Oxford and Cambridge universities (50% of students from private schools) in appointments to the commanding heights of the law, the courts, the army, the navy and the air force, the civil service, local government, the Anglican church and the media (if they wish to work). Dressed up in crowns, coronets, mitres, helmets and wigs, aristocratic society parades itself before a loyal and devoted public who voted Brexit to protect their traditions. Miles Secker Heckington, Lincolnshire • Chris Bryant’s article reminds us that the key to power and wealth is land monopoly. So long as we perpetuate the legacy of past corruption by landowning politicians voted in by a tiny landowning electorate, we have little hope of change. A century ago the historian Tom Johnston urged us to “dissolve the halo of divinity that surrounds the hereditary title” and “shatter the romance that keeps the nation numb and spellbound while privilege picks its pocket”. Yet even in Johnston’s native Scotland, the current parliament’s flagship land reform policy has been half-hearted community right-to-buy legislation which can only tentatively nibble at the edges of the problem. The real solution is through the fiscal system by means of land value taxation. This is the only way to recognise the axiom that the land belongs to all of us while avoiding the absurdity of wholesale reacquisition and reallocation. We happily allow land rents to flow into private pockets that ought to be returned to the public purse to provide a huge revenue stream. Then we could begin to lift the burden of oppressive taxation on work and enterprise. The power base of the landowning elite would simultaneously be neutralised. John Digney Buchlyvie, Stirling • Chris Bryant might have usefully talked to a trust expert before writing that discretionary trusts evade “both public scrutiny and inheritance tax”. Since 1983, discretionary trusts have been subject to ongoing inheritance tax. Moreover, while trustees have long had to identify all those benefiting from a trust and report them to tax authorities, there is now a comprehensive register of all trusts that generate UK tax consequences giving the details of all those connected with the trust. Trusts are widely used by families for reasons totally unrelated to taxation. They are, however, pretty poor tools with which to evade taxes or hide funds from the authorities because they are subject to very significant disclosure obligations and ongoing scrutiny. George Hodgson Chief executive, Step (association of family inheritance practitioners) • Chris Bryant’s article reiterates some tired complaints about the cost of the House of Lords, including regurgitating the hoary old chestnut about Lords’ £300 daily expense allowance, but the article’s figures are misleading and lack context. Peers receive no salary and no pension. Even if a peer claimed the full entitlement and attended every single day parliament was in session it would only amount to a portion of an MP’s basic salary. The total cost of members’ expenditure in 2015-16 was £20,037,000, or around £25,000 per peer – one-third of an MP’s basic salary of £74,000 (now over £76,000 in 2017) and in total less than half the basic salary bill for MPs in that year of £48,100,000, even before considering pensions. On top of this, MPs’ expenses claims for 2015-16 exceeded £113,650,000. Even though there are hundreds more lords than MPs, the House of Lords costs a fraction to run than the Commons. Despite the lazy stereotypes and disingenuous media headlines trying to stoke scandal, the Lords is actually a paragon of parsimony compared to the Commons’ egregious largesse. Should the Lords ever be replaced with an elected senate its members would demand salaries and pensions like their elected Commons counterparts. Robert Frazer Salford • Some years ago a friend who had access to the Duke of Westminster’s Eaton Hall estate took a visitor from Holland on a long tour of it. After several hours, the puzzled Dutchman asked: “Are we still on this Duke’s land?” and, on being told this was so, shook his head and said: “I don’t understand why you English are not all communists.” Robert Anderson Nantwich, Cheshire • Chris Bryant has surely written a manifesto for the speedy introduction of a land value tax. Pam Lunn Kenilworth, Warwickshire • Polly Toynbee (5 September) rails against the nonsense of Brexit – but rest assured little will happen to stop the disaster that is about to befall us all because it is being pushed through by an establishment that wishes us to revert as far as possible to the 19th century. Will Hutton summarised the background brilliantly in his 1995 book The State We’re In, which identified many of the UK’s problems that Brexit will certainly make worse: the dominance of the City, the realm of private education, the prevalence of appointing senior people only from Oxford and Cambridge, the absence of a written constitution, a House of Lords without serious powers to modify legislation, a constitutional monarchy, the privatisation of many of our public services, the poor systems of training and of course inequality. These have been a feature of British life for perhaps 200 years and remain so in 2017. The will only be changed by a party committed to change but one not so leftwing as to alienate reasonable people. Sir Keir Starmer has made a modest start. Only people of his stature and political persuasion can make the changes we need. Some hope before April 2019.

His Napoleonic belief in his destiny was not focused on fashion until, at 29, he met at dinner Yves Saint Laurent, the fragile prodigy aged 22 who had suddenly inherited the house of Christian Dior. It was love at first conversation, about everything but fashion, so intense that Bergé forthwith left the artist Bernard Buffet, whose amanuensis he had been for years. From then on, it was all about Yves. When Saint Laurent broke down during a rough first month as an army conscript, Bergé tracked him to a military hospital, and used his formidable energy and social aptitude to gain access. He became Saint Laurent’s support, suing the house of Dior for damages (Marc Bohan had taken Saint Laurent’s job) to fund an independent YSL atelier to which Dior personnel defected. Bergé grasped that Paris couture was ailing, its houses’ commercial ventures too tentative when demographic and economic forces were opening up markets. He persuaded, or browbeat, Saint Laurent (Bergé alternated as hard and soft cop) into ready-to-wear in 1966, a financial and critical success. Perhaps their compatibility – also combatability, given their opposite temperaments – came from outsidership. Saint Laurent was from Algeria, Bergé from the Île d’Oléron, an offshore island in the Bay of Biscay. Both had scant formal education and dreamed of Paris. At 17, Bergé left his father, Pierre, a civil servant, and mother Christiane (nee Sicard), to make his fortune in the capital. His accounts of his rise sound like a young-man-on-the-make from a Balzac novel; he traded in old books (collecting rare volumes all his life) and at 19 founded a shortlived anarchist magazine, La Patrie Mondiale. However, Bergé’s gift lay in meeting persons of consequence, by contrivance or accident: he claimed that the poet Jacques Prévert fell out of a window on to his head, that he shared a cell with the writer Albert Camus after a demo. Through Buffet he knew Jean Cocteau, through Cocteau Dior – et voilà! – Saint Laurent. YSL ready-to-wear was merely Bergé’s initial bold move; as company president, he sold its rights in 1971 for capital to invest in a different way of staging couture shows, more like rock concerts, with clothes as loss-leaders to promote licensed accessories and perfumes. (YSL made enough to buy back the rights in 1973.) Bergé made complex deals when the luxury conglomerates of today had not yet managed their first merger; in 1986 he sold 25% of YSL for enough to buy Charles of the Ritz, which owned rights to Saint Laurent perfumes and cosmetics. In 1989, the YSL group, with its Bergé–generated internal synergy, was the first designer house listed on the Paris Bourse, oversubscribed by 27 times. Those who got shares did exceptionally well for a while, but Bergé did better. He was fined 1m francs for insider trading, selling shares just before an announcement of plunging profits, while the pharmaceutical company Elf Sanofi paid over the market rate for the 44% of the capital held by Saint Laurent and Bergé before purchasing the group in 1993. Sanofi sold it on to Gucci in 1999, still with the vestigial involvement of Saint Laurent and Bergé, who did not leave as president until 2002. While together, the couple created museum-like apartments in Paris and New York, a Normandy chateau with every room named after a Proust character, a villa and the glorious Jardin Marjorelle in Marrakesh. They split personally in 1976, when Saint Laurent’s perma-depression veered towards drink, drugs, and seclusion, although Bergé, patient with Saint Laurent despite being a prowling, growling panther, claws out, towards everyone else, kept his faith as well as the business going. They lunched daily, and Bergé, who respected Saint Laurent’s creativity, if not his metier (“a man of exceptional intelligence practising the trade of an imbecile” was his description) used his arts network to promote exhibitions of Saint Laurent. Showcasing a living designer was a novelty, and Bergé went wide with it, to museums in Beijing, Moscow and New York. Bergé never ceased buzzing around the arts, owning the Théâtre de l’Athénée-Louis Jouvet, with weekly recitals by the best voices in town. As a lifelong socialist, albeit of the “caviar left”, supporting François Mitterrand, he refused a Mitterand cabinet post but accepted the presidency of the Paris Opera, in charge of the new Bastille Opera House, Palais Garnier and Salle Favart, from 1989 to 1994. There he vented even more ferocious temperament than he had in fashion, sacking musical director Daniel Barenboim for “too little work for too much reward”, and disputing with ballet director Rudolf Nureyev over his international schedule. Leading conductors refused to enter the Bastille, senior staff escaped it; the theatres were in turmoil. Bergé delivered far fewer productions than promised, and most were failures. Mitterrand, a close friend of Bergé, appointed him an officer of the National Order of Merit (1987) and he was later appointed a grand officer of the Légion d’Honneur (2015). In 2010 he was one of the new investors who bought a controlling stake in the newspaper Le Monde. Bergé went through a ceremony with Saint Laurent to become legal civil partners shortly before the designer died in 2008, and after disposed of their art collections, reserving only Jardin Marjorelle as their joint memorial, with a Saint Laurent museum. This year Bergé married his long-term partner, the Jardin’s director Madison Cox, who survives him. • Pierre Bergé, businessman, born 14 November 1930; died 8 September 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"law/2017/sep/10/vietnam-city-french-holding-camp-uk-migrants","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T15:44:57Z","webTitle":"Inside Vietnam City, the French holding camp for vulnerable UK-bound migrants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/sep/10/vietnam-city-french-holding-camp-uk-migrants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2017/sep/10/vietnam-city-french-holding-camp-uk-migrants","fields":{"headline":"Inside Vietnam City, the French holding camp for vulnerable UK-bound migrants","bodyText":"Detailed accounts of a holding camp in Northern France, where hundreds of vulnerable Vietnamese young people are housed every year before being smuggled into exploitation in the UK, have prompted anti-trafficking charities to call on the British and French governments to disrupt the criminal networks running the site. Hidden in woodland, on the site of an old coalmine, the well-organised camp known as Vietnam City is usually home to between 40 and 100 Vietnamese migrants, some of them minors, who are on their way to the UK to work illegally in cannabis farms, nail bars and restaurants, according to charity workers who recently visited. New, previously unpublished photos from the camp show squalid living conditions, with residents cooking and sleeping in unsafe conditions in a derelict coalminers’ barracks, with a collapsed roof and no heating. The site, about 60 miles (100km) south-east of Calais, has been chosen by traffickers because of its proximity to a service station on the motorway where lorry drivers stop to rest, before travelling to the ferry port to cross to England. There is less security here than at the port, so it is easier to smuggle people into vehicles. Although the site is understood to have existed for over a decade, hidden in plain sight at the edge of the town of Angres, there has been little concerted effort to close it by the French police and no effective work done by British authorities to address the smuggling of Vietnamese people through France. A group of local residents, the Collectif Fraternité Migrants, pays for wood for the stove and has installed a generator in the camp, and food donations are delivered once or twice a week. The local government has supplied cold running water, and a French medical charity makes weekly visits to the site. The issue of trafficking and exploitation of Vietnamese people in cannabis farms and nail bars in the UK is the subject of a report from the UK’s anti-slavery commissioner, Kevin Hyland, due to be published on Monday. However there is growing frustration from charities working to protect Vietnamese people trafficked into the UK that so little has been done to stop the trade in vulnerable people from impoverished rural parts of Vietnam. In recent years police have repeatedly raided cannabis farms across the UK, staffed by Vietnamese young people. Earlier this year a former nuclear bunker in Wiltshire was found to have been converted into a cannabis farm on an industrial scale, with four Vietnamese workers locked inside. There have been no prosecutions of people-traffickers bringing Vietnamese labourers into the UK, although last month a British woman was found guilty of trying to smuggle 12 Vietnamese migrants into the UK from Calais, in a van loaded with tyres. Four men, five women and three children were found after a Border Force officer saw a pair of legs protruding from the tyres in the back of the van. Chloe Setter, head of advocacy, policy and campaigns at Ecpat UK, which works on child-trafficking to Britain, said: “Vietnam is almost consistently the top country for adults and children trafficked to the UK and it has been well documented that there has been a ‘Vietnam City’ in northern France where many Vietnamese migrants pass through en route to the UK. Yet there appears to have been little effort made by the UK or French authorities to prevent or disrupt the trafficking of Vietnamese people to the UK, despite the known threat. “It quite beggars belief that vulnerable children and adults have been allowed for so many years to live in an isolated makeshift encampment in a forest and left open to such a huge risk of exploitation. Such inaction renders the UK government’s purported tough approach to modern slavery pretty hollow.” Mimi Vu, of the Vietnam-based anti-trafficking charity Pacific Links Foundation, has visited the camp twice in the past year. She said there were 39 men and one woman at the site when she visited in May. A few of the group were minors. “Everyone in the camp planned on working in nail salons in the UK, even though none had prior experience or training as nail technicians,” she wrote in a report on the visit. They had been told that it was usual “for men to be nail technicians in the UK, and that western women were used to men doing their nails”. There was disbelief when “we tried (gently) to correct these assumptions,” she wrote. All the camp’s residents assumed that they would find work easily in the UK and none wanted to remain in France. Some were aware of the issue of exploitation in cannabis farms in the UK, but did not believe it would happen to them, Vu said. She believes that the camp has continued to exist under the radar because the migrants are not looking to work in France and are not a strain on local resources. Everyone is housed there temporarily until they are able to get on a lorry to take them to the UK. Most are there between a week and two months. A recent study published by the charity France Terre d’Asile suggests that most migrants in the camp are fleeing poverty in rural parts of Vietnam, where the average salary for people working in agricultural labour is £88 a month. Some have paid up to £33,000 to agencies to be taken to the UK to work. Others have been tricked into exploitation, and told that they will be given legal jobs in the UK. Local volunteers understand that the Angres mayor’s office has plans to demolish the unsafe buildings later this month, prompting concern about where the camp’s residents will relocate. A spokesman from the NSPCC’s child-trafficking unit described the camp as “unregulated and dangerous”. “Children being trafficked to the UK from Vietnam continues to be a significant concern in the UK and we must try to protect those we know are at risk”, he said. “There need to be facilities in place that can stop young people from falling into the hands of traffickers, who often deceive them with promises of a better life.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/10/apples-latest-iphone-name-leaks-ahead-of-official-release","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T02:15:00Z","webTitle":"iPhone X: Apple’s latest iPhone name leaks ahead of official release","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/10/apples-latest-iphone-name-leaks-ahead-of-official-release","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/sep/10/apples-latest-iphone-name-leaks-ahead-of-official-release","fields":{"headline":"iPhone X: Apple’s latest iPhone name leaks ahead of official release","bodyText":"Apple’s latest iPhone will be called the iPhone X, according to a leaked report. The name of the phone – rumored to be priced at close to $1,000 and set to be launched on Tuesday at the company’s new multibillion-dollar headquarters – was first reported by the Apple news website 9to5Mac. The site reported that two other new phones would be called the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. The launch marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, Apple’s most successful product. With the company’s self-driving car project Titan reportedly taking a back seat, the new phones may offer an indication of Apple’s next direction. The model names were discovered and tweeted by a game developer, Steven Troughton-Smith, from a release of software code. According to 9to5Mac, the 8 and 8 Plus will be basic upgrades on the 7 and 7 Plus models and will feature glass back panels, a new micro-processing chip and wireless inductive charging. The iPhone X is the model that has Apple fans excited. Apple is expected to do away with the traditional home button on the front – Bloomberg reported that a series of gestures will control the phone – and to introduce a high-definition 5.8in OLED display featuring accommodations for the front camera, earpiece and 3D sensors and extending to the edges at the top, bottom and sides of the device. The operating system is also reported to include a new biometric authentication mechanism, Face ID, that uses sensors that can recognize a user looking at the display. Another innovation is reportedly a messaging app, Animoji, that uses the 3D technology to create emojis reflecting the user’s expression. The leak may embarrass Apple, which prides itself on guarding new products and capabilities. Soon after becoming chief executive in 2012, Tim Cook said he planned to make secrecy a priority. In June, the Outline news site revealed that the company had hired former employees at the National Security Agency to help catch leakers. Details of the new iPhone line-up had already been revealed inadvertently, as in August when Apple published code for its HomePod speakers. In the case of the iPhone X, Apple-watchers said they were almost certain the leak was deliberate. “Someone within Apple leaked the list of URLs to 9to5Mac and MacRumors,” wrote John Gruber of Daring Fireball. “I’m nearly certain this wasn’t a mistake, but rather a deliberate malicious act by a rogue Apple employee. Whoever did this is the least-popular person in Cupertino. More surprises were spoiled by this leak than any leak in Apple history.” The company, with a market value of $815bn and a $250bn cash stockpile, is also likely to announce a new generation of Apple Watch with standalone cell phone capability and a 4K Apple TV. The biggest launch of all, though, will be the Norman Foster-designed Apple Park, the company’s giant campus in Cupertino, California, regarded as co-founder Steve Jobs’ last design creation. The product presentation will be in the Steve Jobs Theater, a glass-walled auditorium that seats 1,000. Apple’s chief designer, Sir Jony Ive, recently told the Wall Street Journal the headquarters project evoked the same set of feelings as a new consumer product. “That feels, I don’t know, encouragingly healthy, because I would be concerned if we lost that sense of anxiety,” he said. “I think that would suggest that we were not as self-critical, not as curious, not as inquisitive as we have to be to be able to be effective and do good work.” Despite some anxiety that Apple’s close-knit creative spirit might be stressed by the move, Cook said the new HQ was designed to inspire collaborative innovation. “We didn’t plan our growth, and then when we saw our growth, we were so engrossed in trying to push things forward that we didn’t spend time to really develop the workplace,” says Cook. “We’ve done a really good job of working around it, but it’s not the way we want to be working, nor does it represent our culture well.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/sep/11/chris-froome-vuelta-espana-tour-de-france-double","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"Riding the Tour de France and Vuelta is one thing, winning them quite another | William Fotheringham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/11/chris-froome-vuelta-espana-tour-de-france-double","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/11/chris-froome-vuelta-espana-tour-de-france-double","fields":{"headline":"Riding the Tour de France and Vuelta is one thing, winning them quite another","bodyText":"As Chris Froome flew south from Asturias to Madrid for a final, ceremonial Vuelta stage in the Spanish capital on Sunday morning, Bernard Hinault was standing with his gun on the edge of a maize field in Brittany, waiting for wild boar to emerge from cover. The last man to win the double of Tour of Spain and Tour de France in the same year, back in 1978, the “Badger” said he believes that Froome, who was set to emulate him after 39 years, should go on next year to attempt a grand slam of all three major Tours in 12 months by tackling the Giro d’Italia before going on to tilt for a fifth Tour de France title. “He should try that,” said Hinault. “He has proved that you can win the Tour and the Vuelta in the same year, so why not the Giro? What he has managed in Spain is a great thing because the general view was that it was not possible to win either the Giro and Tour or the Tour and Vuelta in the modern era. He wasn’t as dominant as usual in the Tour but he’s really rediscovered his true capacity at the Vuelta, in spite of having one or two difficult days.” Why not the Giro? While the appeal of a grand slam is obvious for romantics, Team Sky have built their success over the last few years on ruthless pragmatism. The risk of compromising a fifth Tour win is obvious. On a practical level, as Sir Bradley Wiggins found out, the Giro carries its own unique challenges, including poor weather, not to mention a wealth of climbs unknown to Froome that would have to be reconnoitred in a relatively short time frame. The risk of over-reach and emerging with nothing is surely too great. Hinault responded approvingly when told of the way that the four-times Tour winner had handled Saturday’s key final mountain stage. Froome saw his key rival, Vincenzo Nibali, fall on the descent from the Alto del Cordal to the foot of the Angliru, and backed off the pace, making sure that he stayed upright even though his caution permitted Alberto Contador and his team-mate Jarlinson Pantano to race clear in what proved the stage-winning escape. “Froome’s management of stage racing is as good as ever. He can adopt precisely the tactic that’s required to win. You have to keep that bigger view of where each moment is going to lead.” Looking at the bigger picture, Hinault feels one cannot rank the feats of riders such as himself, Froome, Eddy Merckx and Jacques Anquetil, the only other rider to win Vuelta and Tour in the same year. “These are different eras, with different riders, different equipment and a different calendar. You should take each achievement for what it is and when it is.” Froome’s victory in the Vuelta and his capture of the Tour-Vuelta double after three attempts reflects the domination of three-week stage races by the 32-year-old and Team Sky since 2013, to an extent which has not been seen since Miguel Indurain’s purple patch between 1991 and 1995, when the Spaniard won five Tours and two Giri. Lance Armstrong, even during his EPO and blood-bag fuelled dominance of the Tour de France between 1999 and 2005 – or perhaps because of the way he was manipulating his body – never stretched to targeting a second three-week stage race in the same season. When the Badger and Anquetil managed their doubles of Vuelta and Tour, the Vuelta had a late April-mid-May calendar slot, which meant it was possible to race a full spring programme of Paris-Nice and the Classics, then carry that form into the Vuelta, but the risk was that a rider would end up raced-out by July. The more parochial nature of cycling up to the 1990s, plus the obvious difficulty of peaking twice in the season, meant the Vuelta was rarely on the hit list. The restructuring of the calendar in 1995 turned the challenge of targeting the Tour and Vuelta into a matter of holding form, physically and mentally, for 11 or 12 weeks, including the most demanding and draining event in the cycling calendar. The scale of that challenge can be seen by looking at the fortunes of Romain Bardet, Simon Yates and Fabio Aru, challengers at the Tour but unable to make much impact on the Vuelta. Contador rode with immense courage and charisma in Spain, as in France, but never looked a true threat once he had lost time in Andorra. Riding the Tour and Vuelta is one thing, racing them to win and managing to win them is clearly quite another. “Given that they are so close together it’s extremely hard to keep your form over that period,” said Froome on Saturday. “That’s a huge part of why no one has managed it before. I’ve found that to be the challenge previously. We did it by backing off earlier in the year – [I had] much fewer race days before the Tour – coming in fresher to the Tour. Maybe I wasn’t quite at 100% for the start of the Tour. If I’m brutally honest, my climbing wasn’t up to scratch at the Tour.” The gamble Froome took was to risk turning up at the Tour below his best; it paid off, though he won it on his own admission with little fanfare. Over the three weeks of the Vuelta he rode an almost perfect race but, as Hinault says, that is to be expected of a rider who has now contested almost a dozen Grand Tours. A mature rider at the height of his powers should know when to make the efforts necessary to gain time, be it a few seconds here and there, and to limit his losses on the bad days such as Las Machucos. Additionally Team Sky’s resources meant that they could field almost completely different line-ups in Spain and France but of virtually equal strength. By this time of the season much of the peloton are racing on fumes but at one point on Saturday, at the foot of the Angliru, Sky had six riders in a lead group of 12. Froome was rarely alone on the road; most critically, their key support climber Wout Poels’s injury earlier in the season leading to the difficult decision to keep him out of the Tour meant he turned up fresh at the Vuelta, which helps explain his final sixth place overall. Over the years Team Sky have singularly failed to endear themselves to those with a romantic vision of cycling or doubts over the sport’s ethical issues. The UKAD inquiry into the Jiffy bag affair remains unresolved after almost a year and the questions it raises may never be answered. The debate is inevitable. However, the ability of Froome and his team to manage a Grand Tour from conception to consummation, its build-up and its direction on the road, should never be minimised and should be admired for what it is. Love them or loathe them, cavil at the resources they employ or laud them for the level to which they have taken their sport, Team Sky are the supreme practitioners of their art."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/10/blair-and-adonis-have-spoken-but-will-france-and-germany-help-remainers","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T18:16:10Z","webTitle":"Blair and Adonis have spoken, but will France and Germany help remainers?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/10/blair-and-adonis-have-spoken-but-will-france-and-germany-help-remainers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/10/blair-and-adonis-have-spoken-but-will-france-and-germany-help-remainers","fields":{"headline":"Blair and Adonis have spoken, but will France and Germany help remainers?","bodyText":"Tony Blair and Andrew Adonis, his former Downing Street policy chief, have made separate if coordinated proposals for new controls on UK migration as a viable route back from Brexit and for the UK’s continued membership of the EU single market. To some, the proposals appear like a pro-remain version of Boris Johnson’s love of having and eating cakes – another British offer to remain in the single market so long as Britain can destroy it. To others, it is an attempt to inject some political and strategic realism into the remain position. The ideas lean heavily on the presumption that there is an untapped mood in France and Germany to help the British pro-Europeans. The Blair pamphlet makes references to a smattering of largely middle-ranking former ministers and a thinktank to suggest there is a mood for reform. Lord Adonis suggests that French and German politicians might support free movement reform and make a direct appeal to the British people over the heads of the UK government next summer as the moment of Brexit arrives, thereby making a referendum on the terms feasible. A similar claim about a hidden flexibility has been made for more than a year by Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister who does have good connections with senior liberal politicians on the continent. Blair has good European contacts of his own: for instance, he visited the commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and met Sandro Gozi, the influential Italian European minister, in London last week. Blair specifically suggests Britain can make common cause with Emmanuel Macron, the mercurial French president who, sensing the political danger of unfettered free movement, has issued a démarche against wage undercutting permitted by the 1996 EU posted workers directive – an initiative that has led him over the past months into direct and personal conflict with the Polish government. In Germany, it is said that if Angela Merkel is re-elected on 24 September, she may, especially if in a coalition with Free Democrats, show a new flexibility and might support the idea of an emergency brake on migration – an idea she rejected in her largely fruitless discussions with David Cameron before the referendum. The Blair-Adonis axis argues argue that it is clear next year’s Italian elections may well turn on the issue of migration. There are changes to migration that Europe could either adopt, or allow the UK to adopt, that do not breach the fundamental principle of free movement, one of the pillars of the EU. This makes a new settlement possible. At a minimum, Blair is right to say the UK could have done more to control migration within the EU framework than it has. He is also right to say the single greatest ingredient of modern politics is volatility and soothsaying is the most discredited profession. But scanning French, German or indeed European commission politics, there is precious little sign that the EU is willing to shift on the principle of free movement, even in a concession to pro-Europeans such as Blair. The intellectual energy in Europe is devoted to greater future political and economic integration, as evidenced by Macron’s strongly pro-European speech to the Greeks alongside the Parthenon last week. With the exception of the posted workers directive, the bulk of the EU’s concern about migration concerns people from abroad, from Libya and Turkey, but not about internal free movement within the EU. The remarkable aspect of the German election is the extent to which migration has not been the issue to damage Merkel. Germans seem reluctantly willing to accept 2015 was a one-off response to a humanitarian disaster and Merkel does not offer a policy of open borders. The German elections are focused on security, Turkey, childcare and the necessity of Europe in the age of Donald Trump – not on keeping eastern Europeans out of the country. In the case of France, Blair is right to say Macron, facing a battle over labour and welfare reform, has tried to gather some political capital by going into battle over social dumping – the practice whereby employers use cheaper labour than is typically available locally by using migrant workers. He has won the support of Germany, Austria, Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg. His changes to the posted workers directive, due to be discussed at EU level on 23 October, are not trivial – and he has toured eastern European capitals to explain his plans. They say that no posted worker should be given a secondment of more than 12 months; that pay, including transport and accommodation, should be guaranteed at the same as the local rate; and that a European platform should be set up to crack down on fraudulent countries. The Polish prime minister, Beata Szydło, who is fearful that tens of thousands of Poles will lose pay or work, has denounced Macron’s initiative as “a fundamental attack on the pillars of the European Union”, calling it “protectionism”. Reform to the directive would have some practical impact on wages of eastern European workers in the UK, and perhaps a marginal impact on low skilled labour market. The EU recorded more than 54,300 posted workers in the UK in 2005. But it is hardly a game-changer. Blair, however, has failed to find much evidence that the EU would be willing to accept an emergency brake on the number of EU migrants reaching the UK, as opposed to a brake on their benefits, the deal Cameron negotiated with the commission in 2016. Macron, at least temperamentally, seems to have put UK membership of the EU behind him to focus on what he describes as the miracle of Europe. In his speech in Athens, he repeatedly conceded Europe’s egregious mistakes, its lies and the need to be refounded. “In Europe today, sovereignty, democracy and trust are in danger … We must rediscover the enthusiasm that the union was founded upon and change, not with technocrats and not with bureaucracy.” But his foundation is integrationist. He reiterated his plan to establish “democratic conventions” in EU member states, where “the peoples of Europe will be consulted and will debate on principles proposed by the governments”. He also wants pan-European lists for European elections, greater integration of the eurozone and a common budget. He does not sound like a man willing to delay the project just to give Britain, even one nurtured by an impeccable centrist like Blair, another chance to climb back on board."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/10/barack-obama-rang-with-reassurance-for--theresa-may-on-election-night","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T16:48:06Z","webTitle":"Barack Obama 'rang with reassurance for May' on election night","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/10/barack-obama-rang-with-reassurance-for--theresa-may-on-election-night","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/10/barack-obama-rang-with-reassurance-for--theresa-may-on-election-night","fields":{"headline":"Barack Obama 'rang with reassurance for May' on election night","bodyText":"Barack Obama rang Conservative headquarters on election night with a mistaken but reassuring message for Theresa May because Labour insiders had told him the party was expecting to lose seats, according to a new book about the election. Shortly before the exit poll, which sent shockwaves through both party headquarters, the former US president contacted a friend in Tory central office with the soothing news that Labour was expecting to see the Conservatives increase their majority. The revelation is contained in extracts from a new book, Betting the House, by the journalists Tom McTague and Tim Ross, published in the Mail on Sunday, that the prime minister appeared to be a germaphobe and reluctant to visit party HQ as a result - and that the results of the election night exit poll leaked early. They write that Fiona Hill, one of May’s joint chiefs of staff, was tipped off a few minutes in advance about the result of the exit poll, which is usually tightly guarded by broadcasters. The BBC presenter Andrew Marr admits to having contacted Tory HQ with details of the exit poll that contradicted Obama’s message before the results were announced but told the authors it was only seconds before 10pm. Details of the poll are kept to a very small team of senior staff. The initial reaction to the exit poll, which is a large-scale survey of thousands of voters as they leave their polling stations, was disbelief. May’s other chief of staff, Nick Timothy, reportedly winked and told a colleague: “Don’t worry about that, it’s all fine. Nothing we’ve seen says anything like it.” But as results from constituencies up and down the country confirmed the accuracy of the exit poll, Timothy apparently wondered aloud whether May should consider stepping down rather than endure the wave of criticism that would follow. The book claims that May’s husband, Philip, thought that his tearful wife might have to resign for the sake of her “wellbeing”. But the authors claim May became determined to stay on after the Brexit secretary, David Davis, said he would support her, and she received a text message from Boris Johnson in the early hours of the morning urging her to keep her “chin up”, and promising: “We are with you and behind you.” The pair were considered the most likely leadership contenders in the aftermath of the catastrophic election result. The authors also reveal that May rarely visited party workers, fearing that Conservative HQ was “a pit of germs”. “There were quite a lot of germs flying around,” one Conservative source said. When the prime minister did finally arrive to give a morale-boosting speech to staff, it was a rehash of her already wearily familiar stump speech. “It was all ‘strong and stable’ and the risks of Corbyn’s ‘coalition of chaos’. I couldn’t believe it,” one eyewitness said. Some party workers began visibly checking their phones for Twitter updates. “This was the prime minister of the United Kingdom talking in the middle of an election to her own campaign staff and she couldn’t even hold the room,” the source told McTague and Ross. The extracts suggest May’s advisers were bitterly divided between presenting her as a radical reformer, or the “strong and stable” face of continuity. At an “away day” in February in her country retreat, Chequers, May’s political strategist Chris Wilkins and Timothy set out a series of social and economic reforms, and said the prime minister must be presented as “the person who always fought for relentless change”. But Crosby, the Australian elections expert, dismissed their approach as “classic populist woolly bullshit”, according to the book. Crosby told the senior advisers, who had gathered to discuss the party’s strategy over a meal of chicken lasagne and potatoes: “By the way, mate, it’s not about being the change candidate, it’s about doing what people want.” Crosby, regarded as one of the masterminds of David Cameron’s unexpected victory in 2015, was sceptical about the idea of an early election, which May had repeatedly said was not necessary. But he and colleague Mark Textor nevertheless took on the job of advising the Conservatives. When the election campaign kicked off, the stripped down message of strong and stable leadership became the central thrust of the Tory campaign – and allowed Labour to present Jeremy Corbyn as offering a radical alternative for voters disgruntled with the status quo. Wilkins told Ross and McTague: “In the campaign, we basically just screwed the brand completely, hers and the party’s. We suddenly became the establishment candidate and Corbyn the candidate for change.” Timothy was determined to press ahead with some policies for change – including the controversial changes to social care funding that were included in the manifesto. And May reportedly backed his determination to include detailed policy in the closely guarded document, despite Crosby’s argument that: “I hate policy, it only causes problems.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/11/happy-birthday-scottish-parliament-independence-holyrood-20-years","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T05:00:04Z","webTitle":"Happy birthday, Scottish parliament.

You’ve given us independence of mind","bodyText":"Twenty years ago today Scotland voted 3:1 for the establishment of a Scottish parliament. It was a very different political time: Diana’s death, Britpop and Bill Clinton in the White House. It was clear the old Westminster system of governing Scotland was discredited. Voters recognised it was undemocratic, and produced bad politics and legislation. The case for change had become a consensus – “the settled will” in John Smith’s description – that the referendum merely validated. Twenty years later devolution has been a success. There are no serious calls for the Scottish parliament to be abolished or for a return of direct rule from Westminster. Ruth Davidson and the Tories long ago made their peace. The late Tam Dalyell was the last expression of such a politics. The Scottish public now view the Scottish parliament, rather than Westminster, as the most important political institution. Irrespective of formal independence, Scotland already has an informal independence of the mind in how it talks, thinks and acts. Many good things have happened: land reform, the smoking ban, and a Scotland more at ease with itself on gender equality, sexual equality, sectarianism and multiculturalism. But in a politics supposedly about difference, many of these gains have been about making Scotland more cosmopolitan and like most other western countries. All of this isn’t quite the brave new politics promised in 1997. Instead, much of Scottish politics looks like politics elsewhere, including Westminster. Political power sits not with the Scottish parliament, but with the Scottish government and civil service. There is an adversarial party politics and the remorseless centralisation of public bodies, such as the creation of Police Scotland, with little obvious gain. Scottish ministers gather more and more power into their hands with few checks and balances, or obvious benefits. Beyond this there has been little devolution dividend: economically, socially, in public services, or in relation to what groups have power and influence. This could have embraced a distinct take on public service reform that widened the life chances of the disadvantaged, or tackled the systematic exclusion of working-class children from the opportunities they deserve. The SNP until now has been able to ride two horses at the same time. It has positioned itself as the party of the insiders: of getting things done, delivery and competence. At the same time it has posed as the party of change: of social justice, fairness and the champion of social democracy. This balancing act – of incumbency and insurgency – worked wonders for the party in the late, hectic stages of the 2014 indyref and the aftermath of the 2015 UK election. But after 10 years in office it has begun to look less and less sustainable and plausible. Devolution had many midwives – Labour, the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, churches, trade unions, NGOs and wider civil society. Most important was a public consensus. But while the latter wanted change, it wasn’t quite clear what kind of change they wanted. For some, devolution was about a rejection of Thatcherism; for others a return to the certainty of the Britain of 1945-75, and a Scottish version of the best strands of this age: the NHS, welfare state and BBC. Large parts of institutional opinion, and Labour in particular, didn’t want devolution to bring about change, but merely to refresh the shop window while leaving the business behind it untouched. Devolution was for Scottish Labour about shoring up its northern citadel, and contributing its bloc to Westminster Labour governments. It hasn’t quite worked like that. Labour mini-devolution amounted to an apologetic politics, and was eventually viewed as ineffective by most voters. It was one reason the SNP won in 2007. It seemed to have a story about the Scottish parliament and a vision for Scotland, as well as confidence expressing it. Time has shown the limitations of the SNP, which raises questions about where the politics of change will come from, and who can most successfully adopt the party’s mantle. Change is coming to Scotland. The decline of deference, demographics, Brexit, the squeeze on public spending and the wider age of disruption make this is a certainty. The SNP gave Scotland a distinct voice, but the next decade could be shaped by Nicola Sturgeon’s SNP, Davidson’s newly energised Tories, or a Corbynised Scottish Labour. Nothing in the future can be taken for granted. Happy anniversary, Scottish parliament. We celebrate your existence, not as an end in itself, but as a catalyst for further change. • Gerry Hassan is a Scottish writer, commentator and academic"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/13/uk-to-provide-further-25m-aid-to-hurricane-irma-hit-bvi-and-anguilla","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T19:25:13Z","webTitle":"British territories hit by Irma 'too wealthy' to receive aid budget funds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/13/uk-to-provide-further-25m-aid-to-hurricane-irma-hit-bvi-and-anguilla","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/13/uk-to-provide-further-25m-aid-to-hurricane-irma-hit-bvi-and-anguilla","fields":{"headline":"British territories hit by Irma 'too wealthy' to receive aid budget funds","bodyText":"The British government has said it is unable to use its £13bn aid budget to fund the hurricane rescue effort in the Caribbean since the British overseas territories affected are too wealthy to qualify for aid under official international criteria. The criteria for overseas development assistance, enshrined in UK law, are set by the OECD thinktank and agreed to internationally. They have long been criticised by the Conservatives as too restrictive in the definition of combatting poverty. The decision means the government will have to foot a bill that could eventually stretch to more than £100m from the general Treasury funds and not the Department for International Aid budget. A government spokesperson said: “This is an unprecedented disaster and it was absolutely right that the UK responded immediately to the need of the people affected – this was our primary focus and continues to be our priority. “We are looking at how the current overseas aid rules apply to disasters such as this one.” Another official said: “These are British people on British territories and, in times of crisis, we stand by them. Absolutely nothing held us back in sending help. Our response was based on need alone.” The news came as it was announced that the UK was to provide a further £25m aid to the hurricane-wrecked British overseas territories of Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands. Theresa May announced the extra funds as the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, made a visit to the British Caribbean islands. Johnson said: “It is clear this place has been through an absolutely hellish experience and there is no doubt at all that you need help with power generation, with getting the hospital back up and running, getting the airport back up and running, and schools properly set – all kinds of things need to be done.” Johnson flew to Barbados on Tuesday before transferring to a military flight to reach Anguilla and then the BVI to inspect the scale of the damage wrought by Hurricane Irma. Total UK aid has reached £57m, but BVI officials claim many millions more will be needed to help with reconstruction. Political criticism mounted over the UK’s apparent indifference to the islands’ fate, especially compared with the speed and scale of the response of the French president, Emmanuel Macron. Constitutionally, the security of British overseas territories is the responsibility of the UK government. Johnson was given a political boost when Victor Banks, the chief minister of Anguilla, said the UK government had responded within hours, but added a rider that the overall bill for the devastation caused by Hurricane Irma could top $1bn (£751m). Banks said Johnson’s visit to the island “sends a very positive signal to Anguillians that the British are serious about their response to this very severe hurricane”. Johnson dismissed suggestions his visit was a PR stunt, saying: “This has been long-planned ever since the hurricane broke. “They’ve never seen anything like it for 150 years. People don’t realise that these are British people, these are British islanders and we have a duty to them.” According to the Press Association, Johnson gave an upbeat assessment of the scale of the damage, telling a gathering at the home of the governor of Anguilla, Tim Foy, that what he had seen was very surprising. “I had been told it was going to be a scene of devastation from the air and I have to say that I looked down as we flew in and I saw an incredible amount of tidying up had already happened,” he said. UK officials said there was now a military presence on the BVI, Anguilla and the Turks and Caicos Islands. Seven hundred troops had been deployed as well as more than 50 police officers. More than 40 metric tonnes of aid had been distributed including shelter kits for 13,000 people. However, HMS Ocean remained docked in Gibraltar and was not due to depart for the Caribbean for another 24 hours. Its deployment was announced on Thursday. Billionaire businessman Sir Richard Branson, whose Necker Island retreat was devastated by the hurricane, has been in Puerto Rico helping to organise the aid response. He said he had spoken to Johnson and would be returning to the BVI. He said: “There is an extreme sense of urgency to get food, water and aid supplies into the BVI, and we are bringing as much as we can. Once people have these, restoring order and calm to the islands will be far quicker and simpler.” Branson said he was due to meet the deputy prime minister, Kedrick Pickering. upon arrival in the BVI, as well as the governor, Gus Jaspert. He said: “More can be done, but we are trying as hard as possible to get as much food, water and aid in as possible.” Branson’s yacht, Necker Belle, sailed from Barbados full of supplies. Meanwhile, BVI officials are suggesting that non-BVI residents should be evacuated from the islands since there would be no work for them in the foreseeable future. At prime minister’s questions in Westminster, May said the emergency Cobra committee had been meeting regularly, adding: “We have now deployed over 1,000 military personnel to the region, with an additional 200 to arrive in the next few days along with over 60 police.” The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said the UK must respond “as generously as we possibly can” to help those affected by the hurricane. He said: “I hope that the prime minister will be prepared to look carefully at the speed of our response to Hurricane Irma and, if demands are made in the near future from any country affected by it, that Britain will respond as generously as we possibly can to help people at what must be the most catastrophic time of their lives.” May insisted the government had reacted quickly and would be working with overseas territories on reconstruction work."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/13/councils-must-act-to-combat-destitution","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T15:03:51Z","webTitle":"Councils must act to combat destitution | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/13/councils-must-act-to-combat-destitution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/13/councils-must-act-to-combat-destitution","fields":{"headline":"Councils must act to combat destitution","bodyText":"Local welfare assistance schemes are a vital lifeline for people who find themselves in a crisis and without basic essentials, such as food, electricity, or a working oven. It is therefore very worrying that most of these schemes have been cut back considerably in recent years and that 26 local councils have now closed them altogether, including in many areas that we represent (English councils’ local welfare schemes in ‘meltdown’, 12 September). The Grenfell Tower disaster exposed failings in the local authority’s response to a large-scale emergency. The stories in the report by the Centre for Responsible Credit demonstrate the human cost of failing to respond to the smaller-scale emergencies that hit countless individuals and families every day, due to ill-health, the loss of a job, the breakdown of a relationship, or a spell of homelessness. Food banks, Citizens Advice offices, and other voluntary sector organisations play an important role in supporting people in crisis, but they are under enormous pressure due to rising demand and funding cuts. This responsibility must be shared with central and local government, who have a moral duty to ensure there is an adequate safety net to stop people from becoming destitute.

Lord Bell left the agency last summer in a deal thought to be worth as much as £2.5m that included the company buying his stake. Bell’s exit deal involved a series of staged payouts, and the move to put the business into administration on Tuesday has left him owed hundreds of thousands of pounds. “They owe me £300,000 which they won’t [be able] to pay,” he said. “The payments paid to me are spread over a long period of time and include [one due in] the next four months. I won’t see it.” Before the scandal, Bell Pottinger had accumulated debts understood to be in the region of £5m owed to Barclays bank, in part related to payouts to a number of former management, including Bell. The majority of the firm’s 250 staff were made redundant on Tuesday and almost certainly will not receive pay owed to them. About 30 former Bell Pottinger partners who were paid net of tax face huge tax liabilities. The administrators, BDO, which had unsuccessfully sought a buyer for the company in a fire sale, said Bell Pottinger had been “heavily financially impacted” by the loss of clients, partners and staff as the South Africa scandal poisoned the business. The firm was being paid £100,000 a month by its client Oakbay Capital, the holding company of the wealthy, powerful and controversial Gupta family, to run a social media and PR campaign in South Africa focused on “economic apartheid”. The Guptas have been accused of benefiting financially from their close links to the South African president, Jacob Zuma, whose son Duduzane has been a director at several Gupta-owned companies and worked for Oakbay. Both have previously denied such a relationship. Bell has admitted he was part of a Bell Pottinger team that travelled to South Africa in early 2016 to have meeting with members of the Gupta family about representing them. He maintains, however, that he had nothing to do with running the business. He claims he felt the deal was “smelly” and that warnings to agency bosses not to take the account were ignored. Bell, who has set up his own PR firm dealing with the sensitive geopolitical clients with which he made his name, said he was not interested in speaking to administrators about salvaging any part of the firm he set up in 1987. “I am not making any move for the company at all,” he said. “I think the name should go. [Co-founder] Piers [Pottinger] is buying out the Asian business under a new name, so the Pottinger part is disappearing. So Bell will disappear too.” The management of the Asian and Middle East businesses, which are legally separate and have not been affected by the scandal, are in talks with BDO about being spun off and rebranded. Pottinger is attempting to relaunch the Asian business as Klareco Communications, which means “clarity” in Esperanto. Top executives at Bell Pottinger Middle East are understood to be in London this week as part of discussions with potential investors to back its bid to spin off the business, which has its headquarters in Abu Dhabi. In a statement BDO said that it is working with the “remaining partners and employees to seek an orderly transfer of Bell Pottinger’s clients to other firms in order to protect and realise value for creditors”. The Public Relations and Communications Association banned Bell Pottinger last week for at least five years, saying it had never before “passed down such a damning indictment of an agency’s behaviour” – an unprecedented sanction against a City PR firm of Bell Pottinger’s size."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/14/the-case-for-christ-review-movie-lee-strobel-christianity","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T05:00:33Z","webTitle":"The Case for Christ review – atheist hack suffers crisis in preachy drama","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/14/the-case-for-christ-review-movie-lee-strobel-christianity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/14/the-case-for-christ-review-movie-lee-strobel-christianity","fields":{"headline":"The Case for Christ review – atheist hack suffers crisis in preachy drama","bodyText":"From the faith-based studio that brought you God’s Not Dead – and launched a streaming service for Christians presumably reluctant to Netflix and chill – comes this preachily earnest drama adapted from a best-selling book by Lee Strobel (played by Mike Vogel).

Ebrahim Metwally Hegazy disappeared on Sunday while travelling to a session of the UN working group on enforced or involuntary disappearances in Geneva. He reappeared before prosecutors on Tuesday evening charged with “managing an illegal group, spreading false news … [and] cooperating with foreign organisations”. Metwally represents families of people forcibly disappeared by the Egyptian state – when a person is secretly arrested and held in an unknown location without access to legal services – after his son disappeared in 2013. Metwally later founded the Association of the Families of the Disappeared, which provides information to the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms, a Cairo-based NGO. ECRF lawyers have acted as the legal counsel of Giulio Regeni’s family in Egypt after the Cambridge University student disappeared on 25 January 2016. His body was found on an outlying Cairo desert road bearing signs of extreme torture. Mohamed Lotfy, the head of ECRF, said: “Ebrahim had intended to speak [at the conference] about his son and deaths in custody following disappearance. He was going to speak about the Regeni case as the iconic example of this.” Metwally’s arrest comes days before Giampaolo Cantini is due to assume the post of Italian ambassador to Egypt in Cairo. Italy recalled its former ambassador Maurizio Massari in April 2016 due to Egyptian intransigence regarding the investigation into Regeni’s murder. The return of the ambassador is seen as a boon for Egyptian-Italian relations, but the motivation behind Regeni’s murder, and the identity of the culprit or culprits, remain a mystery. Five Egyptian men shot dead by security forces in March 2016 after they were initially alleged to have kidnapped and murdered Regeni were later revealed to have been innocent. “Ibrahim coordinates with families of those disappeared, defends them and attends investigations,” Lotfy said. “He’s an important source of information, not just for campaigns but also when we advise the Regeni family. He provides case examples.” Metwally is the third person to be arrested this year after working on cases of enforced disappearances, and his detention comes less than a week after ECRF’s website was blocked in Egypt. This was swiftly followed by the blocking of Human Rights Watch’s website after it published a report documenting widespread torture by Egyptian police and the national security agency. The HRW report detailed torture methods used by Egyptian security forces, including physical abuse, electric shocks and beatings with metal bars. It also focused on the relationship between arbitrary arrest, enforced disappearances, torture and fabricated cases against detainees. Egypt’s government and local press have expressed outrage over the report, with the Egyptian parliament’s human rights committee saying it was “mired in fallacies and contradictions, attributed to unknown sources and fake names”. Lotfy said the waning international pressure over the Regeni case was allowing Cairo to step up its persecution of rights activists. “I think the government feels it has got away with the Regeni investigation and now they have some breathing room after months of being under pressure,” he said. “The strongest leverage we had against the government was Giulio’s case. It was a headache for the Egyptian government. As soon as it appears to have stopped, they immediately go after those working on enforced disappearances.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/14/ariel-pink-dedicated-to-bobby-jameson-review-scattered-psychedelic-country-tribute","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T21:15:15Z","webTitle":"Ariel Pink: Dedicated to Bobby Jameson review – scattered psychedelic country tribute","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/14/ariel-pink-dedicated-to-bobby-jameson-review-scattered-psychedelic-country-tribute","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/14/ariel-pink-dedicated-to-bobby-jameson-review-scattered-psychedelic-country-tribute","fields":{"headline":"Ariel Pink: Dedicated to Bobby Jameson review – scattered psychedelic country tribute","bodyText":"LA’s Ariel Pink has long been in the business of off-kilter, sardonic, sleazy sounds that cut and paste 60s psychedelia, 70s prog and 80s synthpop with obvious adoration and more than a tinge of ironic pastiche. How, though, could he possibly filter all of it into a concept record? Dedicated to Bobby Jameson is ostensibly themed around the cult Californian singer from the 60s whose career was derailed by drugs and alcohol, except that it’s loaded with strange non-sequiturs – such as the krautrock-heavy Time to Meet Your God, and Santa’s in the Closet, high on cut-price Bowie vibes – which meander away from the central conceit. The moments where Pink truly connects with the Jameson myth – albeit with minimal context for the listener – are the most effective; Another Weekend and the Cure-nodding Feels Like Heaven are raw and authentic in their ennui and romance, while the title track channels Pink’s knack for facsimile into something productive, as he narrates Jameson’s struggles on the Sunset Strip. There are some excellent – even tender – moments here but, as per, only true fans will be able to overlook Pink’s exasperating lack of focus."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/13/may-urged-to-guarantee-prison-and-police-staff-numbers-after-pay-rise","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T12:10:14Z","webTitle":"May urged to guarantee prison and police staff numbers after pay rise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/13/may-urged-to-guarantee-prison-and-police-staff-numbers-after-pay-rise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/13/may-urged-to-guarantee-prison-and-police-staff-numbers-after-pay-rise","fields":{"headline":"May urged to guarantee prison and police staff numbers after pay rise","bodyText":"Theresa May ducked a question from Jeremy Corbyn on whether police or prison officers numbers could be cut in order to fund the pay rises announced for both groups of public sector workers this week. At prime minister’s questions, Corbyn asked: “Can the prime minister guarantee no more police or prison officers will be lost as a result of decisions she has made this week?” May did not answer the question, and instead argued that factors such as incremental progression pay and tax cuts had actually left many public sector staff better off than before. During a prime minister’s questions dominated by low pay and the government’s announcement it was ending the 1% annual limit on public sector pay rises, Corbyn accused May of presiding over a massive reduction in real-terms wages. On Tuesday, ministers approved pay rises for this year of 2% for police and 1.7% for prison officers in 2017-18 and May’s spokesman said pay rises for other public sector workers in 2018-19 could be greater than 1%, ending the cap that had been in place for seven years. The Labour leader mocked May for the long government build-up to the news it was ending. “At the weekend we were told that the public sector pay cap had been dropped,” he said. “On Monday the prime minister’s spokesman said it would continue as planned. Yesterday they said the pay cap was over, but we later found out that police and prison officers still face a real-terms pay cut. So could the prime minister tell us what the position is at midday today?” May replied that the government was seeking to “balance out protecting jobs in the public sector, being fair to public sector workers, and being fair to taxpayers who pay for it, many of whom are public sector workers”. Closely echoing the words of her spokesman on Tuesday on the issue, May said: “There is a need for greater flexibility as we look at these issues of public sector pay in the future. We will be working on this in the lead-up to the budget, and the remits for the pay review bodies for 2018-19 will be published in due course.” In an otherwise relatively predictable PMQs – beyond the unlikely news from May that veteran Tory backbencher Michael Fabricant is to appear on Channel 4’s Celebrity First Dates – the exchanges focused largely on living standards, including for people with disabilities. On public sector pay, Corbyn asked May: “Does the prime minister understand that inflation is now 2.9%? Anything less means that dedicated public servants are worse off again, and they’ve been made worse off every year for the past seven years.” She responded by trumpeting the renewed fall in unemployment, announced on Wednesday, and mocking the Labour leader over what she said were broken promises. May said, to cheers from her backbenchers: “He promised students that he would deal with their debts, and he’s let them down. He promised the British people that he would support Trident, and he’s let them down. And he’s promised voters he’d deliver on Brexit and he’s let them down.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/14/thursdays-best-tv-mercury-prize-live-without-limits-ambulance","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T05:01:33Z","webTitle":"Thursday’s best TV: Mercury Prize Live; Without Limits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/14/thursdays-best-tv-mercury-prize-live-without-limits-ambulance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/14/thursdays-best-tv-mercury-prize-live-without-limits-ambulance","fields":{"headline":"Thursday’s best TV: Mercury Prize Live; Without Limits","bodyText":"Best Album of the Year: Mercury Prize Live 2017 9pm, BBC4 Two words: Ed Sheeran.

The failure calls into question the Murdochs’ commitment to broadcasting standards and potentially suggests that compliance issues at Fox are only deal with after being identified externally, the government adds. The letter from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) to Fox and Sky explains why Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, intends to refer Fox’s proposed takeover of Sky for a six-month investigation on the grounds of both media plurality and commitment to broadcasting standards. It goes into more detail and is more strongly worded than Bradley’s statement to parliament on Tuesday. Fox News was pulled from Sky in the UK last month by Fox for “commercial reasons”, but this will have “little, if any, impact” on Bradley’s concerns, the letter adds. Bradley could talk further about the deal on Thursday when she addresses the Royal Television Society convention in Cambridge. In what promises to be an intriguing day, James Murdoch will also address the event, offering him the opportunity to respond to Bradley’s comments. Bradley surprised MPs by announcing the £11.7bn deal faced a broadcasting standards inquiry by the Competition and Markets Authority. The minister effectively overruled Ofcom, the media regulator, which had said that the evidence available did not justify a broadcasting standards investigation and that Fox and Sky had a record of compliance in line with other major broadcasters. Fox is controlled by Rupert Murdoch and his sons Lachlan and James. If the Fox bid is successful and it owns all of Sky then the satellite broadcaster will join the Sun, the Times and talkRadio in the Murdochs’ wider British media empire, giving the family a bigger reach than any news provider apart from the BBC. There will be a 10-day consultation before Bradley makes her final decision. Fox only put in place procedures to ensure that Fox News was compliant with UK broadcasting rules when Ofcom expressed concerns. Bradley has expressed concerns about this and corporate governance failures at Murdoch companies, including allegations of sexual and racial harassment at Fox News and the phone-hacking scandal at the News of the World. In the letter, DCMS said: “It appears that 21CF [Fox] failed to put in place adequate compliance procedures for Fox News despite this being a condition of its UK broadcast licence. “The secretary of state [Bradley] considers this to have been a serious failure in compliance which is directly relevant to the parties’ commitment to broadcasting standards, in particular (given that the failure related to a news channel) to the requirements of impartiality and accuracy in news broadcasting. “The fact that 21CF belatedly put in place such procedures does not entirely remove the secretary of state’s concerns. The mere existence of compliance arrangements is not sufficient in itself, not least because any arrangements need to be applied diligently if effective compliance is to be secured. “In order to apply compliance arrangements effectively, a company must have an internal culture that takes compliance issues seriously, ie a commitment to attaining broadcasting standards objectives. “21CF’s failure to put in place UK compliance procedures for Fox News calls that into question, as it is potentially indicative of an approach under which compliance issues are addressed only after having been identified externally.” The letter also questions Ofcom’s conclusion that Fox has a good history of broadcast compliance. It says there must be a “‘genuine commitment’ to attaining broadcasting standards, rather than merely to past compliance” and that the lack of complaints for Fox News may have been distorted by its audience being “very small and likely to contain viewers who were sympathetic to the style and content of its programming”. On Fox News being switched off for UK viewers, DCMS says: “The secretary of state [Bradley] understands that 21CF ceased broadcasting Fox News in the UK on 29 August 2017. She considers that this has little, if any, impact on her concerns – the fact is that 21CF was responsible for ensuring adequate compliance procedures were in place for Fox News and failed to do so, and that 21CF would control Sky and be responsible for Sky News should the merger take place.” Fox said on Tuesday it was disappointed that Bradley had not followed the advice of Ofcom. “We are disappointed that the secretary of state has chosen not to follow the unequivocal advice of the independent regulator, which is the expert body tasked with enforcing the broadcast code,” Fox said. “As the correspondence between DCMS and Ofcom makes clear, we do not believe that there are grounds for the secretary of state to change her previous position.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/14/prison-reboot-may-free-up-7000-prison-places-says-thinktank","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T23:01:26Z","webTitle":"Prison 'reboot' may free up 7,000 prison places, says thinktank","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/14/prison-reboot-may-free-up-7000-prison-places-says-thinktank","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/14/prison-reboot-may-free-up-7000-prison-places-says-thinktank","fields":{"headline":"Prison 'reboot' may free up 7,000 prison places, says thinktank","bodyText":"A “reboot” of the government’s “rehabilitation revolution”, including the early release of well-behaved prisoners, could free up more than 7,000 prison places, according to the latest report from a centre-right thinktank. The Centre for Social Justice report by former prisoner and Conservative cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken and a retired judge, John Samuels QC, says that despite the “rehabilitation revolution” having been championed by two former home secretaries, five former justice secretaries and a previous prime minister, both reoffending rates and the prison population have remained stubbornly high. The scale of the prison crisis was underlined this week by the official pay review body, which recommended a 1.7% pay rise for prison officers. It said staff motivation, morale and confidence in the prison service were “undoubtedly very low” with assaults and other forms of violence in jails at their highest levels since 2000 and rising. The report from the Centre for Social Justice, which was founded by Iain Duncan Smith, published on Thursday, calls for a 10-point programme to resuscitate the drive to cut reoffending rates, including a limited programme of executive release to reduce prison numbers. The measures advocated by Aitken and Samuels that could reduce the prison population in England and Wales from a record 86,000 and potentially save £246m a year include: • Freeing up 3,300 prison places by avoiding unnecessary recalls to prison of released inmates. • Releasing 2,500 of the 3,200 prisoners serving indefinite imprisonment for public protection (IPP) sentences whose tariffs have expired and who can be released relatively easily, quickly and safely. • A programme of executive release overseen by a small number of authorised judges, beginning with the 500 IPP prisoners who have already served longer than the maximum fixed sentence that would have otherwise imposed for their offence. Other categories could include those whose age and incapacity render them no longer suitable to be imprisoned and who pose a minimal risk to the public. • Reducing the historically high number of 21,559 offenders recalled to prison in 2016, most of whom were recalled for minor breaches, by introducing judicial oversight. This couldfree up 3,300 prison places occupied by recalled prisoners. • Creating four pilot US-style “problem-solving courts” to tackle the drug and alcohol addictions of the 3% of serial offenders who account for 40% of crime. • Improving the number, pay and training of prison officers so they can use their skills in the rehabilitation programme, and addressing the failures of the remodelled probation service. “It is our view that such a lowering of the numbers held in custody would assist with reducing overcrowding and mitigating the shortage of prison staff. It would therefore aid in the creation of opportunities for genuinely rehabilitative work in custody: education, vocational training and addressing substance misuse would all be enhanced,” say the authors. “The fruits of such rehabilitative opportunities would be seen in a lowering of the numbers returning to custody through reoffending in the future. Furthermore, a reduction in re-offending would contribute positive advantages to the community,” they add. The CSJ report says that successive governments have failed to live up to their bold promises of rehabilitative criminal justice reform: “Although some small steps towards this ‘rehabilitative revolution’ have been started, there has been little significant progress.” Instead, they note the government’s “myopic and almost exclusionary emphasis on prison security” following the increases in numbers of suicides and assaults. “The rehabilitation revolution requires a reboot. The political and public consensus that rehabilitation is a vital and necessary part of an effective criminal justice system remains intact and the government should seek to turn this ambition into a reality,” they conclude."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/14/debussy-faure-la-mer-pelleas-melisande-ticciati-kozena-linn-cd-review-","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T17:15:10Z","webTitle":"Debussy/Fauré: La Mer/Pelléas and Mélisande CD review – Ticciati harnesses the DSO's depth and drive","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/14/debussy-faure-la-mer-pelleas-melisande-ticciati-kozena-linn-cd-review-","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/14/debussy-faure-la-mer-pelleas-melisande-ticciati-kozena-linn-cd-review-","fields":{"headline":"Debussy/Fauré: La Mer/Pelléas and Mélisande CD review – Ticciati harnesses the DSO's depth and drive","bodyText":"If you’re used to hearing Robin Ticciati with the fleet-footed Scottish Chamber Orchestra, then the pure heft of this recording – his first as music director of Berlin’s Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester – might take a bit of getting used to.

Gareth Thomas, the MP for Harrow West, said local residents had not been consulted over further changes at RAF Northolt in west London, including a proposal that would increase the number of commercial flights to 50,000 a year. Thomas said residents were concerned and it is “increasingly apparent that it is a commercial airport in all but name”, with military status used “as a smokescreen”. RAF Northolt is a military airport, but the number of commercial flights has dramatically increased in recent years. The number of passenger journeys, mostly involving VIP jets, dwarfs the 3,800 military flights. In a report commissioned by the Ministry of Defence, consultants suggested increasing the number of commercial flights to 50,000 a year, with the regional airline Flybe among those campaigning for commercial passenger flights to start operating from the airport, which is seven miles (11km) from Heathrow. The project ark report, authored by the accounting company EY, suggested RAF Northolt could be “an alternative to London City airport” for regional flights with up to 100 seats and a “key access airport” for Heathrow, but said it was unsuitable for larger planes. Thomas said the number of flights was already having a major impact on local people’s quality of life, including noise pollution, poor air quality and concerns about safety. The MoD is to spend £45m resurfacing the runway, which the MP said was a significantly higher cost for than for the same work at other airports and had been approved without a public consultation. The runway will be closed from spring 2018 for the work. “It is not hard to see why my constituents are worried where this is all leading,” Thomas said. “It is clear that at every turn, the government have sought to hide what is happening at Northolt from my constituents by using its military status as a smokescreen. “This has meant a gradual worsening of quality of life and an important discussion about safety swept under the carpet.” RAF Northolt’s classification as a military base means it does not have to comply with the rules of a civilian airport, including the need to get planning approval for changes to the runway and increasing the number of commercial flights. This week, the London assembly passed a motion expressing concern about the airport’s future, calling on the mayor, Sadiq Khan, to do “everything possible to campaign against RAF Northolt becoming a commercial airport”. Tobias Ellwood, a defence minister, said there were “stringent conditions” for using the spare capacity at RAF Northolt for commercial flights. “It is used and needed by the military every single day, but it has for a number of decades been underutilised in this role,” he said in his reply to a Westminster Hall debate. Ellwood said the government was committed to sharing information about the airport with local residents “when it seems pertinent as decisions and options are considered”, but added that commercial use ensured value for money for taxpayers. Passenger flights “offset the cost of the station’s military operations to the taxpaying public”, he said, and ministers would meet Thomas and local councillors to discuss concerns. Thomas said he wanted the government to commit to a full and open consultation on the renovation work. “The simple fact of the matter is that Northolt is no longer, in practical terms, a military airport. The vast majority of flights there are now commercial ones,” he said. “It is not right to continue hiding behind military status, making small changes each time that add up to the very thing they publicly deny.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/14/destiny-2-review-sequel-shooting-online","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T06:00:34Z","webTitle":"Destiny 2 review: shooting aliens has never felt better","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/14/destiny-2-review-sequel-shooting-online","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/sep/14/destiny-2-review-sequel-shooting-online","fields":{"headline":"Destiny 2 review: shooting aliens has never felt better","bodyText":"There are three reviews of Destiny 2 that need to be written. The first is Destiny 2: the campaign, the game that you can sit down and play through from start to finish. It’s a genuinely good experience, with a plot that makes sense, characters who have actual personalities, and a narrative delivered through more than just text inserts and mission descriptions. Take the opening mission, Homecoming, which is already familiar to those who played the beta. It would be perfectly possible to write an entire review focusing on this 30-minute experience, a textbook in game design laid out perfectly for the player. You begin, unlike in the first game, with a fully powered-up guardian, dropped into the middle of an all-out attack on the Tower, last cradle of humanity in a far flung future. Over a snappy string of set-pieces, the game introduces new players to the core cast of Cayde-6, Zavala and Ikora Rey, teaches them the basics of combat and of their special abilities, and drops plenty of fan service in the background for returning players. Most impressively, the level silently communicates the importance of teamwork, matchmaking players into groups of three in the background before throwing them in a larger space where they get to see the effects of other classes’ super abilities, and find out their own abilities get recharged when their allies succeed. A twist of the narrative later, and your guardian finds themselves wracked, depowered, and stumbling through the crumbling remnants of the Last City. The canny design doesn’t end quite yet, with the game smoothly introducing a final few concepts (you try to jump over a ledge you can’t quite clear, only to discover the game now offers “mantling”, letting your character pull themselves up from near-missed jumps), and your character slowly finding their way to allies. Strings swell, a falcon soars, and you realise this is perhaps the first time Destiny has ever done more than telling a story: it’s evoking a feeling. From there, admittedly, things plateau a bit. Most of the rest of the campaign is a fun romp, a getting-the-band-back-together cliché with a few diversions here and there, before everything comes together in an all-out raid on the City, and the end credits roll. Look: you aren’t going to be writing letters home about this plot. Even for an MMO, it’s fairly thin, lacking the epic sweep that players of more traditional online games like WoW or FFXV have come to expect. But it’s the first time in the three years of Destiny’s history that you can reasonably say to the sort of person who bought the Halo series to play through the single-player campaign that the Bungie they know and love is back. But about three quarters of the way through the campaign, Destiny 2 (the single-player game) takes a short excursion, introducing you to its true form: Destiny 2 (the eternal experience). That’s the second review that needs to be written. It’s a far smoother introduction than that of the first game, which unceremoniously dropped you from the end credits back in the game world with no real explanation of how to progress, what the next goal was, or why you were still playing. Now, in the midst of the campaign, the game takes the time to introduce the activities you’ll spend the next few months repeating, once the story is over: the patrols, the strikes and the crucible. By the time you do finish the campaign, you’ll likely be champing at the bit to sink some real time into these things. It’s when it comes to the variety and enjoyment of these activities that Destiny 2 shines. Compared to earlier iterations of the game, where players rapidly realised that one and only one gameplay loop offered valuable rewards, here Destiny goes out of its way to offer you an incentive to range widely over its cornucopia of delights. That hasn’t stopped players finding a marginally more rewarding loop, even so (if you’re a min-maxer, expect to spend a lot of time on Titan over the first few months), but it does mean the days of running in circles through Archer’s Line on the moon desperately farming Helium Filaments are over. New clan features also mean the game is a far less lonely experience for those without many online friends, and a far more rewarding one for those who are used to playing with a group. Destiny rewards you for being in a clan – any clan – and then heaps further rewards on clans that play together. The core gameplay loop has always worked on a narrow level, because the Bungie team are, and always have been, the masters of making gunplay satisfying on a minute-to-minute level. Shooting aliens in the head feels good in this game, and when you start receiving exotic weapons in the latter half, it feels even better. But the wider loop, of continually getting new and better loot, spiralling your character towards the level cap, is also improved. It’s no longer a toxic fruit machine, and the number of guaranteed rewards in the game is at a level where it’s possible to avoid huge levels of frustration entirely. There’s a chance, in fact, that it may be too generous: a game with a level cap of 300 should probably not see players reaching 293 within a week, before the raid was even released, as a member of my clan did. That’s a hollow complaint, though, and if your only problem is you play the game too efficiently, then you’ll probably find other things in its gargantuan world to occupy you soon after. The last review is for those who’ve been clinging to the first game for three years, who just need to be reassured that everything’s still on track: Destiny 2 is Destiny without the bullshit. Almost. Everything you hated about the first three years of the game has been refined, removed, or reappraised, and the game that was left was one that makes sense from toe to tip. And then Bungie added in just a little bit of extra bullshit, focused on endgame micro-transactions: Sparrows are now cosmetic items you receive randomly in the game’s lootbox-style “bright engrams”; shaders, received the same way, are now single-use items, received in packs of three to five; and the faintest whiff of non-cosmetic paid upgrades exists in the armour and weapon “modifications”, which you receive in the same way and use to boost your gear. It’s not the end of the world, but it’s a small preview of where you’re likely to feel greatest irritation most rapidly.

Though over his short career he played and recorded a vast range of the keyboard repertoire – from William Byrd and Orlando Gibbons to Schoenberg and his pupils – it was the music of JS Bach, and the Goldberg Variations in particular, with which his name became indelibly linked. Gould made two studio recordings of the Goldberg, the second in 1981, just over a year before his death at the age of 50, but it was his earlier recording, made in 1955 and released the following year, that acquired legendary status, and defined him as an outstanding musician of the 20th century. Gould famously gave no public performances after 1964, opting to work only in the studio. Since his death, his recorded legacy has maintained his stature. In the forefront of that have remained the two Goldberg recordings, which Columbia/CBS, and later Sony Classical, have re-released in many different editions. This latest concentrates exclusively on the 1955 recording, and is the most exhaustive yet, including every take from the sessions, presented variation by variation. It constitutes detailed documentation of Gould’s quest for his ideal Bach performance – his obsession with every detail, his insistence on getting the articulation of every semiquaver in every bar exactly as he imagined it, sometimes to the audible exasperation of the producer, Howard Scott. There are multiple takes of every variation, each subtly distinct in tempo and nuance, from which the definitive performance as it eventually appeared on LP was later spliced together. Taken together they also demonstrate the unwavering virtuosity of Gould’s playing, and the startling clarity he seemed effortlessly able to bring to the densest contrapuntal textures. It’s sumptuously packaged. As well as the complete sessions, which take up five CDs, the set includes a disc containing Gould’s 1981 interview on the Goldbergs with the critic Tim Page, and the final edited performance, both as a facsimile of the original 1956 LP, remastered and pressed on high-density vinyl, and as a CD. There’s also a fascinating coffee-table book, copiously illustrated, which includes all the original sound engineer’s tape sheets and transcripts of exchanges between Gould and his producer, printed in parallel with an Urtext edition of Bach’s score. Unless you’re a Gould completist perhaps it isn’t a must-have, but it is an extraordinary document, meticulously assembled, and as a bit of a Gould fanatic myself I found it totally compelling. In any case, one or other of Gould’s Goldberg recordings, and preferably both, should be in every CD collection."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2017/sep/13/mike-neville-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T11:45:41Z","webTitle":"Mike Neville obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/13/mike-neville-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/sep/13/mike-neville-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Mike Neville obituary","bodyText":"For five decades Mike Neville, who has died aged 80, was the face of television news in the north-east of England – and seen across the country on the BBC’s Nationwide. There his chuckle and wide grin typified the spirit of the programme, with its populist approach to current affairs. In his early days as a news presenter and reporter, Neville spoke in the measured tones of traditional BBC radio newsreaders, but his personality gradually shone through. A former actor, he was once described as having “the ability to talk like Sir John Gielgud, but also like Jack the Lad with a barrow down the market”. Neville gave up acting in 1962 to work as a continuity announcer and reporter with Tyne Tees, ITV’s Newcastle-based company covering the north-east and North Yorkshire. Two years later, he became presenter of its newly launched weekday programme North-East Newsview, but within months he was poached by the BBC to replace Frank Bough on its rival programme, Look North. His 32 years there made him the corporation’s longest serving regional news presenter. As Neville established his individual style, he was given more freedom, once re-enacting the Romeo and Juliet balcony scene that he had rewritten – Geordie-style. He shared many such skits with his Look North co-presenter, George House, with whom he recorded the LP Larn Yersel’ Geordie in 1971, based on Scott Dobson’s popular dialect books. The pair also performed it at the Newcastle festival and on BBC Radio 4. Neville, who was expert at ad-libbing during technical breakdowns, found a wider audience with Nationwide (1969-84) as the BBC’s man in Newcastle. During 1976 he stood in as one of the programme’s main presenters in London, but resisted offers to leave his beloved north-east permanently. “I actually hated working in London,” he said. “Up here, it is like working with family.” His folk-hero status was cemented in 1989 when he was the victim of a “Gotcha” prank by Noel Edmonds in Noel’s Saturday Roadshow, tricked into believing he had seven minutes to fill live because of a technical fault. Tyne Tees, recognising how viewers so firmly associated Neville with the region, tempted him back in 1996 to present its daily news programme, revamped as the one-hour North East Tonight. The company’s new chief executive, Bruce Gyngell, aware that Tyne Tees was lagging in the ratings war with BBC North, had asked his head of news, Graeme Thompson, what it would take to beat the opposition. He was told: “We should get Mike Neville.” The impact was immediate. Viewing figures soared and North East Tonight won the 1996 Royal Television Society’s award as best regional news programme and, two years later, the World Service medal at the New York film and television festival. Although Neville was the sole anchor, he forged another double act, this time bantering with Tyne Tees’s weather presenter Bob Johnson. Once, they brought levity to the serious news of the day by wearing paper bags over their heads to discuss a report on whether women could be attracted to men by their voices alone – the same method used in a study of the issue. His television career ended in 2005 when he had life-saving surgery to remove a blood clot in his leg, caused by kidney failure. The following year, when Neville announced his retirement, the Guardian asked whether it was the “end of an era for regional TV”, as the identities of the once independent ITV companies were being diluted by single ownership in England and Wales. He was born James Briggs in Willington Quay, Northumberland, to James Briggs, a labourer, and Mary (nee Savory), and attended Stephenson Memorial secondary school in Howdon. He left at 16 to work as a clerk for the Northern Guild of Commerce and Chamber of Trade, then as an editorial assistant at the Daily Mail’s Newcastle office. Following national service with the Wiltshire regiment in Cyprus (1955-57), when he rose to the rank of corporal, he briefly worked as an insurance agent. In 1957 he became a professional actor, joining the Newcastle playhouse’s rep company and changing his name to Michael Neville. Shortly after Tyne Tees started broadcasting in 1959, Neville took the role of a policeman in both its children’s programme Happy Go Lucky and the pub sitcom Under New Management, which was produced by David Croft with storylines by Johnny Speight. After further work in rep, Neville returned to Tyne Tees to begin his career as a broadcaster, before switching to the BBC. Alongside presenting Look North, he occasionally hosted Come Dancing (1966-69) and Miss United Kingdom (1966-67) on the network. In his final spell at Tyne Tees he had his own regional chat programme, The Mike Neville Show. The Royal Television Society presented Neville with a lifetime achievement award in 1987, a unique achievement accolade in 2001 and a special 80th birthday award this year. He was appointed MBE in 1991. He married Pamela Edwards in 1962 after they had acted together in rep. She survives him, along with their daughter, Carolyn. • Mike Neville (James Armstrong Briggs), broadcaster, born 17 October 1936; died 6 September 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/11/norways-rightwing-coalition-set-to-retain-power-by-slender-margin","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T21:14:42Z","webTitle":"Norway's rightwing coalition claims victory in general election","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/11/norways-rightwing-coalition-set-to-retain-power-by-slender-margin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/11/norways-rightwing-coalition-set-to-retain-power-by-slender-margin","fields":{"headline":"Norway's rightwing coalition claims victory in general election","bodyText":"Norway’s conservative prime minister, Erna Solberg, and her rightwing coalition government are set to hold on to power after defeating the centre-left opposition by the narrowest of margins, according to official projections. Estimates based on a partial count of about 95% of votes cast in Monday’s general election gave 89 seats in the Storting – Norway’s 169-seat parliament – to Solberg’s Conservatives, their populist, anti-immigration Progress party coalition partners and two smaller centre-right parliamentary allies. Solberg claimed a narrow victory, saying voters had given her “a mandate for four more years”. “We have to be a little cautious but it looks as though we will have a non-socialist majority,” she told a rally of supporters chanting “Erna! Erna!” as confetti and streamers were dropped on the crowd. The five-party leftwing opposition grouping, led by Labour leader Jonas Gahr Støre, was on target for 80 seats after a nailbiting campaign fought on the issues of taxation and the future of Norway’s giant energy sector. Støre, a 57-year-old millionaire who has previously served as the country’s foreign minister, conceded defeat and wished his rival well. “This is a big disappointment for Labour,” he told supporters. “Our goal was to give Norway a new government. We knew it was going to be close, and it was close. But as it looks now it wasn’t enough to replace a Conservative-Progress party government with a Labour government.” No Conservative-led government has secured a second term since 1985 and Solberg’s may well prove delicate: in the outgoing parliament, her minority coalition needed the parliamentary support of only one of its two smaller centre-right allies, but having lost seats it now needs the backing of both. This is likely to leave the new government exposed to pressure from both the Liberals and the Christian Democrats, leading to tricky negotiations on every issue in order to obtain sufficient parliamentary backing. Solberg, whose government piloted the country through the 2014 collapse in crude oil prices and Europe’s 2015 migrant crisis, pledged further tax cuts to boost growth, while Støre had vowed to raise taxes for the richest to reduce inequality and improve public services. Labour, which is predicted to lose six of its 55 seats, is still on course to remain the country’s single largest party. It had seemed to be heading for a clear victory for much of the past year but shed support in recent weeks as unemployment fell and the economy recovered from the downturn. The election proved a disappointment for the Green party, widely seen as a potential kingmaker, which campaigned to halt all new oil and gas exploration and, within 15 years, phase out the sector that made Norway rich. It was on course for just 3.3% of the vote and one MP. But the climate concerns that dominated the campaign could still see western Europe’s largest energy industry affected since Solberg, if confirmed the victor, will almost certainly need the backing of Liberals and Christian Democrats who also want limits on exploration in Norway’s sensitive Arctic waters. The migrant crisis and economic downturn seemed to have benefited the government’s junior coalition partner, the Progress party, which was set to lose just one of the 29 seats it held in the outgoing parliament. Analysts said the twin crises had allowed the party, seen as less nationalistic and authoritarian than Europe’s other populists, to reinforce its key anti-immigration message with its base and splash out on popular public spending projects using record withdrawals from Norway’s near-$1tn sovereign wealth fund."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/sep/11/roy-hodgson-crystal-palace-total-croydon-farewell","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T20:59:16Z","webTitle":"Farewell Total Croydon, but which Roy Hodgson will Crystal Palace get? | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/sep/11/roy-hodgson-crystal-palace-total-croydon-farewell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/sep/11/roy-hodgson-crystal-palace-total-croydon-farewell","fields":{"headline":"Farewell Total Croydon, but which Roy Hodgson will Crystal Palace get?","bodyText":"Welcome back, then, Roy. And rejoice Croydon, for he has returned. The news that Crystal Palace will turn to Roy Hodgson to replace the departed Frank de Boer is perhaps unsurprising given the background noises of the past few months. For all that there will still be a tendency to roll the eyes, to mock the sudden shift in footballing direction – from the Ajax Way to Purley Way – and to point out that Hodgson is 70 and hasn’t had a club job in five years. This is undoubtedly a little unfair. In isolation Hodgson to Palace makes plenty of short-term sense. Plus it would be foolish to underestimate Hodgson’s determination to prove a point, his popularity with players and his vast experience. And yet there is no escaping the wider sense of dissonance here. Even in a league defined by its habit of vacillating comically between methodologies and personnel, the lurch from De Boer to Hodgson is one of the more bizarrely abrupt about-turns in Premier League history. History will now record that the era of Total Croydon, Palace’s attempt to transform the club into an Amsterdam of the A23, lasted exactly 77 days and 450 minutes of competitive football. De Boer had promised his Palace team would “dominate with and without the ball”. Steve Parish had talked quite a bit at De Boer’s unveiling about footballing DNA, a more technical, sustainable Palace style and assorted other things that have now been thrown out of the window in favour of a man from around the corner who knows how to rig up a four-man defence. It did always seem possible Palace hadn’t read all the small print on De Boer’s connection to the Ajax tradition. One of the great defensive players of his generation, as a coach De Boer has seemed to take most from the Van Gaal end of things, concerned more with control than attacking rhythms. His Ajax teams were invariably the league’s best defenders. Some fans felt the football was stodgy and over-thought. It is painfully obvious that attempting to impose this imprint on a group of Palace players with just one significant addition from last season would involve a fair amount of thrashing around in the wrong gear. And so it came to pass. Four league games was all it took in the end. But then, for all the fine talk the only revolution any Premier League club is really interested in is one that banks enough points, sharpish, to keep the gravy train rolling. And so on to Roy. Hodgson was last seen looking frazzled and wired after a sleepless night in Chantilly, sweating and swaying at his lectern and telling the world “I’m not really sure what I’m doing here”, a quote that has since become his “Hit Les”, his multicoloured golfing umbrella. England had lost horribly to Iceland the day before, outplayed by opponents Hodgson had chosen not to scout in person in order to take Ray Lewington on a boat trip down the Seine (“Ray had never seen Paris”). It was an ignoble end for a good man and a fine, experienced manager, who like so many others found himself bent out of shape by the job in his final few months. And this is the real question when it comes to Hodgson at Palace. Which Roy will they be getting? It seems clear what the club need now is West Brom Roy, and Fulham Roy before that; the man who successfully implemented his own traditionally English defensive strengths to take Fulham to the Europa League final and West Brom to 10th in the Premier League. Hodgson has often been cast as an overly rigid manager, perhaps unfairly. But he was also the future once, a manager with a fully implemented footballing revolution of his own on his CV during the hip young gunslinger years at Malmo. Albeit the direct football imprint introduced into Swedish football in the 1980s is rather different to De Boer’s possession-centred Ajax schooling. Either way Hodgson’s best spells in club football have been characterised by well‑drilled defending and simple attacking lines. And so it was with England, too. Hodgson’s best period with England was arguably his opening five months as a quick-fix replacement for Fabio Capello, when his agreeable manner and agreeably simple demands of the players saw England through Euro 2012 without too many bruises. Oddly his worst moments – the stalled 2014 World Cup, the horrors of the last Euros – came when Hodgson attempted something more. An England built and drilled by old Roy, West Brom Roy would probably have had more chance of seeing off Iceland than the confused, overly funky, ultimately frozen entity fielded in Saint-Etienne and Nice. Wayne Rooney playing in midfield, Harry Kane on corners, the switches between 4-3-3 and 4-2-3-1, the insistence that the suffocatingly dull possession football against Slovakia represented a good performance. It all came a little late. It ended in confusion. It is to be assumed Hodgson will begin his time at Selhurst Park with a return to the shared traits of Old Roy and indeed Old Palace. The strengths of the past few years – aerial power, wing play – will be dusted off and recalibrated. A good relationship with Andros Townsend will be an advantage. A more mixed-looking relationship with Wilfried Zaha, who made his decision to reject England’s overtures while Hodgson was manager, may be more interesting, although both are grown-ups and in the same camp now. Hodgson will also be desperate to provide a gloss on the late years of his career, to erase the image of that frightening, hollow-eyed farewell appearance last summer. In the meantime, it is once again farewell to all that: another new dawn curtailed, another half-baked revolution junked. Employing Hodgson makes plenty of sense given Palace’s league position, playing squad and managerial history of the last few years. Employing Hodgson on the back of De Boer’s 77 days, that stalled and, no doubt, commendable attempt to move in another direction, looks like another triumph for short-termism and muddled thought. Palace will have a fight on their hands to get out of trouble in the Premier League whoever is in charge, a self-inflicted state of confusion for which the board must take its share of blame."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/12/qa-labor-says-australia-risks-being-last-in-developed-world-with-marriage-equality","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T20:47:39Z","webTitle":"Q&A: Mark Dreyfus says Australia risks being last to achieve marriage equality","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/12/qa-labor-says-australia-risks-being-last-in-developed-world-with-marriage-equality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/12/qa-labor-says-australia-risks-being-last-in-developed-world-with-marriage-equality","fields":{"headline":"Q&A: Mark Dreyfus says Australia risks being last to achieve marriage equality","bodyText":"Marriage is a sexist institution and societies should not fight to preserve it, the Israeli parliament member and LGBTI rights advocate Merav Michaeli said on the ABC’s Q&amp;A program on Monday night, while Labor’s Mark Dreyfus has argued that Australia risks being the “the last country in the developed world” to have the change. Michaeli’s comments were prompted by a question about whether the institution of marriage as it currently exists in Australia was worth maintaining given rising divorce rates. Much of the program focused on the issue of same-sex marriage given the upcoming postal vote, which will ask Australians whether it should be legalised. “[Marriage] was created back at the time when we women were commodities, as were children, as were men without property and of other colours,” Michaeli, who is chair of the Zionist party and opposition whip, said. “This is not something that we should maintain in the world when we realise all of us are human beings. It is not about love. I realise the [pro same-sex marriage] campaign says that love is equal. Love is definitely equal. It’s got nothing to do with this institution. This was a tool that was made to dominate women for the sake of reproduction. This is not something we should sustain.” Her views saw her at odds with the Liberal senator and assistant social services minister, Zed Seselja, who told the audience that the “idea of a lifelong union between a man and a woman has been something that is foundational to our community and it’s absolutely worth defending”. “I think it’s been very important for us, not just us as Australians but right around most societies in the world in one form or another and certainly in the form that we understand it.” However, the word “marriage” should be thought of in two distinct ways, according to the British philosopher and author Anthony Grayling, better known as AC Grayling. “There’s the legal institution in which you invite the state into your bedroom and which has decisions over your lives and it’s a very sexist institution in its origins and shouldn’t exist in that form at all,” he said. “But there’s another sense of the word marriage, which is the commitment that two or perhaps more people make to one another about pooling their resources, sharing their lives, mutually supporting one another. It is that sense of marriage, what Shakespeare was talking about when he said the marriage of two minds, that’s important to us as human beings. In the institutional sense I’m against [marriage]. However, I am for same-sex marriage. That’s a different thing.” Audience member Jennie Agustin asked the panellists, who also included the South Australian senator Lucy Gichuhi, what those opposed to same-sex marriage thought made Australia different from other countries. Same-sex marriage had been legalised in 23 countries without any negative consequences, she told the panellists. “And as far as I can see ... they have only benefited from achieving marriage equality,” Dreyfus replied. “I’m very much hoping Australia does not have to be the last country in the developed world to get marriage equality.” But Seselja said same-sex marriage was still “a relatively new thing” in many of those countries and that it was too early to realise the overall impact of legalising it on freedom of speech, freedom of religion and parental rights. Michaeli responded: “I like it so much when the right takes the terms that the left has brought about human rights and turns it around and is fighting for the right to suppress other people.” Those opposed to same-sex marriage were also fighting to suppress children, she said. “Don’t allow your child what they prefer, what they like, what they want to be when they grow up,” she said. “Don’t allow them. Deny them a free choice. Yes, by all means. “The core family as we know it unfortunately is the least safe place for children ... the data speaks. About every fifth child that goes through some kind of abuse, sexual, physical, emotional and the core family is the place [where it occurs]. This structure of marriage which still gives men domination, complete domination over their children and too often over their women is a part of the ongoing hurt in children.” Seselja replied that he disagreed “vehemently with this idea that the family is this inherently unsafe”. “Certainly some families prove to be unsafe for children and we have ways of dealing with that. The family is not inherently unsafe for raising children.” Grayling urged Seselja and the audience to consider “what a terrible torment it must be” to be gay and brought up in a “traditional, rightwing, closed family”. “The point about the ideological views, especially if they’re on one part of the political spectrum rather than another, is that it closes down opportunities for people and that’s precisely what we don’t want to happen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/11/fa-england-cyber-security-world-cup-2018-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T21:29:17Z","webTitle":"FA to beef up cybersecurity if England qualify for Russia World Cup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/11/fa-england-cyber-security-world-cup-2018-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/11/fa-england-cyber-security-world-cup-2018-russia","fields":{"headline":"FA to beef up cybersecurity if England qualify for Russia World Cup","bodyText":"The FA will strengthen its cybersecurity before the 2018 World Cup amid fears about Russian hackers Fancy Bears and concern that tactical and team selection information could be leaked before games. England are top of Group F and on course to qualify automatically for the tournament which begins on 14 June. The FA is still assessing training bases but wherever the squad stay all computer equipment belonging to players and support staff will sophisticated anti-hacking software installed. The FA will also provide its own internet access with staff and players instructed not to use wifi in hotels, cafes or airports to protect against data breaches. Players will also be advised on their use of social media and warned about posting photographs which reveal details of their location or tactical information. It is understood the FA was already exploring cybersecurity measures around the World Cup before August when Fancy Bears, which has previously targeted British Olympians, made revelations about football’s anti-doping procedures. The hack included an email from the FA’s head of integrity, Jenni Kennedy, to Fifa regarding four anti-doping cases in May 2017. It is believed Fancy Bears are a Russian group seeking revenge after the country was banned from competing in athletics at the Rio Olympics when systemic doping in the country was exposed. They had already breached the World Anti-Doping Agency’s database, releasing hundreds of private medical files of mainly European and American Olympians, including Bradley Wiggins and Mo Farah. The first leak concerning footballers only heightened concerns about the possibility of Fancy Bears accessing emails from FA chiefs and coaching staff, including Gareth Southgate, while the team are in Russia. Firewalls have been strengthened and passwords encrypted. A Fifa spokesman said: “We can confirm the FA has sent a letter to Fifa related to the Fancy Bears attack. In its reply Fifa has informed the FA in such context that Fifa remains committed to preventing security attacks in general and that with respect to the Fancy Bears attack in particular it is presently investigating the incident to ascertain whether Fifa’s infrastructure was compromised. Such investigation is still ongoing.” The FA has been alert to potential breaches of security at major tournaments in the past, notably in relation to physical spying. At Euro 2016 in France, the team’s training base in Chantilly was guarded by 9ft of tarpaulin and they rejected the opportunity to train at match venues the day before games. Concerns about security at the Brazil World Cup in 2014 were also heightened with Fifa called up by France to investigate claims that a drone hovering above a training session was recording practice before their opening game."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/11/north-korea-us-sanctions-un-china-veto","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T18:19:51Z","webTitle":"North Korea sanctions: US drops oil embargo and naval blockade proposals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/11/north-korea-us-sanctions-un-china-veto","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/11/north-korea-us-sanctions-un-china-veto","fields":{"headline":"North Korea sanctions: US drops oil embargo and naval blockade proposals","bodyText":"The US has significantly diluted a package of new proposed sanctions against North Korea, dropping an oil embargo and enforceable naval blockade in the hope of avoiding a Chinese veto at the UN security council. A revised draft seen by the Guardian and circulated by the US mission to the UN on Monday will impose a ban on imports of North Korean textiles and put a cap on Pyongyang’s imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products. But other elements were dropped from a much stronger version proposed by the US last week, including the first asset freeze directed at Kim Jong-un, a complete ban on oil sales to his regime, and a mandate for warships from any member state to inspect ships suspected of carrying contraband to or from North Korea, and to enforce inspect using “all necessary measures”. The Pyongyang regime threatened retribution against Washington for any new sanctions measure threatening to inflict “the greatest pain and suffering” the US has ever encountered. A diplomatic source at the security council said that the revisions in the draft had been made with the aim of securing acquiescence from China and Russia, who expressed serious reservations about the original version. The US called for the security council in the wake of North Korea’s sixth, and most powerful, nuclear test on 3 September. “This is a text designed for adoption,” the source said. “If they were running it to force a veto, they wouldn’t have made the revisions.” Even if the US draft is not vetoed, an abstention by China in particular would significantly weaken its impact, as the North Korea is likely to take it as a signal that Beijing would not enforce its measures with much rigour. The UK ambassador to the UN, Matthew Rycroft, insisted the revised text was still “robust” and argued the revisions were not a climbdown by the US. “It’s called negotiation. That’s what we do here at the security council. There is a significant prize in keeping the whole of the security council united,” Rycroft said. “The version on the table is strong, it is robust, it is a very significant set of additional sanctions on imports into North Korea and on exports out of North Korea and other measures as well, so that’s why we will be voting in favour of it.” Alongside the withdrawal of the oil embargo, the most significant change to the resolution is the section on “maritime interdiction of cargo vessels”. A note to the revised version says explicitly that the “provision would not authorize the use of force” either to carry out an inspection or to make a suspect vessel sail to a port where it could be inspected. The only enforcement mechanism would be possible sanctions imposed on any ship that does not comply with inspections. In place of a full ban on oil exports, the new draft ban oil condensates and natural gas liquids while imposing a cap of 2 million barrels a year on refined petroleum products. Crude oil imports are capped at their current level. North Korea vowed retaliation for any new sanctions measures. In a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency on Monday, North Korea’s foreign ministry warned the US that if it “did rig up the illegal and unlawful ‘resolution’ on harsher sanctions, the DPRK shall make absolutely sure that the US pays a due price”. Referring to the country by its official title, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, it added: “The forthcoming measures to be taken by the DPRK will cause the US the greatest pain and suffering it has ever gone through in its entire history.” Richard Gowan, who writes on the UN and conflict management at the European Council of Foreign Relations, questioned the tactics pursued by Nikki Haley, the US envoy to the UN. “This is a pretty solid resolution, and if the US had worked it up quietly with China and Russia it could have been sold as another significant win for Washington,” Gowan said. “But the fact that the original US pitch was so much stronger now makes it look like a defeat. Perhaps Haley felt that she had to open with a maximalist bid to get anything at all.” Richard Nephew, a former sanctions policy official at the state department, argued: “Far from showing a major international shift to support regime-threatening sanctions, the UN [security council’s] proposed resolution underscores the degree to which the US and other members have fundamentally different views on [North Korea].” “We lack vision to incorporate sanctions into a broader strategy and this is hurting our ability to get really tough sanctions or use them appropriately,” Nephew, quoted on the 38 North website, which follows North Korean issues, said. “This must change if we are to avoid just using sanctions for sanctions’ sake.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/12/grenfell-tower-fire-lawyers-seek-judicial-review-theresa-may-inquiry-panel","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T23:01:19Z","webTitle":"Lawyers seek judicial review against PM over Grenfell inquiry panel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/12/grenfell-tower-fire-lawyers-seek-judicial-review-theresa-may-inquiry-panel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/12/grenfell-tower-fire-lawyers-seek-judicial-review-theresa-may-inquiry-panel","fields":{"headline":"Lawyers seek judicial review against PM over Grenfell inquiry panel","bodyText":"Emergency legal proceedings have been lodged against the prime minister in the high court over the lack of ethnic and religious diversity on the panel of the Grenfell Tower fire inquiry, which begins on Thursday. BMELawyers4Grenfell are seeking urgent permission for a judicial review over Theresa May’s alleged failure to ensure the panel reflects the backgrounds of the victims and survivors. They are hoping to secure a declaration from a high court judge that the prime minister is in breach of an undertaking she made to the inquiry chair, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, on 15 August, relating to the composition of the panel. The lawyers say they are raising concerns communicated to them by Grenfell survivors, relatives and local residents that the panel is failing to reflect the religious and ethnic diversity of the victims. They add that if the prime minister fails to ensure that the panel is diverse it will weaken the support and confidence of victims, survivors and the bereaved in the inquiry and could undermine its findings and recommendations. One resident, who witnessed the fire and lost people close to her, welcomed the legal challenge. “This issue is about race and religion, but it is also about class,” she said. “The people in charge of the inquiry ... are for the most part white and privileged. They don’t understand our realities because they’re not connected to them. “Before the fire happened, we were ignored and not respected as individuals. Now I believe that the same thing is happening with the inquiry ... The main issue here is a lack of trust. If the panel don’t understand us, they’re not going to ask the right questions.” Peter Herbert, of BMELawyers4Grenfell, said: “This is a key moment in British legal history. Black and minority communities have never before mounted a judicial review against any prime minister. But it’s essential that we do so now because we have never before had a disaster on this scale that has impacted so greatly on BME communities. We believe that it’s far more effective to take this action now than to go ahead with a flawed inquiry.” The lawyers bringing the challenge say it is vital that black and minority ethnic experts are part of all stages of the inquiry and argue that, unless the inquiry panel includes experts from BME backgrounds, it will not be fair and balanced. The claimants include the chair of the Society of Black Lawyers, the president of the Society of Asian Lawyers and Ismet Rawat, the president of the Association of Muslim Lawyers. Rawat, co-founder of BMELawyers4Grenfell, said: “The fire in the Grenfell tower block is one of the worst collective losses of life seen in UK peace time, and yet three months later, we still have survivors displaced and homeless, with countless others psychologically scarred and under-supported by local authorities. It is therefore critical that the inquiry is established robustly.” A government spokesman said: “The chairman of the inquiry has always been clear that he is considering appointing a diverse group of people to assist him whose experience extends to the occupation and management of social housing as well as other areas of expertise. “The PM is also keeping under review the need for additional panel members. We therefore believe this action to be unwarranted.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/13/hms-queen-elizabeth-nelson-victory","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T10:30:08Z","webTitle":"How does the cost of HMS Queen Elizabeth compare with that of Nelson’s Victory?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/13/hms-queen-elizabeth-nelson-victory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/13/hms-queen-elizabeth-nelson-victory","fields":{"headline":"How does the cost of HMS Queen Elizabeth compare with that of Nelson’s Victory?","bodyText":"The Royal Navy’s new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth cost in the region of £3bn to build.

Ahead of the Lib Dem conference this weekend, Ashdown said the party had not managed to have “one big, dangerous idea” since the coalition with the Conservative party ended in 2015. Its leader, Vince Cable, had to forge a new path for the Lib Dems to ensure they were no longer seen as the establishment, he added. “The biggest danger for our party at the seaside next week lies in glossing over the existential challenges which now face us,” Ashdown wrote in a blog for Lib Dem Voice. “Unless we are prepared to be realistic about where we are, return to being radical about what we propose, recreate ourselves as an insurgent force and rekindle our lost habit of intellectual ferment, things could get even worse for us.” Ashdown said the Lib Dems under Tim Farron had failed to advance in conditions that had never been more favourable. “The vast sea of people who share our beliefs find themselves voiceless and silent,” he said. “Not all of them, sadly, are Liberal Democrats or want to be. If we cannot, or will not, be the gathering point for these, the new left-out millions, then who will and what are we for?” Ashdown said the party had advanced when people saw them as an outsider and he would lay out four ideas over the coming days. “Now people see us not as a force for change, but as a part of the establishment,” he wrote. “Whether we could have been insurgents in government is a question for history. The question for now is; there is a hunger for change out there, why don’t we any longer look or sound like the people to bring it? “There may be many reasons for that. But the biggest one is that we are doing very little new thinking and producing very few new ideas.”Farron attempted to sell the party as the natural choice for pro-EU voters at the general election in June by promising another referendum, but the Lib Dems only gained four extra seats and 0.5% of the vote share they lost in the 2015 election. Since taking over in July following Farron’s resignation, Cable has continued to espouse a pro-EU and pro-immigration policy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2017/sep/12/uk-condemned-ministers-attend-weapons-fair-but-ignore-un-arms-trade-treaty-conference-geneva","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T13:07:45Z","webTitle":"UK ministers attend weapons fair but ignore UN event on illicit arms trade","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/sep/12/uk-condemned-ministers-attend-weapons-fair-but-ignore-un-arms-trade-treaty-conference-geneva","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2017/sep/12/uk-condemned-ministers-attend-weapons-fair-but-ignore-un-arms-trade-treaty-conference-geneva","fields":{"headline":"UK ministers attend weapons fair but ignore UN event on illicit arms trade","bodyText":"The British government has been criticised for lining up cabinet members to speak at a weapons fair, but failing to send a minister to a UN event aimed at stopping the trade of illicit arms. The defence secretary, Michael Fallon, and the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, are among those speaking at the London arms fair, which begins on Tuesday and is one of the biggest weapons and security fairs in the world. Harriett Baldwin, minister for defence procurement, and Ben Wallace, minister of state for security, will also attend. More than 100 people were arrested in the runup to the event as they tried to prevent arms companies from setting up their stands. The fair coincides with the arms trade treaty conference in Geneva to discuss the implementation of the historic 2014 agreement, which attempts to regulate the trade of weapons and promote responsible action by states. Anna Macdonald of campaign group Control Arms said: “It’s very clear where the UK government’s priorities lie. It is sending in the ‘heavyweights’ – Liam Fox and Michael Fallon – to deliver keynote speeches at the arms fair and help seal million-pound contracts that could lead to the deaths of millions of civilians. But they have no ministerial representation at the arms trade treaty conference, where decisions made could save millions of lives.” The UK is a signatory to the treaty but human rights groups have accused the government of ignoring its obligations by supplying arms to countries where there is a risk they could contribute to human rights violations. According to Control Arms, in 2016, the UK authorised arms and military equipment sales to the Philippines, where thousands have been killed in a clampdown on drugs, and to Venezuela where more than 130 people have been killed in anti-government protests since April. Campaigners also point to the conflict in Yemen, where airstrikes by Saudi Arabia have hit schools and hospitals, killing and maiming children. Since 2015, Saudi Arabia has agreed orders for British defence equipment worth more than £3.75bn, mainly bombs and fighter aircraft. The crisis in Yemen, where at least 5,144 people have been killed and 7.3 million are on the brink of famine, has been described by the UN as an “entirely manmade catastrophe”. George Graham of Save the Children said that research commissioned by the charity suggests most British people oppose such sales. “The UK must urgently suspend arms sales until there is a proper international investigation and our allies stop blocking vital humanitarian aid,” said Graham. “Our bombs are also being sent to countries which are killing Yemeni children, bombing schools and hospitals, and impeding aid access.” The arms trade treaty was the first legally binding international agreement obliging states to ensure responsible arms controls are put in place. It was heralded as a landmark move that could reduce suffering as a result of armed conflict. The treaty also requires states that export arms to consider the risk that weapons could be used for gender-based violence, or could harm children. Nounou Booto Meeti, programme director for Centre for Peace, Security and Armed Violence Prevention, and who is based in the Democratic Republic of Congo, said that if implemented properly, the treaty could protect women. “[During the conflict in DRC] armed groups would get their arms without any control because at that time there were no international regulations on arms trade and anybody could sell arms to anyone. Such weapons are still used today to terrorise women,” said Booto Meeti, who is a member of the Control Arms delegation in Geneva. “When someone has a gun they have the power. [A reduction in arms would mean] fewer atrocities, and fewer atrocities against women.” But campaigners say the treaty has failed to live up to expectations. Macdonald said too much time had been spent on process and shuffling paper, while signatories had failed to take any action. James Lynch, head of arms control and human rights at Amnesty International, added that the treaty has been let down by poor implementation. Under the agreement, states are required to submit annual reports on their arms imports and exports, but Lynch said that only 48 of 75 countries had done so for 2016. Some countries have also left large sections of their report blank or aggregated information so that it is impossible to analyse. “This is not just an administrative concern,” said Lynch. “The fact that some states are choosing to leave huge gaps, or are not submitting their reports at all, raises disturbing questions about what they are trying to hide.” The UK government said in a statement that defence exports are kept under careful and continual review. It added: “The UK is the third largest donor to Yemen, having committed more than £139m in UK aid this year. We are also playing a leading role in diplomatic efforts to achieve a political solution that can end the conflict and the terrible humanitarian suffering, including building support for the UN special envoy’s proposals for peace. “The intervention by the Saudi Arabian-led coalition came at the request of Yemen’s internationally recognised president, whose government was forced to flee following a violent takeover by the Houthi rebel group. Since then rebels have launched missile attacks into Saudi Arabia and committed serious human rights violations.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/11/birmingham-council-leader-john-clancy-resigns-bin-collection-strike-labour-unite","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T18:35:44Z","webTitle":"Birmingham council leader quits over handling of bin strike","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/11/birmingham-council-leader-john-clancy-resigns-bin-collection-strike-labour-unite","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/11/birmingham-council-leader-john-clancy-resigns-bin-collection-strike-labour-unite","fields":{"headline":"Birmingham council leader quits over handling of bin strike","bodyText":"The Birmingham city council leader has stepped down after failing to resolve the city’s “bin war”, during which rubbish went uncollected for seven weeks this summer. Labour’s John Clancy, who took on the role in December 2015, blamed “ill-informed” and “frenzied” media speculation for his departure. He quit ahead of a meeting on Monday night, where he was due to face calls to resign and a possible vote of no confidence. His resignation comes as a direct result of his handling of the strike, which saw rubbish pile up in the streets, providing what one resident called “a buffet for rats”. Clancy was under pressure after the aborted deal he struck in mid-August with Unite, the union at the centre of the long-running dispute. On Monday, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, backed the bin strike and Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, demanded an urgent update from Clancy. . Also on Monday, Unite called for the interim council chief executive, Stella Manzie, to follow Clancy’s lead after she opposed the union deal. Last month, Manzie undermined Clancy by warning that the council’s finances could be wiped out if it did not cut pay and hours for refuse collectors to bring them in line with other council workers. The local authority has paid out £1.1bn in equal pay discrimination claims. Unite’s assistant general secretary, Howard Beckett, said: “Stella Manzie must follow in John Clancy’s footsteps and resign, and the council honour the Acas [Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service] agreement it reached with Unite to settle this dispute.” Refuse collectors resumed their strike on 1 September, with workers downing tools for three separate hours each day, as well as returning to depots for breaks. The industrial action began with a dispute over job losses. Unite claims that restructuring plans threaten the jobs of more than 120 staff, while the council says they will modernise the service and save £5m a year. In a blogpost, Clancy wrote: “It has become clear to me that frenzied media speculation about the Birmingham waste dispute is beginning to harm Birmingham city council and the Birmingham Labour party. I can see no end to such speculation, as ill-informed as much of it is, for as long as I remain leader. “I have therefore decided to resign both as leader of the Labour group and as the leader of Birmingham city council, with immediate effect. “I would wish to stress that the actions I took along with my cabinet to negotiate an end to an extremely complex and difficult industrial dispute were done with the best of intentions. None of us are perfect and I made some mistakes, for which I am sorry and take full responsibility.” • This article was amended on 12 September 2017.

The usual bustle of bicycles beneath a grand parade of 140-year-old chestnut trees that crosses Tooting Common, in south London, will cease tomorrow. Wandsworth council is closing Chestnut Avenue, the chainsaws are readied, and more than 50 much-loved mature trees will soon be chopped down. In Sheffield, despite vociferous opposition from local residents and high-profile people such as Jarvis Cocker to Michael Gove, the final tranche of thousands of mature street trees are being removed. This month in the city marks the beginning of the end for the Chelsea Road elm, a rare surviving English elm on which lives a colony of equally rare white-letter hairstreak butterflies. The councils overseeing these chainsaw massacres are different politically. But they share a tragic inability to see street trees as an asset rather than a liability. They’re also ignominiously failing to use new tools at their disposal to calculate the real value of their trees. In Wandsworth, a wealthy Conservative council is lavishing £45,000 of Heritage Lottery cash earmarked for rejuvenating Tooting Common on replacing the chestnuts with young lime trees. Its justification is health and safety after one tree suddenly fell down last winter. An independent expert report for the council suggested it might consider replacing the whole avenue. When residents objected to substituting their grand old trees with a sleek avenue of cheap-to-maintain young trees, the council conducted a consultation: 9,000 letters went out, and most of the 700 respondents picked the rather skewed “choice” of a new avenue over occasionally tatty-looking old trees. More than 5,000 mostly local people have since signed a petition to save Chestnut Avenue. Residents commissioned another expert report by an independent tree consultant. Jeremy Barrell is no tree-hugger and is routinely employed by councils to assess and remove trees. Barrell warns Wandsworth that planting an avenue of one species is a recipe for disaster in an era of fast-moving globalised tree diseases. We need a mix of trees. He concludes the most cost-effective option would be to retain the avenue, trim the older trees, remove a couple, and replant with other species. He’s so confident that the chestnuts can be made safe that he’s offered the council free coverage under his own professional insurance. Barrell also performed a calculation developed by arboralists called Cavat. Just as a building surveyor can calculate the value of a house, so a tree officer can calculate the asset value of a tree – how much it costs to replace it. This reveals a useful truth: not all trees are equal, and big street trees are far more valuable than small trees. Chestnut Avenue is currently worth £2.6m, according to this method. The young trees that will replace it are estimated at £50,000-£100,000. Spending £45,000 to destroy a multimillion-pound community asset doesn’t stack up. In Sheffield’s long-running tree saga, independent professionals calculated that trees worth £66m have been cut down in the past five years. The ruination of this community asset is being orchestrated by a cash-strapped Labour council that sought salvation in a PFI contract with the infrastructure company Amey to rebuild its roads. Big trees are replaced by saplings, which are cheaper to maintain over 25 years of the contract but possess few of large trees’ beneficial effects – for example on flood alleviation and pollution. The devil is in the opaque interpretation of the much-redacted PFI contract. This contract only permits a fairly limited range of engineering solutions for unruly trees, but campaigners have calculated that nearly 50% of the trees earmarked for destruction could be saved using solutions listed in the contract at no extra cost to the council. The puzzle in Sheffield has long been why the council has not used its power to save special trees, such as the Chelsea Road elm. But residents believe they finally got their answer when councillors revealed that if they “saved” any tree they – and not Amey – would then become liable for subsequent maintenance. When the council signed this disastrous PFI contract, it put a gun to its own head. Sheffield’s trees have been privatised for 25 years. And the contract firmly enshrines them as liabilities. It needn’t be like this. Future contracts could include a recognition of street tree values using Cavat, or more sophisticated American software called i-Tree. The latter calculates the annual value of each street tree in terms of certain ecosystem services: flood alleviation, cooling, pollutant removal and carbon sequestration. According to i-Tree, London’s trees provide £133m of benefits each year. Some environmentalists view such “ecosystem service” arguments as the great hope for saving a planet ruled by accountants. Others fear that such calculations are reductive, and underestimate “natural assets” – i-Tree valuations do not include less easily calculable tree benefits, such as the improved mental health of local people, or ecological diversity. Ultimately, nature will always be the loser in any cost-benefit crunch. Nevertheless, giving trees a price looks like a good, pragmatic way to retain them in urban environments. What the streets of Wandsworth and Sheffield show us is that policymakers cannot be relied upon to recognise these precious assets. The only solution is for local communities to teach them. • Patrick Barkham is a natural history writer for the Guardian This article was amended on 13 September 2017 to clarify what the Sheffield PFI contract permits"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/17/poulenc-kodaly-janacek-kyrie-review-st-johns-college-cambridge-nethsingha","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T06:25:33Z","webTitle":"Poulenc, Kodály, Janáček: Kyrie CD review – a tale of two masses","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/17/poulenc-kodaly-janacek-kyrie-review-st-johns-college-cambridge-nethsingha","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/17/poulenc-kodaly-janacek-kyrie-review-st-johns-college-cambridge-nethsingha","fields":{"headline":"Poulenc, Kodály, Janáček: Kyrie CD review – a tale of two masses","bodyText":"Kodály’s Missa Brevis had its premiere in the cloakroom of the opera house in war-torn Budapest in 1945, with gunshots sounding in the streets outside.

Some changes are creeping in: King Salman has loosened the grip of male guardianship, and is encouraging women to work. But they are still not allowed to drive. There are, however, women who refuse to be still. Twenty-five-year-old Baraah Luhaid has always loved cycling. But although women’s cycling was legalised in 2013, it is only allowed in parks or on beaches, and only with a male guardian present. Luhaid is striving to get women – and the fight for women’s rights – moving. She founded Saudi Arabia’s first gender-inclusive cycling community and business, Spokes Hub, last year, and now runs the kingdom’s only cycling shop, with a cafe and workshops, for women. As a Saudi woman peddling counterculture, Luhaid has long known that she would have to embrace the spirit of “I’ll do it myself”. After graduation, she longed to work in a bike shop – but no one would hire a woman. So last year, she went on a cycling trip to China with her brother. She returned to Riyadh determined to ride freely, but met with roadblocks. For one, her abaya – a traditional long, black robe – kept getting caught in the chains of her bike. “But that wasn’t the most challenging part,” she says. “It’s the cultural barriers.” People regularly roll down their windows and shout insults and she is routinely stopped by the police. “Last week I was stopped because someone complained I was causing offence,” she laughs. “When I started cycling, my best friends said: ‘Baraah, if we see you, we’re gonna Snapchat you, and we’re gonna laugh – you’re a girl, you’re not supposed to do this’,” she says. And, apart from her sister and brother – “one of very few male Saudi feminists” –, her family have been cautious. “My parents have a different mentality, and were worried about how the more conservative family would react,” she says. Her dream is for all Saudi women to cycle freely, but she has had to tread carefully. “Originally, I was confronted with aggression and negativity,” she says. Some women feared she would lead their daughters astray. Lacking allies, she decided to lead by example, and soon found that people came to her. Since opening a women’s cycling centre was untenable, both legally and socially, Spokes Hub originally catered exclusively for men and remains located at the university her brother attends. As such, Luhaid is barred from her own business. She has found workarounds to include women and girls – such as offering Spokes Hub services from the back of a van. She has even designed a cycling abaya with legs, which is about to be patented. In order to attract support, Spokes Hub can not be described as being “for women”, and her brother often has to represent the business. “Investors chuckle when they hear ‘female CEO of a sports business’,” says Luhaid. But while having to dilute her feminism can be disheartening, Luhaid finds comfort and inspiration in those who came before her. She devours books like Sue Macy’s Wheels of Change, which charts the role that cycling has played in the women’s rights movement. Spokes Hub has recently won a kingdom-wide prize for start-ups, and Princess Reema – deputy president of Saudi Arabia’s Women’s Sports Authority – has publicly endorsed the project. “I’m standing against something bigger than I originally thought,” says Luhaid. “When I advocate for women’s cycling, I’m advocating for women’s independence. Changing core beliefs requires slow, consistent work,” she says. “It’s challenging, but someone has to start.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/23/go-went-gone-review-jenny-erpenbeck","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T06:30:09Z","webTitle":"Go, Went, Gone by Jenny Erpenbeck review – humanising migration","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/23/go-went-gone-review-jenny-erpenbeck","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/23/go-went-gone-review-jenny-erpenbeck","fields":{"headline":"Go, Went, Gone by Jenny Erpenbeck review – humanising migration","bodyText":"Displacement has moved beyond a literary theme; for millions, it is reality.

Previously she had looked to the layered history of her own country, Germany, in dazzling metaphysical fictions such as Visitation and The End of Days. As a Berliner born in the former East Germany in 1967, her early experience was dominated by living in a divided city within a fractured country; her work suggests that she believes human understanding resides in memory. Her new novel resonates with an unexpected simplicity that is profound, unsettling and subtle. The prose, as before astutely translated by Susan Bernofsky, is this time far less incantatory. There is none of the stylistic bravura of Visitation, with its haunting scenes of lives lived and ended, often in images of horror, and of a silent gardener serving as a lone witness to the rampages of history. Instead Erpenbeck has relinquished theatricality for a conventional, calm and at times wry narrative that follows Richard, a self-contained widower and newly retired academic, as he discovers empathy through delving into the individual ordeals of a group of African asylum seekers in Berlin whom he gradually befriends and tries to help. As the novel opens, the former classics professor is dealing with the prospect of retirement. His self-absorption dictates his daily routines; he is Everyman minding his patch. In his case it is a comfortable home complete with a high-maintenance garden. There is even his boat, tethered by a picturesque lake. Only there is a problem: the lake is less appealing these days. A man has drowned. It was a swimming accident, not suicide. “They say the ill-fated swimmer was wearing goggles.” Disturbingly, the body remains lost somewhere beneath the placid surface. The image of it drifting in the water recurs throughout the novel and is a powerful metaphor for the uncertain existence of the asylum seekers suspended by bureaucracy – forbidden to work, to stay, to make a life. It is only when watching the evening news that he realises he had walked by 10 African men staging a hunger strike. “Why didn’t Richard see these men at Alexanderplatz?” When the anonymous protest is ended, he regards it as a pity. “He’d liked the notion of making oneself visible by publicly refusing to say who one is. Odysseus had called himself Nobody to escape from the Cyclops’s cave.” From the opening pages, Erpenbeck makes clear that this cultivated academic knows little about Africa. “Where is Burkina Faso?” he wonders, and is surprised to learn that there are 54 African countries. The book could easily have become a well-intentioned polemic, but Erpenbeck combines her philosophical intellect with hours of conversations conducted with refugees to tell a very human story about a lonely, emotionally insulated man slowly discovering there is a far wider, urgent world beyond him through his meetings with extraordinary, vividly drawn migrants, each with a story to tell. Richard is a remarkable creation. He was once himself a displaced child in wartime; initially it is curiosity that draws him to the men. He approaches them as if they are a project, reading several books before compiling “a catalogue of questions for conversations he wants to have with them”. The list is heartbreaking: “Where did you grow up? What’s your native language? What’s your religious affiliation? How many people are in your family? Was there a TV? Did you have pets? How did you say your goodbyes? Can you imagine growing old here? Where do you want to be buried?” But these men are not cases, they are lives. Some had children, some saw parents being killed. Others watched from boats as friends drowned. Erpenbeck and her translator make effective use of the inane rigidity of bureaucratic language. The law is not concerned that the men are victims of war: “The details of their histories are the sole legal responsibility of the country where they first set foot on European soil … The first thing that’ll be decided on is whether or not they’re allowed to apply for asylum.” The Africans master many languages yet struggle with German. Why? Because no one speaks it to them. Richard helps the men, responding to their interests, contrasting individual cultures and specific dilemmas, whose agonies make him recall tales from the Brothers Grimm. The refugees have nothing except their memories and their mobile phones, which contain invaluable numbers – their sole links with family, friends and who they once were. Richard, a present-day pilgrim, becomes only too conscious of what he does not know. Music enables him to establish a friendship with one of the men, Osarobo. This echoes the sentiment from Visitation when an old woman recalls: “In the end there are certain things you can take with you when you flee, things that have no weight, such as music.” Great fiction doesn’t have to be real, but it does have to be true. Erpenbeck’s powerful tale, delivered in a wonderfully plain, candid tone, is both real and true. It will alert readers, make us more aware and, it is to be hoped, more human. • Eileen Battersby’s Teethmarks on My Tongue is published by Dalkey Archive. • Go Went Gone is published by Granta.

And with 86,413 locked-up prisoners, we’re producing it at record levels (Letters, 4 September and 7 September). I was put away for a short, sharp shock at 14 for stealing a bike. I was then given a three-to-five-year sentence at 15 for stealing £5. And as I raised in last week’s Lords crossbench debate on prison overcrowding, I also failed at school – as did most of my fellow inmates and virtually every person I meet in prisons today. Until we move to prevention, and until we begin to dismantle poverty, we will have overcrowded prisons. Prisons that don’t work. We can be as clever as we like and come up with all sorts of new solutions, but, first, let us stop the churn. Let us stop the arrival of people into prisons. And let us accept that the revolutionary need in our thinking is that prevention is better than cure. John Bird House of Lords • Yet again we are told the shocking truth about how many children get involved with the criminal justice system in England and Wales. In this case (Exposed: race bias in British justice system, 8 September) David Lammy puts the focus on black, Asian and minority ethnic individuals. It applies to adults as well, but arguably the worst damage inflicted by unnecessary prosecutions is to minors (the English system allows prosecutions from the age of 10, only just less outrageous than the Scottish at eight). The idea of deferred prosecutions is excellent and one hopes, though without too much optimism, that the government will go for this idea. However, we have had an almost equally good procedure available since an act brought in by the Blair government in 1999: referral orders. These do require prosecutions, but are only available in cases where a plea of guilty is entered, so do not involve lengthy trials. Under a referral order the person convicted, instead of going into the penal system in some way or other, is “referred” to a panel of volunteers organised by the local youth offending team (a mixed group of professionals, including social services and the police). Referral orders are still little known by the public, but they operate under the ethos of restorative justice and have a low reoffending rate. They have never been used as much as they could have been, and youth offending teams are much weakened by cuts to local government. Their use could be revived and extended. In the case of BAME offenders, panels could be made up of people from the appropriate community. Restorative justice works. It maximises the chance of rehabilitation (it “restores” the offender to his or her community) and minimises reoffending. For some reason, our system is still resistant to it, preferring punishment even when it manifestly doesn’t work and uses up vast amounts of taxpayers’ money. Jeremy Cushing Exeter • David Lammy is right. It will take more than simple policy change to tackle the racial discrimination that defines – and shames – our criminal justice system. Our experience shows that some of the biggest barriers to a fairer system are institutionalised and it is vital that government, the courts, probation service, youth offending teams and custodial settings are all led by Lammy’s principle of “explain or reform” to make inaction on racial and ethnic disparities a thing of the past. As leaders of agencies working with men and women across the criminal justice system and/or members of the Young Review, we are committed to creating a system that no longer discriminates against men and women from BAME communities and to supporting the leaders of our justice system to achieve this. We start by calling on government to fully support Lammy’s recommendations and seize this opportunity to create a criminal justice system which delivers value, fairness and effectiveness for us all. We need a clear and transparent plan of practical action, and to increase public trust and confidence by involving BAME community groups and voluntary organisations to support every part of our justice system.

He has recognised the significant negative impact that the criminal records disclosure regime has on people’s chances of finding work after they’ve turned their lives around. It unnecessarily anchors people to their past, locks them out of the labour market and has a considerable financial cost to society through out-of-work benefits. The regime is in desperate need of reform. Unlock has long supported the introduction of a criminal records tribunal, a process that would enable individuals to apply to have their criminal record deemed spent or filtered, and, if granted, would mean it must no longer be disclosed to employers on a relevant criminal record check. There is evidence from overseas that this approach works, and it would help to address the injustice that many people face as a result of what are arbitrary fixed rules that take no account of the positive steps people have taken since their criminal record. Christopher Stacey Co-director, Unlock, for people with convictions • The Lammy review has raised important questions about the treatment of black, Asian and minority ethnic individuals in the criminal justice system. One group that urgently needs renewed focus is BAME women. They face a double disadvantage: discriminated against because of both their gender and their race. The report draws particular attention to the magistrates courts, where BAME women are more likely to be convicted than white women and are more likely to be tried at crown court after being charged. This coincides with what women told us for our own research, giving troubling accounts of discrimination and injustice from the courts through to prison. Most women in prison have committed nonviolent offences, and the root causes of their offending are often linked to high levels of disadvantage and complex needs, including mental ill health, addiction and experience of abuse. The overuse of prison for remand and sentencing of women needs to end. We must invest in prevention and community-based support, including women’s centres, which are proven to be more effective than prison at reducing reoffending. Sexism, racism and unconscious bias should have no part in the criminal justice system. It is imperative that action is taken to ensure fairness throughout the process – with increased understanding of the distinct experiences of BAME women. We hope that the publication of the Lammy review is a first step to achieving this. Katharine Sacks-Jones Director, Agenda Dr Kate Paradine Chief executive, Women in Prison • In prisons we see the vulnerable preyed upon by fellow inmates, with even their food stolen in some cases, for want of help and representation. We have legal aid so restricted now hardly anyone qualifies. There are only 5,000 criminal defence solicitors left in England and Wales. A staggering 1,000 resigned in April because of the difficulties in finding clients who qualify for legal aid under the new scheme. It is high time the government expanded its public defender programme and offered to employ these 5,000 solicitors as civil servants, providing free criminal defence in our magistrates’ courts and police stations. They could mostly work from home and have jobs allocated to them by the duty solicitor call centre at very low cost. Nigel Boddy (Solicitor), Darlington • I was saddened to read the report of David Lammy’s review, not only by the injustice he found, but because most of the facts were known and had been exposed by the work of Nacro and others 30 years ago. They have hardly changed since then and we have been reminded of them several times – for example, by the Parekh report in 2000. Many of the ideas contained in his recommendations were also discussed at that time. Sincere and well-intentioned efforts to bring about change lost momentum when they came to be dismissed as “political correctness” and because they did not fit the tick-box culture of management which was then becoming prevalent. Experience shows that the issues to be tackled are about much more than organisation, process and management. They are about the kind of people we are and the kind of country we want to live in; they are matters of social and professional conscience and they deserve much more than a conventionally bland or complacent response.

It’s a love story, it’s a spy thriller, it’s an underwater adventure, it’s about terrorism, it’s about climate change, it’s about being ghosted by text (!). But ultimately – sadly, predictably – it’s also a bit of a mess. Adapted from the novel by JM Ledgard, it focuses on two people brought together by a chance encounter. James (James McAvoy) is a Scottish spy about to embark on a dangerous mission in Somalia. Danny (Alicia Vikander) is a professor and a bio-mathematician about to head to the bottom of the ocean to explore what lifeforms might exist. They find each other at a plush hotel in France, both taking a chance to relax before embarking on their high-risk missions. There’s an instant frisson and in the space of a few days, they fall in love, eager to see more of each other once they return. But when James is kidnapped by jihadists, Danny is left waiting for a text message that might never come, unaware of his predicament as she prepares for her deep dive. What’s most frustrating about Submergence is that the stage is so readily set for a sweeping, elevated and intelligent romance. There’s a handsome set of beautifully captured locations, an occasionally lush soundtrack, a source text filled with a rich tapestry of social issues and intrigue and a central pair brought together and torn apart by their high-risk professions. But in trying to do so much, Wenders’s film ends up doing so very little. Right from the outset, it’s clear there’s a problem with Erin Dignam’s script, stilted and confusing dialogue sounding as if it’s been mistranslated. Dignam was also responsible for Sean Penn’s unholy flop The Last Face, a film that similarly squandered two talented actors on a misfiring romance. This isn’t quite so staggeringly awful but there’s a clear commonality: neither film seems to understand courtship. The scenes of the couple flirting and building a watertight bond need to be hugely impactful as we’re supposed to believe as an audience that within mere days, a relationship is forged. But it’s tough to invest in, despite the very best efforts of the actors involved. There are interesting details along the way, especially with regards to the unusual gender dynamic between the two. In the scenes of affection between them, Vikander assumes the more traditionally masculine position and her character is the more sexually forward, brushing off the idea of a relationship initially as she is too busy with work. McAvoy, an ever-reliable presence, is more physically tentative yet emotionally open and there’s a frisson between them that works even when their dialogue lets them down (it might be related to her job but is “What ocean is your favorite?” ever an acceptable chat-up line?). When the two part, McAvoy’s character gets the far more interesting storyline as he falls deeper into a jihadist community, unsure of his fate. Depressingly, Vikander’s character, who had spent so much time talking about the potentially world-shifting importance of what she might find in the ocean, spends the rest of the film checking her damn phone to see if he’s texted. The origins of life be damned! Where can she get some signal? It’s repetitive and regressive and she finds it an understandable struggle to maintain our investment in her fate. It’s also another curious misstep for the Oscar winner, after the much-delayed period turkey Tulip Fever, her brief period of picking roles in adaptations of unlikely and unfilmable literary love stories hopefully coming to an end. There’s something to be admired about a film that can gracefully defy simple genre categorization but Submergence feels like a clumsy melange, a confused adaptation made by people who don’t seem quite sure what they have on their hands. Submergence is screening at the Toronto film festival and will be released at a later date"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"}]}}
