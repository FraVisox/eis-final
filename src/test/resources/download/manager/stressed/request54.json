Though it bills itself as an LGBTQ+ version of Woman’s Hour, Homo Sapiens is much jollier and funnier than that sounds, plus – result! – there’s no dodgy 15-minute drama tagged on the end. (Actually, in last week’s episode, Young and Sweeney mentioned that they’ve recently been on Woman’s Hour and that Young had met Jenni Murray before. “She was different to when I’d met her,” he said, “because we were at an event and she was… ” “Drunk?” inquired Sweeney, sweetly. Well, it made me laugh.) Anyhow, for their new series, our two hosts have become more intrepid, venturing out of their cosy north London kitchens to visit interesting interviewees across the country. We are promised chats with Alan Cumming, Skin from Skunk Anansie and Johann Hari in the coming weeks, but for last week’s opener, the lads landed the big JC. Not Jesus, not Jarvis, but Jeremy Corbyn. They were inordinately pleased about this, and even for those of us with reservations about the Labour leader, the interview was a delight, covering gay rights and mental health issues, as well as Corbyn’s childhood, his jam-making techniques and how to maintain a compost heap. “Do you turn your compost?” asked Corbyn. “Do you water your heap?” Young: “I wee on it.” Anyhow, engaging as this interview was, I must say I enjoyed the preliminary chat between Young and Sweeney even more. Their quips and teasing, their double double entendres (quadruple?) make for lively, giggly listening. They have great bantz, for want of a better expression. And this week’s episode, with Jack Monroe, was similar. Daft, funny chat (top marks for Young’s anecdote about talking his way into a lift with the Chelsea football team), followed by their interview with Monroe, in which they managed to discuss her being libelled by Katie Hopkins on Twitter without ever mentioning Hopkins’s name – quite the achievement. Homo Sapiens was lovely last season, but this season it’s upped its game even more. You feel that Young and Sweeney could podcast their way along a bus journey now they’ve become so accomplished. Another podcaster supreme is Adam Buxton, whose self-made interview show is required listening for many people. No wonder the BBC has tempted him back for a new series of short programmes called You’re Doing It Wrong – a title so Buxton it made me smile before it even began. The first episode was about work. Buxton interviewed a “happiness consultant” (“I’m a misery technician,” he said in an aside). The consultant tried to describe a modern workplace: “Fuzzy smiles… Instagram-happy…”; “Ball pit?” said Buxton. “Yes,” she said, “but I think, let’s get deeper…” “Deeper ball pit?” inquired Buxton. He is so good. He even managed to make some thought-provoking points about work among his jokes. Just room to mention BBC podcast Unpopped, in which host Hayley Campbell unpicks pop cultural moments with the help of experts. Like In Our Time, but actually about our time. Campbell is good, and the show is interesting, but the listener enjoyment factor varies according to the speakers. Put Juno Dawson on every week, then everything will be fine. Women in love… three of the best lesbian podcasts Dyking Out podchaser.com Two American comedians, Carolyn Bergier and Sarah York, plus a guest, bash swiftly through news, pop culture, and lesbian and queer life in general. Upbeat and witty, Dyking Out takes the form of most matey podcasts: lots of chat and silliness, a little too much talking over the top of each other and much laughter. Episodes cover topics as varied as “problematic gay men”, “dating straight women” and “pets”, all pulled apart in a discursive, interested and interesting manner. Alice Isn’t Dead Night Vale presents From the producers of the amazing Night Vale, this excellent drama series is properly spooky. A truck driver searches across America for the wife she thought was dead. Intimately broadcast, gorgeously written, beautifully made, every detail is thought through – and there are a nice lot of episodes to binge on. If scary fiction is your thing, then try Mabel too, where a carer starts to explore a family house in a story told via phone calls, recorded messages and weird cut-ins. The Lesbian Historic Motif Podcast thelesbiantalkshow.com A spinoff from the The Lesbian Talk Show, this is stuffed with bookish information, delivered like a talk from a well-informed lecturer. Every month there’s an interview with an author of historic fiction that features queer women, another show where the author talks about books they like, one about a woman from history whose lesbianism is not usually acknowledged, and one about the podcast’s ongoing research project.

The 45th president of the United States would not be Hillary Rodham Clinton, as had been widely predicted, but Donald J Trump. The day after he was inaugurated, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Washington as part of the Women’s March; worldwide, millions attended hundreds of related marches. Since then, Trump’s presidency has been marked by protests. “It all started with the election – we were like, ‘We need to do something,’” says Jennifer Lippert, editorial director at Princeton Architectural Press in New York. She spotted a blog post showing a sign in a window that said “Everyone Welcome Here” and this sparked an idea: PAP would put out a call for political posters and publish the best as a book, donating the proceeds to non-profit organisations. “We didn’t want curse words in it, and we didn’t want it to be about Trump – we wanted it to be about the issues,” says Lippert. They received 800 submissions from around the world, covering topics such as climate change, civil rights, LGBTQ issues, healthcare, feminism and gun control. “In the last couple of years there’s been so much happening with protests. Since the election we’ve definitely seen more people engaged in the political environment,” says Lippert. The 50 posters in the book were chosen on the strength of their graphic design, the clarity of their message and their ability to grab people’s attention. They are also detachable: “The whole point of the book was that they would be hung up – in windows, in shops, in dorm rooms, on front doors, in offices…” Graphic design activism has a rich history, and when putting the book together, Lippert’s editorial team did extensive research into protest art going back to the 1960s. It found that although there is now much more computer-generated art, other techniques have remained the same – hand-drawn posters and collages are still among the most popular. And while there is now more focus on LGBTQ rights, many of the issues being discussed 50 years ago are still relevant – the environment, peace, equal rights. “It’s hard to think about things not getting better. But I feel like there are so many issues we still have to overcome that we’ve always had to overcome. The biggest, I think, is equality for everybody.” Lippert remains hopeful: the recent rise in activism, she believes, is a promising sign for the future. “I think when you start taking things away from people – their right to speak out, equality – it sparks a change. People realise that they do have a voice and they need to use it, otherwise change will never happen. I think that’s what we’re seeing now.” Posters for Change – Tear, Paste, Protest: 50 Removable Posters is published by Princeton Architectural Press on 20 March"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global-development/2018/mar/01/no-african-country-will-end-child-malnutrition-by-2030-says-study","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T10:00:07Z","webTitle":"Africa 'very, very far away' from meeting global target to end child malnutrition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/01/no-african-country-will-end-child-malnutrition-by-2030-says-study","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/mar/01/no-african-country-will-end-child-malnutrition-by-2030-says-study","fields":{"headline":"Africa 'very, very far away' from meeting global target to end child malnutrition","bodyText":"No African country is expected to reach the UN target of ending childhood malnutrition by 2030, according to a new study. The research, comprised of two papers published in the science journal Nature, is the first of its kind to identify local hotspots for poor child nutrition and low education levels across 51 African countries. By using maps of local health and education data, in 5x5 sq km across the whole continent, researchers identified variations at state and county level missed from previous comparisons. Simon Hay, senior author of the papers and director of geospatial science at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, said the UN global goal of ending childhood malnutrition was always quoted as an “aspirational” target. “All we are trying to say is that this aspiration is very, very far away,” Hay said. “Particularly at a time when people are questioning, at least in the US, at the top levels of government, the value of international aid and what it brings.” The study found that many countries, including Ghana and southern Nigeria, had shown improvement in childhood stunting and wasting since 2000, but indicated that malnutrition indicators remained “persistently high” in 14 countries, stretching the length of the African Sahel from Senegal in the west to Eritrea in the east. “Most of the previous assessments were made at best at a state level and many at a country level,” said Hay. “That masks a lot of variations in a country.” For instance, in Nigeria the national average for basic schooling in 2015 was seven years. Yet the study found wide gaps between northern and southern communities, ranging from two years in the former to 10 years in the latter. Hay said for investments in global health to make progress towards the UN’s sustainable development goals, efforts must be made to address the social inequalities that drive health disparities. The research, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, found that most improvements in child growth failure were sparked by large political, social and financial investments. It was “no coincidence” that nations like Chad, Central African Republic, Somalia and much of the Sahel – areas that had experienced conflict and received less international assistance for child and newborn health – showed no progress, said the study. The researchers warned that the “continued high burden” of wasting in arid sections of the Sahel, the Horn of Africa and southern areas of sub-Saharan Africa was “especially important” given the implications of famine on health, geopolitical unrest and mass migration. The study highlighted a widespread need to adopt “evidence based precision public health programmes to track and improve progress” in order to give clinicians, teachers, donors and others an insight into where best to direct resources. In a foreword to Nature, Kofi Annan, a former UN secretary general, described progress in the fight to end hunger as “patchy” and called for more data to help end malnutrition. “Data gaps undermine our ability to target resources, develop policies and track accountability,” Annan said. “Without good data, we’re flying blind. If you can’t see it, you can’t solve it.” He singled out Senegal, where making malnutrition a political priority has reaped dividends, as an example of what African countries can achieve with impetus from the state. Stunting rates in the west African country dropped by one-third between 2011 and 2015 after the prime minister’s office set up a co-ordinating body tasked with reducing malnutrition."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2018/mar/30/gender-ideology-big-bogus-and-coming-to-a-fear-campaign-near-you","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T07:00:14Z","webTitle":"'Gender ideology': big, bogus and coming to a fear campaign near you","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/30/gender-ideology-big-bogus-and-coming-to-a-fear-campaign-near-you","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/mar/30/gender-ideology-big-bogus-and-coming-to-a-fear-campaign-near-you","fields":{"headline":"'Gender ideology': big, bogus and coming to a fear campaign near you","bodyText":"Costa Rica goes to the polls this weekend for a presidential runoff election in which economic concerns have unexpectedly been overshadowed by a debate over gay marriage. The current frontrunner – rightwing evangelical candidate Fabricio Alvarado – leapfrogged 12 rivals to win February’s first-round vote, largely thanks to his pledge to ignore an Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruling which warned Costa Rica that it must guarantee same-sex couples equal rights to marriage. What was even more remarkable than his sudden electoral surge was that Alvarado had managed to make the election in Central America’s most stable democracy hinge on an abstract – some would say specious – concept: “gender ideology”. The phrase is neither a legitimate academic term, nor a political movement. It is a theory drummed up by hard-right religious activists, who present it as a gay- and feminist-led movement out to upend the traditional family and the natural order of society. It’s a catchall phrase to sell a false narrative and justify discrimination against women and LGBT people. And it is winning elections. The term first surfaced in the Vatican, in the mid-1990s, a time when sexual and reproductive rights were formally recognised by the UN, and when gender entered the lexicon of the global body. Gender equality was finally being protected and promoted by international legal obligations. Advances in women’s rights threatened the Catholic church, which feared this would open the floodgates to abortion and promiscuous behaviour, and lead to the downfall of western civilisation. By 1997 the notion of a “gender ideology” gained wider momentum with the publication of Dale O’Leary’s The Gender Agenda. This influential text – reportedly read by members of the Vatican – maintained that substituting the word “sex” with “gender”, in international spaces like the UN was part of a global feminist scheme to dissolve the family and remake society. By the early 2000s, a transnational movement agitating against “gender ideology” was strengthening. And not just in Catholic Poland, Brazil and Ireland, but in reliably progressive countries like Germany and France. One of the most remarkable deployments of gender ideology was during the 2016 Colombia peace referendum. After 52 years of civil war, Colombians were widely expected to vote for a peace accord. Yet in a stunning setback, voters rejected the deal by a narrow margin. It was Latin America’s Brexit moment. One contributing factor was a fear campaign launched by peace opponents. They framed efforts to address gender-based violence and to ensure the political participation of women and LGBT people as the work of gender ideologues out to subvert the traditional family and Colombia’s Christian values. In Costa Rica and Colombia, activists were able to weaponise the term to attack secular human rights institutions, and in the process, reclaim Christian cultural primacy. But its value lies in its ambiguity. Because the term is so ill-defined and misunderstood, it can be repackaged for any country and any context. In Europe, it is often used by anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant parties. The connection may at first not seem obvious – most observant Muslims do not support abortion or LGBT rights. But rightwing populists imply that both Muslims and pro-choice, and pro-LGBT defenders have an interest in the destruction of western society, that both benefit from anti-discrimination policies and protections – and that both are out to remake and dominate the political and social order. In Europe, even mechanisms to protect women from gender-based violence, such as the Istanbul convention, are being attacked for pushing a covert agenda. Elsewhere, the spectre of “gender ideology” has been deployed to help purge ministries that protect women. This happened in Austria – which in 2000 folded its women’s ministry into the ministry for social affairs – and also in Brazil and Costa Rica. And we can’t talk about eliminating protections for women without mentioning Trump’s funding cuts to the Office of Global Women’s Issues. In Costa Rica, Alvarado has promised that if elected, he will not only ignore the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruling, but would also pull the country out of the Organization of American States, the oldest international institutional system dedicated to human rights and democracy. Ultimately, what’s being targeted is the infrastructure of democracy. This is the genius of the anti-gender ideology formula. Its plasticity to be secular and anti-Muslim in Europe, and unapologetically Christian in Latin America. The term is no longer part of the Catholic rightwing vernacular, but that of a transnational conservative movement dedicated to preventing, and even undoing, progress on women’s and LGBT rights."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/28/trump-jeff-sessions-attack-twitter-fisa-investigation","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T17:04:31Z","webTitle":"Trump attacks Jeff Sessions over inquiry into alleged surveillance abuses","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/28/trump-jeff-sessions-attack-twitter-fisa-investigation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/feb/28/trump-jeff-sessions-attack-twitter-fisa-investigation","fields":{"headline":"Trump attacks Jeff Sessions over inquiry into alleged surveillance abuses","bodyText":"Donald Trump has once again lashed out at his attorney general, tweeting that he found a plan by Jeff Sessions to use his department’s internal watchdog to review alleged surveillance abuses by intelligence teams “DISGRACEFUL!” Sessions announced on Tuesday that the Department of Justice’s inspector general, its internal watchdog, would investigate allegations that the FBI and the Department of Justice abused Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa) procedures to spy on a Trump campaign adviser. “We believe the Department of Justice must adhere to the highest standards in the Fisa court, and, yes, it will be investigated … The inspector general will take that as one of the matters he’ll deal with,” Sessions told reporters during a press briefing. On Wednesday morning, Trump attacked Sessions with a convoluted tweet. “Why is A.G. Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse. Will take forever, has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc. Isn’t the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use Justice Department lawyers? DISGRACEFUL!” Trump wrote. The DoJ inspector general is Michael Horowitz, appointed under the Obama administration in 2012. The DoJ typically expects to operate without interference from the White House. Sessions said on Wednesday afternoon he would do his job with “integrity and honor”. Members of the House intelligence committee have been warring over allegations by Republicans, crystallized in a memo controversially released by committee chairman Devin Nunes, that the DoJ and FBI submitted misleading information when applying for Fisa warrants to surveil former Trump campaign aide Carter Page, who has links to Russia. Horowitz’s team is already investigating the former FBI director James Comey’s handling during the presidential election of Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state. Sessions, without mentioning the president, later issued a statement, saying: “We have initiated the appropriate process that will ensure complaints against this Department will be fully and fairly acted upon if necessary. As long as I am the Attorney General, I will continue to discharge my duties with integrity and honor, and this Department will continue to do its work in a fair and impartial manner according to the law and Constitution.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/feb/28/a-visit-to-toys-r-us-or-maplin-shows-why-they-are-doomed","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T17:29:24Z","webTitle":"A visit to Toys R Us or Maplin shows why they are doomed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/28/a-visit-to-toys-r-us-or-maplin-shows-why-they-are-doomed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/feb/28/a-visit-to-toys-r-us-or-maplin-shows-why-they-are-doomed","fields":{"headline":"A visit to Toys R Us or Maplin shows why they are doomed","bodyText":"After hearing the news that Toys R Us UK was to go into administration on Wednesday morning, removal men Mark Connor and John Banks decided to pop into the business’s tired-looking store on the outskirts of Manchester city centre for a “nostalgia trip”. “It’s like a relic from the 80s,” said Banks. “The last time I came here, I was playing with Transformers.” Connor said he was keeping his eye out for Lego or Star Wars toys for his five-year-old son, but found that – despite the business’s troubles – prices were still too high. “I’ve just compared one item they’ve got over there to what’s on eBay,” he said. “It’s £40 and you can get it for £15 online.” The 30,000 sq ft Toys R Us store in the Ancoats area of the city had been earmarked for closure before the announcement, as the retail park it sits in is set to be redeveloped. On Wednesday morning only a handful of customers could be seen wandering through its aisles, with about 10 members of staff huddled chatting near the tills. Mike Meszaros, who was in the store to find an outfit for his son for World book day, said he could remember the shop in better days. “You’d come in and it was like Hamleys,” he said. “You’d have staff demonstrating the toys. They’d have stuff set up that you could play with … It’s not like that now. It’s quite sad really.” Electrical goods retailer Maplin also went into administration on Wednesday morning. The dribble of customers coming out of one of the chain’s small stores on Manchester’s Oxford Road in the afternoon were similarly clear that the business had been a victim of e-commerce. “Most of the products that they sell, a lot of people, especially younger generations, will now look online for,” said student Jack Poulton. “The only reason I came in today is its proximity to the university and because I needed something immediately, otherwise I would have gone online myself.” Poulton visited the shop, which has been on the same site for more than 30 years, to see if they stocked a specific magnifying lens. “They didn’t have it,” he said. “But the manager knew instantly where to look. I would have no complaints about the service. It’s just that it’s very easy to find what they sell in Maplin on Amazon these days.” Inside the tidy and well-ordered store the staff, who usually outnumber customers three-to-one, said they could not speak to the press, but confirmed they had heard the news about the business that morning. Aslam Malik, who works for Manchester city council, popped in on his way past, after hearing that the company was going into administration, to see if they had a cheap DVD player for his nephew. He did not find what he was looking for. “What they sell is quality stuff, but they are very expensive,” he said. “You can buy a printer for £20 or £30 from Tesco and Asda these days. I would usually look on eBay and at the big supermarkets for things like that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/feb/28/prezzo-restaurant-chain-to-close-a-third-of-its-uk-branches","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T18:02:20Z","webTitle":"Prezzo restaurant chain to close a third of its UK branches","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/28/prezzo-restaurant-chain-to-close-a-third-of-its-uk-branches","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/feb/28/prezzo-restaurant-chain-to-close-a-third-of-its-uk-branches","fields":{"headline":"Prezzo restaurant chain to close a third of its UK branches","bodyText":"The Italian restaurant chain Prezzo is to close a third of its 300 UK branches, putting about 1,000 jobs at risk, the latest victim of the casual dining crunch. The chain, owned by the US private equity group TPG Capital, hopes to engineer a turnaround plan echoing steps taken by the burger chain Byron and Jamie’s Italian to keep themselves afloat. Prezzo’s creditors will be asked to approve proposals under which its restaurants’ landlords accept rent reductions. About 100 unprofitable outlets are likely to close altogether, including all branches of its Tex-Mex offshoot, Chimichanga, in an attempt to put the business on a sound long-term financial footing. While landlords have yet to agree to the plan – known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) – it is expected to result in about 1,000 of the 4,500-strong UK workforce losing their jobs. Sources close to the company said staff would be transferred to the surviving restaurants where possible. Prezzo is one of several high-street restaurant chains to announce restructuring plans as firms battle factors including rising business rates, higher staff costs due to the “national living wage” and fragile consumer confidence. Restaurants are also feeling the strain of stiff competition in the crowded casual dining sector, after an influx of private-equity backed firms. Last month, creditors agreed a CVA to rescue Byron, the chain whose upmarket offering caused embarrassment for the then chancellor, George Osborne, in 2013 when his expensive taste in fast food was called into question. The celebrity chef Jamie Oliver’s chain, Jamie’s Italian, also entered into a CVA this month. Prezzo’s directors are understood to believe that the company is in better shape than either Byron or Jamie’s Italian, given that it made a profit of £5m last year and has £11m cash in the bank. But the CVA will reshape the business, cutting out less profitable restaurants to reflect lower demand, indicated by sales that have been declining compared with last year. A CVA involves creditors agreeing to forgo some of what they are owed by a business rather than risk it disappearing altogether. In the case of restaurant chains, this usually involves landlords accepting reduced rent payments. A CVA has to be agreed by creditors with a combined claim of more than 75% of what the company owes, with the remaining 25% bound by the same terms if the deal goes through."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/feb/28/howard-rees-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T18:28:13Z","webTitle":"Howard Rees obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/feb/28/howard-rees-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/feb/28/howard-rees-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Howard Rees obituary","bodyText":"My former colleague Howard Rees, who has died aged 89, was the chief veterinary officer who dealt with the problem of salmonella in eggs in the 1980s and introduced the measures that eventually saw off the problem of BSE in cattle. He was widely regarded as the most able veterinary public servant of his generation. On retirement in 1988 he became president of the World Organisation for Animal Health’s animal health code commission in Paris and under his presidency the commission drafted complex and contentious guidelines that dealt with the international trade in livestock in the context of BSE. He held the post for nine years and was awarded the organisation’s gold medal in 1994. Howard was born and grew up in Llanelli, the son of Walter and Margaret Rees, and attended the grammar school there before going on to the Royal Veterinary College in London. He qualified as a veterinary surgeon in 1951. After a short period in general practice he joined the state veterinary service, which, he said, gave him more time to play rugby. On his posting in Stafford he played for the club there, the county and the West Midlands. He soon gained valuable experience of disease problems in the livestock industry. This was a time when infectious diseases such as swine fever, bovine brucellosis and tuberculosis had not yet been brought under control. He was posted to the service’s headquarters at Tolworth, London, in 1973 and became chief veterinary officer in 1980. His most notable early achievement was to lead the team that completed the eradication of brucellosis, a disease that was widespread in cattle herds. As CVO he had to deal with the problem of salmonella in eggs and, shortly before he retired, the emerging and potentially catastrophic problem of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). It was on his watch that the government rapidly introduced the ruminant feed ban, which eventually led to the virtual elimination of the disease. One of Howard’s strengths was that he had what the Welsh call “dawn”, the gift of foresight. This enabled him to identify potential problems before they became apparent to others. But he also had an able and practical intellect that meant his judgment was trusted by colleagues and by ministers on potential but often difficult courses of action. When he eventually retired, he and his wife, Mollie, moved to Pennard on the Gower coast. He is survived by Mollie (nee Collins), whom he married in 1952, and by their four children, 14 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2018/mar/01/world-weatherwatch-a-beast-unleashed-by-stratospheric-warming","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T11:45:44Z","webTitle":"World weatherwatch: a beast unleashed by stratospheric warming","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/01/world-weatherwatch-a-beast-unleashed-by-stratospheric-warming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/mar/01/world-weatherwatch-a-beast-unleashed-by-stratospheric-warming","fields":{"headline":"World weatherwatch: a beast unleashed by stratospheric warming","bodyText":"This week, for the first time since 2012, Rome was blanketed in nearly 10cm of snow in temperatures of -10C, as the “Beast from the East” crept in from across northern Russia. Beast from the East refers to the bitter easterly winds that carry exceptionally cold and dry continental air across Europe. This onset of unseasonably cold weather was resultant of an abrupt shift in temperatures high in the stratosphere, known as sudden stratospheric warming, which disturbed the jet stream and natural weather patterns, allowing this cold air to seep southwards into parts of Europe. Disturbance has also been felt across the mid-west and north-eastern US, as this same southward dip in the jet stream subsequently steered in successive areas of low pressure, delivering blizzard-like conditions to the Great Lakes and New England. To central parts of the US, however, melting snow and heavy rain from relentless storms have brought significant flooding, and the wettest February ever recorded in Louisville, Pittsburgh and Indiana as 70 rivers reach flood capacity.

It was 1 March 1981, and Spain’s top scorer at the time, who passed away on Tuesday after a sudden heart attack aged 68, had just scored two more goals and was going to collect his wife and children, who were flying back into Barcelona from Asturias. It is there, at Sporting Gijón’s El Molinón ground, that his body lies in rest and where the funeral was held on Wednesday, a stadium that will now carry his name, but his loss was felt all over Spain. As the tributes came, it was not just about a wonderful footballer who was the top scorer in Spain’s first division five times, plus twice more in the second; a striker who played for Spain, Barcelona and Sporting, but a man who was universally admired; warm, generous and kind, with time for everyone. He had been diagnosed with cancer and lost his brother, a goalkeeper at Sporting, when he died saving an English boy from drowning, but Quini overcame both, guiding kids who came through at Sporting. The tribute paid to him by David Villa, in which Villa apologised for never being a better striker than the man who said he would be when he was just a small boy, is particularly heartbreaking. What happened in March 1981, though, may be the most telling portrait of all. On the way to the airport that night, Quini pulled in to a petrol station on Plaça de Comas; a DKW van, its number plate M9955AX stolen from a Seat, pulled in behind him and two men got out. Eduardo and Fernando walked slowly up to Quini, showing him a rusty Colt 45, and whispered: “Not a word: get in.” They climbed in alongside him and as he pulled away, gun pressed into his neck, the van followed his Ford Granada towards Les Corts, where he was made to get out and climb into the back of the van. The following day, the police found his car abandoned with the doors still open. By then Quini, head covered with a hood, had long since been imprisoned in an improvised cell under the floor in a lock-up in Zaragoza. It measured barely a metre and a half. The kidnapping lasted 25 days. The three men who took Quini were on the dole and desperate. They had slept rough on the hill of Montjuic as they planned the kidnapping, and when police finally liberated Quini, a magazine article on him was among the things they found. Yet the planning was far from perfect. They demanded a ransom for Quini’s return but had not agreed on how big it should be, eventually settling on 100m pesetas. During one telephone conversation they began making demands over how the 10m should be paid – in used, non-consecutive bills – only to be asked: “Excuse me? Didn’t you ask for 100 million?” “Oh,” came the reply, “yeah, the 100 million, that’s right. Erm, well, how much have you got ready for us?” “100 million.” “Right, 100 million. That’s what I meant.” The kidnappers also had no idea how to arrange for the ransom money to be delivered. No account had been set up – Barcelona had to do that for them – and they had no idea how to make good their escape. They did not have the phone number of the club, their president, any directors or players. Quini was the one who suggested that they phone his wife at home – and the one who gave them the number. Every time a suggestion was made, they panicked and feared a bluff and changed their minds constantly over who should deliver the ransom, eventually settling on the Barcelona captain Alexanko. That did not go to plan either. Followed by police motorcyclists, Alexanko was sent on a long and ultimately pointless journey from Barcelona into Girona and towards the French border, where the journey was aborted when it dawned on Spanish police that they had not contemplated being forced out of the country and had not cleared anything with their French counterparts. The kidnappers made the occasional threat, even though one of them promised Quini that nothing would happen to him, adding: “I’m even a Barcelona fan.” At one stage, they even complained that Quini was costing them a fortune in sandwiches, to which his wife, María Nieves, snapped: “You kidnapped a sportsman for god’s sake, next time kidnap a Hare Krishna.” They were kids, amateurs, and they were scared, but that did not diminish the fear and the impact on Barcelona was enormous. Bernd Schuster had refused to play the first game after the kidnapping, against Atlético Madrid, saying: “As well as legs, I have a heart.” Barcelona’s directors lied to Schuster, telling him they had had good news on Quini to try to encourage him to play but, demoralised, they lost 1-0. They lost three of the next four, drawing once. “For 25 days we didn’t win a game,” recalled Quini’s team-mate Charly Rexach. “It was impossible to concentrate on football. The league slipped out of our hands.” Eventually, the police were tipped off about the van outside the Zaragoza lock-up where he was being held. Specialists were called in, carrying Magnum revolvers. When one policeman kicked the metal shutter, his foot went straight through it, getting stuck. One of the kidnappers was cooking an egg on a butane stove. Guns pointed at his face, he gestured silently at the floor. The trap door was opened, a policeman wriggled through into the small, damp space below. Quini, unshaven, dirty and grey, had heard the noise and was hiding under his mattress, shaking. “Quini?” came the voice. “Quini, I’m a policeman. I’m here to rescue you.” Barcelona had a game four days later. “I want to play on Sunday,” Quini told them, but he was not allowed; in his absence, they lost 3-0 to Real Madrid. He later scored twice in the Copa del Rey final against his former club Sporting. He had a kickabout with the police after he attended one of their games on Montjuïc. The kidnappers were sentenced to 10 years in prison and ordered to pay him 5m pesetas. He refused the money and refused to press charges. “It wasn’t that uncomfortable, if you knew how to move into the right position,” he said. “One day they brought me down a copy of Marca so that I could see the football results and in the end they gave me a television and everything. And a chess set. I played on my own, but I like playing on my own. “My kidnappers are good people who did me no harm; I forgive them,” Quini said, which said it all."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/feb/28/grey-squirrels-are-unfairly-maligned","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T17:08:48Z","webTitle":"Grey squirrels are unfairly maligned | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/28/grey-squirrels-are-unfairly-maligned","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/feb/28/grey-squirrels-are-unfairly-maligned","fields":{"headline":"Grey squirrels are unfairly maligned","bodyText":"Your article (The faddy eater: Could I stomach southern-fried squirrel?, 22 February) should be admired for its honesty in showing appropriate discomfort with the idea of eating a creature that should have been living, breathing, playing, instead of suffering an early violent death. However, it also propagates a couple of myths regarding the highly intelligent and successful grey squirrel. The thing is, red squirrels, for whose troubles the greys are blamed, became virtually extinct in this country before greys were even introduced. That happened because of habitat loss. The reds were then also reintroduced from continental Europe, so the “nativeness” narrative is flawed. The tree damage is hugely exaggerated as well – the Forestry Commission puts the damage at 5%. More is lost due to poor growing practices. Furthermore, that figure relates to commercial forestry: in natural woodland grey squirrels are uniformly good for the ecosystem.

Oral arguments were held on Monday 26 February on Janus v AFSCME, a case that some have called the most important labor case of the century. The aim of the plaintiff’s case is to eliminate “fair share fees”, dividing public sector workers and limiting their power in numbers. If the supreme court finds in favor of the plaintiff, as they are widely expected to, public sector unions will no longer be able to collect fees automatically from the employees they represent, and these unions’ ability to operate will be dramatically undermined. This lawsuit is part of a coordinated effort from far-right groups supported by funders like the Koch brothers to “defund and defang” US unions. A 10-page fundraising letter from the Koch-backed State Policy Network, obtained by the Center for Media and Democracy, says that by undermining unions, they can ensure “the permanent collapse of progressive politics”. The billionaires behind this coordinated effort want to weaken unions and drive down wages and benefits for working people in order to line their own pockets with more profits – but that’s not their only goal. They also want to weaken the movements that working people support. When working people hold and exercise collective power, history shows that they use it to advocate for issues like climate action, civil rights, LGBTQ equality, and reproductive justice. By attacking unions, far-right conservatives hope to bring down the entire progressive movement. The same extremists who deny the reality of climate change, pollute without accountability, and seek to sell off our public lands to the highest bidder also understand that unions are the most effective way for everyday working people to build power. Unions are a political and economic pillar of the progressive community, providing a venue for millions of working people to make a difference on the issues they care about. If the US supreme court undermines the power of unions with its decision on Janus, working people will end up with fewer resources and less collective power. Such a ruling could further tilt the balance of political power in favor of the polluters who prioritize their profits over clean air, clean water and a livable climate. This attack on the ability of public sector unions to operate comes at a time when the environmental, climate and labor movements are working in closer solidarity than ever before. Over the past few years, unions like Service Employees International Union and United Steelworkers have closely allied with environmental groups on the Paris climate accord and the Clean Power Plan, and have fought for clean air and clean water in cities from Flint to Los Angeles. Union members turned out in record numbers for the People’s Climate March. Our opponents – the polluters and their supporters in Congress – have noticed, and they are working to undermine the power of unions at least in part to undercut the environmental movement. As representatives of two of the most prominent environmental organizations in the United States, we are in solidarity with working people to push back against these attacks. We know from experience that a strong union movement is essential to building a healthy environment for all. Mae Boeve is the co-founder and executive director of 350.org.

True, he has made the perilous journey from the conflict in his country, travelling alone across the mountains, dodging bandits and snipers on the way. He also survived being robbed of all his money and violently beaten in the Calais “Jungle”. But now he’s rocking in his chair, arms wrapped around himself like a much-needed hug as tears stream down his face. “I’m all alone,” he wails, doubling over in pain. “I haven’t got anyone.” Said isn’t one of my scheduled clients, having been referred to me by a children’s section colleague when he arrived this morning after a night on the streets. I know there’s little I can offer in practical terms – my colleagues, who are experts in helping young people in these circumstances, are already on the case, finding him a solicitor and emergency accommodation. Instead, I sit quietly listening, giving him the space he needs to cry the tears he’s been holding inside since fleeing his country, leaving behind everyone and everything he knows. An hour or so later, I’m listening to another young man in tears. Robel escaped the militia through the Sahara, after his family were targeted for political reasons. He knows his father was killed, and probably his sister, but he thinks his mother and a sibling made it through to Europe. He tells me he has made an appointment to see the Red Cross Family tracing service, hoping they’ll be found and he can bring them to safety in the UK. “You have to have hope,” he says, as he tells me that being apart from them is worse torture than the physical and sexual violence he suffered during six weeks’ detention in Libya. He talks about a wonderful dream he had last night, where he was with his family again – followed by the agonising pain when, he tells me, “I wake up and it’s not real … I am here all alone.” All our clients are children who have come to the UK alone. Many have grown up in stable, loving homes, with no clue that their lives would suddenly change like this, that they would find themselves a terrified teenager, alone and traumatised in a foreign land. These children could not have known that the UK is one of only two countries in the EU that refuses to grant child refugees the right to be reunited with even their closest family, unlike adult refugees. So even if Robel is granted refugee status, the government will not permit his mother or sibling to join him – the very thing that is keeping him going. Every day brings an inbox full of referrals for therapy. There’s one from a GP about a young man “separated from family, with concerns for their wellbeing and his future” who has presented with mental health issues. Another is from a foster carer worried after “Ali disclosed information about his family … He was crying alone in his room.” And there is a poignant description from a social worker, who told us: “Abbas reports that ‘his heart was hurting’ but the doctors could not find anything wrong with him when he was examined in A&amp;E.” It’s hard for therapists to witness how distraught these children feel, wanting so desperately to be reunited with their families. After more than an hour and a half with Said, I gently bring the session to a close, reminding him that he is not alone now, the Refugee Council is supporting him. “And you … you will be like my mother now and look after me,” he says and starts to sob inconsolably. The Refugee Council cannot replace the lost families of our young clients, but MPs have an opportunity to make a real difference to the lives of child refugees like Said. On Friday 16 March, Angus MacNeil’s private member’s bill on refugee family reunion is due to be debated in the Commons. This bill would allow a wider range of family members to be reunited with refugees living in the UK. It would reintroduce legal aid for refugee family reunion so that refugees who have lost everything can afford to navigate the complicated process of being reunited with their families. Crucially, it would undo the wrong that sees child refugees like Robel and Said deprived of the chance to grow up with their families. All names have been changed Sarah Temple-Smith is a children’s psychotherapist at the Refugee Council. The Refugee Council, as part of the Families Together coalition, is urging MPs across parties to vote to amend the UK’s restrictive rules keeping refugees apart from loved ones.

By 10am on Tuesday, there was a grand total of about half a millimetre. There seems to be a rather over-hyped, sensationalistic approach at times to forecasting, with warnings about the “beast from the east” and officials telling people to wrap up warm and wear sensible shoes. What would the forecasters have made of major snow events in 1981, 1987 and 1991 – far worse than this? People just got on with things. There needs to be a rethink about what actually constitutes weather warnings, in particular yellow, amber and red.

Now, Rag’n’Bone Man is talking about the difficulty of getting other artists to return his calls. If their candour seems unusual, that might be because both are in conversation with George Ezra, on the singer’s new podcast, George Ezra &amp; Friends. The premise is long-form conversations promoting “honesty” between musicians; in other words, a way for the most seemingly beige names in pop to show that – beyond hits tailor-made for Sainsbury’s shelves – they do in fact possess a charismatic side. Ezra is the latest musician to give it a go, with his show debuting at No 1 on iTunes last month. Jessie Ware’s Table Manners also topped the pod charts at the end of 2017, while the second run of Homo Sapiens – co-hosted by Will Young – is at No 14 at the time of writing. While musicians crossing over into radio is nothing new, podcasting offers a platform for artists to further sex up their personal brand, something which Ezra could arguably do with (at BBC Introducing’s 10th-birthday show last year, Steve Lamacq could offer few rock’n’roll anecdotes about the Hertford singer-songwriter, instead recalling that he had showed up for his first songwriting workshop with a packed lunch in hand). What’s more, podcasting is a medium free from the usual stipulations. “I imagine [musicians] appreciate retaining control of their ‘voice’ rather than being asked to conform as a radio host,” says pod producer Joel Porter. He sees the format as comparable to Carpool Karaoke, which showed how an informal setting “can open up a more natural conversation”. Rather than being a faceless, vanilla crooner, Ezra is freer to show a bit of personality. Here, he can moan about stressful schedules and drop the occasional swear, straying slightly from the clean-cut, gap-year vibe. Besides, it is a pretty low-stakes business move. While TV shows such as The Charlotte Church Show (2006-2008) or Lily Allen and Friends (2008) saw pop stars trying and failing to ape the chatshow experience with studio audiences, live acts and VTs, podcasts are a much safer marketing tool. Ware’s was released just after her latest album, Glasshouse, and arguably outshone the record, which peaked at No 7 before quickly slipping down the charts. Ezra’s new album Staying at Tamara’s is due at the end of the month, and you imagine the umpteen news stories rehashing his Sheeran interview won’t hurt. Indeed, it seems there are plenty more confessionals – and column inches – to be had for chart mainstays looking to play things less safe. Now, when is the Sam Smith Show out?

This follows the fashion designer Diane von Furstenburg cloning her dog two years ago. Although pet cloning is illegal in some countries – including the UK – it appears to be a burgeoning international industry. The first pet to be cloned was a cat at Texas A&amp;M University in 2001, while the first dog was cloned at Seoul National University in 2005. So, how exactly does one clone a pet? 1 The first thing anyone wishing to clone an animal needs is money. The US company Viagen, a market leader, charges $50,000 (£36,000) to clone a dog and $25,000 to clone a cat. It describes these animals as “an identical twin of the donor pet that is born at a later date”. For $1,600, you can genetically preserve your pet by freezing a tissue sample, thus keeping your options open. The dog in question doesn’t have any options, obviously. 2 Next, those interested in cloning need a vet. Cloning requires a biopsy to extract tissue from the original pet. In Streisand’s case, cells were taken from the late Samantha’s mouth and stomach. Cloning companies have different requirements. Sooam in South Korea – which claims to have created more than 1,000 clones since 2006 – prefers skin tissue if the pet is alive or skin and muscle if the pet has died. 3 If a pet dies before tissue has been extracted, cloning is still possible. But dead pets should not be put in the freezer – apparently, they belong in the fridge. Interested parties will need a large one. Or a small dog. Speed is of the essence. One British couple who cloned their late dog through Sooam has spoken of dashing to Boots for the tools they needed to remove the tissue themselves before flying out to South Korea to deliver it. 4 It seems to be the fate of cloned animals to be given rubbish names that allude to the idea of duplication. Dolly the sheep sounds like a toy sheep. The first cloned cat was named CC (carbon copy). Streisand’s dogs are Miss Violet and Miss Scarlett, after the bows they must wear to be told apart. The offspring of Winnie, the first British dog to be cloned, was named Mini Winnie. How is a dog or cat meant to express its individuality? 5 The RSPCA has “serious ethical and welfare concerns around the application of cloning technology to animals”. In a statement, the organisation said it “would recommend anyone looking for a new pet to become part of their family to adopt one of the thousands of animals in rescue centres.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"technology/2018/feb/28/bank-of-america-brand-safety-officer-clean-up-online-ads-unilever-fake-news-racism-sexism-hate","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T14:53:06Z","webTitle":"Bank of America hiring brand safety officer to 'clean up' online ads","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/28/bank-of-america-brand-safety-officer-clean-up-online-ads-unilever-fake-news-racism-sexism-hate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/feb/28/bank-of-america-brand-safety-officer-clean-up-online-ads-unilever-fake-news-racism-sexism-hate","fields":{"headline":"Bank of America hiring brand safety officer to 'clean up' online ads","bodyText":"Bank of America is to hire a “brand safety officer”, a full-time job dedicated to ensuring that the company’s advertising doesn’t appear alongside questionable content online. The new role, announced at the MWC conference in Barcelona, comes weeks after Unilever threatened to pull adverts entirely from Facebook and Google. Lou Paskalis, a senior vice president at Bank of America, said the new role was a reaction to growing fears in the company that advertising could be seen as a net negative to the company. “I get a text from my chief financial officer every time there is news about a brand safety issue,” Paskalis said, according to ad industry news site The Drum. “I know why he is sending them to me … at some point he is going to say, ‘gee is marketing safe to invest in?’ and we don’t want that. We have to clean up our house right now.” Paskalis cited Unilever’s threat to Google and Facebook as part of the company’s impetus for moving rapidly on the issue, saying he “applauded” what the company had done and that he was “with them in spirit”. “It is a function of the marketer to hold to account the individual platforms to get better,” Paskalis added. Unilever’s announcement earlier this month was prompted by a belief by the company’s chief marketing office that “parts of the internet we have ended up with [are] a million miles from where we thought it would take us”. Citing “fake news, racism, sexism, terrorists spreading messages of hate, toxic content directed at children”, Unilever’s Keith Weed argued that it was his company’s responsibility to take a stand. “We cannot continue to prop up a digital supply chain – one that delivers over a quarter of our advertising to our consumers – which at times is little better than a swamp in terms of its transparency.” “It is in the digital media industry’s interest to listen and act on this,” Weed added. “Before viewers stop viewing, advertisers stop advertising and publishers stop publishing.” In the past, advertiser pressure has been successful in forcing action from Google and Facebook, who between them control more than half of all digital advertising in the UK. In 2017, YouTube lost millions as advertisers pulled funds over fears that their brands would appear alongside extremist views or hate speech.

Something this stripped-back hasn’t won the Oscar since Crazy Heart’s The Weary Kind in 2009 – which probably only won because voters were split between two Randy Newman choices – and Stevens’ feathery songwriting will likely be blown away by the bombast elsewhere. Remember Me (from Coco) Performed by Miguel and Natalia Lafourcade Miguel goes from comparing his penis to a variety of firearms on his exceptional recent album War &amp; Leisure to rather more family-friendly fare here, for Disney animation Coco, duetting with Mexican singer Natalia Lafourcade on this song by Frozen songwriters Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez. It doesn’t blatantly tug the heartstrings as Disney winners of old have done, instead taking a modest approach with amiable acoustic strumming – which might harm its chances – but this is full of the ultra-satisfying perfect cadences that the studio is so fond of. Mighty River (from Mudbound) Performed by Mary J Blige As well as a best supporting actress nomination, Mary J Blige also gets a nod (along with co-writers Raphael Saadiq and Taura Stinson) for this song from the Netflix drama about the racism experienced by returning second world war soldiers in the southern US. Cliched lyrics about white flags and lines in the sand show that reducing civil rights struggles to greeting-card poetry is clearly the mini-trend of this year’s nominees, but Blige gives her song far more authority than Day does with hers; its raw, rootsy production is unusual for the progressive diva, and worth her exploring further. A possible curveball for the win. This Is Me (from The Greatest Showman) Performed by Keala Settle Sung over Coldplay-style “whoa-oh-ohs” and martial arena pop, this has a huge chance of winning: a way for the Academy to acknowledge the hit musical without having to give it any of the big prizes. The title alone is the affirmation that beats in the id of every Hollywood director, star and non-specific dreamchaser. The only caveat is that its writers, Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, won last year for La La Land’s City of Stars – will voters want to anoint them again? Expect it to be the ceremony’s big-budget blockbuster performance, either way."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/feb/28/team-gb-winter-olympics-decade-off-please","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T13:26:58Z","webTitle":"Well done Team GB but can we have a decade off the Olympics, please? | Paul MacInnes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/feb/28/team-gb-winter-olympics-decade-off-please","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/feb/28/team-gb-winter-olympics-decade-off-please","fields":{"headline":"Well done Team GB but can we have a decade off the Olympics, please?","bodyText":"It’s been a month of incredible success at the Winter Olympics. It was a month, right? It certainly felt like it, though others will know better. As for the success, that was indisputable. Five medals, one of which was not bronze, made it Team GB’s greatest medal haul at the Winter Games, aka the international sporting event we have little aptitude for given our preponderant meteorological conditions hover somewhere between “dreich” and “probably fine without a coat”. After such unalloyed achievement, it was not surprising to find the chief executive of the British Olympic Association bouncing off the plane from Pyeongchang to bang the drum for British winter sport and (in a remarkably dextrous move) get the begging bowl out for it at the same time. Britain’s journey to Winter Olympic domination has barely begun, declaimed Bill Sweeney. “I think we’re where we were with summer sport in 2000,” he said. It’s a reference to the Sydney Olympics, when Great Britain (as we were known then) posted their greatest medal haul since 1920. But compared with the three Games that followed, it was as a nothing. You thought that was medalling? No, this is medalling. So where are we heading next, Mr Sweeney? On which snow-dashed highlands are we fixing our sights now? And by the way, I’m presuming you’ll be on board to see it through and collect your £279,000 annual salary en route? “If we want to progress” – and who wouldn’t want that, Mr Sweeney? – “and become a top 15” – hang on – “you need more investment.” You what, mate? Top 15? After a best Winter Games performance on a biggest-ever budget, this is what we’re chasing? A dream that would see us move not only above Finland but also Slovakia in the medals table? One that would leave us tantalisingly close to overhauling Belarus? Blimey, that is some balls-out-of-the-box thinking right there. I don’t really mean to mock an aspiration for 15th in the Winter Olympics medal table. I mean to mock any and all models of success defined by medals won. Yeah, that’s right. Sure, it was good that Team GB did well in 2012. No one likes to come to an event and watch their host make a fool of themselves (unless that event is a music awards show and the host is James Corden). But in general, really, can’t we aim a little higher? The aim of any public funding in sport should be to encourage participation. That’s my feeling. As things stand, that link is not always apparent. Olympic funding from UK Sport is predicated on winning medals. A supplementary argument, and one made by UK Sport, says that if you win the medals you inspire others. Last year a survey found that the London 2012 Games inspired 7% of respondents to take up sport. I’ve heard people say that is both an awful number and, actually, when you look at it in the round, a very impressive one. Either way, if participation is the ultimate goal, emulation seems an imprecise way of delivering it. So I say let elite sport run fallow. For the next decade, say, stick all the cash we would have spent into participation instead. Take the money (which, for a four‑year cycle, we’ll round down to a third of a billion) and spend it on 3G pitches, sports halls and multipurpose courts. Actually, spend some of it on that; spend the rest on getting people to use them. As a mature democracy (ahem), a stark decline in physical activity is a live public health matter which should be concerning us. As a nation at ease in its skin (ahahah), the benefits of play should be apparent to us all. So leave the funding fallow for a decade and fund participation instead. Open the trials as widely as possible, let a thousand Eddie the Eagles spread their wings. I swear this is what the nation actually wants from the Olympics anyway, people we recognise as being something like ourselves. Who defines their sense of national pride by how many medals we win? The chairman of the BOA, Sir Hugh Robertson, does not subscribe to this view. “I think it would be a very sad day if we gave up on wanting to succeed at the Olympic Games,” the former Tory MP said this week. He went on to defend Olympic funding of skeleton (£6.5m over four years, 130 practitioners in the country) over other activities, such as the minority-friendly basketball (150,000 practitioners, not one penny). “It would be very sad if we gave up the opportunity of winning a winter medal to put in a basketball team that at the moment is going to get eliminated pretty early.” Now I can understand if Sir Hugh is getting riled as people confuse funding for elite performance with funding for all. My scheme would eliminate all such confusion. It would also assert that getting eliminated pretty early is less of a problem than the manner of it. And for those who remain ideologically committed to medal targets? Well, you get them back in 10 years, but ask yourself: what happens when you finally reach the end point? What happens when you win all the medals? Ennui, that’s what. Fin de siècle sentiment, leading inevitably to decadence. Nobody wants that. Under this scheme, I guarantee it will not happen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/01/the-weirdest-oscars-nominees-ever-ranked","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T16:00:24Z","webTitle":"The weirdest Oscars nominees ever – ranked!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/01/the-weirdest-oscars-nominees-ever-ranked","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/01/the-weirdest-oscars-nominees-ever-ranked","fields":{"headline":"The weirdest Oscars nominees ever – ranked!","bodyText":"10. Hermione Baddeley: best supporting actress nominee, Room at the Top It took just over two minutes of screen time for Baddeley to nab a nomination for her work in Jack Clayton’s 1959 drama. The current holder of the title for smallest amount of screen time resulting in an actual prize is Beatrice Straight, who won in the same category in 1977 for a performance in Network totalling just under six minutes. 9. Pierre Boulle: best adapted screenplay winner, The Bridge on the River Kwai Though Boulle had written the 1952 novel on which David Lean’s film was based, most people who saw him collect the Oscar in 1958 knew he was a front for the blacklisted writers Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson. “Everyone knew Boulle couldn’t speak English, let alone write it,” said Hollywood historian Larry Ceplair. 8. Kazuhiro Tsuji and Rick Baker: best makeup nominee, Norbit It is not that Tsuji and Baker, both masters in their field, didn’t deserve this nomination. But the idea that the woeful, fat-tastic 2007 Eddie Murphy comedy can be referred to for all time as “Academy Award nominee Norbit” makes the heart sink. But there can be no controversy, surely, over Tsuji’s nomination this year for turning Gary Oldman into Churchill in Darkest Hour. 7. Kenneth Branagh: best adapted screenplay nominee, Hamlet Branagh’s four-hour 1996 version of Hamlet – comprising the full first folio supplemented by the second quarto – worked more as filmed theatre than cinema, give or take some gimmicky guest stars (Ken Dodd as Yorick, anyone?). Perverse, then, to single out the script for a nomination when Branagh seemed merely to have decanted the play into Final Draft. 6. George Bernard Shaw: best adapted screenplay joint winner, Pygmalion Thirteen years after winning the Nobel prize for literature, Shaw added an Oscar (shared with Ian Dalrymple, Cecil Lewis and WP Lipscomb) to his mantelpiece in 1938 for his hand in the film adaptation of his 1913 play Pygmalion. It would, in turn, inspire future Oscar winner My Fair Lady and nominee Pretty Woman. 5. Roderick Jaynes: best editing nominee, Fargo and No Country For Old Men The Coen brothers edit their films under the pseudonym “Roderick Jaynes” and have even concocted a backstory for him as a crusty veteran of British cinema. On the occasion of their imaginary editor’s second nomination, in 2008, Joel Coen doubted that their man would show up at the ceremony: “He’s very old – late 80s, early 90s – so I don’t know if he’d make the trip.” 4. Jaye Davidson: best supporting actor nominee, The Crying Game Not an unlikely nominee so much as a walking spoiler. Anybody who had not, at that point in 1993, already seen Neil Jordan’s playful, gender-fluid thriller might wonder why the main female face in the film was up against the likes of Jack Nicholson, Al Pacino and eventual winner Gene Hackman. 3. PH Vazak: best adapted screenplay nominee, Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes Unlike Jaynes, PH Vazak was real, all right. Had he won in 1984, however, he would probably have been happier with a handful of choc drops than an Oscar, since in reality he was a Hungarian sheepdog belonging to Robert Towne. The screenwriter (who had previously won for Chinatown) had his name taken off Greystoke in protest at script changes. 2. Charlie and Donald Kaufman: best adapted screenplay winners, Adaptation Charlie Kaufman already had a screenwriting Oscar nomination for Being John Malkovich, but he shared his second, for the fiendishly clever 2002 comedy Adaptation, with his twin brother, Donald. Except that there was no Donald. Named as co-writer in the credits, he exists only as a character played in the film by Nicolas Cage. 1. Jean-Paul Sartre: best story nominee, The Proud and the Beautiful Until 1957 there were three screenwriting categories: best original screenplay, best adapted screenplay and best story. It was in the latter section, in the final year of that prize, that the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre found himself nominated for The Proud and the Beautiful, based on Typhus, a screenplay he wrote in 1944. His competitors included the neo-realism figurehead Cesare Zavattini (for Umberto D), but the award went to Robert Rich, a pseudonym for the blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, who lived to see the prize reissued under his real name in 1975. Another oddity about the Sartre film: it includes a rare acting appearance from surrealist film-maker Luis Buñuel."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/04/apple-users-icloud-services-personal-data-china-cybersecurity-law-privacy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T07:00:40Z","webTitle":"What happens to Apple’s iCloud in China","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/04/apple-users-icloud-services-personal-data-china-cybersecurity-law-privacy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/04/apple-users-icloud-services-personal-data-china-cybersecurity-law-privacy","fields":{"headline":"What price privacy when Apple gets into bed with China?","bodyText":"Here’s your starter for 10. Question: Apple’s website contains the following bold declaration: “At Apple we believe privacy is a fundamental human right.” What ancient English adage does this bring to mind? Answer: “Fine words butter no parsnips.” In other words, what matters is not what you say, but what you do. What brings this to mind is the announcement that from now on, iCloud data generated by Apple users with a mainland Chinese account will be stored and managed by a Chinese data management firm – Guizhou-Cloud Big Data (GCBD). “With effect from 28 February 2018,” the notice reads, “iCloud services associated with your Apple ID will be operated by GCBD. Use of these services and all the data you store with iCloud – including photos, videos, documents and backups – will be subject to the terms and conditions of iCloud operated by GCBD.” The new terms and conditions for Apple users in China contain a clause. “If you understand and agree,” it reads, “Apple and GCBD have the right to access your data stored on its servers. This includes permission sharing, exchange and disclosure of all user data (including content) according to the application of the law.” So what’s behind this change? Well, basically, Apple is moving the personal data and content of its mainland Chinese users to a place inside the country’s borders to comply with China’s sweeping new cybersecurity law which requires foreign companies to store all of the data they generate from China inside China’s borders. Henceforth, cloud services in China have to be operated by Chinese companies, so foreign outfits must either lease servers in China or establish joint ventures with local partners. Apple has chosen the latter option, which, it says, “will allow us to improve the speed and reliability of our iCloud services products while also complying with newly passed regulations that cloud services be operated by Chinese companies.” That guff about improving “the speed and reliability of our iCloud services” is the usual corporate cant designed to conceal a harsh reality – which is that henceforth everything that Chinese Apple users store in the cloud will be accessible to the Chinese state. And although the data is encrypted, Apple will, apparently, have to store the encryption keys in China – which means that its joint venture will have to comply with the cybersecurity law and provide them to the Chinese authorities if required. As Amnesty International points out, “Chinese police enjoy sweeping discretion and use broad and ambiguously constructed laws and regulations to silence dissent, restrict or censor information and harass and prosecute human rights defenders and others in the name of ‘national security’ and other purported criminal offences.” So what’s new? In one sense, nothing: we’ve known for ages that there are no bargains that western tech companies will not make with an authoritarian state in order to gain access to the fastest-growing market in the world. But until now, Apple has laid claim to the moral high ground in this area – as witnessed not only by the aforementioned website declaration about privacy as a human right, but also by its principled stand in 2016 against the demands of the FBI to unlock the iPhone of the San Bernardino shooter. Cynics used to point out that this kind of high-mindedness came cheap for Apple, since the company made its money by selling expensive hardware at premium prices. It didn’t sully itself with the “surveillance capitalism” practised by Google and Facebook, which depended on exploiting the data of its users in return for the provision of “free” services. That was indeed true in earlier times. But Apple has discovered over the last decade that “services” (apps, music, videos, photos) are also a hugely lucrative business line. In fact, if its services business were a separate company, it would already be in the Fortune 100. And iCloud is the indispensable enabler of that business – which means that Apple is now into cloud computing and user data-hosting in a big way. Hence the servile cringe of the February 28 announcement. Corporations can blather on all they like about corporate responsibility and human rights, but, in the end, maximising shareholder value is all that counts. And Apple is determined to get to that trillion-dollar valuation no matter what. So if you’re an Apple user in China, you now have a simple choice: junk your iPhone, iPad and fancy Macbook laptop; or accept that your autocratic rulers can access your data at their convenience. In which case, whatever you say, say nothing – as they used to say in Belfast.

In it for the long haul Most of the stuff we read about self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles is useless because it ignores the real-world hurdles that have to be surmounted before the cars become commonplace.

They had only just flown out on holiday to Tenerife the previous evening. The call came at 6am. “Louise’s mother called us,” says Neto. “She lives close by and a neighbour whose son saw the flames called the fire services and ran to her house to tell her what was happening.” The couple flew back to discover their home, a 1920s thatched property near Leatherhead, Surrey, had been razed to the ground. Ebeid, a GP, said: “It didn’t feel real. We feel very fortunate that we didn’t burn with the house, or experience the horror of escaping and watching our house burn.” But while the couple and their son are glad to be alive, almost 16 months since that fateful phone call in October 2016, they are locked in a battle with their insurer, Ageas, over the cost of rebuilding their home. The couple’s insurance policy, taken out through the Thatched Owners’ Group (TOG), a specialist broker in Lincolnshire, had set the rebuilding cost at £515,000. This was calculated using the Building Cost Information Service (BCIS) calculator from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics). But when the couple claimed on their policy, it took many weeks for Ageas to accept liability – and when it did, it said that as the rebuild cost was much higher than £515,000, the couple were under-insured and it would not pay out in full. Ageas’s initial estimate of the rebuild cost in may last year was £700,000, revised to £900,000 in January 2018. It said it will only pay out £435,000 – leaving the couple possibly £465,000 out of pocket. Their case will alarm people across the country who rely on the automatically generated rebuild cost quotes that come with the assurance that they meet Rics criteria. Ebeid and Neto used the online calculator supplied by Rics when they obtained quotes for the insurance they needed when they bought their home in April 2016. Ebeid and Neto, who works as a dentist, argue their building met all the criteria required by the calculator. “The construction is from the 1920s and the property is not listed. It’s basically two brick rectangles set at right angles to each other, to make an L-shape. The house was unmodernised since the 1970s, so there were no expensive fittings,” Ebeid said. The couple were not told they might be under-insured until May 2017. Despite months of letters and emails requesting more information, Ageas only recently gave details of how it arrived at its own estimate. The £900,000 rebuild figure includes VAT at 20%, even though a complete rebuild would not incur VAT. The estimate is also several hundred pounds higher per square metre than figures supplied by Ebeid and Neto’s own structural engineer. The couple took their complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) in September last year. But a final ruling may still be months away: an adjudicator was only appointed to their case last month. Ageas says: “We sympathise with the position this customer finds themselves in and are doing everything in our power to resolve the situation as quickly as possible.” Tim New, the managing director of TOG, says he always advises clients to obtain rebuild valuations from a chartered surveyor. But Ebeid and Neto say that when they spoke to the broker at TOG in April 2016, they were not advised to use a chartered surveyor to determine the rebuild cost. The couple paid a premium of £1,360 a year for their insurance. They estimate that if a higher rebuild value had been put into their policy, it would have cost little more than an extra £100. They insist there was no attempt on their part to deceive or under-insure deliberately just to save a few quid. Is the rebuild calculator reliable? The BCIS calculator is widely used by the insurance industry, as well as brokers who sell bespoke buildings insurance policies to homeowners. To arrive at a rebuild figure, it asks a range of questions which include the age of the building, the postcode, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, its size in square metres, as well as the key building materials used, including thatch. On comparison sites, the figure is generated automatically, after prospective buyers have input their property details. For example, on Confused.com, the site ask: “What’s the rebuild cost of the property?” and then says: “With the help of Rics, we’ve estimated the rebuild cost of the property to be £XXX. Properties like yours in the same area cost between £XXX and £XXX to rebuild.” But then there is a get-out clause, saying “Please estimate the rebuild cost as accurately as possible, so that you are adequately covered in the event of a claim.” Richard Groom, the head of core data products at Rics, says its calculator is constantly adjusted to include new data from members about increases in labour or material costs, as well as location. Every five years the entire calculator is totally revised to take into account national surveys of new building stock. Written guidance published alongside the calculator warns that unusual features in a building or luxury fixtures and fittings may increase the cost of a rebuild, sometimes substantially. If in doubt, prospective policyholders are advised to ask a chartered surveyor to carry out a rebuild estimate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/28/nobel-laureates-president-erdogan-turkey-free-writers","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T14:03:38Z","webTitle":"An open letter to President Erdoğan from 38 Nobel laureates | JM Coetzee, Kazuo Ishiguro, Svetlana Alexievich and others","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/28/nobel-laureates-president-erdogan-turkey-free-writers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/28/nobel-laureates-president-erdogan-turkey-free-writers","fields":{"headline":"An open letter to President Erdoğan from 38 Nobel laureates","bodyText":"Dear President Erdoğan, We wish to draw your attention to the damage being done to the Republic of Turkey, to its reputation and the dignity and wellbeing of its citizens, through what leading authorities on freedom of expression deem to be the unlawful detention and wrongful conviction of writers and thinkers. In a Memorandum on the Freedom of Expression in Turkey (2017), Nils Muižnieks, then Council of Europe commissioner for Human Rights, warned: “The space for democratic debate in Turkey has shrunk alarmingly following increased judicial harassment of large strata of society, including journalists, members of parliament, academics and ordinary citizens, and government action which has reduced pluralism and led to self-censorship. This deterioration came about in a very difficult context, but neither the attempted coup, nor other terrorist threats faced by Turkey, can justify measures that infringe media freedom and disavow the rule of law to such an extent. “The authorities should urgently change course by overhauling criminal legislation and practice, redevelop judicial independence and reaffirm their commitment to protect free speech.” There is no clearer example of the commissioner’s concern that the detention in September 2016 of Ahmet Altan, a bestselling novelist and columnist; Mehmet Altan, his brother, professor of economics and essayist; and Nazlı Ilıcak, a prominent journalist – all as part of a wave of arrests following the failed July 2016 coup. These writers were charged with attempting to overthrow the constitutional order through violence or force. The prosecutors originally wanted to charge them with giving “subliminal messages” to coup supporters while appearing on a television panel show. The ensuing tide of public ridicule made them change that accusation to using rhetoric “evocative of a coup”. Indeed, Turkey’s official Anatolia News Agency called the case “The Coup Evocation Trial”. As noted in the commissioner’s report, the evidence considered by the judge in Ahmet Altan’s case was limited to a story dating from 2010 in Taraf newspaper (of which Ahmet Altan had been the editor-in-chief until 2012), three of his op-ed columns and a TV appearance. The evidence against the other defendants was equally insubstantial. All these writers had spent their careers opposing coups and militarism of any sort, and yet were charged with aiding an armed terrorist organisation and staging a coup. The commissioner saw the detention and prosecution of Altan brothers as part of a broader pattern of repression in Turkey against those expressing dissent or criticism of the authorities. He considered such detentions and prosecutions to have violated human rights and undermined the rule of law. David Kaye, the UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression, concurred and dubbed the legal proceedings a “show trial”. Turkey’s own constitutional court concurred with this criticism. On 11 January this year, it ruled that Mehmet Altan and fellow journalist Şahin Alpay’s rights were being violated by pre-trial detention, and that they should be released. Yet the first-degree courts refused to implement the higher constitutional court’s decision, thus placing the judicial system in criminal violation of the constitution. Mr President, you must surely be concerned that the lower criminal court’s defiance and this non-legal decision was backed by the spokesperson of your government. On 16 February 2018, the Altan brothers and Ilıcak were sentenced to aggravated life sentences, precluding them from any prospect of a future amnesty. President Erdoğan, we the undersigned share the following opinion of David Kaye: “The court decision condemning journalists to aggravated life in prison for their work, without presenting substantial proof of their involvement in the coup attempt or ensuring a fair trial, critically threatens journalism and with it the remnants of freedom of expression and media freedom in Turkey”. In April 1998, you yourself were stripped of your position as mayor of Istanbul, banned from political office, and sentenced to prison for 10 months, for reciting a poem during a public speech in December 1997 through the same article 312 of the penal code. This was unjust, unlawful and cruel. Many human rights organisations – which defended you then – are appalled at the violations now occurring in your country. Amnesty International, PEN International, Committee to Protect Journalists, Article 19, and Reporters Without Borders are among those who oppose the recent court decision. During a ceremony in honour of Çetin Altan, on 2 February 2009, you declared publicly that “Turkey is no longer the same old Turkey who used to sentence its great writers to prison – this era is gone for ever.” Among the audience were Çetin Altan’s two sons: Ahmet and Mehmet. Nine years later, they are sentenced to life; isn’t that a fundamental contradiction? Under these circumstances, we voice the concern of many inside Turkey itself, of its allies and of the multilateral organisations of which it is a member. We call for the abrogation of the state of emergency, a quick return to the rule of law and for full freedom of speech and expression. Such a move would result in the speedy acquittal on appeal of Ms Ilıcak and the Altan brothers, and the immediate release of others wrongfully detained. Better still, it would make Turkey again a proud member of the free world. • Full list of Nobel laureate signatories: Svetlana Alexievich, Philip W Anderson, Aaron Ciechanover, JM Coetzee, Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, Elias J Corey, Gerhard Ertl, Albert Fert, Edmond H Fischer, Andrew Z Fire, Andre Geim, Sheldon Glashow, Serge Haroche, Leland H Hartwell, Oliver Hart, Richard Henderson, Dudley Herschbach, Avram Hershko, Roald Hoffmann, Robert Huber, Tim Hunt, Kazuo Ishiguro, Elfriede Jelinek, Eric S Maskin, Hartmut Michel, Herta Müller, VS Naipaul, William D Phillips, John C Polanyi, Richard J Roberts, Randy W Schekman, Wole Soyinka, Joseph Stiglitz, Thomas C Südhof, Jack W Szostak, Mario Vargas Llosa, J Robin Warren, Eric F Wieschaus"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/06/steve-rose-on-film","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T09:00:07Z","webTitle":"Painted into a corner: is the art world unfilmable?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/06/steve-rose-on-film","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/06/steve-rose-on-film","fields":{"headline":"Painted into a corner: is the art world unfilmable?","bodyText":"“If we took your bag and placed it here, would that make it art?” asks Claes Bang’s suave gallery curator in new movie The Square. His interviewer, Elisabeth Moss, does not know what to say. Is there a right answer? Is it a trick question? That’s contemporary art for you. In the movies, especially, the art world is presented as one big private joke. It’s a realm of snobs and charlatans, of pretentious conceptual art, intimidating opening parties, and credulous punters too cowed by the cognoscenti to say what they really think. The Square, which won last year’s Palme d’Or at the Cannes film festival, satirises all of this delectably. In its most memorable scene, a human ape-impersonator is introduced into a black-tie dinner but the conceptual gimmick goes a little too far. Elsewhere, a cleaner accidentally hoovers up a gravel-based artwork. A chimpanzee casually doodles on a sofa. Noisy, ridiculous installations interrupt conversations annoyingly. While movies have created many biopics about heroic artists who everyone sneered at at the time, when it comes to art made in our time, they’re happy to sneer away. It was ever thus. It was nearly half a century ago that the Tate’s acquisition of Carl Andre’s Equivalent VI (essentially a pile of 120 bricks) prompted national outrage and headlines such as “What A Load Of Rubbish”. Many a movie character has thought the same thing. Eddie Murphy laughs his head off at the revolving, decapitated heads in the gallery in Beverly Hills Cop. He laughs even harder when he hears the price. Of course, Steven Berkoff’s gallery-owner turns out to be the bad guy. Tom Cruise disses a pretentious sculptor’s work at his gallery opening in Cocktail. He then punches him, destroying one of his works in the process. Mark Wahlberg puts his wine glass on a coffee table in The Other Guys, only to be told by the snobby attendant that it’s actually a $500,000 installation. He ends up sabotaging the installation (after some very intelligent criticism) and calling them all “lame, artsy douches” - which they kind of are. There’s a similar gag in Miranda July’s Me and You and Everyone We Know, in which an artist makes replicas of everyday objects. “It really is amazing, it just looks so real,” the gallerists say, admiring a discarded hamburger wrapper on the floor. “Oh, that wrapper is real,” the artist admits. The popular image of the contemporary artist is someone like The Big Lebowski’s Julianne Moore, who swoops naked over her canvases on pulleys, spattering them with paint as she passes. “My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal, which bothers some men,” she says in her weird English accent. Jeff Bridges’ Dude has no time for this nonsense, or her snickering video-artist friend, David Thewlis. Either that, or they’re a self-absorbed monster, like Dustin Hoffman in The Meyerowitz Stories, or Jordan Taccone’s Booth Jonathan in Girls. Or a complete phony, like Tony Hancock in The Rebel, who passes off someone else’s paintings as his own. They’re all lame artsy douches. The Square’s director, Ruben Ostlund, says that the art world is difficult to satirise because “it’s like a satire from the beginning”. To make the point, his film is based on real-life examples. Russian artist Oleg Kullik really did pretend he was a dog at a 1996 exhibition in Stockholm; he damaged other artworks and even bit members of the public. Gallery cleaners really did destroy an installation of empty champagne bottles in an Italian gallery in 2015, thinking it was litter. And so on. The actual Square in Ostlund’s film is also based on real life. It is an installation consisting of a simple square of light, supposedly creating “a sanctuary of trust and caring”. Ostlund actually made the Square for real, and exhibited it in several Swedish galleries. In the movie, things backfire when a hip, young ad agency comes up with a provocative, attention-grabbing YouTube video to promote the Square. So the movie itself is effectively a classier version of that YouTube video. Is it a private joke? Is it satire? Is it art? Is there any difference? The Square is in UK cinemas from 16 Mar"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/28/meghan-markle-pledges-to-shine-a-light-on-womens-rights","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T13:35:51Z","webTitle":"Meghan Markle pledges to 'shine a light' on women's rights","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/28/meghan-markle-pledges-to-shine-a-light-on-womens-rights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/28/meghan-markle-pledges-to-shine-a-light-on-womens-rights","fields":{"headline":"Meghan Markle pledges to 'shine a light' on women's rights","bodyText":"Meghan Markle has indicated that she is not ready to abandon her campaigning as she prepares to join the royal family, highlighting her support for women’s rights. Markle, an ardent feminist, has advocated for women and ethnic minorities in the past, but after deleting her social media accounts, it appeared that she might be less inclined to speak out. However, speaking on Wednesday at a London forum for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry’s charity, the Royal Foundation, she made it clear that such issues were still close to her heart. “I think right now in the climate we are seeing so many campaigns, I mean #MeToo and Time’s Up, and there is no better time to really continue to shine a light on women feeling empowered, and people really helping to support them – men included,” Markle said. “I mean, it makes such a tremendous difference. So … I guess we wait a couple of months and we can hit the ground running.” The Los Angeles-born actor has worked as an ambassador for UN Women and the charity World Vision. Markle has previously used her celebrity status to back Hillary Clinton, lament Brexit and attack Donald Trump as “misogynistic” and “divisive”, but royal protocol dictates that she will no longer be able to comment on UK or international politics. Markle was appearing alongside the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and her fiance, Prince Harry, who could be heard quietly mentioning the wedding as she spoke. That prompted laughs and Markle to respond: “We can multitask.” She said she could not go into detail on what future work she would be doing, but added: “I certainly know how passionate I am, and Harry and I see the world so similarly in our approach of being very hands-on with things.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/04/corbyn-brexit-wars-eu-fudge-bananas","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T10:00:43Z","webTitle":"The Brexit culture wars are driving me bananas | Stewart Lee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/04/corbyn-brexit-wars-eu-fudge-bananas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/04/corbyn-brexit-wars-eu-fudge-bananas","fields":{"headline":"The Brexit culture wars are driving me bananas","bodyText":"On 10 May 2016, in the closing days of the Brexit campaign, at an impromptu speech in Cornwall, lying Boris Johnson again invoked the Brexiters’ foundation myth that the EU sought to ban bendy bananas. But voters who backed leaving the EU in order to get back the bendy bananas, which had not been taken off them anyway, must surely now be wondering, privately, if it was all worth it. Last Monday, Jeremy Corbyn reluctantly declared his own “bespoke customs union” Brexit fudge with all the enthusiasm and conviction of a man held at gunpoint saying how well he is being treated. “The option of a new UK customs union with the EU would need to ensure the UK has a say in future trade deals,” he mumbled. “Also, I am allowed to coddle an egg on alternate Tuesdays.” Apparently Corbyn’s Own Brexit Fudge ™ ® was offered to preserve the soft Irish border with Northern Ireland, as it will be impossible to re-bend a straightened Euro banana should a straight Irish banana need to cross into Northern Ireland, perhaps as part of an Irish child’s snack box, an Irish chimp’s dinner or as an Irish clown’s comedy prop. Some Tory Brexiters have an almost blind faith in the idea that there may be some form of as yet nonexistent technological solution; Bernard Jenkin, interviewed by an increasingly scruffy Dobby the House Elf on Newsnight on Tuesday, said Wilf Lunn, the extravagantly mustachioed novelty bicycle inventor from Vision On and Magpie, was already working on a bespoke Border Banana Detector and Straightener ™ ®. Lunn’s Borderbananandetecto-straightorbendomatic ™ ® would detect and straighten, or bend, any bananas crossing the border, so they would be the right banana type for the segment of the Irish island they were bound for. Jenkin’s attempt to demonstrate a prototype Borderbananandetecto-straightorbendomatic in the Newsnight studio backfired spectacularly after it lunged at political editor Nicholas Watt’s face and tried to peel it. Honestly! You couldn’t make it up!! It’s an increasingly difficult time to be a comedian!!! (And before I forget. Message to Bernard “Jenkin”: Jenkin is a French name. No one is called “Jenkin” here. Your British name is Jenkins. Bernard Fucking Jenkins. So start using it.) But Corbyn’s Own Brexit Fudge ™ ® is as impossible a proposition for the EU in its own way as Boris Johnson’s pre-referendum fantasy of the magic cake that grows again, no matter how much of it you eat; an idea the massive liar surely gleaned from a visit to one of the cloud lands at the top of the Faraway Tree, before sliding back down the slippery slip with his friends Darius, Marina, Petronella, and the Saucepan Man. Whether you are a kamikaze-hard Brexiter or a diehard traitor Remoaner, the precision-applied works spanner of Corbyn’s Own Brexit Fudge ™ ® means hard Brexit is far less likely. Banzai! Boris Johnson’s dream of bendy bananas for ever withers on the banana vine, a cowed people cowering for eternity beneath the blow of the straight banana, a straight banana squished on a human face – for ever. But the culture war continues. Last Monday, on the Twitter, the Mad Max writer and Milo Yiannopoulos cheerleader Brendan McCarthy called me a “decaying Morrissey impersonator and leftwing donut-eater” and declared: “It’s end times for the Oxbridge comedy establishment as their own Roy ‘Chubby’ Brown lashes out at an indifferent public.” While I never knowingly eat doughnuts, “lashing out at an indifferent public” is a reasonable description of the impression I strive to create live, and detractors often inadvertently illuminate exactly the effect I aim for, their harshest criticisms helping me to sculpt the on-stage character of Stewart Lee. But as I stood, on the 194th date of my current 220-date tour, on stage in Dartford last Sunday, in the first half-full theatre of the run, my hyperacoustic ears still ringing from a catastrophic sound operator error at Hereford Courtyard on Thursday, the room somehow just would not quite catch fire. I wondered if Mad Max McCarthy was right. Was it indeed “end times for the Roy ‘Chubby’ Brown of the Oxbridge comedy establishment”? In April last year, the Daily Telegraph, the Daily Mail, the Daily Express, Breitbart, the Spectator, ShortList and Spiked all ran the same demonstrably false story saying I was experiencing mass walkouts because of doing anti-Brexit jokes. This wasn’t the case, even in archly Eurosceptic Lincoln, although, to be fair, the people there may have struggled to find the exits without hard-working east Europeans to show them the way and carry their cauliflowers around. The only walkout of the tour was a very funny man in Canterbury, who shouted “I’ll wait for the DVD” as he left, but I don’t think his departure, unlike David Cameron’s, was Brexit-related. Last year it was fun doing anti-Brexit material on tour. Brexiters in the room had won the referendum, after all, so as a Remoaner I was in a position of weakness punching up at them, as the comedian is required to be. Laughing Brexiters would come up afterwards and magnanimously get me to sign their books and DVDs “to a Leave-voting c*nt”, an amusing transaction that genuinely renewed my faith in humanity nightly. We could all be friends after all. But on Monday, after Corbyn proposed his hard Brexit-sinking “bespoke customs union”, it seemed like no one was going to get exactly what they wanted out of Brexit now. There probably weren’t any winners, certainly not the Leave voters of Leave-voting Dartford, now condemned, even their figureheads agree, to an even less prosperous future. So on stage in Dartford, I didn’t feel I quite understood how to pitch the Brexit stuff any more. In a situation where no one will win there were no winners to aim at. It was not clear any more which way was up, and I no longer knew which direction to punch upwards in.

Sure, but the question is: do you know how to do it? Sneezing is an autonomous process, so I don’t have to know how to do it. Ha! It’s semi-autonomous, yes, but there are still decisions to make. Whether to pinch your nose shut, where to sneeze, whether to shout at the same time ... Shout-sneezers annoy me. Everyone annoys you. How about where to do it? Are you saying I should rush to the toilet or something? No. But you must still choose where to direct the sneeze. Into a disposable tissue. Isn’t that right? Yes. But what if you don’t have a tissue, or you can’t get it out in time? Where do you sneeze then? Towards someone I don’t like. What if you like everybody within range? That’s rare. I don’t know. Into my hand, maybe? Wrong! Sneezing into your hand just covers your hand with nose goo, which you’re then likely to spread. You should sneeze into your elbow. My elbow? I can’t reach. The inside of your elbow, dummkopf. Bury your nose in there when you sneeze. That’s the official advice of the US’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s the best course of action when you cough, too. This is revolutionary! Why am I only hearing about it now? It has been catching on slowly over the past decade. Do I have to wash my elbow afterwards? When you get the chance, sure, but I’m guessing people don’t touch the inside of your elbow very often. Sadly, no. What if I’m wearing sleeves? Do I remove my shirt and throw it away? That might be expensive and awkward. No, that’s fine. But it’s probably a good idea to wash your clothes regularly when you’re ill. How about pinching my nose and closing my mouth? Isn’t that even more hygienic? I don’t know. Maybe. But you may also do yourself a mischief. How can you hurt yourself by suppressing a sneeze? Last month, the British Medical Journal reported the case of a man who tore his throat in the process. Um ... OK. Maybe I won’t do that. Good plan. Do say: “You’re going to sneeze, I can tell.

Before the white-out of snow which covered much of the country on Wednesday, reports by the Woodland Trust charity showed yet more evidence that spring is arriving earlier and earlier. Officially the first day of spring in the UK is Thursday, but for millennia nature has fluctuated to its own rhythms. In recent years, however, wildlife charities have been reporting flowers, animals and fungi have been appearing earlier, and Woodland Trust records, which go back decades, clearly support the trend. “We’ve been shocked by the sheer volume of early records received this year,” said Charlotte Armitage, citizen science officer for the Woodland Trust. “With colder weather anticipated over the coming weeks, it will be interesting to see how some species react, having bred, bloomed or emerged early.” Not everybody agrees that spring has sprung already this year, however. The National Trust’s annual Valentine’s survey of flowers in the south-west showed a one-third jump in blooms from last year – though fewer than in 2016. Nationwide records of phenology – the study of changing seasons – suggested this year was a relatively normal winter, said Matthew Oates, the charity’s wildlife expert. “We’re in a long-term run of mild winters [and] early springs [but] this winter actually hasn’t been that mild – with the exception of pulses in January, particularly down south … and it’s about to get very snowy,” said Oates. For species that did appear early during the mild “pulses”, though, current freezing temperatures are especially dangerous, said Oates. He is particularly worried about caterpillars which came out of hibernation and will now use up too much energy, and can shrivel in spring."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/feb/28/toyota-to-build-new-generation-auris-car-in-derbyshire","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T13:40:23Z","webTitle":"Toyota to build new-generation Auris car in Derbyshire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/28/toyota-to-build-new-generation-auris-car-in-derbyshire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/feb/28/toyota-to-build-new-generation-auris-car-in-derbyshire","fields":{"headline":"Toyota to build new-generation Auris car in Derbyshire","bodyText":"Toyota has announced it will build the next generation of its Auris car at its Burnaston plant in Derbyshire. The Japanese carmaker said the majority of engines for the new cars would be manufactured at its Deeside factory in north Wales. Toyota’s decision safeguards the jobs of about 3,000 workers across the two plants and is part of a £240m investment in the UK business announced by the company last year. The company has other European manufacturing plants in countries including Poland and France. Johan van Zyl, the president and chief executive of Toyota Motor Europe, said the decision to make the third-generation Auris in Burnaston demonstrated the firm’s “confidence in the skills and capabilities” of its UK workers. The UK car industry has said it needs urgent clarity on a transitional Brexit deal if it is not to risk Britain losing out to other European countries on investment as global automotive firms make key spending decisions. Commenting on Toyota’s position, Van Zyl said: “As a company, we are doing what we can to secure the competitiveness of our UK operations as a leading manufacturing centre for our European business. “With around 85% of our UK vehicle production exported to European markets, continued free and frictionless trade between the UK and Europe will be vital for future success.” The new Auris will be unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show on 6 March and will start rolling off the production line at Burnaston by the end of 2018. Last year, UK car production fell for the first time since the depths of financial crisis in 2009, as Brexit fears took hold and consumers turned their backs on diesel vehicles. A total of 1.67m cars were made at UK factories in 2017, down 3% compared with 2016 as demand for British-made cars dropped both at home and abroad. The industry trade body, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, warned that 2018 was likely to be another tough year.

Kuciak and his fiancée, Martina Kusnirova, were found shot dead in their home last weekend in a killing that police have said is likely to have been related to his investigative work. The summary, published by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), focuses on the alleged activities in Slovakia of people associated with the Italian organised crime group ’Ndrangheta. Entitled The Model, the Mafia and the Murderers, it was jointly published with the Czech Centre for Investigative Journalism (CCIJ), the Investigative Reporting Project Italy, and Aktuality.SK, a team of investigative reporters in Slovakia with whom Kuciak was working when he was killed. The report describes how the project began with an investigation into why the Slovakian prime minister, Robert Fico, hired Mária Trošková, a then 27-year-old former topless model and Miss Universe contestant, as one of his assistants despite what it described as her relative lack of political experience. “His press department had refused to release her job description, to clarify her position in government, or to say whether she got a security clearance,” the summary said. The investigation took a dramatic turn after it emerged that Trošková had been a business partner of Antonino Vadala, 42, an Italian living in Slovakia with alleged close ties to the ’Ndrangheta. According to the report, in 2001 Italian police issued a warrant for Vadala’s arrest after wiretaps caught him discussing the logistics of hiding a fugitive drug trafficker and killer in his home in Calabria. The charges were dropped, however, after Vadala avoided arrest, having already moved to Slovakia. According to reports in the Slovakian press, Vadala has not responded to requests for comment. A CCIJ reporter who knew Kuciak told the Guardian the investigation revealed that Italian organised crime members had “entered into business with regional politicians”, forming what was effectively a mafia syndicate. The investigation was about to enter what Kuciak regarded as the “dangerous phase”, as he and colleagues from the CCIJ based in Prague were preparing to confront the key players. This hadn’t happened at the time of Kuciak and Kusnirova’s killings in their home in Vel’ká Mača, 40 miles (65km) east of Bratislava. Kuciak focused mainly on tax evasion stories for Aktuality.sk and had been investigating the suspected theft of EU funds destined for eastern Slovakia by the Italian mafia. The shootings have shocked the central European nation, with Andrej Kiska, the Slovakian president, saying he was left “shaken and terrified” by the “cold-blooded murder”. A group of Slovakian editors-in-chief said the murder was “directed against the freedom of expression and the right of citizens to control the powerful and those who violate laws”. Culture minister Marek Madaric, who is a member of Fico’s party, resigned on Wednesday, telling reporters: “After what has happened, I cannot imagine just calmly sitting in my minister’s chair.” Fico, however, warned at a press conference on Tuesday against the “political abuse of a tragedy”, after opposition politicians alleged that members of his ruling party were linked to the killings. In response to questions about the associations of members of his inner circle, Fico did not mention Trošková by name, but warned the press not to jump to conclusions. “You are connecting innocent people to a double murder. That’s crossing the line.” The prime minister drew condemnation for what one journalist described as a “vulgar” publicity stunt during the conference, as Fico, the interior minister, Robert Kaliňák, and the president of the police, Tibor Gašpar, stood next to an ornate table bearing large bundles of cash guarded by a masked and armed police officer: the €1m (£880m) reward Fico has promised for information leading to the arrest of the killers. Filip Struhárik, an editor at the daily Denník N, criticised Fico for implying that he had taken personal control of the investigation. “Cash on the table is one thing,” he told the Guardian, “but it is also weird for him to say ‘we’ are investigating this, ‘we’ have this hypothesis, ‘we’ are pursuing these lines of inquiry. There is no ‘we’; this needs to be an independent investigation, especially when members of the prime minister’s own office have been linked to these stories about the Italian mafia.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/04/the-nile-hilton-incident-review-cracking-cairo-thriller","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T08:00:40Z","webTitle":"The Nile Hilton Incident review – a cracking Cairo thriller","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/04/the-nile-hilton-incident-review-cracking-cairo-thriller","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/04/the-nile-hilton-incident-review-cracking-cairo-thriller","fields":{"headline":"The Nile Hilton Incident review – a cracking Cairo thriller","bodyText":"Writer-director Tarik Saleh’s engaging, textured Cairo crime drama takes place during the build-up to 2011’s Egyptian revolution, drawing parallels between the city’s rising tensions and his noirish antihero’s crumbling personal prospects.

Labour and the Liberal Democrats also said Johnson should face scrutiny over his role in a project he strongly supported, and which an earlier inquiry concluded was driven more by political considerations than value for money. The foreign secretary, whose mayoral term ended in May 2016, is due to give evidence to a London assembly committee on Thursday, the first time he will face detailed questions on how £46.4m of public money was spent on a project of questionable value on which construction work never even began. Touted by Johnson as an oasis over the Thames, the planned pedestrian link from Temple to the South Bank was scrapped in August last year because of a shortfall in funds raised by the charity behind it and a lack of final planning consent despite three years of talks. The public liabilities, initially capped at £16m, had escalated by 2016 when Transport for London and the Department for Transport agreed to release funding for a construction contract, even though it appeared the stipulated conditions were not in place for this to happen. Johnson is expected to face questioning from the committee as to whether he played any role in seeking the release of the extra money. Kerry Underwood, a senior partner at Underwoods solicitors and a former judge, said a case under misconduct in public office could be considered if the actions of a public officer, such as a mayor, showed “reckless indifference” even if there was no dishonesty involved. “Boris Johnson is giving evidence to the London assembly on Thursday, and if his appearance gives rise to any fresh evidence pointing towards him pushing through the construction money, then it may be that there is a case for the Crown Prosecution Service to look into the matter,” he said. Misconduct in public office is a criminal offence under common law, which penalises official wrongdoing that can be deliberate, deceitful or simply amount to excessive neglect of duty. About 100 cases reach the courts each year, but it is known as a complex area to prosecute. The Law Commission is carrying out a review of how well it works. The shadow communities secretary, Andrew Gwynne, said Johnson needed to explain “why this project was allowed to spiral out of control”. He said: “Boris Johnson drove forward this project during his mayoralty, and he needs to needs to provide answers on the role he and his office played in the reckless decision to release public funds for the construction contract.” The Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, said: “Boris Johnson must be pushed to explain his full involvement and actions in the garden bridge debacle. If it is found he was negligent in any way, action must be taken.” Johnson has already faced criticism over the the project, which was first proposed by the actor Joanna Lumley, a family friend of Johnson. A total of £60m of public money was committed, and £37.4m was spent by the Garden Bridge Trust, the charity behind the project, without any construction work being done. A report by the Labour MP Margaret Hodge, commissioned by Johnson’s successor as mayor, Sadiq Khan, said the final total in public spending, with cancellation costs, was likely to reach £46.4m. In a damning verdict on the bridge, which was designed by Thomas Heatherwick, she said the business case was always weak, and it had been “driven by electoral cycles rather than value for money”. Johnson’s staff did not respond to requests for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/feb/28/bill-gates-cryptocurrencies-deaths-bitcoin-steve-wozniak-scam","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T12:06:38Z","webTitle":"Bill Gates: cryptocurrencies have 'caused deaths in a fairly direct way'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/28/bill-gates-cryptocurrencies-deaths-bitcoin-steve-wozniak-scam","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/feb/28/bill-gates-cryptocurrencies-deaths-bitcoin-steve-wozniak-scam","fields":{"headline":"Bill Gates: cryptocurrencies have 'caused deaths in a fairly direct way'","bodyText":"Bill Gates, the philanthropist and former chief executive of Microsoft, is concerned by the crytocurrency craze, saying that the anonymity offered by the new technology has “caused deaths in a fairly direct way”. Speaking during a Reddit AMA, Gates argued that “the government’s ability to find money laundering and tax evasion and terrorist funding is a good thing. “Right now cryptocurrencies are used for buying fentanyl and other drugs so it is a rare technology that has caused deaths in a fairly direct way.” In contrast to cash, which is also untraceable, cryptocurrencies can be used remotely, which removes another avenue of control, he added. Gates also suggested that investing in the sector is a bad idea: “I think the speculative wave around ICOs and cryptocurrencies is super risky”. In the group interview, Gates had harsh words for some other speculative technologies. Elon Musk’s Hyperloop concept, for instance, which involves using a railgun to fire a passenger compartment down a low-pressure tube at speeds of several hundred miles per hour, was dismissed: “I am not sure the Hyperloop concept makes sense,” he said. “Making it safe is hard.” But Gates was positive about the overall direction of technology, dismissing concerns that rising automation could have negative consequences for the wider economy, and citing natural language understanding as the technology he’s most looking forward to over the next decade. “Automation has been driving productivity ever since the industrial revolution including things like tractors and garment making,” Gates said. “With software this will continue to accelerate so we need to think about how we educate people for the new jobs that will emerge. “Overall automation is a great thing – eventually we won’t have to work as much but we are still at least a generation away from a big change there.” Gates is not the only former tech executive to have a negative view of cryptocurrencies. Steve Wozniak, the co-founder of Apple, revealed on Tuesday that he had lost seven bitcoins to a scammer. “Somebody bought them from me online through a credit card, and they cancelled the credit card payment,” he told a conference in India. “It was that easy. And it was from a stolen credit card number, so you can never get it back.” At the time the scam was carried out, the bitcoins were worth just under $5,000; now, their value tops $70,000. Gates had one final word of warning for readers of his interview. Asked by one user: “Is it true that if I forward the email in my inbox to 100 people you will give me money?”, he replied, simply: “No.” Self-proclaimed bitcoin ‘creator’ sued for $10bn EU finance head: we will regulate bitcoin if risks are not tackled Bill Gates gives $4.6bn to charity in biggest donation since 2000"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2018/mar/09/british-scientists-work-on-zika-vaccine-brazil-recife-birth-defects","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T07:00:30Z","webTitle":"'There are a lot of unknowns': British scientists set to work on Zika vaccine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/09/british-scientists-work-on-zika-vaccine-brazil-recife-birth-defects","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/mar/09/british-scientists-work-on-zika-vaccine-brazil-recife-birth-defects","fields":{"headline":"'There are a lot of unknowns': British scientists set to work on Zika vaccine","bodyText":"Scientists in the UK have started work on developing a vaccine to protect women against the Zika virus. The £4.7m project, involving the universities of Manchester and Liverpool, and Public Health England, aims to have trials on humans up and running within the next three years. The news comes two and a half years after the Zika virus, which can lead to foetal abnormalities, began to appear in Brazil. When cases of babies born with abnormally small heads were first reported in late 2015, Brazilians were frightened and bewildered. Few had heard of the rare birth defect microcephaly, or were aware that it restricts growth of the skull and can cause learning, cognitive and motor difficulties. Nor did scientists know why cases were concentrated in Brazil’s impoverished, dry north-east. Two and a half years later, they still don’t. The Brazilian government quickly blamed Zika – an obscure, mosquito-borne virus, previously unknown in the Americas. The World Health Organization declared a public health emergency, and panic grew as Zika spread across the region. Then the outbreak petered out, leaving Brazil with more than 3,000 babies affected by what its government calls “developmental and growth alternations possibly related to Zika virus infection”. Two-thirds of those children are here in the north-east. As of December, 438 were in the state of Pernambuco. Yet just 700-odd cases of what is now called congenital Zika syndrome have been confirmed across the whole of the rest of the Americas, according to the Pan American Health Organization. And nobody can explain the discrepancy. “We were braced for a large epidemic of microcephaly. We didn’t see that,” said Albert Ko, professor of epidemiology and medicine at the Yale School of Public Health, who has studied the epidemic. “It’s still a little bit embarrassing that we don’t know these answers.” Zika was first discovered in Uganda in 1947, and spread quietly through Asia. An outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013-14 caused a noticeable upswing in microcephaly cases. A 2016 study concluded that Zika arrived in the Americas between May-December 2013, when air travel from Zika-infected countries to Brazil was increasing. In June 2013, Tahiti even played a soccer match in Recife as part of the Confederations Cup. By 2015, the virus was infecting huge numbers in Brazil’s north-east, said Ko, including up to 60% of all pregnant women. “It’s this proverbial perfect storm-type situation,” Ko said. “There are some transmission chains that create large epidemics and others that just burn out and die.” Zika reached much more populous states in Brazil’s south-east, like Rio de Janeiro. But Rio has almost half the congenital Zika cases of Pernambuco, and twice the population. Oliver Brady is an assistant professor in arboviral epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who is studying the virus for the Brazilian government. He said Zika’s spread was much patchier in Rio, where mosquitoes are also much less active in the cooler, drier winter. The north-east had more cases. As one dose of Zika is believed to give immunity, when a second, less intense Zika outbreak followed in 2016, north-eastern cities like Recife and Salvador – capital of Bahia state, which had the most microcephaly cases, at 509 – had reached “critical threshold”. “That’s the proportion of people that need to be infected for the disease to die out,” Brady said – 63%, in Salvador’s case. Ernesto Marques, a professor of infectious diseases and vaccines at the University of Pittsburgh, said investigating hypotheses is hampered by a lack of reliable data on how many people caught Zika. It is tricky to diagnose: in most cases, the virus is asymptomatic, retrospective tests are not conclusive, and it is easily confused with viruses like dengue. “There are a lot of unknowns in this story,” Marques said. Marques is also a researcher at Brazilian government research institute Fiocruz in Recife, which set up a microcephaly epidemic research group to study the outbreak. Last December, the group published a study confirming the association between microcephaly and congenital Zika virus infection, which also eliminated suspicions that either vaccines or a chemical larvicide called pyriproxyfen, used in some areas around Recife, could have been responsible. A further study this year found higher levels of microcephaly associated with precarious living conditions, with poor or open sewage and irregular water supplies favouring the proliferation of the Aedes aegypti mosquito that spreads Zika. In Pernambuco, 11% of people don’t have a fresh water supply and only 32% get their sewage treated, according to the state government-controlled sanitation company, Compesa. One of the study’s researchers, Ricardo Ximenes, is a professor of epidemiology and infectious diseases at Pernambuco’s state and federal universities. His team believes that microcephaly is just the tip of the iceberg, and that other malformations also caused by Zika will appear as children grow up. Some scientists have hypothesised that dengue, another mosquito-spread disease present in Brazil, could increase the risk of Zika infection. And a new sibling study from researchers at the University of São Paulo, published in February, provided intriguing evidence that genetics could make some babies more susceptible to congenital Zika syndrome than others. It studied identical twins, where both had microcephaly, and non-identical where, in six of seven cases, only one did. “There could be genetic variants increasing risk, they could be more present in that population,” said Mayana Zatz, a professor of genetics and the study’s coordinator. “But this is a hypothesis.” In Recife, the city government reduced the density of mosquitoes by cleaning areas where the insects were intensely concentrated, educating citizens, and even monitoring water containers without lids from traffic control cameras, city health secretary Jailson Correia said. Now they are planning to release sterile mosquitoes. But as officials from the UN and World Health Organization argued in 2016, improving Brazil’s woeful sanitation is also vital to stopping Zika. According to the WHO, 35 million people in Brazil lack adequate sanitation and 3.8 million are without safe drinking water. The uncertainty is leaving Brazilian women unsure of the risks. In 2016, according to the state government, births in Pernambuco fell to 131,000, down from 145,000 the previous year. Brazil’s birth rate, which rose in 2014-15, also fell in 2016, by 5.1%. Fatima Marinho, head of non-communicable diseases at the Ministry of Health, believes some women held off becoming pregnant – or had abortions, illegal in Brazil. Zika cases have almost zeroed out, she said, but another outbreak could happen. “We cannot discount this possibility.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/2018/mar/05/annotated-solutions-for-genius-176","type":"article","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T00:01:00Z","webTitle":"Annotated solutions for Genius 176","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2018/mar/05/annotated-solutions-for-genius-176","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/2018/mar/05/annotated-solutions-for-genius-176","fields":{"headline":"Annotated solutions for Genius 176","bodyText":"* Six clues containing only wordplay, their solutions being the name of one of ‘Les Six’, a group of six young composers working in Montparnasse post-WWI ** Solutions to these five clues to be entered in the grid less ix (Roman) or nine, producing non-words Across 8 ego altOGEther (hidden rev) 9 asking price AS/KING/(Vincent)PRICE 11** dieland D[ix]IELAND 12 biotech ICE BOTH (anag) 13 igloos (d)IG  S 15** megapel MEGAP[ix]EAL [M  EAL] 16* Durey D&lt;(sq)U(ab)&gt;REY [Louis D, d. 1979] 17** asi AS/I[nine] 18* Auric (f)AUR(é) + I see (hom) [Georges A, d. 1983; Gabriel Fauré] 20* Milhaud MIL  D [Darius M, d. 1974] 23 tip-toe POT/PIT (rev) 25 bostril I SHORT (anag) + L(ine) 27* Poulenc P&lt;(s)OUL&gt;ENC(e) [Francis P, d. 1963] 28* Tailleferre TAIL + ERR in FEREL (anag) [Germaine, d. 1983] 29 tab BAT (rev) Down 1** hendr HENDR[ix] [Jimmy Hendrix; hen doctor] 2* Honegger HO&lt;(wi)NE&gt;GGER [Arthur H, d. 1955; Women’s Institute] 3 lavatory L \n<a>ORY 4 skid S&lt;(heartbrea)K&gt;ID [Sid Vicious] 5 snub BUNS (rev) 6 rise up PERU IS (anag) 7 cephalic C  HALIC(e) [extended-play] 10 prong (P/w)RONG 14 sward DRAWS (rev) 15 moist M&lt;0&gt;IST 16** dominatr DO over MIN </a> \n<a>T/(horro)R[ix] 18 ampoules PAUL SOME (anag) 19 roomette ROO  T/(on)E [Metropolitan Police Force] 21 Les Six or less ix/9 22 April A/PRI(a)L 24 scuba S(outhern)/CUBA 26 left double def 27 port double def </a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"stage/2018/mar/04/the-shadow-factory-nst-city-southampton-review","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T08:00:41Z","webTitle":"The Shadow Factory review – Southampton’s wartime spirit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/mar/04/the-shadow-factory-nst-city-southampton-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/mar/04/the-shadow-factory-nst-city-southampton-review","fields":{"headline":"The Shadow Factory review – Southampton’s wartime spirit","bodyText":"Just over 40 years ago, Howard Brenton wrote the first new commission to be performed in the National’s Lyttelton theatre.

The Shadow Factory follows the consequences of a Luftwaffe strike on Southampton’s Spitfire factory in 1940 - a critical juncture of the second world war. Local businesses were summarily requisitioned; transformed into “shadow factories”, they were to maintain production of the aircraft described as “a violent, ugly killer – and exactly what we need” by newspaper magnate and recently appointed minister of aircraft production Lord Beaverbrook (Hilton McRae’s convincing, charming bully). Brenton’s fictive exploration of these historical events follows the fortunes of the house on the hill and a family laundry business in the town (Anita Dobson is vivid both as Lady Cooper and laundry granny). The play’s sweep is part epic, in its mix of points of view personal and political, and part pageant, in its demonstration (rather than working through) of situations and events – a well-integrated community chorus of singer-actors extends the scope of the action. Flying machines, roofscapes, bombscapes, interiors and landscapes are evoked stunningly via the adaptable lighting rig (59 Productions’ design).

Recommendations by the Sentencing Council published on Thursday state that the starting point for a judge assessing punishment for anyone over 18 caught with a “bladed article” in a public place should be six months in jail. For young people, the starting point is four months. One significant mitigating factor judges must consider – which permits them to impose non-custodial sentences – is whether it is the first time a defendant has been arrested with a knife. Those convicted of a second possession offence are subject to statutory minimum terms, meaning that in most circumstances they will go to prison. Offenders who make threats with knives or highly dangerous weapons will always receive sentences longer than six months. For those convicted of carrying a knife in a school or prison, the punishment will be much higher, with an initial reference point of 18 months’ jail before the individual facts of the case are taken into consideration. Acid is explicitly listed as a potentially dangerous weapon for the first time in the judicial guidelines, in response to the rise in the number of people having corrosive and disfiguring liquids thrown at them. Those who film their crimes and post them on social media will face tougher punishments. Other factors to be assessed will include the age, maturity, background and circumstances of young offenders. The guidelines, which come into effect in June, “may ... lead to some increases in sentence levels, predominantly in relation to adults convicted of possession offences”, the Sentencing Council acknowledges. Rosina Cottage QC, a member of the council, said: “Too many people in our society are carrying knives. If someone has a knife on them, it only takes a moment of anger or drunkenness for it to be taken out and for others to be injured or killed. These new guidelines give courts comprehensive guidance to ensure that sentences reflect the seriousness of offending.” The guidelines are not directly comparable with previous Sentencing Council recommendations. They take account of recent legislation and court of appeal judgments. They are intended, according to the council, to “reflect parliament’s concern about the social problem of offenders carrying knives”. The council promotes greater consistency in sentencing across courts in England and Wales by issuing and updating guidelines for judges, while aiming to increase public understanding of the decisions made by judges. The latest figures show that knife crime in England and Wales rose by 21% to 37,443 offences in the year to last September – the highest level for seven years. Welcoming the guidelines, the justice minister Rory Stewart said: “Knives ruin lives and fracture communities, and carrying a weapon is often an indicator of further devastating crimes to come. “We must equally recognise the emerging threat of other weapons, such as acid. Those caught with any offensive weapon must feel the full force of the law.” The guidelines respond to concerns about minimum prison terms raised by some lawyers and others who took part in the consultation. The guidelines explain: “In considering whether a statutory minimum sentence would be ‘unjust in all of the circumstances’, the court must have regard to the particular circumstances of the offence and the offender. “If the circumstances of the offence, the previous offence or the offender make it unjust to impose the statutory minimum sentence then the court must impose either a shorter custodial sentence than the statutory minimum provides or an alternative sentence.” The guidelines do not apply to situations where knives have been used; those are dealt with as wounding, murder or manslaughter charges."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/feb/28/macbeth-review-mark-bruce-wiltons-music-hall-london","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T21:00:01Z","webTitle":"Macbeth review – murder on the dance floor in Mark Bruce's stunner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/feb/28/macbeth-review-mark-bruce-wiltons-music-hall-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/feb/28/macbeth-review-mark-bruce-wiltons-music-hall-london","fields":{"headline":"Macbeth review – murder on the dance floor in Mark Bruce's stunner","bodyText":"As the choreographer of Dracula, The Odyssey and other dark stories, Mark Bruce has learned much about conjuring supernatural forces, so it’s no surprise that his new dance setting of Macbeth boasts a fabulous trio of witches. Riffing, perhaps, on the theme of “Fair is foul and foul is fair”, the trio first present themselves as quasi-ethereal creatures, dancing in silver-feathered headdresses, their airy, birdlike movements floating on the music of Arvo Pärt’s Magnificat Antiphons. The impact is doubly shocking when the witches rip away their feathers to reveal monstrously distorted faces (clever makeup and stocking masks) and when, to a violent blast of light and sound, they tumble to the floor in a gibbering, thrashing, howling tangle of limbs. No less curdling are scenes where they deliver their prophecies: teetering on platform heels and with shopping bags dangling from their arms, they become a ghastly, simpering parody of femininity as they show Macbeth a succession of grotesque baby dolls – the descendants of Banquo who will steal the throne. As with all of Bruce’s productions, this Macbeth is overwhelmingly strong visually. Daggers are everywhere: from the single blade that haunts the hallucinatory monologue to the opening battle scene, where the chorus of whirling, knife-wielding soldiers that Macbeth commands is not so much an army as a premonition of his own violent impulses. Blood also saturates the action, from the slowly intensifying crimson light that bathes the stage to the coup de theatre in which Duncan’s hideously gory corpse appears to be consumed on a funeral pyre. No less clever are the wooden stakes that form the walls of Macbeth’s fortress, and which finally transform into the trees of Birnam Wood, where the dead wait with the living to wreak their revenge. Without Shakespeare’s text, however, Bruce’s production depends on the quality of his choreography and expressiveness of his dancers. Jonathan Goddard could not be more ideally cast in the title role: flayed and hollow-eyed, he communicates the full existential horror of a man caving in on his own emptiness. No less importantly, he begins the work as a figure of gleaming charisma, and a fitting partner for Eleanor Duval’s predatory Lady Macbeth. When the pair dance their first confidently sexy duets – bodies curving around each other like clever conspirators – they are a couple with very credible pretensions to royalty. As Bruce charts the unravelling of their ambitions and their sanity, he makes vivid reference to these early duets: Banquo’s ghost is never more terrifying than when he appears to take Lady Macbeth’s place on the ballroom floor and Macbeth, revolted, finds himself holding on to a lifeless, blood-encrusted hand. Lady Macbeth’s descent into madness, much like Giselle’s, is deftly conveyed through the broken, tormented dance in which she reprises snatches of her former choreography. The weakness of the work, however, is that not enough of the action has been alchemised into dance. Bruce has perhaps been overambitious in the degree of plot detail he attempts to reproduce and too much of his narrative is thus carried by overly literal mime. This darkly hectic, beautifully executed Macbeth is truly worth seeing, but by the end it feels more like a visual gloss on Shakespeare than a fully choreographed alternative. • At Wilton’s Music Hall, London, until 17 March.

Made of plastic, the House of the Future looked suitably avant garde and was entirely mechanised. Sponsored by Monsanto, then one of the world’s biggest chemical companies, it attracted 20 million visitors over the next 10 years. However, as Mathieu Asselin points out in his book Monsanto: A Photographic Investigation, a very different vision of the future was unfolding in Anniston, Alabama. There, since the 1920s, Monsanto had been producing PCBs, chemicals widely used in the creation of lubricants, inks, paints and electrical equipment. PCBs were banned in the US in 1979 due to fears about their toxicity, but the damage to Anniston had already been done. Between 1929 and 1971, some 27 tonnes of PCBs were released into the atmosphere, 810 tonnes flushed into Snow Creek canal, and 32,000 tonnes deposited in an open-air landfill site near the city centre, according to a 2005 report by the Environmental Protection Agency. PCBs linger long in the environment and have been detected in water far from their original source of release. Prolonged exposure causes skin rashes in humans and changes in blood and urine that may denote liver damage. In 2013, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified dioxin-like PCBs as human carcinogens. “I began the book seven years ago and I have often been shocked by what I have uncovered,” says Asselin. Using a mixture of his own photographs, archive material, court files, Monsanto’s own adverts and the stories of campaigners and ordinary citizens, his hard-hitting volume, which is shortlisted for this year’s Deutsche Börse photography prize, attacks Monsanto’s reputation and its practices. His approach is unapologetically crusading. “I am playing with fire for sure,” he says. Asselin’s often low-key landscapes show a town in decline: empty buildings, abandoned businesses, dilapidated houses overgrown by trees and weeds. His equally melancholy images of local residents include one of David Baker, 65, head bowed by his brother’s grave. The caption reads: “Terry Baker died at the age of 16 from a brain tumour and lung cancer, caused by PCB exposure. The average level of PCB in Anniston is 27 times higher than the national average.” In February 2003, residents of Anniston won a $700m (£491m) settlement from Monsanto in a now-famous court case in which they argued the multinational was responsible for polluting the town and harming its citizens – and that the company had been aware of the toxic effects of PCBs on human health and the environment for decades, but had done nothing about it. In 2007, high pollution levels from PCB dumping were still being recorded in the nearby Snow and Choccolocco creeks. In one 2012 photograph by Asselin, the water at Choccolocco creek appears to be red. As Asselin’s book makes clear, the 2003 settlement was just one relatively small legal skirmish in a much larger and longer battle that has pitted a global chemical corporation against communities across America and the globe. That ongoing battle sheds light on a US lobbying system that skews the democratic process and often results in politicians, scientists and experts siding with Monsanto against farmers and communities. “In America,” says Asselin, “the company funds both the Democrats and the Republicans. They don’t have a political standpoint, they just need to make sure everything is OK to make more money. This is the bigger point I am making – global business just cannot go on like this. It has to change.” Asselin’s gaze shifts from Alabama to Vietnam where, during the long war against the Viet Cong, US troops sprayed 123m gallons of Agent Orange over huge swathes of the country between 1965 and 1971. Asselin cites evidence that about 10% of South Vietnam was contaminated and that between 2.1 and 4.8 million Vietnamese were directly exposed. Monsanto was one of the producers of the highly toxic defoliant, which is now linked to cancer and birth defects among the Vietnamese population, as well as physical and psychological issues affecting returning US servicemen. One arresting portrait is of Heather Bowser, a woman born with several fingers and part of her right leg missing. Another is a closeup of her deformed hand holding a photograph of her late father, Morris, who served in Vietnam and whose own myriad health problems were directly linked to exposure to Agent Orange. Asselin’s installation at the Photographer’s Gallery in London, where the work of the four Deutsche Börse finalists is on show, includes two wall-mounted tablets that have Deutsche Börse apps installed so that they can livestream the daily stock market prices of Monsanto and Bayer. (In 2016, Bayer announced that it was planning a $66bn takeover of Monsanto.) This should please the sponsors of the prize no end, I suggest. “I have to handle the nomination carefully,” says Asselin. “It is a recognition from my fellow artists and professionals – but it is also a prize sponsored by another big multimillion dollar company.” When I mention the Syngenta photo award, which purports to address issues of sustainability while being sponsored by a global pesticide manufacturer, he says: “It’s the biggest bullshit around.” Asselin is a breath of fresh air in a contemporary photography world where conceptual ambiguity too often undercuts social or political commitments. “I often don’t understand what photographers are trying to tell me,” he says, “so I try to make sure there is no room for ambiguity in my work. I want to make clear exactly what the problem is. There is just no time to waste being neutral.” • The winner of the prize is announced on 17 May. The Deutsche Börse exhibition at the Photographers’ Gallery, London, runs until 3 June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/feb/28/pmqs-verdict-may-corbyn-brexit-irish-border","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T13:20:30Z","webTitle":"PMQs verdict: Corbyn misses key Brexit attack line on Irish border","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/28/pmqs-verdict-may-corbyn-brexit-irish-border","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/feb/28/pmqs-verdict-may-corbyn-brexit-irish-border","fields":{"headline":"PMQs verdict: Corbyn misses key Brexit attack line on Irish border","bodyText":"Key points Jeremy Corbyn spoke for many when he began by asking the prime minister what “ambitious managed divergence” – the approach to Brexit thrashed out last week during the cabinet awayday at Chequers – means in practice. May replied that the Conservatives would restore Britain’s control of its laws, borders and money, in contrast to Labour’s position of remaining in a customs union, which she described as a “betrayal of the British people”. Corbyn said 94% of small and medium-sized businesses think the government is ignoring their concerns about Brexit. Who is best at representing the views of businesses: small business groups or Liam Fox? May retorted that the Federation of Small Businesses had said it was behind the government’s trade policy. To Labour cheers, Corbyn asked May whether the government could clarify which sectors would align with EU regulations and which would diverge. Groaning and telling them to “calm down”, May said she had already set out the position and the Tories were committed to trade going across borders, and there being no hard border. Corbyn responded that May’s “after-dinner speeches” are no substitute for negotiations. Health and social care in the UK is reliant on migrant workers. Is she not concerned that EU workers are leaving Britain in unprecedented numbers? May said the most recent immigration figures showed more people from the EU are coming into the UK than leaving, and the government has set nursing and GP training places at the highest level. Corbyn replied that the government has cut the nurse training bursary and does not seem to realise that it takes eight years to train to be a doctor. There are 100,000 NHS vacancies, he said, and those on the benches opposite should “get a life and visit a hospital and see how hard those people work”. He then turned to Boris Johnson’s leaked letter to May about the Irish frontier, which seemed to contradict his assurance that there would be no hard border. May said the issue of EU nationals had been a key part of the December agreement, there are more nurses on wards than under Labour and if training a doctor takes eight years, Labour were in power eight years ago. May reiterated that the government is “committed to ensuring we deliver on no hard border”. Corbyn concluded that the government was in disarray, proved by its soundbites: first Brexit means Brexit, then a red, white and blue Brexit, then a liberal Brexit and now ambitious managed divergence. “The government is so divided, the prime minister is incapable of delivering a coherent plan, so when will she put the country’s interest before the outsized egos of her cabinet?” May said her priority was the British people and the Conservatives were building homes, raising standards in schools and protecting the environment, “as opposed to [a] Labour government that would bankrupt Britain and drag this country down”. Snap verdict Corbyn’s Brexit speech on Monday clarified the divide between Labour and the Tories on this topic, and this may explain why he sounded more confident than before to tackle May on it. Her attempt to rubbish the new Labour position in response to an early planted question did not quite hit home, and so the Corbyn/May exchanges felt very much like a score draw, shedding little light on policy, but covering quite a lot of ground. Corbyn’s point about business groups having more credibility on the needs of business than Fox (a doctor before he became an MP) was good and well put, and he was effective too on recruitment vacancies in the NHS. But May had fairly decent responses, and her argument about eight-year timetables for doctor recruitment meant that when she parried Corbyn with a reference to the previous Labour government, for once it sounded as if she had a point. Corbyn’s best moment probably came when he mocked Boris Johnson, and his best question was the one about how May can square what she is saying now about not having a hard border in Ireland with Johnson’s private letter suggesting that he clearly sees this as an option. But he did not push this charge repeatedly or aggressively, and it ended up feeling like a key attack line that did not get fully exploited. Best lines He’s mixing it up with the Camden/Islington border Jeremy Corbyn responds to a heckle from Boris Johnson about the Irish border with a reference to the foreign secretary’s claims on Tuesday’s Today programme that the two were comparable. Who hasn’t a clue? The Labour party that wants to borrow £500bn and bankrupt Britain May responds to Corbyn’s claim that the Tories do not have a clue about what small businesses think of their Brexit policy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/07/from-the-house-of-the-dead-royal-opera-janacek-mark-wigglesworth","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T12:54:48Z","webTitle":"From the House of the Dead shines a light into darkness","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/07/from-the-house-of-the-dead-royal-opera-janacek-mark-wigglesworth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/07/from-the-house-of-the-dead-royal-opera-janacek-mark-wigglesworth","fields":{"headline":"From the House of the Dead shines a light into darkness","bodyText":"Ten years after the end of the first world war, the 74-year-old Czech composer Leoš Janáček completed his final opera, From the House of Dead. The 1920s was a period of economic prosperity and Gatsbyesque indulgence, but those less inclined to denial saw the wasteland left in the wake of such senseless global conflict. Indeed, TS Eliot’s 1922 poem of that name reflected many people’s numb confusion. Janáček based his own fragmentary mix of “memory and desire” on the 19th-century Siberian prison memoirs of Fyodor Dostoevsky. The stage is full of some of the most aggressive and unpleasant people you could imagine. Yet with music of intense beauty, vulnerability, strength, pathos, and humour, the composer encourages us to look for life in even the blackest of holes. From the House of the Dead is a perfect illustration of opera’s ability to articulate the disconcerting, and a deeply moving example of its power to shine light into a darkness that some might prefer to ignore. A new production by the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden – its first ever staging of the work – opens this week. There are probably a few reasons why it has taken 90 years for the Royal Opera to perform what many consider to be the greatest work by such a theatrically approachable and psychologically relevant composer as Janáček. But the Covent Garden audience is no longer made up of people who go to the opera to seek an escape from reality. Opera can be a mirror for our time, one that invites us to look at ourselves as individuals and as the communities we are part of, inspiring us to find private or public solutions to the challenges we face. In a climate of moral absolutism and the intolerance that that engenders, From the House of the Dead is a much needed celebration of the redemptive power of empathy. The worst of our society are worth more than the worst things they have ever done, and though humankind’s capacity for futile violence might seem as strong as ever, Janáček does not believe we should give up on those we do not understand. Through the transcendental qualities of his music, he shows us that everyone is human. Even murderers, as one of the characters says, “had a mother”. It is not so much a question of forgiveness, but rather one of understanding. How we judge criminals is a sign of how we judge ourselves. The state of a prison is more an indication of the values of those on the outside than it is of those incarcerated within. Janáček is the ideal composer to counteract those who wonder whether opera can be a credible dramatic experience if realistic expression feels compromised by the fact that everyone is singing. He believed that “the truest expression of the soul lies in the melodic motifs of speech”. A lifelong obsession with the rhythmic and melodic patterns of what we say (even to the extent of annotating musically his dying daughter’s final words) led him to take a great deal of time and trouble prescribing exactly how the texts of his operas should be sung. The result is a sincere and primordial form of communication, one in which the words and notes are so connected that it is impossible to conceive of one without the other – or even which came first. His compositional style is a persuasive argument in support of the view that language and music evolved as two sides of the same coin. In essence, they are one and the same thing. Such detailed control of the text also means that a speed that is right for the words is right for the music too. Were From the House of Dead to be performed as a play without any music at all, it would probably last exactly the same length of time. Perhaps uniquely in opera, not a single sung word has a pause written above it – an acknowledgment that when we speak, our pauses most often occur not on the words but in the spaces we choose to put between them. It is with our silences that we reveal more. For Janáček, the sound of silence was an audible thing, and he uses the orchestra to weave a constant thread through the disparate montage of Dostoevsky’s prison life. We hear the prisoners’ private longing, their inner anger, regret, uncertainty and conviction. And we hear the femininity of the many women, whom an almost exclusively male cast spend most of the opera remembering. In a more literal sense, we hear the noises of everyday life too. Musicians are required to play prison chains, church bells, rattles, spades, axes, and even a saw. “I’ve run out of wood!” is not a sentence you usually hear in rehearsals. On the title page of this extraordinary work’s barely legible manuscript, Janáček added: “In every creature, a spark of God.” It is a statement of profound affirmation from within the depths of despair – a complexity that the many-layered operatic form is well equipped to express. From the House of the Dead is able to be optimistic and triumphant because it offers what Janáček called a “vibrating string”, connecting us all through consideration and compassion. As F Scott Fitzgerald wrote, around the same time as this opera, “reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope”. Hope is something we have an individual responsibility to act upon. Mark Wigglesworth conducts From the House of the Dead at the Royal Opera House, London, until 24 March.

Well, just the cocksure scorn of his more thugged-out moments – there is very little of Drake’s melodic invention on show here. He’s not the only MC to get ripped off on Lanez’s gutless quest to avoid developing his own artistry. Swae Lee’s entreaties (on 4 Me), Post Malone’s mournful melodies (on Hillside), the Weeknd’s jaded songcraft (on Real Thing), Rick Ross’s freewheeling declarations (on Benevolent) – all are rendered less appealingly in Lanez’s strained, vocal-fried tones. Aside from stark, straightforward domestic abuse storytelling on Pieces – where J Cole takes his turn to be imitated – the lyrics, full of bad girls and truly blank verse, are as generic and lumpen as value-range muesli. As Migos or 2 Chainz ably demonstrate, rapping about racks and whips isn’t necessarily dull, but you need to have wit, nimble hooks and idiosyncratic flow, none of which Lanez possesses. He’s so profoundly unoriginal you start to wonder if he is actually a rudimentary Spotify AI project who has been fed the RapCaviar playlist and given an edgy beard.

Her film is a bit shapeless and unsignposted, sometimes more like a rough cut than a finished movie, a patchwork of original interview material and archive footage. But it’s a good story. After serving in the Vietnam war, the mercurial Gritz was given training and intelligence postings, and on leaving the services became notorious for declaring to saucer-eyed journalists and movie producers thatPOWs were still being held in south-east Asia. Clint Eastwood and William Shatner fronted up cash for Bo’s preposterous rescue-adventures in return for the “movie rights”, thus creating an overwhelming temptation for this big talker to return with Hollywood tales of derring-do (but no POWs). He was widely considered to be the model for Sly Stallone’s Rambo, but Bo was already the star of the movie in his own head. Later he would run for office as an anti-establishment populist. (That could remind you of a certain someone, although Gritz did genuinely serve in dangerous war zone situations.) He tried forming his own gun-happy “covenant communities” in Idaho, offering his diva-ish and unhelpful services as a “mediator” in an armed standoff with police there in 1992, which was later filmed as a TV movie. It is a bizarre life-story of publicity, but Zimmerman gives an interesting account of Gritz’s personal issues with depression, and conveys the feeling that after Vietnam, things were never the same again. • Erase and Forget is available on Lux from 4 July (free from 4-11 July)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"news/2018/feb/28/has-your-company-published-a-gender-pay-gap-audit","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T06:50:20Z","webTitle":"Tell us what the gender pay gap looks like where you work","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/feb/28/has-your-company-published-a-gender-pay-gap-audit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/feb/28/has-your-company-published-a-gender-pay-gap-audit","fields":{"headline":"Tell us what the gender pay gap looks like where you work","bodyText":"If you work for a company with more than 250 employees then management will have been working to report gender pay gaps to the Government Equalities Office.

Researchers say the discoveries on two naturally mummified bodies that date from between 3351 and 3017BC mean they will have to rewrite the story of tattooing. Daniel Antoine, the curator of physical anthropology at the British Museum, said: “Incredibly, at over 5,000 years of age, they push back the evidence for tattooing in Africa by a millennium.” The findings, published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, concern a mummified man and woman from Egypt’s predynastic period, the era before the country’s unification by the first pharaoh in 3100BC. The male mummy, known as Gebelein Man A, is something of a gallery favourite. He is one of the best-preserved mummies in the world and has been on display almost continuously since his discovery around 100 years ago. He is known to have had ginger hair; in 2012, it was revealed that he had probably been murdered, apparently stabbed in the back. What had not been examined previously were some indistinct dark smudges on his upper right arm that have now been revealed as tattoos of a bull and of a sheep. They may have been worn as symbols of power and strength. Before the discovery, archaeologists had thought tattoos were restricted to women. On the female mummy, known as Gebelein Woman, researchers found a series of four small S-shaped motifs that were more difficult to interpret. They could be crooked staves or throw-sticks, batons or clappers used in ritual dance. Tattoos were a part of many ancient cultures. Before the latest discoveries, the oldest surviving examples were mainly geometric tattoos on an Alpine mummy known as Ötzi the Iceman. He dates from the fourth millennium BC, so is approximately contemporary with the Gebelein mummies. Antoine, one of the lead researchers on the paper, said use of CT scanning, radiocarbon dating and infrared imaging “has transformed our understanding of the Gebelein mummies. Only now are we gaining new insights into the lives of these remarkably preserved individuals.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/feb/28/talking-horses-cheltenham-weights-to-be-announced-and-snow-updates","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T11:04:27Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Cheltenham weights to be announced and snow updates","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/feb/28/talking-horses-cheltenham-weights-to-be-announced-and-snow-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/feb/28/talking-horses-cheltenham-weights-to-be-announced-and-snow-updates","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Cheltenham weights to be announced and snow updates","bodyText":"Wednesday is a key date in the diary for serious punters, as the weights for the handicaps at the Cheltenham Festival the week after next will be published and the business of trying to find a long-priced nugget of gold amid a daunting wealth of possibilities will begin in earnest. And it is just as well, given that there will be no jumps racing in Britain until Friday at the earliest and it is up to the all-weather programme to keep turnover rolling until the elements relent. Even the all-weather tracks are beginning to feel the strain, however. Newcastle’s card on Wednesday evening is off following an 11am inspection. Chelmsford City has also announced an inspection at 1pm on Thursday before its scheduled card on Friday. “We have about four inches of snow overnight and we have more forecast today,” Andy Waitt, the clerk of the course, said on Wednesday morning. “We will take a look tomorrow afternoon to check we are where we need to be in terms of clearing the snow. It is more of a health and safety issue than a problem with the track. We also need to check the surrounding roads are safe for people to get to the course.” Doncaster’s jumps meeting on Friday has been abandoned due to snow on the course, and Thursday’s card at Clonmel in Ireland has gone the same way. Compatriot (3.50) is a short price for the 12-furlong handicap at Wolverhampton, but it is difficult to see past Olly Murphy’s runner after he made a successful debut for the stable last week. That was Compatriot’s first run beyond a mile after some fair performances in defeat when for his previous trainer in Ireland, and he has plenty of scope for further progress at middle distances. A 6lb penalty should not cause him too many problems.

Founded by passionate book lover Omar Amin, who left his job in marketing in November to dedicate himself to the library full time, the multilingual collection is made up of donations, including a first edition Harry Potter and a 1927 edition of Kafka’s Amerika which Amin found while rummaging through the Egyptian capital’s book markets. It is a risky time to be setting up. Al-Karama library was raided in December 2016 by Egyptian security forces, part of a larger crackdown on freedom of expression. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 20 journalists were imprisoned in 2017, and Egyptian writer and activist Basma Aziz reports that “many publishing houses are subjected to harassment”. But despite the risks, Amin wants to encourage people in the frantic city of Cairo to rediscover the simple pleasure of reading. Kabul public library, Afghanistan Founded from the amalgamation of two small libraries in 1966, Kabul Public Library has witnessed the communist regime, a civil war, the rule of the Taliban, and the instability that has racked the country since the coalition invasion in 2001. Violence is rising in Kabul, and the library is in a state of disrepair. “The ongoing conflict has hampered library services and many people are afraid to stay out of their homes for any length of time,” says Qayoom Suroush, an analyst focusing on Afghanistan. “In short, they need everything that is required for a modern library. They need new books, modern management systems, professional librarians and buildings.” Afghanistan has many pressing needs, but the library is crucial as a place for social and academic exchange, Suroush maintains, adding that it “can help young people understand that there is no single reading on Islam and everyone has a right to their beliefs”. Unnamed library in Mogadishu, Somalia It may not yet have a name, but the slick black-and-white space which is poised to open as a library in Mogadishu confounds western stereotypes of the Somalian capital. With frequent attacks from the Islamist group al-Shabaab and the country on the brink of famine, Mogadishu is a challenging place to live and work. But Badra Yusuf and Abdulrahim Aden, who are helping to set up the library, hope it can contribute to a culture of reading. Roseau public library, Dominica With roots reaching all the way back to 1843 and a handsome building constructed in 1906, Roseau public library boasted a collection of black history and Caribbean literature spanning over 100 years. But when Hurricane Maria struck the island last year, the library lost its roof and 25,000 books. The library reopened in a temporary space at the National Documentation Centre in December 2017, after Book Aid donated 2,000 books. Librarian Veranda Raymond says she remains committed to providing a service, especially for students who lost books, internet connections and places for study in the storm. “Our space is limited,” she said, “however, we are making it work to support our members.” Raymond says the library service is planning to rebuild, though with climate change already pushing the islands into new patterns of weather, Dominican librarians will have to brace themselves for more disruption in the future. Eventually, she says, the plan is to rebuild a library, although that will require money. Iraq National Library and Archive, in Baghdad, Iraq The Iraq National Library and Archive has seen plenty of turbulence since it was founded in 1920. But during the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 the library was burned and looted, losing 60% of the archives and 95% of the collection of rare books. Rebuilding and keeping the library open among the chaos of the years that followed was no easy task. Writing on the British Library website, the director, Saad Eskander, described the aftermath of a 2007 bombing: “Tens of thousands of papers were flying high, as if the sky was raining books, tears and blood. The view was surreal. Some of the papers were burning in the sky.” He told the Guardian in 2008: “I never have a bodyguard because that attracts attention. This idea of having bodyguards, changing cars two or three times, is very stupid. If they want to kill you, they will do it. If you are lucky you will stay, if not, you will be killed.” The situation in Baghdad has improved since the darkest days of the post-invasion instability, but it remains a dangerous city – a bomb in January killed at least 35. But the library is still open, five days a week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/feb/28/wholesale-gas-prices-more-than-double-as-freeze-drives-demand","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T19:43:41Z","webTitle":"Wholesale gas prices more than double as freeze drives demand","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/28/wholesale-gas-prices-more-than-double-as-freeze-drives-demand","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/feb/28/wholesale-gas-prices-more-than-double-as-freeze-drives-demand","fields":{"headline":"Wholesale gas prices more than double as freeze drives demand","bodyText":"Wholesale gas prices in the UK more than doubled on Wednesday to their highest level in at least 10 years, as freezing temperatures across Britain drove a spike in demand and raised fears of a supply shortage. Within-day prices rose 108% to 160p per therm, after hitting am earlier peak of 190p per therm. Day ahead prices were up 6p at 95p. It comes as the severe cold snap continues and is forecast to worsen in some parts of the country. Experts said that while National Grid data suggested the market had a theoretical oversupply, physical shipments remained low. Britain’s bigger energy companies typically hedge supplies many months in advance, so short-term price spikes should not automatically trigger higher prices for customers. But smaller suppliers, which account for about 20% of the market, are usually less hedged and can pass on price rises sooner. Bulb, which has about 300,000 customers, said on Tuesday that it would raise bills by 2.8% from 28 April. Fears over supply were exacerbated by outages at gas terminals in St Fergus, Scotland, and at Morecambe, which amounted to about 13m cubic metres of capacity. “These events may ease during the day but could also add to already acute demand for gas,” said gas analysts at Thomson Reuters. A further outage at a Norwegian gas processing plant also contributed to the rise in UK wholesale prices. National Grid data on Wednesday showed demand for gas was 28% above the seasonal norm. A National Grid spokesperson said: “Due to the cold weather some supplies have tripped but we’re also seeing some come back. We are in communication with terminal operators and closely monitoring the situation. Market prices are high, reflecting the supply and demand position.” Britain’s ability to respond to short-term demand shocks has been hampered by the closure last year of Centrica’s Rough gas storage site in the North Sea off the Yorkshire coast, the country’s largest site. At its operational peak Rough could store about 10% of Britain’s gas demand."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/13/birdwatch-beguiling-song-of-the-serin","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T21:30:34Z","webTitle":"Birdwatch: beguiling song of the serin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/13/birdwatch-beguiling-song-of-the-serin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/13/birdwatch-beguiling-song-of-the-serin","fields":{"headline":"Birdwatch: beguiling song of the serin","bodyText":"Under a fiercely blue sky, the sun shines down on groves of oranges and almond blossom. I am in the mountain village of Sella, in Spain’s Alicante province, enjoying a sneak preview of spring – a month or more before it arrives in Britain. The migrant birds are not yet back, but half a dozen different butterflies are on the wing and birdsong fills the air. The scratchy sound of Sardinian warblers, the metallic song of the black redstart, and, from every little bush and tree, the liquid tinkling of serins. A cousin of the canaries trapped in their cages nearby, the serin is Europe’s smallest finch, a plump, yellow ball of feathers fringed with grey and green. Serins are such a common bird here and throughout most of western Europe it’s hard to believe they are so scarce in the UK. Yet from the 1960s onwards they did breed for a while in Devon and Dorset, before deciding that our climate wasn’t quite what they were looking for and retreating back across the channel. Seeing them here, though, gives me hope that one day they might return to Britain, and I’ll hear their delicate song echoing across my own village."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/feb/27/swansea-v-sheffield-wednesday-la-liga-football-league-and-more-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T22:00:31Z","webTitle":"Swansea 2-0 Sheffield Wednesday, La Liga, Football League and more – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/feb/27/swansea-v-sheffield-wednesday-la-liga-football-league-and-more-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/feb/27/swansea-v-sheffield-wednesday-la-liga-football-league-and-more-live","fields":{"headline":"Swansea 2-0 Sheffield Wednesday, La Liga, Football League and more – as it happened","bodyText":"And that’s that. Swansea made a little bit of FA Cup history; Rangers kept on Celtic’s shoulder in Scotland; erstwhile Premier League clubs Sheffield United, Blackburn Rovers and Coventry City all made promotion statements; and Real Madrid continued to faff around in La Liga. It’s been a blast. Thanks for reading! Nighty night! The Swans sail serenely into the quarter finals. It’s their best cup run since 1964, the year they were put out by Preston North End in the semis, as Swansea Town. Now they’ll host either Tottenham Hotspur or Rochdale in the last eight! The Blades usurp Bristol City in the Championship play-off places. Reading remain in serious danger of being dragged into a relegation dogfight. Wednesday are applying no pressure whatsoever to Swansea, who look set fair for the quarter finals. It’ll be a fairly shocking comeback if this one goes to extra time, put it that way. Michael Dawson’s second-half equaliser keeps the Tigers above the Tykes in the relegation struggle. They’re three points above Birmingham in the dropzone, and one ahead of Barnsley in 21st place. Some results from further down the Football League. In League One, Blackburn Rovers won 3-0 at AFC Wimbledon, Bradley Dack their two-goal hero, Elliott Bennett scoring the other. Rovers move four points clear of Shrewsbury Town at the top. Meanwhile Peterborough United came from behind to beat Walsall 2-1 at London Road. Peterborough are now within touching distance of the play-offs. And in League Two, Coventry City won at Wycombe Wanderers, Marc McNulty’s 82nd-minute penalty the difference. City also have play-off designs. Nathan Dyer is sent scampering down the right by a clever through ball from Abraham. Dyer enters the area, draws Dawson, and nutmegs the keeper. That’s his third goal of the season, and they’ve all come in the FA Cup. All of the scoreboard-bothering action at Tynecastle came in the first half. The teams stay in fifth and sixth spots respectively. So Graeme Murty’s side are now just six points behind Celtic at the top, having played one game more. The champions won’t be too worried, but at least they’re being kept honest by their old rivals. The Saints remain in eighth. Michael Dawson levels things up in the relegation struggle at the KCOM. It’s a good night for Sheffield United. Wednesday are losing in the cup, while it appears three points are in the Blades’ bag at Reading. Billy Sharp nets his second to turn the mood sour at the Madejski. The snow is really falling in Perth now. Craig looks for the bottom-left corner of the Rangers goal from 20 yards, but it’s wide, and with less than ten minutes remaining the only thing that’ll stop Rangers picking up all three points is a short-order snowdrift. Even the Beast from the East couldn’t summon up one of those. The positive substitution has worked for Swansea! They triangulate prettily down the right. Then Carroll decides to take a pop from distance. He lashes a glorious low shot past Dawson and off the base of the right-hand post. The ball flies along the goal-line and off the left-hand post ... and out! It’s awful luck, because it was a wonderful strike. But Swansea needn’t fret, because Ayew, who has been on the pitch for just over nine minutes, is on hand to sidefoot the rebound powerfully home! Reading desperately need points, and accordingly have launched a comeback in the early stages of the second half at the Madejski. Omar Richards has halved the deficit. Swansea make a double change at half time, presumably with a view to getting a result in 90 minutes one way or the other. Olsson and Ayew replace Ki and Routledge. Olsson is quickly linking up with Dyer down the left, nearly releasing the striker into shot-taking territory. Not quite. But there’s an upturn in tempo. A corner from the right is launched long. Foderingham finds his route to the ball blocked. Kerr rises high at the far post, and plants the simplest header into the net from close range. That’s his first goal for the Saints. And the comeback is, er, on! It’s fair to say that Graeme Murty’s side have secured the three points at McDairmid Park. Morelos flicks a glorious header home from a tight angle, helping on a cross from the right. Meanwhile poor Murray Davidson’s dismal evening comes to an end: he’s tweaked a hamstring and his race is run. Mark Duffy makes it two for the Blades just before half time at the Madejski. Meanwhile here’s Chris Smith with an alternative view on Carlos Carvalhal: “Matt Collins may have only just become used to seeing and hearing from Carvalhal and may therefore believe that he’s easy going and fun loving. As a Wednesday fan, let me tell you that he uses it as his form of prickliness when things start falling out of his control. Watch Swansea tumble away once he has to build a squad of his own, and once that happens and people start questioning him (fairly) you’ll see how ‘fun’ he is.” That breaks an 11-game losing streak for Espanyol against Real. A thoroughly deserved victory, as they were on top for the majority of a poor match. They rise to 13th spot in the Primera División; Real Madrid continue to mooch around in third place. Espanyol win it with pretty much the last kick of the game! A low cross from the right is met by Moreno, 12 yards out. He shapes like Zidane at Hampden in 2002 - well, OK, maybe a little too much artistic licence there - but he does belt a shot into the right-hand side of the net! Barnsley defender Adam Jackson has been stretchered off, following a clash of heads with Hull’s Jon Toral at the KCOM Stadium. Play was stopped for over 10 minutes, the incident occurring five minutes before half time. Jackson has only recently returned from a four-month lay-off with posterior cruciate ligament damage sustained against the same opposition back in October. Toral wasn’t able to continue either, but was at least able to make it off the field on his own. Espanyol are doing all the late pressing in their match against Real Madrid. Moreno is released into the box down the right, but his effort to swish one into the top left gets no curl. Then Sergio Garcia tries to chip Navas from the best part of 50 yards. He’s a saucy one. Abraham bursts down the middle of the field at the Liberty, with Dyer to his right and Wednesday light at the back. An overhit pass allows Dawson to scamper off his line and claim, though Dyer should really have been put clean through on goal. Something happens in Swansea! Carroll dinks a little ball into the Wednesday area. Clucas decides to go for the spectacular, and lashes an overhead kick wide left of goal from 12 yards. A half-decent effort, and full marks for ambition, though Abraham was pretty much free in the middle, and a clever cushioned header down by Clucas would have probably resulted in a simple tap-in goal. Still, it’s something. “Watching Carlos Carvalhal’s pre-match interview, I wondered if he’s the only manager around with a ‘Hey guys it’s only a game, let’s enjoy this’ cheery default disposition?” wonders Matt Collins. “It’s a refreshing change from the usual mix of prickly, defensive, sarcastic, brow-beaten etc etc.” Yes, he does appear to have everything in proportion. It’s almost as though he’s worked out that all of this is just meant to be a bit of fun. Chris Kane of St Johnstone has just been booked for booting David Bates up the seat of his trousers in the comic-book style. Haw. It’s not quite Gemmell on Haller, but you’ve seen red cards flashed for that sort of thing. Rangers, three up at the break, won’t be too fussed, though poor Bates might have to sit on a plump cushion tomorrow. Sean Goss, on loan from QPR, dinks a delicious free kick over the wall and into the bottom right. Mannus had no chance! A shame Rangers were so poor in the early stages of this season, because they’re in form now, and we might have had a title race. Gareth Bale tries to flick one home from a corner, but his near-post activity is all pirouette and no power. Meanwhile in Scotland, Jamie Murphy of Rangers embarks on a Gazzaesque burst down the park, but is clipped by Murray Davidson just before he enters the box. Free kick, and a booking for Davidson. Replays show Davidson got some of the ball, so that’s added insult to the two injuries he suffered in the first ten minutes of this game. Not only that ... Not much going on at Espanyol, or in Swansea. Pity po’ Clocko. The snow’s coming down in Perth, though. All level at Tynecastle as Steven Naismith finds the net for Craig Levein’s side. Meanwhile Rangers have the ball in the back of the St Johnstone net again, Morelos slamming home from close range after a penalty-box stramash. But Bates had been a-pushin’ and a-shovin’, so the whistle went. Promotion-chasing Sheffield United want to usurp Bristol City in the play-off places, and they’re going the right way about it. Billy Sharp opens the scoring at struggling Reading. This is a gorgeous goal. Greg Docherty dinks a clever little ball into the box down the middle. Josh Windass times his run to perfection, and steers an immediate finish into the bottom left past a flat-footed Mannus. That’s cute football. Hull and Barnsley are both desperate to put some distance between themselves and the Championship dropzone. The early signs tonight are better for Barnsley, who take the lead through Oliver McBurnie. Espanyol and Real Madrid have started their second-half manoeuvres. The home team are on the front foot early doors, Moreno bothering the top of the bar from a corner. Meanwhile the FA Cup tie between Swansea and Sheffield Wednesday is also underway. An early chance for Butterfield to cause the hosts a few problems with an early free kick down the right. But though the visitors load the box, the delivery is no good whatsoever. Penalty for Rangers as Morelos chases a long ball and rounds Mannus on the left. The keeper clatters into the Rangers man. He’s booked and it’s a spot kick. Tavernier calmly dispatches it into the bottom right. On the plus side for St Johnstone, Murray Davidson hasn’t suffered any more physical indignities in the last five minutes. As if pipping them to the 1965 title wasn’t enough, Killie continue to riff on Heart of Midlothian’s pain with an early goal at Tynecastle. Eamonn Brophy gets it. But not yet! For no sooner is Murray Davidson back up and about, than he’s back on the floor again, clattering accidentally into Josh Windass and taking one upside the head. That’s gotta hurt, to borrow a phrase from George Costanza’s Big Book of Cinema Banter. He’s still good to continue, but the poor guy really has been in the wars. And that’s the end of a goalless first half in Spain. Now then, what’s happening at a beyond-freezing McDairmid Park? Not much, because Jamie Murphy has just danced all over Murray Davidson’s trouser arrangement, the result of both men stretching into a 50-50. Ooyah, oof. A lot of understandable grimacing and rolling around. Action to follow! Isco has just whipped a very average free kick over the bar from a dangerous spot just outside the Espanyol box. Seconds earlier, Bale had a good shout for a penalty kick when his low shot from a tight position on the left was blocked by Victor Sanchez, who was skittering around on his arse in the slapstick style, the ball hitting his hand. It was a good save, if accidental, and yes, you’ve seen them given nonetheless. It’s been 38 minutes of turgid fare at the Estadi Cornellà-El Prat. No goals yet. But Gareth Bale’s just gone in the book for hanging out a leg to bring down Darder. He can have no complaints, and to be fair he doesn’t bother making any. ... and the lads at the Liberty ...

Subs: Moore, Donaldson, Leonard, Lafferty, Holmes, Ched Evans, Lundstram. Referee: Andy Davies (Hampshire) Now Moreno has the ball in the net, a wild long shot deflecting into his path. He’s free on the penalty spot, and after trapping the ball, tucks it away into the bottom left. The flag goes up for offside, and to be fair to the officials he looked miles off. But replays show there really wasn’t much air between him and Llorente. Real breathe again. They don’t exactly look solid at the back. Espanyol should be a goal up. Varane’s dismal clearance ended up at the feet of Moreno, who found himself one on one with Navas. A little dink would have sufficed, but instead Moreno went low, and dragged his shot wide left of the target. He’s claiming a corner, insisting Navas made a save, and he may well be right. But he’s not getting it. A terrible miss. The teams at Tynecastle tonight ... Hearts: McLaughlin, Randall, Hughes, Berra, Mitchell, Cowie, Cochrane, Adao, Milinkovic, Naismith, Lafferty. Subs: Irving, Amankwaa, Michael Smith, Hamilton, Callachan, Godinho, Henderson. Kilmarnock: MacDonald, O’Donnell, Broadfoot, Greer, Taylor, McKenzie, Power, Mulumbu, Jones, Brophy, Tshibola.

Evans and his assistant Paul Raynor have left the Fourth Division League Two club amid rumours linking them with Peterborough United. Evans has been in charge of the Stags since 2016, leading them to 12th place last season. Mansfield, who are currently fifth, have “reluctantly accepted” the resignations. Their chairman John Radford says: “Whilst I am disappointed by their decision, there are no individuals bigger than Mansfield Town Football Club and the process of appointing a new management team which can lead the club to League One is already under way.” Peterborough host Walsall tonight. And here’s your Real Madrid XI, embedded below for your leisure and pleasure: They’ve just kicked off at the Estadi Cornellà-El Prat. Nothing much going on yet. No Karim Benzema or Cristiano Ronaldo tonight for Real, but we’re getting ahead of ourselves. Here’s the Espanyol starting XI, in super-social-media form: Tonight’s teams from the KCOM Stadium ... Hull City: McGregor, Aina, Dawson, MacDonald, Clark, Larsson, Irvine, Bowen, Toral, Diomande, Dicko. Subs: Hector, Marshall, Keane, Campbell, Tomori, Stewart, Grosicki. Barnsley: Townsend, Cavare, Jackson, Lindsay, Pinillos, Gardner, Joe Williams, Potts, Thiam, Moore, McBurnie. Subs: Davies, Bradshaw, Moncur, Mallan, Mahoney, Pearson, Yiadom. Referee: Michael Jones (Chester) Welcome, one and all, to a midweek Clocko special! The big action tonight comes from the Liberty Stadium, where Swansea City take on Sheffield Wednesday in an FA Cup fifth-round replay. It can’t be any worse than the original tie at Hillsborough, it just can’t. There’s the potential for extra time and penalties, as well. That kicks off at 8.05pm. In the Championship, Hull City welcome Barnsley (7.45pm) while Reading take on Sheffield United (8pm). Up in Scotland, Hearts host their 1965 tormentors Kilmarnock, while St Johnstone roll out the red carpet for Rangers. The kick-offs north of the border: 7.45pm. And it’s 15th versus third in La Liga as Espanyol host Real Madrid. A 7pm start in the UK money for that one. So then: four countries, four competitions, four different kick-off times. No scope for farcical confusion there!

They should though – leaders make mistakes. My terrible ideas often come from being under pressure to make many different decisions across the business. Those who are earlier in their career are usually focused on a specific task or department, so I always say to my team: “You guys are on the frontline, you’re far more knowledgeable than me about this area. Update me on what’s going on.” I see my role as intelligence gathering for the long-term good of the business. If you think my idea is awful, you should tell me! The best way is to offer an alternative. There is nothing more frustrating than someone who shoots down ideas without supplying their own. Make a case by playing to your unique vantage point – what you know of your customers, what you have learned during your time at the company and the productive working methods you’ve devised. To increase your advantage and impress your boss, it also helps to suggest a new business theory from a book you have read that he or she has not. Then, once you’ve pitched your alternative method, suggest testing it for a week or two, followed by a meeting to report results. Your idea might not work, but at least you had time to explore, learn and grow. I had a brilliant boss, Melanie, who allowed me to pursue pointless projects with a strict time frame, knowing I would see my errors and learn from the experience. Once, I tried to get the business to build a boutique curated from its many different product lines but it was impossible to try to change the buying practices at the time.

In the latest in a series of critical statements, a joint parliamentary select committee investigating the collapse of the construction firm also accused Carillion’s former leadership of making a “litany of excuses” for the demise of the construction group. The comments came as the joint inquiry being conducted by the work and pensions committee – in conjunction with the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee – published conflicting accounts of Carillion’s corporate dispute with Msheireb Properties, a Qatari customer that Carillion directors have accused of being a significant cause of the company’s collapse in January. In previous evidence, the former Carillion chief executive Richard Howson – who was sacked after a profit warning last July but kept on by the firm as an executive – said he felt like a “bailiff” while trying to collect about £200m owed for Carillion’s work on a project to redevelop downtown Doha. For their part, the Qataris have accused Howson of “misleading” the joint committee, arguing that they believe the UK company “owed Msheireb Properties a similar amount of money”. Frank Field, chair of the work and pensions committee, said: “This extraordinary exchange reinforces the impression that the upper reaches of Carillion were stocked with fantasists. It takes a special kind of optimism – that of a man kept on after his sacking to keep up morale – to classify money one hopes to earn in the future, on a challenging project, as money ‘owed’ to you. He cannot tell the difference between money he’d like to be paid, he wishes would be paid, and money that is actually owed to him.” He added: “The likes of non-executive directors and auditors are there to guide the company – and its books – back down to earth. In the case of Carillion it was, unfortunately, a crash landing.” Correspondence published by the committees illustrates the extent of the breakdown in the relationship between the two companies. Howson had previously told the committee that an accounting provision taken against the Qatar contract in June 2017 had been triggered when Msheireb had “elected to appoint a third-party contractor to complete the works, which we disagreed with, at our cost”. Msheireb wrote to MPs and stated that the switch occurred when it became “objectively clear that Carillion was unable to complete the works, and was not paying its subcontractors” and the Qataris had “little option but to hire a new contractor”, at cost to Msheireb. Rachel Reeves, chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, said: “The Carillion directors’ litany of excuses for the collapse of the company is fast unravelling. While spiralling debt problems and failing contracts signalled the alarm to almost everyone but Carillion’s directors and auditors, their former chief executive was jet-setting off to Qatar to chase a pot of gold that may never have existed. “Once again Carillion’s directors appear to have shut their eyes and ears to the real problems at the company and failed dismally to take meaningful action to avert its tragic collapse.” The exchanges emerged as another select committee inquiry into Carillion heard further evidence from former executives on Tuesday. The former finance director Emma Mercer, who had been named in Carillion board minutes released on Monday as the person who exposed the group’s problems, told the a joint hearing by the public accounts committee and the public administration and constitutional affairs committee that she didn’t consider that her intervention classified her as a “whistleblower”. Before she was promoted to the firm’s top finance role, and just six weeks after returning to the UK from a post in Canada, Mercer had raised questions last spring over the company’s accounting practices. Carillion folded in January with just £29m in cash on its balance sheet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2018/feb/27/toby-young-office-for-students-appointment-questionable-minister","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T16:53:22Z","webTitle":"Toby Young's OfS appointment was questionable – minister","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/feb/27/toby-young-office-for-students-appointment-questionable-minister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/feb/27/toby-young-office-for-students-appointment-questionable-minister","fields":{"headline":"Toby Young's OfS appointment was questionable – minister","bodyText":"The government has admitted there were “question marks” over the botched appointment of Toby Young to the board of the higher education regulator, but defended Downing Street’s blocking of candidates linked to student unions. Facing criticism in parliament over a report into nominations for the Office for Students by the public appointments watchdog, the higher education minister, Sam Gyimah, conceded there were “question marks, quite rightly, over the appointment of Toby Young”. “We have already accepted that in the case of Toby Young the due diligence fell short of what was required,” Gyimah told MPs. “Clearly, the social media vetting around Toby Young was not as extensive as it could have been, given that there were around 40,000 tweets or so,” Gyimah later said in response to questioning from Labour MPs. Young was named to the OfS board earlier this year despite a history of controversial behaviour, and a report published by the commissioner for public appointments found that he escaped scrutiny while other nominees were barred by ministers for their previous comments. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said Young had benefited from special treatment compared with the three rejected candidates for the board’s role of student representative, who were subjected to close vetting from ministers and special advisers. “One candidate was rejected on the basis of their past public statements – incredibly, this was not Toby Young. It was the student representatives, rejected due to the desire by ministers and special advisers not to appoint someone with close links to student unions,” Rayner said. After a week of controversy over his article and social media posts, and despite an extensive apology, Young withdrew from the OfS board. A spokesperson for the prime minister also defended the more in-depth vetting carried out on student nominees to the OfS board members as “routine” advice given to ministers. Asked if it was routine for ministers to blacklist candidates with union connections, the spokesperson said: “In terms of that particular case, ministers concluded that appointing student representatives who had publicly opposed the Prevent duty, or supported no-platform policies, could undermine the intended policy goals of the Office for Students.” The commissioner’s report revealed that Young was approached to apply for the post of director by the previous higher education minister, Jo Johnson. “Toby Young believed in eugenics. He made terrible remarks about disabled people, he made awful remarks about women. This is a man his predecessor thought was fine to be on the board of the Office for Students,” the Labour MP David Lammy said. “What confidence now should working-class young people across this country, under-represented groups and ethnic minorities, have in the Office for Students if we have a government where the minister who did this cannot come to the dispatch box, apologise or step down.” Lucy Powell, the Labour MP for Manchester Central, said the commissioner’s report was “absolutely damning” in showing that ministers ordered investigations into the nominees they disproved of. “The same due diligence was carried out by the same advisers on all the candidates,” Gyimah said in response, although Labour later said the report contradicted that claim. The report states: “The commissioner has found that the appointments to the board of the OfS followed an inconsistent approach in one crucial respect: there was a clear disparity in the level of due diligence performed between different types of candidates.” Gyimah also defended the involvement of No 10’s special advisers, who were revealed by the commissioner’s report to have contacted ministers with the results of their own research against three candidates. “Ministers make a judgment call, especially in decisions around recruitment, and the judgment call here – after having considered the advice from the advisory panel that had looked at the candidates and all the information – the view was that none of the three students representatives that were put forward were suitable,” he said. A spokesperson for the OfS said: “Appointments to the OfS board are a matter for the secretary of state for education. Whilst the appointment panel chaired by Sir Michael Barber made recommendations as to who to appoint, decisions were made by the secretary of state.” The report by Peter Riddell, the commissioner for public appointments, concluded that the Department for Education had made “avoidable mistakes” in rejecting the student representatives by “invoking a ‘catch-all’ generalised objection based on political views”. Sally Hunt, the general secretary of the University and College Union, said: “The new body was launched with much fanfare about representing students’ interests. The report suggests that so far it has gone out of its way to do the exact opposite.” A spokesperson for the OfS said: “Appointments to the OfS board are a matter for the secretary of state for education. Whilst the appointment panel chaired by Sir Michael Barber made recommendations as to who to appoint, decisions were made by the secretary of state.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/03/seven-year-switch-wife-swap-with-the-looming-threat-of-divorce","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-03T11:00:15Z","webTitle":"Seven Year Switch: Wife Swap with the looming threat of divorce","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/03/seven-year-switch-wife-swap-with-the-looming-threat-of-divorce","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/03/seven-year-switch-wife-swap-with-the-looming-threat-of-divorce","fields":{"headline":"Seven Year Switch: Wife Swap with the looming threat of divorce","bodyText":"“You can’t be naked around her,” rumbles Michelle darkly as her husband George packs his suitcase, ready to move in with his new wife. “And if your hands go on her arse, you won’t have hands.” Behold Seven Year Switch (Tuesday, 9.15pm, Channel 4), the latest reality TV brain-fart in which four couples whose marriages are on the rocks are dispatched to a Thai island where each of them is paired off with new spouse. The idea is to spend a fortnight in a luxury villa getting a taste of what life would be like with someone new. It is, chunters the voiceover, “a groundbreaking experiment”, which seems a bold claim given that it’s basically Wife Swap with swankier locations and the looming threat of divorce. Relationship therapist Lee Valls is on hand to provide expert analysis and, in case we were in any doubt, makes his credentials clear by leafing through CSI-style case files on participants while earnestly furrowing his brow. But Lee is not fooling anyone. Off-screen he can surely be found quietly praying for adultery. Oh, did I mention? The “twist” here is that each of the villas has just one bedroom. This probably sounded clever at the commissioning stage but, in the event, is a creepy, calculating ruse that prompts no end of awkwardness and, in one case, boiling fury (“You might as well stop recording,” fumes Tony from Essex. “That’s not on”). First, though, we’re in Blighty where, through gritted teeth, our warring couples reflect on where it is all going wrong. Michelle misses the washboard stomach and the romantic impulses of the George of yesteryear. Meanwhile George has the hump because Michelle, a stay-at-home mum, never has dinner on the table when he gets in. “A man usually goes to work, he’s the provider; the woman usually stays at home and does all the, you know, woman things,” he explains. Oh George. You don’t need a new wife; you just need a Deliveroo account. Meanwhile, in York, Rachel is exasperated with her manchild partner Tom, who, in his spare time, can be found dangling on the zipwire at the local kids’ park. When they met they were students and Tom was a barman. Ten years later, married and with a baby daughter, he’s still pulling pints. Rachel would like to see progress, ambition, and maybe even a bit more money. “I’m not asking for a Ferrari,” she says plaintively. “A car of any description would be nice.” Eagle-eyed viewers will notice that the couples have one thing in common beyond their rapacious desire to air their dirty laundry on national television, and that is young children. Now I’m no expert, but the solution seems clear and could have saved a load of heartbreak and air miles. Simply park the kids with the grandparents, go for a long walk and then spend the afternoon at the cinema (Nana nap optional). Pick up a takeaway on the way home, light a candle and scoff with a decent bottle of wine. Then go upstairs and … bask in eight hours of gloriously uninterrupted sleep. Romance restored, marriage rescued, job done. No need to thank me.

The pair are both set to compete on Wednesday at the world track championships in Apeldoorn, the Netherlands – Laura in the team pursuit and Jason in the first round of the team sprint. Neither is in a position to contest any individual events, as their time out since Rio means they have no qualifying points, although Laura won the British omnium championship in mid-February. In the longer term the significance of the moment is clear. Between them the pair boast 10 Olympic gold medals, averaging two per Games. Laura is Britain’s most prolific female Olympian with four in London and Rio, while her husband Jason, whose first Games was Beijing, has managed six; together with fellow cyclist Sir Chris Hoy, he is the joint holder of the highest number of British gold medals. Both are now on a quest to extend those records. There was little doubt about Laura’s intent to return to racing after the birth of their first child, Albert, last August. Within six weeks she was already riding a turbo trainer and beginning gym work; she received advice before and after the birth from Jessica Ennis-Hill, contacted via a mutual friend, and when her coach Paul Manning threw her into the team it was clear that she had regained form faster than expected. When Laura won the British omnium championship it implied that long term she should be competitive in a new format that has removed the timed events that favoured her so strongly. This week she should have a chance of a world title just over six months after giving birth, a spectacularly fast comeback. Jason has faced a different situation. Rumours that he had retired were persistent after Rio, although no public announcement was ever made. He confirmed last week that in fact he had decided to quit in January 2016 and was effectively going through the motions as he took gold medals at the sprint and team sprint in Brazil. “I thought he had finished,” said Laura. “He’d told me he wasn’t enjoying it any more.” “I took a year off, I didn’t have anything to do,” said Jason. “I went mountain biking, walking the dogs up mountains, just enjoying being outside. I started enjoying doing the gym again; I’d never liked the gym but take the programme away and you can do what you want. I drifted back into it.” Ironically, helping his wife to plan her comeback after Albert was born helped to inspire Jason in his turn. “We were planning for Laura’s comeback, putting all the things in place, the gym in the garage and so on. One day I saw it was the same for me [as for her]; it seems a long time when you think about having a year off but, when you’ve been doing it as long as we have, it’s not.” Discussing his retirement, Jason sounds like a man who needed a mental break. “I should have taken a few months off, but you try telling me that … When you’re in it, you can’t see anything, you’re just working to the plan. Even when you go on holiday you can’t completely switch off because you are thinking about when you will come back again. It wasn’t until I had decided I wasn’t going to compete again that I totally switched off.” All of a sudden, the British cycling team have to deal with a new set of issues based around the fact that their most prolific medallists are now a team of three with a six-month-old baby to look after. “We’re learning … there is flexibility in the programme that can allow them to train and compete but also be parents looking after a young family,” the team’s performance director, Stephen Park, said. “[But] we need to be careful it’s not one rule for one and one for others.” Albert will accompany the team to Apeldoorn; grandparents will be on hand, and he and his parents will stay in an apartment on their own away from the team hotel. That in turn has implications for such mundane – and certainly not insurmountable – matters as transport to the velodrome for training and competition, or whether the Kennys will eat meals with the team, how they will attend team meetings and so on. Comebacks and childcare put to one side, the pair jointly shake their heads over the task of clearing out their garage to create a gym, initially for Laura to train in after Albert’s birth although, as it turned out, it was for both of them. “It took some emptying,” said Jason. “We literally finished it the morning he arrived, we were hoovering it out that morning. It was a nightmare.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/01/matteo-salvini-extends-his-far-right-appeal-as-far-as-sicily","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T00:00:05Z","webTitle":"Matteo Salvini extends Northern League's appeal as far south as Sicily","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/01/matteo-salvini-extends-his-far-right-appeal-as-far-as-sicily","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/01/matteo-salvini-extends-his-far-right-appeal-as-far-as-sicily","fields":{"headline":"Matteo Salvini extends Northern League's appeal as far south as Sicily","bodyText":"It has been three years since Matteo Salvini set foot in Sicily and issued an apology on behalf of the Northern League for years of abuse directed toward southern Italians by his once separatist party, which had long dismissed them as parasites dragging down the country. It took riot police to protect him from the crowds in Palermo, who greeted him by throwing eggs and tomatoes on that visit in 2015. But when Italians head to the polls in national elections on Sunday, Salvini’s efforts to make amends in the south are likely to pay off. Campaigning now as The League – La Lega – the party is expected to win 7% or more of the vote in the region. Such a result would have been unthinkable in the 1990s, when its then leader called for the creation of a mythical-sounding state in northern Italy called Padania. Where southerners were once depicted as lazy plunderers of northern Italy’s riches, Salvini has instead cast migrants, asylum seekers and Roma gypsies as the enemy of his “Italians first” ideology. In Sicily, where resentment of EU guidelines is rife, he has homed in on two industries close to locals’ hearts – agriculture and fishing. The message is beginning to resonate. “I have embraced Salvini’s ideas. He apologised for the offences by the Lega against us Sicilians and now has become a bearer of our interests and our problems,” says Angelo Attaguile, a Lega candidate for the senate from Catania. “They attacked us for supporting a party that had offended Sicilians, but now the people agree with us and we even managed to get a deputy in the regional government elected in the last elections.” An entrepreneur and Lega supporter in Catania, Rocco Zapparrata, said it was the only party that supported products made in Italy. “Compared to all the other political leaders, Salvini has come among the people, talking to the people. Others do not,” he said. Despite the history of personal animosity between Salvini and Silvio Berlusconi, the Lega is running as part of a centre-right coalition that is headed by the former prime minister and is leading in the polls, but may fall short of winning an outright majority. Under a “gentleman’s agreement” between the two men, if the coalition wins the party with more votes within it will determine the next prime minister. Berlusconi is ineligible to serve because of a tax conviction. In an unpredictable race, Salvini is the only contender who has boasted that he will be the next occupant of Palazzo Chigi, the prime minister’s residence. Some analysts think the Lega will never be truly competitive in southern Italy, where Berlusconi and the populist Five Star Movement are jockeying for the lead, but Salvini’s performance in the south is considered one of the wildcards in the election. Whatever the outcome of Sunday’s vote, the 44-year-old has one of the brightest futures in Italian politics. Berlusconi, 81, who is more moderate on foreign policy and immigration, has dominated politics on the right for decades, but his absence would leave a vacuum that Salvini is ready to fill. In the final stretch of the campaign, Salvini has sought to downplay his xenophobia before national audiences. “Italy’s problem is not fascism, racism or communism,” he said. “It’s hunger for jobs.” He has vowed to defend Italy in Brussels and not grovel to the EU “with hat in hand”. On one of his regular television appearances recently, he compared himself to Emmanuel Macron, the French president who recently unveiled tough proposals to crack down on migrants and asylum seekers. Salvini’s rhetoric over the years makes it clear, however, that despite similarities between his call for mass deportations of migrants and Macron’s new proposals, there is a vast gulf between the two leaders on substance. Salvini has won public attention by espousing outlandish and racist views, including his support for a proposal to racially segregate trains in Milan so that seats and carriages could be reserved for the Milanese. Human rights advocates say he has damaged the country’s discourse. “Human rights do not live in a vacuum. The cultural, political and social climate are key for the enjoyment of rights in practice. The rhetoric put forward by Salvini and others is harming fundamental rights much more than certain laws can advance them,” says Francesco Palermo, an Italian senator who supports Roma gypsies’ rights. Salvini’s angry and indignant populism may well have attracted more voters if not for the League’s rivalry with Italy’s other major populist party, the anti-establishment Five Star Movement. He has also had to contend with intense friction within his own party, where more moderate voices such as that of the president of the Veneto region, Luca Zaia, compete for power. It is Salvini, however, who is credited with expanding the League’s base from about 4% in 2012 to 13% today. In Catania, Davide Cicero, a 26-year-old sports manager, notes that Sicilians have historically held important positions of power in Italian politics, including the current president, Sergio Mattarella, a native of Palermo. “None of them did important things for Sicily,” Cicero said. “So I do not care if Salvini is from the north or from the south. Salvini is much closer to the issues of Sicilians than other Sicilian politicians.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/05/ex-trump-aide-paul-manafort-approved-black-ops-to-help-ukraine-president","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T15:00:00Z","webTitle":"Ex-Trump aide Paul Manafort approved 'black ops' to help Ukraine president","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/05/ex-trump-aide-paul-manafort-approved-black-ops-to-help-ukraine-president","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/05/ex-trump-aide-paul-manafort-approved-black-ops-to-help-ukraine-president","fields":{"headline":"Former Trump aide approved 'black ops' to help Ukraine president","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort authorised a secret media operation on behalf of Ukraine’s former president featuring “black ops”, “placed” articles in the Wall Street Journal and US websites and anonymous briefings against Hillary Clinton. The project was designed to boost the reputation of Ukraine’s then leader, Viktor Yanukovych. It was part of a multimillion-dollar lobbying effort carried out by Manafort on behalf of Yanukovych’s embattled government, emails and documents reveal. The strategies included: • Proposing to rewrite Wikipedia entries to smear a key opponent of the then Ukrainian president. • Setting up a fake thinktank in Vienna to disseminate viewpoints supporting Yanukovych. • A social media blitz “aimed at targeted audiences in Europe and the US”. • Briefing journalists from the rightwing website Breitbart to attack Clinton when she was US secretary of state. Manafort’s Ukraine strategy anticipated later efforts by the Kremlin and its troll factory to use Twitter and Facebook to discredit Clinton and to help Trump win the 2016 US election. The material seen by the Guardian dates from 2011 to 2013. Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating claims of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, has indicted Manafort on multiple counts. Manafort is accused of “laundering profits” from his lobbying work in Ukraine, carried out over a period of a decade for Yanukovych and his political party. Mueller also accuses Manafort of hiring retired European politicians to lobby on behalf of Yanukovych, and paying them more than €2m (£1.74m, $2.45m) via offshore accounts. The documents reveal another surreptitious operation to influence international opinion. In 2010 Yanukovych defeated his rival Yulia Tymoshenko in presidential elections. The following summer Ukrainian prosecutors arrested Tymoshenko and put her on trial. This provoked severe criticism from the Obama administration and the EU, which accused Yanukovych of locking up Tymoshenko for political reasons. In 2011 Manafort approved a clandestine strategy to discredit Tymoshenko abroad. Alan Friedman, a former Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reporter, based in Italy, masterminded this project. Friedman has previously been accused of concealing his work as a paid lobbyist. Also involved were Rick Gates, Manafort’s then deputy, and Konstantin Kilimnik, another senior Manafort associate who the FBI believes has links to Russian military intelligence. In July 2011 Friedman sent Manafort a confidential six-page document titled Ukraine - A Digital Roadmap. It laid out a plan to “deconstruct” Tymoshenko via videos, articles and social media. Yanukovych deferred to Manafort, who gave the project the go-ahead, sources in Ukraine’s former government say. Friedman’s proposed operation was ambitious. It included producing anonymous videos attacking Tymoshenko and comparing the opposition leader to a drunk Boris Yeltsin. “The social media space offers great opportunities for guilt by association,” Friedman wrote in the document. He continued: “We know that video exists of Tymoshenko uttering some of her outrageous claims in court … The video can be floated into the social space to reinforce the impression that she is at best reckless and unstatesmanlike and at worst malicious, defamatory and antisemitic.” Twitters users, including “those ‘known’ to us”, could retweet hostile content. The “roadmap” included a website, blogposts and “blast emails”, sent out to a “targeted audience in Europe and the US”. One section was called “Black Ops”. It said: “This could include Wikipedia page modification to highlight [Tymoshenko] corruption and trial and modify the tone of the language being used.” Friedman worked with Eckart Sager, a one-time CNN producer. Emails show they liaised closely with “Paul”, who in turn briefed Yanukovych’s chief of staff, Serhiy Lyovochkin. Lyovochkin declined to comment. He appears in correspondence as “SL”. “He was under the radar,” one source said of Friedman. “Alan kept a low profile. Without Paul’s authorisation Alan would never have got a contract with the [Yanukovych] government.” Friedman’s company FBC Media was retained on a “rolling contract”. It was paid around €150,000 every three months, sources in Kiev suggest. The money was deposited in an offshore account in Seychelles, they allege. Often the payments were late, prompting Friedman to complain, they add. Contacted by the Guardian, Friedman said these earnings were “declared”. He confirmed his company worked for Ukraine from late summer 2011 on what he called “a public relations and country profiling project”. He said: “It was not a secret or covert plan. We had PR people proposing interviews and features to newspapers very openly.” He said its goal was to promote the Ukraine government’s then policy of moving closer to a partnership agreement with the EU. “Our aim was to keep a steady communication going in favour of dialogue between Brussels and Kiev. That was our message. “We never supported a pro-Moscow stance and had already ended our relationship when the Ukrainian president abandoned closer ties with Europe.” Asked whether he had registered with the US Department of Justice, Friedman said he had never worked as a lobbyist for Ukraine. He added: “I never registered as a foreign agent because I never was one. “I was a communications guy, doing PR media strategy work in Europe for a client, like dozens of London PR companies that work for a variety of governments.” The documents show Friedman reported directly to Kiev. In spring 2012 he told the foreign minister, Kostyantyn Gryshchenko, he had “generated dozens of positive op-eds/interviews/articles for print and TV” and “disseminated positive news stories” to nearly 2,000 publications. Key to this strategy was a fake thinktank, the Center for the Studyof Former Soviet Socialist Republics (CXSSR), set up with Manafort’s backing. Friedman used it to publish dozens of positive stories about Yanukovych, many of them authored by a “Matthew Lina”. Lina’s comment pieces criticising Tymoshenko and Obama’s state department ran on the conservative US website RedState. Friedman told Manafort his editorial team ghostwrote an article by Yanukovych published by the Wall Street Journal. He claimed credit for a Tymoshenko profile written by the Journal’s Matthew Kaminski. Kaminski said Friedman was never a source, “or even someone that as far as I can remember I had any contact whatsoever with”. In April 2012 Friedman sent another “highly confidential” two-page document to Manafort. It set out plans to launch a “special website” entitled The Tymoshenko Files. The site would purport to belong to Inna Bohoslovska, a Ukrainian deputy and Tymoshenko critic. In fact, Friedman would “discreetly prepare, implement and maintain” the site, the document said. It would include “ghost-penned” blogs and “a quasi-novella serialisation”. Asked about the website, Friedman said he had never written “any content”. Emails seen by the Guardian show a regular pattern of interaction between Manafort, Friedman, Gates, Kilimnik and Ukrainian officials. Gates, who went on to work with Manafort on the 2016 Trump campaign, wrote several messages. In February Gates admitted conspiracy and lying to the FBI, and agreed to cooperate with Mueller. At the time Kilimnik was the Russian manager of Manafort’s Kiev office. Kilminik is understood to be “Person A” in Mueller’s latest indictment, filed last week. It says the FBI believes Kilimnik has ties to Moscow’s GRU spy agency, and adds that Gates was aware of this. Kilimnik denies a connection. Friedman confirmed he had met Manafort and Gates but said he had done so “because the client asked me to”. Manafort’s media operation included attacks on Clinton. In October 2012 Gates emailed Manafort and Friedman, flagging a piece written by the journalist Ben Shapiro. The Breitbart article criticised Clinton for her public support of Tymoshenko, who had recently made an electoral pact with the far-right Svoboda party. The article cited a Jewish “leader” who accused Clinton anonymously of creating a “neo-Nazi Frankenstein”. Gates wrote: “Gentlemen – Here is the first part of a series of articles that will be coming as we continue to build this effort. Alan, you get full credit for the Frankenstein comment.” The alleged use of offshore accounts is likely to interest the FBI. Manafort is accused of concealing more than $75m earned from his work in Ukraine. Yanukovych’s attempts to woo western leaders ended in October 2013 when he accepted a bailout from Moscow. He fled to Russia after anti-government protests. In 2015 Friedman wrote an authorised biography of Silvio Berlusconi. Manafort continued to work for Yanukovych’s party up until he joined Trump’s campaign. Manafort denies wrongdoing and has said he will fight Mueller’s charges."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/feb/27/late-night-hosts-on-trumps-parkland-comments","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T16:09:53Z","webTitle":"Late-night hosts on Trump's Parkland comments: 'We already know how you react to combat'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/feb/27/late-night-hosts-on-trumps-parkland-comments","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/feb/27/late-night-hosts-on-trumps-parkland-comments","fields":{"headline":"Late-night hosts on Trump's Parkland comments: 'We already know how you react to combat'","bodyText":"Late-night hosts on Monday discussed president Trump’s suggestion to arm teachers in the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, and his comments regarding how he would have acted had he been at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High. “Trump met with the nation’s governors and at the top of the agenda, of course, was the urgent problem of school shootings,” Stephen Colbert said, referring to a summit held at the White House. “Donald Trump has said that maybe we should arm teachers. This idea has not been received well by people who have had or been a teacher.” Showing footage of Trump doubling down on his suggestion to arm teachers particularly adept with guns, Colbert said: “If you’re in the pocket of the NRA like he is, the solution is never fewer guns. The solution is always more guns. Then again, the school in Florida did have an armed sheriff deputy, and even with guns and training he didn’t enter the building, nor did the next three armed deputies who showed up.” “Who among us could honestly say what they think they would do in that situation?,” Colbert asked. He then showed a clip of Trump, at the event with the nation’s governors, saying, “I’d run in there even if I didn’t have a weapon.” “There’s a lot in there that I doubt, but the part I really don’t believe is that he can run,” Colbert responded. “Sir, we already know how you react to combat situations. You got five deferments from Vietnam!” Trevor Noah also tore into Trump for saying he would have entered the high school unarmed. “While the shooting was happening, an armed deputy stayed outside the school doing nothing,” Noah said, before showing footage of various pundits and lawmakers sharply criticizing the deputy for his “unconscionable” inaction. “Damn, that was harsh,” the host said. “That was like hearing the white people version of ‘Fuck the police.’” “For some people, this shows exactly why there’s no point in arming teachers, because if a trained officer didn’t come to the rescue, then how is Mrs Flanderson going to do any better?,” Noah explained, before noting that there’s no cure-all to the country’s epidemic of gun violence. “Here’s what frustrates me about this gun violence discussion. ‘It’s the guns! No, it’s the cops! Maybe it’s both?,’” Noah said. “Maybe with training, the deputy would have known how to go into the situation while keeping himself relatively safe? But maybe with better gun laws, once the deputy did go into the school, he wouldn’t have to face a teenager with an AR-15?” “There’s no one solution that will solve all shootings. Except for this one solution,” the host said, before showing Trump extolling how he’d respond to the situation. “To be fair, if Donald Trump ran into a school during a shooting, I do believe he would actually stop the shooting,” Noah joked. “How distracting would that be? He’d be like, ‘That’s right, it’s me, Donald Trump. I don’t have a gun, but what I do have is an amazing electoral college victory.’” Finally, Seth Meyers also discussed the administration’s response to the country’s reckoning with guns, and the attacks on the students of Stoneman Douglas. “The immediate crisis facing Trump and the rest of the government right now is our country’s epidemic of gun violence,” Meyers said. “The national conversation over gun safety had only intensified in the days since the Parkland shooting. And people are demanding action.” “In response to those demands, Trump has spent the last week or so rambling nonsensically about his truly deranged idea to arm teachers,” Meyers said, showing a clip from Monday’s White House event comparing a deft handler of firearms to someone who consistently makes four-foot putts. “Even when he’s laying out his plan to prevent school shootings, he can’t hide how much he’d rather be playing golf,” Meyers joked. “The only reason we’re still talking about the issue of gun violence is because of the students at Stonemason Douglas high school, who have demanded action and sparked a national movement for gun reform.” Meyers went on to note that, as a result of their outspokenness, the Parkland students have been subjected to attacks on their credibility and tone. The host mentioned Sarah Chadwick, a survivor of the shooting who tweeted, “We should change the name of AR-15s to Marco Rubio because they are so easy to buy.” “Damn, that is a white-hot burn,” Meyers said, before detailing Fox News anchor Laura Ingraham’s response. “How teens speak to and abt adults,” Ingraham wrote, referring to Chadwick as a “Stoneman Douglas sophomore.” The student responded to Ingraham’s tweet: “I’m a junior.” “Laura Ingraham, what is wrong with you?,” Meyers said. “Don’t go after teenagers on social media. You saw what happened to Marco Rubio.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/shortcuts/2018/feb/27/stacey-dash-dionne-clueless-running-congress-republicans","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T15:26:27Z","webTitle":"From Dionne to DC: Clueless star and Trump fan Stacey Dash is running for Congress","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/shortcuts/2018/feb/27/stacey-dash-dionne-clueless-running-congress-republicans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/shortcuts/2018/feb/27/stacey-dash-dionne-clueless-running-congress-republicans","fields":{"headline":"From Dionne to DC: Clueless star and Trump fan Stacey Dash is running for Congress","bodyText":"Name: Stacey Dash. Age: 51. Appearance: Remarkably unchanged in 20-odd years. I’m sure she looks familiar. Well, she’s an actor. You might remember her from the 1995 high-school comedy Clueless. Yes, I do remember her from that! I loved Clueless! In that case, you will also remember that she played Dionne Davenport, Cher’s best friend, the one who learns to drive. She also delivers the best one-liner in the film during a tennis lesson. Of course. What’s Dionne been up to for, um, the past 23 years? Oh, you know, this and that. Lots of TV, including the Clueless TV series. There was a reality show called Celebrity Circus. Lately, she has been a host and contributor on Fox News. Uh-oh … Uh-huh. She was reportedly known by Fox’s former boss Roger Ailes as “the black girl”. Then Fox let her go last year. Poor Dionne! Stacey. Her name is Stacey Dash. Whatever her name is, I’ll join her in the struggle against the patriarchy. I’m not sure you will. You see, Dash is rather unusual among Hollywood actors – let alone African-American actors – in being an avowed supporter of President Trump. And now she is running for office herself. To be president? Well, to be the congresswoman for California’s 44th district, to begin with. She has submitted papers putting herself forward to be the Republican candidate at the midterms later this year. Her slogan will be “Dash to DC”. Of course it will. So do I have to stop liking her? That depends on your politics. Dash supported Obama in 2008, then switched to Romney in 2012. In 2016, she became well known for her opposition to Black History Month and the BET awards for minorities. This is like Scott Baio all over again. Oh, she’s better than Baio. He spreads conspiracy theories about the Sandy Hook school shooting. She just thinks awards for minorities are a type of self-segregation. So she is the perfect candidate! She can appeal to liberals and conservatives alike! Ye-es. Either that, or nobody will like her. Do say: “So they were all, ‘How would you tackle partisan redistricting?’ And I was like, ‘Whatever.’” Don’t say: “A Republican winning a district that went 83% to Hillary two years ago is way unlikely.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/feb/27/right-to-be-forgotten-claimant-wants-to-rewrite-history-says-google","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T15:43:52Z","webTitle":"'Right to be forgotten' claimant wants to rewrite history, says Google","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/27/right-to-be-forgotten-claimant-wants-to-rewrite-history-says-google","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/feb/27/right-to-be-forgotten-claimant-wants-to-rewrite-history-says-google","fields":{"headline":"'Right to be forgotten' claimant wants to rewrite history, says Google","bodyText":"A businessman who has launched a legal bid to remove some search results about his criminal conviction in the first “right to be forgotten” case in the English courts should not be allowed to rewrite history, lawyers for Google have said. The claimant, referred to only as NT1 for legal reasons, was convicted of conspiracy to account falsely in the late 1990s and wants Google to remove results that mention his case, including web pages published by a national newspaper. Representing NT1, Hugh Tomlinson QC, chairman of the press regulation campaign Hacked Off, told the high court that the presence of the articles caused “distress and upset”. In 2014 the European Union’s court of justice ruled that “irrelevant” and outdated data should be erased on request. Since then, Google has received requests to remove at least 2.4m links from search results. Search engines can reject applications if they believe the public interest in accessing the information outweighs a right to privacy. But Antony White QC, representing Google, said the “right to be forgotten” ruling was “not a right to rewrite history or ... tailor your past if that’s what this claimant would like to use it for”. White said the business malpractice that gave rise to NT1’s conviction was “serious and sustained”. “It involved deceptive and misleading criminal practices,” he said, that led to regulatory interventions and condemnation in parliament. White told the court the businessman had portrayed himself as a “respected businessman” with a successful career on social media and in a series of blog posts, on a blog containing information about his business and financial background. The posts create a “false picture” and if his right to be forgotten claim succeeds he would continue to “mislead”. Tomlinson told the court the businessman was not a public figure and now made a living on commercial lending and funding a property developer. “Before anyone meets a new person these days they Google them,” Tomlinson told the court. He said “many people engage in misdeeds when they are young or in the past” and if the misdeeds are “constantly brought to the attention of others then they will permanently have a negative effect”. The conviction is now spent, Tomlinson said, and the law is designed to allow for the rehabiliation of offenders so they can go on to lead normal lives. The high court case, which is expected to last five days, will be monitored by convicted criminals and others who want embarrassing stories erased from the web. Google’s refusal to erase two links to newspaper articles referencing the businessman’s conviction led to Tuesday’s hearing. The businessman, who is represented by the law firm Carter-Ruck, gave evidence to the court on Tuesday about the founding of the controversial property company which he had an interest in. The company was subject to a regulatory sanction before being wound up. Another “right to be forgotten” claim against Google is to be heard by the high court next month. The person in that case was convicted of conspiracy to intercept communications over a decade ago. •This article was edited to clarify that the legal action refers to the delisting of Google search results rather than the removal of articles."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/28/britain-national-parks-reclaim-rewild","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T06:00:09Z","webTitle":"Britain’s national parks are a farce: they’re being run for a tiny minority | George Monbiot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/28/britain-national-parks-reclaim-rewild","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/28/britain-national-parks-reclaim-rewild","fields":{"headline":"Britain’s national parks are a farce: they’re being run for a tiny minority","bodyText":"Visit any national park in Britain and ask yourself what you are seeing. Is it the “wild”, “unspoilt” landscape the brochures and display boards promised? Or is it eerily bereft of wildlife and rich ecosystems? Is it managed in the interests of the nation or for a tiny, privileged minority? I suspect that if we saw such places called national parks in another country, we would recognise them for what they are: a complete farce. One of the reasons for this dire state is burning. Much of the land in our national parks is systematically burned, with the blessing of the agencies supposed to protect it. This vandalism is sometimes justified as a “conservation tool”, but it bears as much relationship to the conservation of wildlife as burning libraries bears to the conservation of books. So weird has our engagement with nature in this country become that we can no longer tell the difference between protection and destruction. On Dartmoor and Exmoor, the national park authorities and the National Trust, charged with protecting the land, instead torch it to favour sheep. In the national parks of central and northern England and Scotland, this arson is conducted on behalf of another species: red grouse. Burning by grouse estates roasts reptiles, small mammals, insects and tree seedlings. Research conducted at Leeds University shows that it also damages and dries out peat, raises the acidity of rivers, and could increase the risk of flooding downstream. But the amount of burning, which produces young heather shoots for the grouse to eat, has been increasing exponentially: according to one study, by 11% a year. The management of grouse moors is intensifying, to give the select group of people who shoot them as many targets as possible. In some places, the burning is accompanied by mass killing of birds of prey, weasels, stoats, foxes, badgers, pine martens, domestic cats, and other predators. The continued disappearance of hen harriers, golden eagles, peregrine falcons and other raptors when they cross grouse moors is no mystery. A study on Langholm Moor in Scotland discovered that when the persecution of birds of prey ceases, grouse numbers drop below the point at which driven shooting is economically viable. (Driven grouse shooting involves clients waiting in shelters, called butts, while lines of workers chase the birds over their heads). Though it is illegal to trap, shoot and poison birds of prey in this country, the economic model depends on these practices. Don’t expect any help from the statutory agencies. Natural England, the government body charged with defending wildlife and ecosystems, behaves as if it were a subsidiary of the grouse shooting industry. The formidable conservationist Mark Avery has produced a long catalogue of this agency’s collusion: granting grouse moors consent for the killing of protected birds; removing hen harrier chicks from their nests; supporting the roads the estate owners build to take their clients to the shooting areas; refusing to release the results of its study on hen harriers. Nor should you expect much help from other groups. In 2016, after a video of a man trying to kill hen harriers on its property caused a furore, the National Trust revoked the grouse-shooting lease on its land in the Peak District national park. But last year, to general astonishment, it advertised for new grouse-shooting tenants. It brushed aside a petition by local people to rewild the land instead. It dismissed an offer by Derbyshire Wildlife Trust to manage the land without grouse shooting. When I asked why it had made this decision, the trust said it wanted “to explore whether less intensive forms of grouse shooting can be compatible with and help deliver the nature conservation aims of our High Peak Moors vision”. But this experiment has been conducted, at Langholm Moor, and it showed that you can have either a rich ecosystem or grouse shooting, but not both. The natural population density of red grouse in the wild, according to a study published in the journal Ibis, is between 0.2 and 20 birds per square kilometre. But for a driven grouse shoot to be viable, it needs far more birds: the average on grouse estates in England is 325 per square kilometre. Such densities are impossible without burning, draining and the mass killing of predators. This and its recent decision on trail hunting suggest to me that the National Trust is funded by the many but answers to the few. It arose from the Commons Preservation Society, founded in 1865, whose purpose was to protect society from the aristocracy. But under the disastrous leadership of the socialite James Lees-Milne (from 1936 to 1950), its role was reversed: it came to protect the aristocracy from society. It has, it seems, yet to recover. So where do we turn? The RSPB? Sadly, no. First, it joined the government’s Hen Harrier Action Plan, despite repeated warnings by other conservationists that this was nothing but greenwash. Eventually the RSPB twigged, and withdrew in disgust. But, having learned nothing from this episode, it now supports a petition to “license driven grouse shooting”. You might as well call for licensing river pollution. Worse, this effort undermines and confuses a more popular petition that other conservationists have launched: to ban driven grouse shooting. Is a brave, unflinching conservation movement too much to ask for in this country? No. Independent campaigners are stepping in where the big groups fear to tread. With their help, the demand for rewilding, a fringe interest when I published Feral five years ago, is now becoming impossible to ignore. A few weeks ago, the ecologist Alex Lees published an online poster on a topic that might strike you as recondite: the bird life of the Peak District. Half the poster showed the birds that currently exist there; the other half showed the birds he would like to see. It has so far been viewed 140,000 times. On his list of missing or suppressed species are goshawks, hen harriers, golden eagles, black grouse and capercaillie, all of which once lived in the Peak District. We could go further: cranes, storks and pelicans are also native British birds that could, if we allow its wrecked ecosystems to recover, be reintroduced. So, one day, could wildcats, lynx, moose and other missing mammals. This summer two new books, Isabella Tree’s Wilding and Ben MacDonald’s Rebirding, will reinforce the case. But none of it will happen in our national parks until they are managed for the benefit of all, rather than a tiny, privileged group. As the environment secretary, Michael Gove, launches a consultation on the future of farming, we need a similar discussion on conservation. If the big groups won’t lead it, others will. And then, perhaps, we could have some parks worthy of the name."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/27/the-guardian-view-on-technology-and-language-accommodate-diversity","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T18:32:37Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on technology and language: accommodate diversity | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/27/the-guardian-view-on-technology-and-language-accommodate-diversity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/27/the-guardian-view-on-technology-and-language-accommodate-diversity","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on technology and language: accommodate diversity","bodyText":"No language is an island, but Icelandic tries. To keep alive its rich culture it has built linguistic defences to prevent erosion from outside influence. Yet the technological revolution of recent years has seen Iceland submerged by a rising tide of English. As one researcher told our reporter: “Now on phones, tablets, computers, TVs, there are countless games, films, series, videos, songs. You converse with Google Home or Alexa. All in English.” At least a score more European languages, repositories of history and culture, face the same problem. Technology ought to be able to accommodate – even encourage – the rich variety of global communication. But this raises a wider question about modern-day nation states: can they encompass a multiplicity of languages and still appear coherent? In the European context a single dominant language was historically seen as the indispensable glue that keeps citizens together. It would be wrong to think that languages do not have political purposes. They do. Obviously the dominant narratives that emerge from a people, and the language used to express them, influence the way a society views itself and forms its priorities. It is how we accommodate the languages within borders that is important. Europeans fear being scattered by a babel of tongues, yet the EU, where nations cooperate, has defied historical experience. The heterogeneity of the EU’s geographic community is a lesson worth learning. Instead of thinking that a nation is only unified by one language, a modern-day nationalism would represent its semantic diversity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"news/2018/feb/27/guardian-weekly-coral-reefs","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T15:41:17Z","webTitle":"Inside the 2 March edition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/feb/27/guardian-weekly-coral-reefs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/feb/27/guardian-weekly-coral-reefs","fields":{"headline":"Inside the 2 March edition","bodyText":"It’s been many years since I last went diving on a coral reef (Britain’s North Sea coast is strangely lacking in such oceanic wonders), but each time I have been fortunate enough to do so, it has been a life-affirming experience to rank alongside the finest. For many nearby communities, these beautiful marine habitats are important tourist revenue generators, but coral reefs are also vital to the ecosystem. They protect coastlines from wave action and tropical storms; provide homes for thousands of marine species; and generate nutrients for food chains. Now they are under grave threat from several factors including development, environmental degradation and bleaching from rising sea temperatures. Roughly 75% of the world’s coral reefs currently face danger, with scientists predicting more than 90% could be gone by 2050. That’s why the Guardian Weekly’s cover this week goes to Thailand and the Philippines where authorities are so concerned, that they are considering banning tourists from some of their coral reefs to allow them to recover. Can it work, or is it too little too late? The Guardian and Observer’s new south-east Asia correspondent, Hannah Ellis-Petersen, reports. Elsewhere in the news pages we reflect on another horrific week in Syria, look ahead to crucial elections in Italy, investigate the mysterious abduction of a Hong Kong bookseller in China, and hear why US teachers are not keen on Donald Trump’s plan to arm them in the wake of the country’s latest school gun massacre. The Weekly Review goes to Dubai, where plans are afoot to revive a chintzy mega-tourist resort built on artificial islands which are modelled on the Earth’s continents. What could possibly go wrong? And Shaun Walker, the Guardian’s outgoing Moscow correspondent, looks back on his time living in a Russia that has changed immeasurably in the 18 years since he first set foot in the country. The Discovery pages consider China’s increasing advances in the science world, while Books considers important gains made in the field of immunology. Sport reflects on the most memorable moments from the 2018 Winter Olympics, and soaks up the characteristically understated mood of joy in Norway, which finished top of the medals table. On the back page George Monbiot rounds things off with an impassioned rallying call for social communities as bringers of human wellbeing, drawing on the particular example of Frome in south-west England. Frome is not a town I’ve visited before but after reading George’s piece, it’s on my list of places to go. As some late winter snow falls outside our London offices, I somehow suspect I will make it there long before I get to visit my next coral reef.

Instead, it was a photocall for this week’s preview of New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art’s forthcoming exhibition Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination, which will feature ecclesiastical items with designs by labels including Lanvin and Chanel, to demonstrate the influence of Catholicism on fashion. Going from the sacred to the profane might sound like an uneasy aesthetic shift, but there is a long history of items worn by those in the pulpit being reworked for those in the congregation. Cristóbal Balenciaga was famously influenced by the robes worn by priests, while Italian designers ranging from Dolce &amp; Gabbana to Antonio Berardi have referenced Roman Catholic tropes. Before the Met’s exhibition opens in May, here are five moments where fashion and Catholicism became a holy alliance. Alexander McQueen, Joan, 1998 Alexander McQueen, it’s fair to say, was attracted to the dramatic side of life – so the Catholic church was always going to be his thing. For his autumn/winter 1998 show, he took Joan of Arc – the Catholic martyr – as inspiration. The show involved chain mail, cardinal-style jackets and ended with a model in a ring of fire. Jean Paul Gaultier couture, 2007 The inventor of Madonna’s conical bra and wearer of kilts on late-night TV, Jean-Paul Gaultier is a designer who loves to play with tradition. In 2007, the Catholic church was in focus in his couture collection, which had models wearing halos, sacred hearts and dresses that looked like stained glass. Some models were walking religious icons, with gold headdresses, while there were several in the Virgin Mary’s blue. Nicki Minaj with ‘pope’ at the Grammys, 2012 Before 2018’s white roses, the Grammys red carpet was an anything-goes space. Into that, in 2012, came Nicki Minaj, dressed in a red Versace robe, with a “pope” as her escort, providing divine assistance for Minaj to slay the other red-carpet competition – arguably a hard ask during a year in which other attendees included Katy Perry, with blue hair to match her dress, and a woman with a Terminator-style arm. Dolce &amp; Gabbana, AW18 The Italian fashion duo have often referred to the look of Catholicism, with Dolce’s Sicilian childhood a particular source of inspiration. Their most recent show might have been most notable for the handbag-wielding drones, but the clothes once again explored the more traditional world of the Catholic church: models wore papal purple, jackets with ornate crucifixes and cardinal’s robes. The Prada Pope, 2005-2013 Pope Benedict XVI was a sartorial gamechanger, bringing back ornate robes to the Papal wardrobe. A snap of his red shoes that resembled slip-ons designed by Prada went around the internet in 2007, and he was nicknamed the “Prada Pope”. It later emerged that the shoes were, in fact, designed by his personal cobbler Adriano Stefanelli, allowing the Vatican to issue possibly the most alpha correction ever: “The pope is not dressed by Prada but by Christ.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/mar/04/joan-jonas-video-art-pioneer-tate-modern-exhibition-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T09:00:42Z","webTitle":"Joan Jonas: ‘You don’t know what you’re doing sometimes.

You just begin’","bodyText":"At the beginning of the 21st century, New York’s SoHo has become just another shopping mall, Guess cosying up to Banana Republic, Dean &amp; DeLuca arm in arm with Bloomingdale’s. Walking its streets, it’s impossible to believe that any artists live or work here now, let alone the kind who knew it back in the day, when it was all rusty factories and wild “happenings”. And yet they do. Behind a door in Mercer Street is an elevator that takes you up to the loft of the performance artist Joan Jonas, a space where she has lived and worked since the early 70s. To open this door, and to ride this elevator, is discombobulating: it’s time travel, of a kind. Surrounded by the dozens of objects she has accumulated over the decades – a realm of authenticity that includes pebbles, baskets, bowls, dolls and masks – you feel suddenly ashamed of the long minutes you just spent staring at the windows of the Prada store that stands on the site of the old SoHo Guggenheim. It’s a sensation that isn’t exactly eased by Jonas herself, a coiled spring of a person with tousled grey hair and a veritable shadow of a poodle called Ozu, which barks proprietorially every time her hand loosens on its lead. She dislikes doing interviews, and her somewhat minimalist answers, at least at first, give me the strong sense that my questions are as dumb as any she has ever been asked. Add to this the essential problem that, like most of those who come to talk to her, I have seen her performances only in photographs (as she and I will discuss later, there is a sense in which her work can be said not really to exist beyond the moment of its production), and the potential for misunderstanding would seem to be bigger even than this vast room. Oh, well. At least I know the way out. Later this month, a major survey of Jonas’s work – the largest ever presented in the UK – will open at Tate Modern. It will include an immersive gallery exhibition, in which some of her installations and items from her personal collections will be displayed, and a 10-day live performance programme in the Tanks in which Jonas, now in her early 80s, will appear on two occasions (she will perform Mirage, a piece from 1976 that makes use of chalk and a blackboard; other works, including iterations of the famous Mirror Pieces from 1968-71, will be performed by younger collaborators whom she will, in effect, direct). The idea is that this show will reveal Jonas, whose name is not well known in Britain, as a pioneering figure whose way with a video camera – she was the first artist to incorporate live video feeds into her work – seems newly relevant in this, the era of the selfie and the smartphone. Is she excited about the show? “It’s hard to be excited,” she says, giving me a look. “I have so much to do.” In any case, the years have done little to change the anxiety involved in performing. “Confidence is totally important,” she says. “You have to be confident to get up in front of an audience, or to be able to give the illusion of it. I still get a little nervous. If I do a bad performance, I feel awful for weeks.” What about if she does a good one? “If it works out… I can’t say it’s satisfying, but it is fulfilling.” Is she aware that in photographs of her performances, she gives the impression of immense power, that she seems almost to be the size of a giant? (When the lift doors opened, I could not believe my eyes; she is tiny.) At last, the ghost of a smile. “Other people have said the same thing. But that’s what happens when you’re photographed. You’re not you. I was just in Jamaica, and I met Grace Jones, and she is not tall at all. She’s only a little bigger than me.” How did she come to meet Jones? She flaps her hand dismissively. “Oh, we don’t have to go into that.” The last few years have, she agrees, been good ones for her: the Tate retrospective follows the 2015 Venice Biennale, at which she represented the US (her show was described by the New York Times as a “triumph”). “I didn’t expect to be in this position,” she says. “I’ve always been a little on the edge of the art world, albeit purposely in the beginning, when I was using different spaces, trying to avoid the white cube of the gallery. And it is wonderful to be recognised.” But it is also important to keep working – “it’s what keeps us alive” – and for this reason she is wary of the tendency to describe her as the godmother of performance art. “If I thought of myself like that, I wouldn’t be able to function. I’m pleased with the effect I’ve had on other artists, and on the students I’ve taught. But I can’t put myself in some exalted category. It’s important not to slip into repetition.” Is there really much danger of that? It’s hard to imagine there is. As the painter Susan Rothenberg once put it, hers is an “excruciatingly odd” kind of a mind. You never quite know what she will do next. Jonas was born in Manhattan in 1936, and grew up there and on Long Island. Neither of her parents, who separated when she was six, worked for a living – her father, who lived on a boat, was a failed writer – and she won’t tell me how they funded themselves (perhaps some private money was involved). But they and her wider family had artistic leanings that seem to have rubbed off on their daughter, whom they would also enrol in a progressive school on the Upper East Side where the days began with the children being asked what they wanted to do. Her mother, a keen collector of things, took her to galleries and the opera, and her father introduced her to poetry; a great uncle made dioramas, and an aunt was a painter. Her step-parents, too, were influential. She got her love of magic shows from her stepfather, a jazzman who was also a talented amateur magician; her stepmother had a sister who knew, among other artists, Gorky and de Kooning. (Jonas was never introduced to either of them, but their spirit was somehow in the air.) “I knew I wanted to be an artist from the age of five or six,” she says. “And my father encouraged it, perhaps because he had been disappointed himself artistically. But it wasn’t until I was in my 20s that I knew I could be one. It took me a long time to get there, as a woman.” Having studied sculpture at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Jonas returned to New York to attend Columbia as a postgraduate, this time with a husband in tow; it was through Gerry Jonas, to whom she was married for five years (she has never remarried), that she came to hear about the various excitements that were then going on downtown (Gerry’s Yale friend Henry Geldzahler, the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s first curator of contemporary art, would call the writer Calvin Trillin to let him know what was happening, and Trillin would in turn call the Jonases) . And as her interest in dance, music and the strange happenings then being staged by artists such as Claes Oldenburg and Robert Whitman grew, so did her dissatisfaction with her own Giacometti-like sculptures. “I was lucky to see those things, and they affected me deeply, so I switched to performance,” she says, as if it was the simplest thing in the world. And she destroyed all her sculptures? “Yes, and I’m not sorry I did.” Did this change feel daring? “I didn’t feel so, no. I was driven by my interests. I’d always liked poetry and films; I saw what I was about to do as related to their structure.” She didn’t worry, particularly, about how she would make a living. At first, her husband supported her; later, she found ways of supporting herself, working in a gallery and as a proofreader for the New York Review of Books. Sometimes there were grants, too. “I survived all those years. I just had to be careful to live within my means.” She didn’t use the word “performance” at first: “I called them pieces.” Her first fully realised piece was Oad Lau, in 1968, in which she and another performer, dressed in costumes to which small mirrors had been glued, walked stiffly back and forth across a New York gymnasium in parallel lines (she was all the while reciting passages from Jorge Luis Borges’s Labyrinths). Meanwhile, five other performers (friends and fellow artists) built a string structure on which sheets of plastic were laid; it blew in the breeze generated by some large electric fans. This performance, which ended with the structure being pulled down, involved many of what would become her motifs: choreography; a sense of ritual; an engagement with nature (the plastic sheets suggested a watering place or pond); above all, an interest in mirrors. It was intensely precise, but it was also highly contingent, and its meaning, as opposed to its effects, remained largely obscure. (I’ve yet to find someone who can talk or write about Jonas’s early work in a way that makes sense of it; those who were there at the time are not, alas, the ones compiling the catalogues or curating the shows, nor does it seem to have occurred to them to find and interview those who were.) After this, she was on her way. In the course of the next few years, she made some of the work for which she is probably still best known. The Mirror Pieces [1968-71] involved groups of women moving in tightly choreographed patterns as they carried full-length mirrors, the first batch of which she had picked up at a five and dime store; or, in the case of Mirror Check, a naked Jonas inspecting every part of her body with a small hand mirror. In Organic Honey’s Visual Telepathy [1972], she performed as her masked erotic double, Organic Honey, wearing an extraordinary feathered head-dress as she engaged in repetitive activities that riffed on female narcissism (by this point, she had been to Japan, where she had bought her first video camera; the audience, then, was able to watch both the performance and a live feed of it, a juxtaposition she loved). “I was very involved with changing my appearance, and observing myself, and the persona I was creating,” she says. “Dancers look at mirrors, and I had taken workshops with dancers. One thing that interested me, it still does, is that [in these pieces] the audience is reflected in the mirrors; what gave it all an edge was that they felt uneasy. You don’t want other people to see you looking. It’s the taboo of the mirror. Visually, also, the mirror breaks up a space; your perception of it changes.” These pieces have things to say about the perception of women’s bodies, and about the tension between what is public and what is private (well, this is my interpretation of them). Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that at the time she made them, Jonas was a member of a women’s group. “It had a big effect on my life,” she says. “The whole [women’s liberation] movement did. Our group was small. We had a lot of pent-up anger about the whole situation. [We went in for] self-examination, and for revealing intimate aspects of one’s sensibilities. Organic Honey’s Visual Telepathy was all about asking the question: what is the feminine? I was concerned with the roles women play.” Did she feel vulnerable making this work, particularly Mirror Check? “It seemed to other people I had made myself vulnerable, but it really wasn’t the case. It wasn’t autobiographical. Also, I was protected by the distance from the audience, and in my work, no one breaks the wall – or they haven’t so far. I don’t know any performance artists who have been heckled.” In the beginning, her audiences were small, and they were composed of people she knew: other artists, curators, musicians. Now, they’re bigger, more diverse and more receptive (there seems to be a real hunger for performance art at the moment – witness the popularity of Marina Abramović’s show 512 Hours at the Serpentine Gallery in 2014). What’s strange, though, is that Jonas doesn’t feel the audience changes the work from performance to performance. There is a sense in which, in spite of what she has just said about the crowd seeing itself in the mirror, she doesn’t care about it at all. In this way, if no other, her practice is very different from that of a theatre director, or an actor. As the years went by, the work grew richer, her frame of references wider. She moved away from the site-specific and into gallery spaces, which is how she came to start making installations, as a kind of pendant to the performance itself. The Juniper Tree (1976), which told the story of an evil stepmother using, among other things, wooden balls and a ladder, was inspired by the Grimm brothers’ Fairy Tales and Bruno Bettelheim’s book, The Uses of Enchantment, which applied Freudian psychology to them. Lines in the Sand (2002) was inspired by HD’s [Hilda Doolittle] poem Helen in Egypt, and deployed some of the marvellous photographs Jonas’s grandmother had taken when she visited the country in 1900. Reanimation (2010-13) has its source in the novel Under the Glacier by the Icelandic writer Halldór Laxness. “There is a continuity in the work,” she says. “And sometimes one thing segues into the next. But I always try to choose a new subject or form. Sometimes, you don’t know what you’re doing. You just begin. One piece, Funnel [from 1974], began with a cone. It evolved entirely from that. The set was cone-shaped, and I used cones as props.” How long does the process take? “About a year, usually.” How does she know when something is finished? “There is no one finished product.” This takes us to some of the tricky issues around performance art, whose intangibility presents something of a problem in an art world that fetishises objects. I wonder: does a reconstruction (I would call it a reproduction if that word didn’t seem so loaded in context) of a piece have the same value as it did originally, or is something lost in translation? And what about if it is performed by a collaborator, rather than by Jonas herself? Is it still the same? Above all, how firmly must she stick to what we might call her original rubric? (I’ve seen pictures of the typescripts of the directions involved in her early performances; they read a bit like something out of Pinter.) She thinks for a minute. “The Mirror Piece, which I will do at Tate: I have reconstructed it before, at the Guggenheim in New York. I took all my old photographs and all my old directions, and I based it on those. I find it very interesting seeing it now. I enjoy it. But it is a slightly new version, yes. These things can never be the same as they were, never, never.” The Tate will also stage Song Delay, an outdoor piece from 1973 (it will be performed by collaborators; Jonas will not participate). “We will do it by the Thames at low tide, a site quite different from where it was originally performed. It’s a new work, based on old work, with the same props and movements.” It takes me a moment to notice that she hasn’t really answered my questions. But perhaps, for her, they are unanswerable – matters to be left to the critics and the theorists. The 80s were difficult, she admits. Art was suddenly all about money, and painting, and her work “kind of disappeared… it wasn’t quite the same for a while.” But the 90s were good, she says – as they were for many female artists of her generation. She no longer feels, as she used to, that the art world is overly masculine. “When I went to art school, there were no women teachers. Now there are many. It’s still harder for women: men get more shows. But there are some very strong women out there now: Barbara Kruger [the American conceptual artist and collagist], Louise Lawler [the photographer, also American].” What does she make of #MeToo? (At the time of our interview, allegations of harassment have been made against the dealer and collector Anthony d’Offay, and the publisher of Artforum, Knight Landesman.) “It’s like a revolution, and it’s very important, a necessary explosion. The only thing I criticise is the lack of due process. I don’t think it is fair to be accused and taken down without one.” I wonder what she’s like to work with. Is she collaborative or tyrannical? “In between,” she says, barely missing a beat. “I am forceful. But with something like the Tate, I don’t have time to do everything, so I will have to rely on the judgments of others.” Will she mind what the critics say? “You can’t help caring. Art is communication.” Her escape hatch is Nova Scotia, where she has a house and a studio, and spends her summers. “It’s important. I like to be in the country, and I do a lot of work up there… the freedom.” Yes, SoHo has changed beyond all recognition. But she won’t move, not now: that would be too big an undertaking. “I still like the buildings early in the morning and late at night, and there are still places like this [she gestures at the windows, today’s thin winter light streaming through them and on to the little white models of the gallery spaces at Tate Modern]. A lot of us are still here.” Is it lonely, though? Her assistant has just arrived, but a practice like hers involves a certain amount of necessary seclusion. “Sometimes,” she says, “but not often. I have many friends, I collaborate.” She looks at her hands, her long fingers. “I don’t worry about whether my work is right any more, but I do still constantly have to think: is this working? Is this any good?” Joan Jonas is at Tate Modern from 14 Mar-5 Aug and is performing as part of BMW Tate Live from 16-25 March.

There are no legal protections for people sleeping rough in England during severe weather, but most councils offer extra beds when temperatures are forecast to drop below 0C for three consecutive nights. A survey by the charity Homeless Link found that last winter 118 local authorities provided “severe weather and extended winter provision” (SWEP) to 2,793 people. On Monday night, 86 rough sleepers used emergency shelters in Manchester, the first major metropolitan area in the country to promise help as soon as the the temperature drops below 0C. The provision has been triggered 12 times in Manchester this winter, over a total of 30 nights, a city council spokeswoman said, with about 200 rough sleepers referred by outreach workers and charities over that period. Announcing the policy shift in November, the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, urged other councils to follow suit. “These measures will save lives this winter, and are an important step towards ending rough sleeping in Greater Manchester for good,” said Burnham, who gives 15% of his salary to homelessness charities as part of his attempt to eradicate street homelessness in the region by 2020. About 10 hostels, such as those run by the Salvation Army, put up camp beds to house emergency residents, according to Amanda Croome, the chief executive of the Booth Centre, a day centre in Manchester for homeless people, which refers them to the emergency provision. The Methodist church, an occasional concert venue in the city’s fashionable Northern Quarter, has also been turned into a makeshift homeless centre, run by the charity Coffee4Craig. This week the charity was overwhelmed with donations after issuing an appeal for blankets, sleeping mats, underwear and socks, but it was still in need of clean sleeping bags on Tuesday. Hendrix Lancaster, a spokesman for the charity, said: “We’re asking for sleeping bags because no one’s come forward with an offer of commercial washing support. Some people just come for one night and obviously that sleeping bag then needs commercial washing or replacing. “We’re doing our best to make sure as many people as want to come in are receiving support.” During Tuesday morning rush hour, some people could still be seen sleeping on Manchester’s streets. In doorways on London Road, near Piccadilly station, three people had set up camp as snow fell around them. “There are a variety of reasons why people don’t want to take up offers of accommodation, even in this weather,” said Croome. “But it’s worth noting that this emergency provision doesn’t enforce the sort of conditions that can often put people off going into a hostel. They allow couples to stay together, for example, and they allow dogs.” Rick Henderson, the chief executive of Homeless Link, welcomed the opening of emergency shelters but said councils had a “humanitarian obligation” to open them during storms as well as freezing weather. “Authorities across the country should have their emergency provision open this week,” he said. “However we are urging them to adopt a commonsense approach, going beyond the minimum trigger to open for the duration of the cold snap and during other extreme weather, including storms and gales.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/feb/28/echolocation-could-help-blind-people-learn-to-navigate-like-bats","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T00:01:04Z","webTitle":"Echolocation could help blind people learn to navigate like bats","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/28/echolocation-could-help-blind-people-learn-to-navigate-like-bats","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/feb/28/echolocation-could-help-blind-people-learn-to-navigate-like-bats","fields":{"headline":"Echolocation could help blind people learn to navigate like bats","bodyText":"Some people who are blind learn the extraordinary skill of echolocation, using mouth clicks to explore their environment in a way comparable to how bats navigate. Now scientists have uncovered new insights into how this feat is performed, which could help others to learn the skill. The study confirms that people can identify objects with a high rate of accuracy by listening for echoes of mouth clicks and that they make subtle alterations to their clicking patterns depending on the object’s location. Most people who are born blind are highly sensitive to the acoustics of their environment – using the echoes that bounce of objects, walls and buildings to navigate and avoid collisions. However, in recent years there has been a growing awareness of the ability of some blind individuals to use mouth clicks to actively echolocate. One American echolocation expert, Daniel Kish, uses the technique to accurately build up a mental sketch of a room as well as using it to go mountain biking along new trails. Lore Thaler, who led the work at Durham University, said: “From a scientific perspective, it’s firmly established that people can do this.” Thaler said that the skill often emerges spontaneously in children, as they experiment with ways to explore their environment. “We’ve found they end up doing similar things, even though they’ve developed the skill independently,” she added. In the latest study, eight expert echolocators were given the task of spotting whether a 17.5cm disc was present in their environment. The researchers placed the disc one metre from the volunteers at a range of angles. The volunteers were 100% accurate in spotting the object when it was directly in front of them, but their success rate dropped to 80% when it was slightly behind them and 50% – no better than chance – when it was directly behind their back (head movement was not allowed). Participants tended to instinctively increase the number and volume of the clicks when the object was further behind them, the study found, mirroring the type of adjustments made by bats when navigating using sonar. Knowing the types of strategies experts use could help train other visually impaired people in echolocation, Thaler hopes. “It’s a very learnable skill,” she added. The technique is typically used alongside a cane or guide dog – not as a replacement – but can help avoid collisions with objects at head height and gives an impression of the broader surroundings, which other aids cannot do. “It gives you an impression of larger scale space, which some people who are blind from birth can really struggle with,” said Thaler. The findings are published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/feb/27/michel-barnier-calls-david-davis-to-brexit-transition-crisis-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T15:33:43Z","webTitle":"Michel Barnier calls David Davis to Brexit transition crisis talks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/27/michel-barnier-calls-david-davis-to-brexit-transition-crisis-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/feb/27/michel-barnier-calls-david-davis-to-brexit-transition-crisis-talks","fields":{"headline":"Michel Barnier calls David Davis to Brexit transition crisis talks","bodyText":"The EU’s chief negotiator has summoned the UK’s Brexit secretary, David Davis, to Brussels for crisis talks over his concern that despite weeks of discussions major differences remain over the transition period, including its end date. Following a meeting with EU ministers to discuss the state of the Brexit negotiations, Michel Barnier told reporters he was deeply worried that significant differences between the two sides were not being settled. The commission official said the EU had stipulated that the transition period would last 21 months but that the UK wanted to keep the end date open, a claim Whitehall officials strenuously denied last week. “We have not achieved the transition yet… I am quite happy to discuss these matters straight away with David Davis,” he said. “It is essential we make progress by means of political discussions, political negotiations, above and beyond all the technical points of clarification, which we are working on at the moment. Just yesterday together with the UK I made it clear that we do need to make progress ... In many cases, there have been no negotiations, which is a matter of concern for me”. On the end date for the transition period, Barnier told reporters: “Logically enough we want it to end on 31 December 2020 at same times as the MFF [seven-year budget]. The UK it seems would like to keep this open ended, which is not possible.” Davis has been notable for his absence from Brussels in recent months, leaving negotiationslargely in the hands of officials led by Downing Street’s senior Brexit adviser, Olly Robbins. In the last week, the Brexit secretary has been meeting ministers in Austria, Poland and Greece. The Guardian understands Barnier made a pointed joke in his meeting with the European affairs ministers earlier in the day that Davis “seems to have a lot of time to see the 27 capitals – but it would be nice to see him here too”. Barnier also said the commission was now backing the European parliament’s position that it would be unacceptable for EU citizens arriving in the UK during the transition period to be treated differently to those already in the country, a demand of the prime minister’s. The UK wants an agreement on the terms of the transition period by the time of a European council meeting at the end of March but, with significant issues remaining open, doubts are growing in Brussels that the time frame can be met. Barnier told reporters the commission would publish the draft withdrawal agreement on Wednesday, including legal text on the transition period and on how a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic will be avoided. The document of 168 legal articles across 120 pages will focus on the solution under which Northern Ireland would effectively stay within the single market and customs union, while keeping open the possibility of other options emerging over time. Barnier said: “We are happy to work in parallel on all the solutions, but as things stand here and now our responsibility is to ensure that in the withdrawal agreement we are able to render operational solutions which would make it possible for us to honour the commitment we have entered into vis-a-vis the Good Friday agreement.” Asked about comments by the UK’s foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, in which he suggested the border issue could be dealt with by a system similar to that used to collect the congestion charge in London, Barnier was dismissive. “What counts here is what the British prime minister says”, he said. On the future relationship, Barnier said he agreed with the comments of Donald Tusk, the European council president, last week that the policy of “managed divergence” agreed by the cabinet in Chequers last week was not viable. It is understood that representatives from Germany and France stressed to Barnier during his earlier meeting that the guidelines that the EU agrees at a summit by leaders at the end of March should be “short and broad” although they will throw more light on hopes for future ties on security, foreign policy as well as agreements on aviation and fisheries. “This has the advantage of not ruling anything out, so allowing the UK position to mature, but it also means we are not second-guessing the UK position and doing their work for them,” said one senior diplomat. A draft text will be issued to European diplomats on Monday, kicking off a fortnight of discussions. Barnier, however, warned the EU ministers of the 27 that there was “no sugar-coating it – time is short”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/27/mark-wood-made-grown-up-decision-not-to-play-england-cricket-one-day-international-new-zealand","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T18:00:40Z","webTitle":"Mark Wood made ‘grown-up’ decision not to play for England in thrilling ODI","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/27/mark-wood-made-grown-up-decision-not-to-play-england-cricket-one-day-international-new-zealand","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/feb/27/mark-wood-made-grown-up-decision-not-to-play-england-cricket-one-day-international-new-zealand","fields":{"headline":"Mark Wood made ‘grown-up’ decision not to play for England in thrilling ODI","bodyText":"A “grown-up decision” is how Mark Wood described withdrawing from the first one-day international against New Zealand. England’s three-wicket defeat in Hamilton leaves them 1-0 down in the five-match series but the Durham quick is not pining for a sharp return, even if he did bowl at full pelt in training on Tuesday, having pulled himself out of the line of duty for what he perceives as his and England’s benefit. For the first time in an international career starting in the summer of 2015 during which he featured in 10 out of 40 Tests and 27 of 85 limited-overs matches, Wood is putting number one first and is not expected to feature in the second ODI on Wednesday. Having missed more than he has played, the Durham bowler was tempted to throw himself into another fixture when not at full capacity. It is a measure of the man that at a crucial juncture of his career – two Tests against New Zealand and a maiden Indian Premier League campaign on the horizon – he did not. “I spoke to [Eoin] Morgan after the day’s training last time and said I was umming and ahhing about it,” Wood said, upon feeling discomfort in a left ankle that has undergone three surgeries. “It was affecting my performance, my accuracy more than anything, with a weakness caused by a bit of a pinch. I was on the fence for ages. I could have gone out there like I have in the past and not do myself justice and let the team down, or make a grown-up decision and say it’s not quite right. I think I made the right decision.” A precautionary scan on Monday revealed no serious injury. Then again, it is all relative when referring to Wood’s left ankle: one that takes the brunt of his short, explosive run‑up and carries a degree of scar tissue and fluid unfamiliar to his peers. “My ankle will never be a normal ankle because I’ve had that much work in there,” he said. “It’ll probably be a bit of strengthening and some rest.” He took a full part in the nets , squaring up a handful of England’s squad. Therein lies the danger – Wood has rarely been at full capacity in his international career,even when he has willed himself to operate at a high level. “I’ve been bowling with ankle discomfort for three or four years now. It’s not like every time I rock up I am 100%. It’s always going to be there, it just becomes an issue when it starts to affect my performance. If I don’t bowl well because it’s not my day or my execution’s not right, I can deal with that. If it’s my ankle that’s causing me trouble it doesn’t feel a true reflection of me, and I don’t want to do that again like I did against South Africa in Tests or Australia at Lord’s. I didn’t bowl very well then.” He has no ambitions to put himself into the limited-overs-only box that boasts Adil Rashid, Alex Hales and now, through a succession of injuries, Reece Topley. The very assertion has the 28-year-old pushing back. “Never. I still want to play Test cricket, I love playing four-day cricket for Durham, to me that’s my ultimate goal growing up. I won’t give up that dream anytime soon.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/03/saturdays-best-tv-troy-fall-of-a-city-modus","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-03T06:00:10Z","webTitle":"Saturday’s best TV: Troy: Fall of a City; Modus","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/03/saturdays-best-tv-troy-fall-of-a-city-modus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/03/saturdays-best-tv-troy-fall-of-a-city-modus","fields":{"headline":"Saturday’s best TV: Troy: Fall of a City; Modus","bodyText":"Troy: Fall of a City 9.10pm, BBC One With the realisation that war with the Greeks could take a wee while, Helen and Alexander’s glow of honeymoon-period bliss changes to harrowed guilt at the devastating consequences of the choice they have made.

The Children of Violence series featuring Martha Quest, and above all the novel The Golden Notebook, had a revolutionary impact on a generation of women. Lessing asserted that it was possible to live an intellectual life while attached to a human body: she wrote of emotion, how hormonal changes around mood, pregnancy or menstruation might affect the life of the mind without necessarily diminishing it. Instead of needing to be separated, each aspect of existence became part of a complete whole. In a liberating form of autobiographical fiction, Lessing discounted the prevailing idea of the 1950s that an intelligent, political woman must be unwomanly, un homme manqué. She wrote with great perception on the complications of sex, and how it will tie you more closely to a particular person, which in turn risks altering your personal freedom. As with many writers, the books she produced can be seen in hindsight as an almost inevitable product of circumstance. Before she had reached the age of 30, she had married, had two children, divorced, married again, had another child, divorced again, and sailed to London with one child. She was escaping the constriction of poor, rural white Rhodesian life, her creative revolt against which had led to her being spied on as a communist by the colonial police. Her education was almost entirely self-generated, done from reading and conversation. When she reached London she had not yet published a book; ahead of her lay achievement and fame: more than 60 books, and the Nobel prize for literature. For Lara Feigel, at a time of her own frustration with social and biological expectation, Lessing offered a model of feminism “in which it was more important to live fully than to live contentedly”. She writes movingly of her maternal ambivalence, loving her son even while not wanting him to distract her from her necessary thinking and writing, and yearning for another child even while her marriage is falling apart. A reader in modern literature and culture at King’s College London, Feigel has something of Lessing’s diligent energy on the page, and in Free Woman she succeeds in making an extraordinary meditation on what it means to be a clever, engaged woman two generations after Lessing. The ostensible starting point for her book is a sense of resentment against being coopted into the conventions surrounding a series of friends’ weddings. Wondering about the choices made by herself and her contemporaries, she tunes in to the powerful voice of Lessing. “I could hear her sentences in my ears as I sat below a hundred metres of tasteful Liberty print bunting that the bride, her sister and their mother (three intelligent and expensively educated women) had sewn by hand.” Like Anna Wulf in The Golden Notebook, she wants to be free and to exist independently of others in a way that now seems to be falling out of fashion, as the sacrifices of an earlier generation are taken for granted. “It seemed to me that Anna’s refusal to define herself primarily as a wife, mother or lover was a significant part of the audacity of The Golden Notebook.” Feigel acknowledges that the freedom she desires and expects is less about freedom from servitude or want than about freedom to do as you please and exist outside categories of attachment, and hence is predicated on advantages of class, race and money. The reason this privilege does not sink the book is because she approaches her reordering of life around the precepts of Lessing and her protagonists with such focused earnestness, and with a classical, precise use of language. An account of her teenage sexual awakening is endearingly bookish, with crushes on Mr Rochester and “the Ralph Fiennes of The English Patient”. Free Woman is structured on themes found in Lessing’s writing, and involves close reading of her books as well as a measure of biography, combined with journeys to places and people of importance in her life. Although this is always interesting and mainly accurate (she mistakes the composer Philip Glass for the object of desire in Lessing’s 1996 novel Love, Again), it is perhaps the autobiographical representation that is in the end most compelling. Her technique is scrupulous, sparing neither herself nor others in a chronicle that is physically and intellectually intimate, in the manner of Jean-Jacques Rousseau in The Confessions, who had “resolved upon an enterprise which has no precedent … My purpose is to display to my fellow mortals a portrait in every way true to nature.” In contemporary terms, her model may be Rachel Cusk, who displays a similar lack of interest in the feelings of people around her in favour of fidelity to her art. Feigel journeys to Zimbabwe to examine the sunset at the farm where the child Lessing lived, and goes to Los Angeles to meet her lover and chronicler, Clancy Sigal. Smaller than she had anticipated, “He was wearing a baseball cap labelled ‘Secret Agent’ and a T-shirt and shorts that were not the costume of an ageing Lothario.” It is in the analysis of Sigal and his relationship with Lessing that I felt most strongly the difference in the way men and women may react to the same story. Feigel is outraged on Lessing’s behalf that he claims not to have been attracted to her, and was “dismissing her aged 37 as a kind of ageing witch”. But Sigal, seven years her junior, was mentally ill, a wandering, faithless wannabe novelist who had been raised in a Chicago slum by a single mother. Living with Lessing in London, he felt hard done by, complaining bitterly that she was a “Stakhanovite” with “a furious and almost cosmic creative energy”. She treated him maternally in return, cooking him fine meals and continuing as she always did with her work. As a successful writer, Lessing used her pain from the relationship as a learning experience, examining the ways in which men and women react to situations of extreme emotional stress. In a reversal of the usual literary man-woman relationship, Sigal was crushed by the industry and stability of the established novelist, and in years to come would seek to create many Lessing-like characters and caricatures in his books, while always asserting his indifference to her work. He does not come out well. Feigel has thought seriously about the meaning of freedom at different points in history, and about possible social mechanisms to escape “the limits of admissible thought”. Her quest in Free Woman to do things differently is too sincere to be self-indulgent. Unlike Lessing and Sigal in postwar London, she is part of a contemporary world that maintains rules that are nominally liberal but utterly constricting in their peer-pressured mental boundaries. “Now that we had fewer restrictions than their generation had done, there was less possibility to enjoy the feeling of moving beyond constraint, which itself constituted an experience of freedom,” she concludes. • Patrick French is writing the authorised biography of Doris Lessing.

Vincenzi published her first book, Old Sins, in 1989 and produced 17 novels and two short story collections. She was several chapters into a new book. When she launched her final work, A Question of Trust, in 2017, she said: “If nobody buys it, it will be my last book. Otherwise, no, I don’t want it to be my last book … I still love writing and the whole process.” Tackling topics ranging from the publishing empire of the Lytton family in the Spoils of Time trilogy, to trouble at Lloyd’s insurance market in An Absolute Scandal, Vincenzi’s sweeping, doorstopper-sized novels earned her the moniker “doyenne of the modern blockbuster” from Glamour. Before turning to fiction, she wrote for newspapers including the Times, the Mirror and the Daily Mail. Vincenzi’s agent, Clare Alexander, said: “Her special gift as a novelist was her love for her characters, and that came from her deep interest in not only the people in her imagination, but also in pretty well everyone she ever met. “She had such a generous gift of friendship, quite blind to whether someone was the boss or just making her a cup of tea. And that is why so many people in publishing will be devastated by her loss. Throughout her life – which like everyone’s, had its own tragedies and pitfalls – Penny always looked for hope and joy and the best way forward, which is perhaps why her huge fan base crossed generations and never deserted her. I will miss her every day. She was a storyteller of such natural talent.” In a joint statement, her four daughters Polly Harding, Sophie Cornish, Emily Gunnis and Claudia Vincenzi paid tribute. “A true trailblazer, her ambition matched her talent, enabling her to break down barriers and show others behind her – especially her daughters – what it was possible to achieve, professionally and personally. In her later years she met many challenges with her health, but was adamant to remain, in her own words, ‘cheerful and positive, someone the grandchildren remembered as happy and fun to be around.’ She always said she wanted to die at her typewriter. Only last week she was still galloping through her new novel, so she fulfilled her ambitions to the last,” the statement read. Fellow authors remembered Vincenzi online, including Katie Fforde and Sophie Kinsella, who called her “the most entertaining of friends”. “As an author I so admired her ability to weave together huge, epic plot lines and create such satisfying books full of real life, wit and passion,” Kinsella added. “She was like one of her own novels: once you were in her company you didn’t want to say goodbye. I will really miss her.” Novelist Harriet Evans, who edited Vincenzi before turning to writing fiction herself, said that working with her was “the highlight of my publishing career, hands down”. Evans wrote on Instagram: “Her astonishing powers of storytelling, her work ethic, her intelligence and the way she raised up everyone with her and made them love her, from editorial assistants to the MD of the company – so many authors including me have so much to learn from her. I say all this about me to illustrate how special she made everyone she encountered feel. Hundreds, probably thousands of people who came across her, not to mention the millions who devoured her books. Oh the books were so flipping amazing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/filmblog/2018/mar/01/send-us-your-questions-for-jonny-greenwood-oscars-phantom-thread","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T12:33:30Z","webTitle":"Send us your questions for Jonny Greenwood","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/mar/01/send-us-your-questions-for-jonny-greenwood-oscars-phantom-thread","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2018/mar/01/send-us-your-questions-for-jonny-greenwood-oscars-phantom-thread","fields":{"headline":"Send us your questions for Jonny Greenwood","bodyText":"Most musicians would be content with playing in one of the world’s biggest bands, but most musicians aren’t Jonny Greenwood. Having made his name providing guitar histrionics for Radiohead, Greenwood has spent the last 15 years burnishing his reputation as one of the best film score composers around, collaborating with Paul Thomas Anderson on There Will Be Blood, The Master and Inherent Vice, and providing the deeply discomfiting music for Lynne Ramsay’s chilling drama We Need to Talk About Kevin. Even by his own standards, March is set to be a significant month for the musician. Next Friday sees the release of Ramsay’s Joaquin Phoenix-fronted revenge drama You Were Never Really Here, for which Greenwood has provided the throbbing soundtrack. Before that, though, there’s Sunday’s Academy Awards, where Greenwood has been nominated for best score for Anderson’s fashion-house drama Phantom Thread. The two scores are a testament to Greenwood’s range: You Were Never Really Here’s is modern and menacing, built on synth-led compositions; while Phantom Thread’s is a lush, romantic orchestral work hinting at Debussy, Satie and Schubert. Both are decidedly different, but unmistakably Greenwood’s. Got any questions for Jonny? Post them in the comments below and he’ll answer the pick of them ahead of the release of You Were Never Really Here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/01/football-transfer-rumours-liverpool-or-barcelona-to-land-houssem-aouar","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T08:51:59Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Liverpool or Barcelona to land Houssem Aouar?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/01/football-transfer-rumours-liverpool-or-barcelona-to-land-houssem-aouar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/01/football-transfer-rumours-liverpool-or-barcelona-to-land-houssem-aouar","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Liverpool or Barcelona to land Houssem Aouar?","bodyText":"You might think Jack Wilshere is the most overrated player on the planet. You might think he was the best 17-year-old you have ever seen play in the flesh, after Kieron Dyer, but accept that injuries have taken that crucial extra few per cent away. You might just be glad we’re talking about something other than snow and VAR. What you might not know, though, is that he is apparently on the brink of quitting Arsenal, with contract negotiations not going well and the two parties a long way apart – a pay cut has been mooted by the club. He’ll cast all that aside for 90 minutes if the game with Manchester City beats the chill on Thursday night, but the former boy wonder’s days at the Emirates are beginning to look numbered and clubs across the continent are on red alert. Meanwhile, a starlet from France is causing Liverpool and Barcelona to flutter their eyes admiringly. Their objet d’amour is Houssem Aouar of Lyon, and the Anfield club will be hoping to steal a tiny dose of revenge for the departure of Philippe Coutinho. Manchester United and Chelsea did battle on Sunday afternoon and, whaddya know, they’re at it again. Not in the form of a Mourinho-Conte snowball fight, although you’d pull up a chair for that: they’ve both got their beady eyes on Alessandro Florenzi of Roma, who has 16 months left on his contract and can excel at right-back and in midfield. Roma are dangling a long-term deal his way, but Premier League interest is said to have turned his head. That is unlikely to deflect too much attention from Real Madrid’s latest play for David de Gea. They even have a cunning plan: offer United Gareth Bale in return, or possibly Raphaël Varane, or even, Toni Kroos. The latter would be a last resort but is – as we told you yesterday – on José Mourinho’s wishlist. Alan Pardew may, via the advice of the deity upstairs, have forgiven Jonny Evans for his role in West Brom’s recent high jinks but the pair may not be reunited for long. The doubt over Pardew’s job is one thing; the second is the fact that West Ham are keen to get their hands on him if the Baggies go down – reportedly for a mere £3m, thanks to a relegation clause in his contract. You suspect the suitors will be queuing up in a long line. If it’s gone badly wrong at West Brom then, relative to expectations, it hasn’t gone a whole lot better at Everton – whose big transfer window signing, Cenk Tosun, could be heading back in the direction he came from. Tosun has not had much of a chance at Goodison but may return to Besiktas, who sold him for a princely £27m, on loan in the summer. Which would speak pretty concisely for how the Toffees’ transfer business has been conducted over the past year or so."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/01/carpetright-warns-annual-loss-uk-consumer-spending-squeeze","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T14:25:05Z","webTitle":"Carpetright warns of annual loss amid UK consumer spending squeeze","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/01/carpetright-warns-annual-loss-uk-consumer-spending-squeeze","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/01/carpetright-warns-annual-loss-uk-consumer-spending-squeeze","fields":{"headline":"Carpetright warns of annual loss amid UK consumer spending squeeze","bodyText":"More high street store closures could be on the cards after Carpetright warned it would slump into the red this year and said it was asking its banks for help to ride out the financial storm. The floor covering chain’s third profit warning in four months comes the day after Toys R Us and Maplin, two of the high street’s best known retailers, went into administration, casting doubt over the future of 5,500 jobs and 300 stores. The tough market conditions were also underlined by new figures published by the troubled South African group Steinhoff, which owns a number of UK retailers. It said like-for-like sales slumped in its furniture business, which includes the Bensons for Beds and Harveys brands, had dropped 7% in the last three months of 2017. By comparison sales at sister chain Poundland were up 5% after a record Christmas. Carpetright’s chief executive, Wilf Walsh, is trying to turn around the retailer by modernising its stores and closing underperforming branches. But on Thursday the company said the trend of falling sales at its 409 UK stores had continued amid a slowdown in consumer spending. Carpetright said it now expected to make a loss of around £4m for the year to 28 April. At the start of this year the City had pencilled in profits of £13m. “The group is proactively engaged in constructive discussions with its bank lenders in order to ensure it continues to comply with the terms of its prevailing bank facilities,” said the company in a statement. “The bank lenders have indicated that they currently remain fully supportive.” The warning wiped more than a quarter off the value of Carpetright’s shares, which were changing hands for 58p at lunchtime on Thursday, valuing the company at £40m. Walsh said the retailer was examining a “range of options to accelerate the turnaround of the business and strengthen its balance sheet”. Analysts said the most likely scenario was that it sought to raise fresh funds from shareholders to finance an ongoing store refurbishment programme alongside closures. It is only six weeks since Carpetright’s last profit warning, when it told the City that like-for-like sales were down 7.1% amid a sharp drop in the number of shoppers visiting the high street. The company said the magnitude of the sales fall had lessened in the intervening weeks but the trend remained negative. Carpetright has a £55m overdraft and analysts said the two banks involved were expected to loosen the conditions attached to the loans when they are tested again next month. The home furnishings sector has been particularly hard hit by weak consumer confidence as inflation eats into Britons’ spending power. The slowdown in the housing market has also depressed demand for big-ticket purchases like furniture and carpets. Home furnishings companies Multiyork, Feather &amp; Black and Warren Evans have all ceased trading since November. Walsh has cut the size of Carpetright’s UK chain by more than 10% since taking charge in 2014. About half its stores have now been modernised – a process that involves ditching the dated red branding and improving customer service – and they are producing higher sales than the rest, which include a tail of unprofitable branches. The retail sector is braced for a wave of store closures this year as major players including Marks &amp; Spencer, House of Fraser and New Look scale back their high street presence. Prior to its collapse Toys R Us had been trying to close loss-making stores and downsize others. Canaccord Genuity analyst Sanjay Vidyarthi said Carpetright had too many stores but getting rid of them would be expensive given its straitened circumstances. “The issue here is a rent bill of £80m and a UK store portfolio of circa 400 stores that should really be under 300,” said Vidyarthi. “The average lease length as at April 2017 was 5.5 years. The cost of an early exit from onerous leases is likely to be hugely material relative to current market cap.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2018/mar/01/stock-markets-fall-house-prices-retail-carpetright-manufacturing-powell-fed-chair-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T17:04:56Z","webTitle":"US unemployment claims hit 48-year low as factory growth surges - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/mar/01/stock-markets-fall-house-prices-retail-carpetright-manufacturing-powell-fed-chair-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2018/mar/01/stock-markets-fall-house-prices-retail-carpetright-manufacturing-powell-fed-chair-business-live","fields":{"headline":"US unemployment claims hit 48-year low as factory growth surges - as it happened","bodyText":"And finally, European stock markets have closed with losses across the board. Despite the less hawkish tone from Jerome Powell this afternoon, investors picked up the baton from Asia and send shares lower. In London, the FTSE 100 ended 56 points down at 7,175, a fall of 0.8%. Rentokil was the biggest faller, down 9%, after cutting its profit forecasts this morning. WPP, the world’s biggest advertising firm, shed 8% after its own gloomy outlook. David Madden of CMC Markets says: WPP are still suffering at the hands of Google and Facebook as companies are shying away from traditional advertising and are using online targeting to reach their customers. Like-for-like billing declined by 5.4% and 2017 ‘wasn’t pretty’ according to the CEO Martin Sorrell. The company revealed disappointing figures in August and today’s announcement sent the stock to its lowest level since October 2014. Traders may remain sceptical about the company until it can challenge the tech titans for advertising space. Germany’s DAX lost almost 2%, while France’s CAC lost 1.1% and the pan-European Stoxx 600 fell by 1.4%. That’s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Powell is also making some interesting points about student debt; suggesting it could be wiped away if an individual is made bankrupt. Background: The US Education Department said this week it will review when borrowers can discharge student loans, an indication it could become easier to expunge those loans in bankruptcy. Fed chair Jerome Powell is exhibiting a more dovish plumage to Congress today, having come over as quite the hawk on Tuesday. Jerome Powell’s cautious comments about wage inflation have taken some of the sizzle out of the US dollar. Shares have also pushed higher on Wall Street, as traders shed some of their worries about rate increases. Over in Washington, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell is testifying to the Senate banking committee. His prepared testimony was the same as Tuesday’s offering to the House, so it didn’t move the markets. But Powell now taking questions....and he’s delivered a dovish-sound comment on wages increases. Perhaps importantly, the new Fed chief says there aren’t any signs of a ‘decisive’ move in wages. That could dampen expectations of hefty interest rate rises this year. CNBC has the details: Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday that there are no “decisive” signs of wage inflation yet. Speaking in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, the central bank head also said more gains can come in the labor market without causing harmful levels of inflation. The remarks are significant in that during Powell’s remarks two days ago before the House Financial Services Committee were interpreted as being more concerned about inflation, leading the Fed to a more aggressive path in interest rate hikes. “We don’t see any strong evidence yet of a decisive move up in wages. We see wages by a couple of measures trending up a little bit, but most of them continuing to grow at two and a half percent,” he said. “Nothing is suggesting to me that wage inflation is at a point of accelerating. I would expect that some continued strengthening in the labor market can take place without causing inflation.” Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics is impressed by today’s US manufacturing figures: The rise in the ISM manufacturing index in February to 60.8, from 59.1, left it at a 13-year high and suggests that growth is set to pick up following a soft start to the year. On past form, the index is consistent with real GDP growth of more than 5% annualised. Rupert Harrison of BlackRock suggests Donald Trump’s tax reforms are helping: James Knightley of ING says the data supports the case for four US interest rate rises this year: Given orders and production are also well above the 60 level – remember that a reading of 50 notionally means stable output - the report suggests that the manufacturing sector will continue to contribute significantly to economic activity in coming months. However, inflation pressures are also clearly building with prices paid the highest since 2011. As such, this report supports our predictions that the US economy will expand 3% this year and that headline inflation could hit 3% in the summer. With new Fed Chair Jay Powell seemingly backing the case for further policy tightening, we look for a March 21st rate hike with three more to follow later this year. Charlie Bilello of Pension Partners puts today’s data in context: More strong US economic data! Growth among American factories jumped last month, to the highest level in 13 years. That’s according to the Institute of Supply Management. Its monthly manufacturing PMI survey has risen to 60.3 in February, up from January’s 59.1. Economists had expected a small fall. Instead, ISM reports that new orders and employment growth were both strong, keeping activity in the sector bubbling away. In contrast, the UK’s factory PMI fell to 55.2 this morning, while the eurozone posted 58.6. Any reading over 50 shows growth. Back in the UK, households have been told to ‘carry on cooking’, despite the shortfall in gas supplies. Energy minister Claire Perry has pledged that domestic supplies won’t be disrupted, so Britons should ”carrying on using your gas heating and cooking meals as normal”. Here’s Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, on the surprise drop in US jobless claims: “In the final week of February 1969, 201,000 US workers made jobless claims (seasonally adjusted). Led Zeppelin had just released their debut album, the Vietnam war was raging, and some 69 million workers were on Non-Farm Payrolls. Unemployment was below 4%. The fact that a comparable number of initial jobless claims are being made today illustrates just how tight the US labour market is getting. We also have fresh data showing that inflationary pressure are building in America, although not dramatically. The prices paid by US consumers rose by 0.4% in January, although the annual rate remains below the significant 2% level. Reuters has the details: U.S. consumer prices increased in January, with a gauge of underlying inflation posting its largest gain in 12 months, bolstering views that price pressures will accelerate this year. The Commerce Department said on Thursday consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, rose 0.4%. That was the biggest increase since September and followed a 0.1 percent gain in December. In the 12 months through January, the PCE price index rose 1.7% after a similar gain in December because of base effects. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index advanced 0.3% in January - the largest gain since January 2017. Economist Danny Blanchflower reckons this isn’t an excuse to raise US interest rates.... Significantly, the four-week moving average of US jobless claims has also hit a 48-year low. This measure, which strips out week-to-week volatility, fell 5,000 to 220,500 last week. Bloomberg’s Mike McKee says today’s US unemployment data is seriously impressive: Analyst Marco Mazzocco says the figures highlight the strength of America’s recovery Financial blogger Bill McBride has tweeted a graph showing the initial claims figures over the decades: Breaking: The number of Americans signing on for unemployment benefit has hit its lowest level in almost 50 years. The weekly initial claims survey shows that just 210,000 US citizens filed new claims last week, down from 220,000 the previous week. This extends a long run of impressive jobs data, underlining the strength of the US labor market (which is why interest rates are likely to rise three or four times this year). The shortage of gas in the UK has pushed prices to new record levels. Britain’s same-day gas prices have surged by more than 130 per cent to 275p per therm. That extends todays record highs, and beats the previous record high of 150p set in 2013. Last week, wholesale gas for immediate use was trading around 60p per therm, but the snowy weather - and National Grid’s warning that supplies can’t meet demand today - has triggered a scramble to get hold of gas. Dr Jonathan Marshall, energy analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, says a range of factors have left Britain short of supplies. He explains (via PA) “Behind today’s gas deficit warning is a ‘perfect storm’ of unrelated short-term issues - freezing conditions, diminished Dutch gas production due to earthquake concerns, weather-related issues curbing imports from Europe, and a global LNG market in which supplies are being pulled to Asia by higher prices. “But underlying it is another set of issues that speak to a failure by successive governments to map out a secure gas future in the way that they have done so successfully for electricity. “Allowing Centrica to close the UK’s only big long-term gas store without consideration for supply during cold snaps, failing to develop a coherent plan for low-carbon heating, and above all a head-in-the-sand approach to improving energy efficiency in homes have all put households and businesses at risk of shortages and price spikes.” The pound and the euro are both losing ground against the US dollar today. America’s currency is benefiting from the prospect of several interest rate rises this year (which would make it more profitable to hold cash in dollars, rather than sterling or euros). The euro has slipped to a seven-week low against the dollar, at $1.216, while the pound has dipped to $1.374, a six-week low. The London stock market has fallen deeper into the red, after a morning of generally bad news. The FTSE 100 is now down 63 points, or 0.9%, at 7170. Ad firm WPP remains the biggest faller, down 13%, after reporting its weakest growth since 2009 this morning. The smaller FTSE 250 index, of medium-sized companies is also down, shedding 135 points or 0.7% . The latest gloom at Carpetright, the drop in UK house prices, and the slowdown in factory growth have all dampened the mood in the City. But there are chunky losses across Europe too -- with Germany’s DAX down 1.6%. Wall Street is also expected to drop, when trading begins in over two hours time. Investors remain nervous about the prospect for US interest rates -- with new Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaking at the US Senate in a few hours time. Will Powell repeat his upbeat words from Tuesday, when he testified before the lower House of Congress? Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA explains why traders will be watching closely: It would appear markets are bracing for more hawkish commentary from Powell today when he appears before the Senate Banking Committee, once again discussing the semi-annual monetary policy report. Given everything that he said on Tuesday, it seems pretty clear that economic forecasts will be revised higher this month and the pace of tightening will likely therefore pick up, which may make today’s less eventful as he reiterates many of the views already expressed. That said, should he wish to back pedal on anything or clarify points that have been misinterpreted, it may attract some attention. Even the world’s financial markets aren’t immune to the snowy weather. The Irish stock exchange is closing at noon today, and will be shut all Friday, due to “extreme weather conditions”. The ISE says: Due to the announcement by the Irish Government’s National Emergency Coordination Committee and the severe weather-related nationwide Status Red Warning, and to protect against any potential risk to market integrity in these exceptional circumstances, the Irish Stock Exchange (ISE) is altering its trading calendar to facilitate an earlier closing of the market today, Thursday, 1 March 2018 and will close all day on Friday, 2 March 2018. Earlier today, a ‘Red’ weather alert was extended to cover the entire Republic of Ireland, which means people should stay at home to avoid the severe winter storm that is hitting the country. The Guardian’s weather blog has full coverage of Storm Emma, and the ‘Beast from the East’: Heads-up, UK readers. This is the last day to spend your old £10 notes (the ones with Charles Darwin on them). From Friday morning, only the new Jane Austen ones will do (although you can always change out-of-date notes at the Bank of England). Here’s my colleague Mark Sweney on ad giant WPP’s results, which have sent its shares sliding: The world’s largest advertising and marketing services group, WPP, has said last year was its worst year since the 2009 recession. The UK company reported a 0.3% fall in revenues to £15.2bn in its results for 2017, making it WPP’s worst year in growth terms since 2009 when the company reported a fall of 8.1% during the depths of the recession following the credit crunch. WPP’s share price fell more than 10% in early trading on Thursday, the biggest faller on the FTSE 100. Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP’s chief executive, admitted 2017 “was not a pretty year” for the company but denied it was because his agencies were being cut out of deals between advertisers and Google and Facebook. More here: Mike Rigby, Head of Manufacturing at Barclays, fears that Brexit uncertainty is hitting UK factory growth. Here’s his take on this morning’s manufacturing report: Although the sector remains positive, the continuing uncertainty over Brexit negotiations can’t be helping the investment intentions of manufacturers who are looking for some degree of clarity over the future relationship with the EU sooner rather than later. Manufacturers will also need to remain flexible in their planning as they negotiate the uncertain market conditions in 2018. With current Barclays data highlighting the premia that international consumers are prepared to pay for British goods, and given the continuing improvement in key overseas markets, manufacturing businesses should be increasingly focusing on differentiating their products on quality and service.” Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, reckons Britain’s factory sector is still in “a positive mood”, despite the drop in the manufacturing PMI last month. Brexit uncertainty is a key factor, he adds: Recent ONS figures show sector productivity is increasing, although there is still some way to go before the UK catches up to its G7 counterparts. But manufacturers are taking steps to make this happen by investing in automation and exploring the opportunities presented by Industry 4.0. Many are using specialist asset finance facilities to invest in equipment, protecting their working capital which can be used to support growth opportunities. “Clearly, challenges and uncertainties lay ahead. All firms are keen for clarity on the future trading relationship with the EU, but manufacturers, which account for nearly half of UK exports, are disproportionately exposed to uncertainty associated with international trade agreements. The PMI will therefore be closely watched in the coming months for any clues as to how exporting firms are managing this uncertainty.” Newsflash: UK factory activity growth has hit its lowest level in eight months, according to data firm Markit’s monthly healthcheck. Manufacturers have reported that production increased at the slowest pace for 11 months in February, with “decelerations seen across the consumer, intermediate and investment goods sectors”. Firms also suffered a sharp rise in input costs, as raw materials and other commodities became pricier. Some companies passed this onto their own customers -- which could push inflation up. But there’s good news too - new orders picked up, and firms kept hiring staff: Duncan Brock, Director of Customer Relationships at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says there wasn’t much “bonhomie” in the UK manufacturing sector last month. All sectors lost their drive as manufacturing activity crawled at a snail’s pace not seen for almost a year. “Amidst these signs of a moderate slowdown, it was supply chain disruptions that were largely at fault. Suppliers underperformed not only on the timely delivery of goods but in their inability to meet the demand from makers for some raw materials. This intensified capacity issues and acted as a drag on overall purchasing activity. Time for some data... The euro zone’s manufacturing boom slowed a little last month, new figures from Markit show. But Europe’s factories are still in a rosy period, and enjoying their strongest growth spell in almost 20 years. Markit’s manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (which tracks activity in the sector) dipped to 58.6 in February from 59.6. Any reading over 50 shows growth. France and Germany both reported a small drop in growth. National Grid has issued a warning that the UK will not have enough gas to meet demand on Thursday, as temperatures plummeted and imports were hit by outages. It is thought unlikely that the situation will affect supply to households, but if enough extra gas supplies by pipeline or ship are not forthcoming, it could affect industrial users. Within-day wholesale gas prices soared 74% to 200p per therm this morning after the formal deficit warning, which acts as a call to suppliers to bring forward more gas on Thursday. Prices have since fallen back to 170p. More here: European stock markets are all in the red this morning, following last night’s late slide on Wall Street. In London, the FTSE 100 is being dragged down by advertising giant WPP - which has shed 13% after reporting a “slow start” to the new year, and a 0.3% drop in like-for-like revenues in 2017. Otherwise, traders are continuing to fret about the prospect of sharp hikes in US interest rates this year (as the Federal Reserve tries to prevent inflation getting out of hand). Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says European markets got off to “another duff start”, after traders saw America’s Dow Jones shed 380 points last night. Interactive Investor’s Lee Wild explains what’s going on: A strong US economy is great for confidence and jobs, but corporate America will have to absorb more expensive debt, which is why equity traders are selling into the rally from mid-February lows. It’s all eyes on Jerome Powell again on Thursday when the Fed chair testifies before the Senate Banking Committee. Any further talk about an overheating economy will give equity market bears another reason to dump stock. Retail analyst Nick Bubb is amazed that Carpetright has produced another profit warning today: It is only 6 weeks or so since the last Carpetright profit warning on Jan 19th, but, almost unbelievably it has issued yet another profit warning today and flagged, ominously, that it is in discussions with its banks about to prop up the balance sheet. Whether Carpetright needs to raise more equity remains unclear, as does the issue of how far its problems are to do with intense competition from its rival Tapi, but shareholders will fear the worst today… Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says Carpetright has deteriorated sharply in recent months. “A bad week for retail as Carpetright’s woes get worse: now the company expects to report a loss for the year to the end of April as its store investment programme is not paying off. It’s been quite a climb-down from just a few months ago. In December it issued a profits warning, guiding underlying profit before tax for the year to be at the lower end of the previous range of £13.8m to £16.7m. As we noted at the time, profits warnings have a nasty habit of not coming alone and that guidance appeared to be wishful thinking. In January management slashed this to a range of £2m-£6m. Horrendous post-Christmas sales were to blame then but the trend is not improving. Now a small loss is expected as trading remains very difficult. That loss may not remain small if Easter doesn’t go well. Like-for-like sales are negative and below management expectations. Lee Wild, Head of Equity Strategy at interactive investor, says the next few months will be crucial for Carpetright. Carpetright’s long and painful decline clearly has further to run. Things haven’t improved since the last profits warning in January, and the company will lose money this year. It has the backing of its lenders for now, but a strong Easter is crucial for the business and any goodwill that remains. Newsflash: Shares in Carpetright, the UK flooring and furnishing business, have plunged by 25% in early trading. In another sign of retail gloom, Carpetright has issued a profits warning (its fourth in three months, according to Reuters). It now expects to make a small underlying pre-tax loss for the current financial year. Carpetright admits that sales in the UK have been weaker than hoped, saying: Trading conditions in the weeks since the Group last updated the market on 19 January 2018 have remained difficult, characterised by continued weak consumer confidence. While the trend in the Group’s UK like-for-like sales has improved through the intervening period, it remains negative. Carpetright says it is “proactively engaged in constructive discussions” with its banks, to ensure it sticks with its bank facilities. They add: The bank lenders have indicated that they currently remain fully supportive. This comes a day after Toys R Us and Maplin, two other UK retailers, both fell into administration putting over 5,500 jobs at risk. The drop in UK house prices in February is a surprise, says Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent . He explains: ’As one of the most closely-watched indicators of property market strength due to its longevity and accuracy, Nationwide’s figures may cause concern. At this time of the year we would have expected an increase, not a fall, in house price growth although of course these figures are in contrast to the previous month’s findings. ‘However, it goes to show the limitations of a national snapshot of the market. While Nationwide reports a lack of supply, on the ground, we are finding more balance between supply and demand in our part of London as buyers, spoilt for more choice, hesitate before making commitments and identifying whether they are dealing with serious sellers.’ Simon French, chief economist of Panmure Gordon, predicts that the slowdown in UK house prices will continue this year: Jonathan Samuels, CEO of the property lender, Octane Capital, believes the property market is being battered by weak consumer confidence. “With the ongoing financial squeeze on households, you sense the house price slowdown has now begun in earnest. “High living costs, low wage growth, potential rate rises and a lethargic economy in the shadow of Brexit: for consumers, the bad news is in stereo mode. “While weak supply and very low borrowing costs will prevent a collapse in prices, it’s hard to see 2018 delivering anything other than very low single digit growth. “February could go down as the month the big freeze on prices took hold. Newsflash: UK house prices fell in February, fuelling suspicions that the housing market is cooling fast. The Nationwide Building Society has reported that prices fell by 0.3% last month, crushing expectations of a rise, following January’s 0.8% increase. That drags the annual rate of house price growth down to 2.2%, from 3.2% a month ago. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s Chief Economist, blames falling consumer confidence and the squeeze on household budgets: “Month-to-month changes can be volatile, but the slowdown is consistent with signs of softening in the household sector in recent months. Retail sales were relatively soft over the Christmas period and at the start of the new year, as were key measures of consumer confidence, as the squeeze on household incomes continued to take its toll. Gardner points out that mortgage approvals fell to their weakest level for three years in December - a sign that activity in the sector has fallen. Nationwide expects house prices to only rise by 1% this year, due to ‘subdued economic activity’ and Britain’s exit from the European Union. “How the housing market performs in the year ahead will be determined in large part by developments in the wider economy and the path of interest rates. Brexit developments will remain a key factor, though these remain hard to foresee. I’ll pull some reaction together now... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European stock markets are facing fresh losses today, after a late wobble on Wall Street sent the Dow Jones industrial average down almost 400 points, or 1.5%. The selloff ended Wall Street’s run of 11 monthly gains, and was triggered by renewed jitters about the pace of US interest rate rises . The big fear is that America’s central bank, the Fed, will hike interest rates four times in 2017. This has sparked declines in Asia, where Japan’s Nikkei shed 1.5%. As AFP put it: After a couple of weeks of calm, the volatility that kicked off February has returned on worries that the strong US economy and Donald Trump’s tax cuts will lead the Federal Reserve to tighten borrowing costs more than previously thought. European markets are set to follow, with the main indices being called down 0.5%. The new chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, worried investors on Tuesday by indicating that borrowing costs must rise to prevent the US economy overheating. We’ll hear from Powell again today, when he testifies to the Senate banking committee. If he repeats his hawkish tone, then the markets could take fright. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: Mr Powell returns for a second round today with US lawmakers and markets will be looking to see whether he rows back a little from Tuesday’s hawkish interpretation of his remarks or whether he reaffirms them. If he does the latter then we could well see further gains for the US dollar and increased pressure on stock markets.

So why has the ABC gone MIA?","bodyText":"Since diving into the ABC’s drama offerings for 2018, I’ve thought often of the words of Sandra Levy, the former ABC director of television, more than 10 years ago: “I think the future for ABC television is very bleak.” We speak a lot now about the golden age of television. But as longform, serialised storytelling has emerged as a global point of cultural interest, the ABC has stepped away from drama as a staple of its programming. How ironic that in a period of intense global creativity and demand, the predicament of Australian drama is that it’s missing in action on the ABC. For decades, drama was the mainstay of ABC television. During my own childhood in the late 1990s, SeaChange dominated the drama landscape. From inside the dark neoliberal drift of the Howard years, Deborah Cox and Andrew Knight’s comedic drama offered a glimpse of a different set of values – Sigrid Thornton’s highly strung lawyer ditching her corporate career for a more humble job as a local judge in a beachside town in Victoria. SeaChange was preceded by grittier fare, much of it in the crime genre: Fallen Angels, Police Rescue and Wildside. At the culmination of this period – 1998-99 – the ABC broadcast 157 hours of locally made drama. Last financial year, the figure for new fiction was a grim 70 hours. This year, the ABC’s drama flagship remains very slim indeed. Rake is looking to be 2018’s narrative-storytelling saviour, and antihero Cleaver Greene’s new place in the Senate should orient the series towards national and global politics. Jack Irish and Rosehaven are the drama slate’s reliable regulars, made in the satisfying template of old-school weeknight television. There are one-offs like the recent queer telemovie Riot. Beyond that, two new scripted titles in the ABC’s 2018 program could mark exceptions: Pine Gap, made in association with Netflix, and Mystery Road – The Series, the only Indigenous drama to be announced so far. But the current slate still represents a downward slide that has become the new normal. The reduction in drama comes down to a combination of government underfunding and wobbly adaptation to the digitisation of the broadcast space. The state of the arts has languished due to the culture wars waged by successive governments and the effects are ongoing. The link between underfunding and the decline of drama is tangible: between 2013 and 2014, when the $136m funding boost from the Rudd government to enhance local content and build a dedicated children’s channel was fully felt, 126 hours of drama were aired. In 2016-17, it was down to 70 hours of both scripted drama and comedy, with a $45.2m spend. Earlier this year the ABC promised to ramp up investment in local content. But the details are fuzzy: it’s not known how much of this will go towards drama and it doesn’t come close to redressing the 28% funding decline in real terms since the mid 1980s, including $200m in the last two years. That means we can’t take it for granted that the ABC will always deliver a broad, diverse gamut of drama. After all, there is no specific obligation in the ABC charter to sustain a certain level of homegrown drama, to embed it into the national broadcaster’s DNA. Of course, television is in constant flux, like all parts of the entertainment and screen industries. The ABC’s move away from drama is preceded by many other peaks and troughs. Think of the way in which Australian television was once dominated by the family variety show, an era that ended in 1999 with the demise of Channel Nine’s Hey Hey It’s Saturday. Just two years later, Big Brother debuted on Channel Ten and reality TV changed the television landscape forever. This last shift, to reality TV, has affected the ABC in a sneakily sideways manner – with the onset of light entertainment. Light entertainment looms as a more inexpensive spectre, enthusiastically embraced to the point where it has become the ABC’s version of reality TV. In recent years, there has been the Annabel Crabb tidal wave of politician-celebrity banter as a way to collide politics with leisurely fare (The House, Canberra Al Desko, Kitchen Cabinet). Then there’s the deluge of fun-and-games panel shows. This year, there are those in the Gruen universe, quiz shows hosted by Paul McDermott, the latest being Think Tank, as well as the third season of Tom Gleeson’s Hard Quiz. This kind of light entertainment lacks the development costs and honed cultural production sensibilities of drama and traditional scripted shows, as do the bite-sized arts documentaries such as Behind the Second Woman and You See Monsters, wonderful as they are, that populate iView. Of course, there’s space for all types of programs for different audiences at a national broadcaster. But gone, it seems, are the plentiful, sustained, serious, culturally diverse, narrative-based dramas that tap the pulse of life and society – with a scale and scope of ideas that can’t be contained in short-form storytelling; with complexity of narrative and character; with the capacity for intellectual and emotional nourishment in many repeated viewings. Despite the global upswing in brilliant television narratives, the ABC is a marginal player rather than a leader here. Where is the next Please Like Me, Josh Thomas’s sparkling comedic drama that provided momentary respite from the light entertainment tsunami? Apart from Ivan Sen’s Mystery Road series, where are the other independent directors making longform stories for the small screen on the ABC? It’s hard not to notice the ABC’s absence in the present wave of mature, intelligent storytelling and hard not to think of it as a missed opportunity. The days of appointment-based television are over. The new streaming giants are a huge source of competition to the ABC, but they are producing precious few scripted local dramas. The solution may come in the form of an amendment in the ABC’s charter to commit to drama, a quota to mandate a minimum, the sharing of production costs with a partner like Netflix, or a more organised and vocal expression of demand from us as the audience to replenish the national broadcaster’s eroded funding base. In a digital environment, the media ecology is breaking and remaking itself. But can we really afford to let ABC drama continue to decline in this time of change?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/01/nt-supports-all-but-10-royal-commission-recommendations","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T06:17:32Z","webTitle":"NT resists cash guarantee on child detention blueprint from royal commission","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/01/nt-supports-all-but-10-royal-commission-recommendations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/01/nt-supports-all-but-10-royal-commission-recommendations","fields":{"headline":"NT resists cash guarantee on child detention blueprint from royal commission","bodyText":"The Northern Territory government has given its support to all but 10 of the royal commission recommendations to fix its failed child protection and detention systems, but declined to guarantee they would be fully funded and implemented. Half the recommendations were given “in principle support”, including a ban on incarcerating under-14s except in extreme circumstances, and some which required no funding, such as the call to raise the age of criminal responsibility. The royal commission into the protection and detention of children in the Northern Territory delivered its final report and 227 recommendations in November, labelling the system a continuing failure which harmed children. The NT government has already acted on some recommendations, including allocating $70m to replace both Don Dale in Darwin and the Alice Springs Youth Detention Centre. While conditions have improved, there are still 38 children incarcerated in the two facilities, with 35 on remand, despite new bail support services and accommodation. The NT government will act on the report “to make sure we have a plan in place that is properly resourced and is able to deliver change on the ground”, the Territory families minister, Dale Wakefield, said on Thursday. Wakefield said 10 recommendations were the responsibility of other parties or the federal government, including a proposed audit of commonwealth expenditure, which was the subject of dispute last month over whether it called for examining NT spending of federal money, or federally funded programs. Wakefield would not provide details of funding or any guarantee that all 217 recommendations would be fully funded but she would be talking to the commonwealth about federal assistance before then. Some recommendations were given support “in principle” because the government believed some needed to go further, Wakefield said, but she wouldn’t be drawn on whether “in principle” meant they might not be funded. Other recommendations not given full support included: Sufficient female staff to supervise female detainees A youth justice case management system Better working conditions for youth justice officers Required retention of all CCTV for at least 12 months Free and unfettered access to facilities and detainees for the children’s commissioner to investigate A custody notification scheme Foster care reform Restrictions on police holding children for more than four hours Asked if the royal commission response was the number one priority for the NT government, Wakefield said the government had to balance its priorities, shared between three areas of children, the economy and jobs, and transparency. Ensuring a healthy economy “is one of the best things we can do for families who are struggling, as well as making sure we are delivering the services that are needed to our community”, she said. The government was criticised last week for announcing more than $100m in tourism grants to towns including Tennant Creek, which is in the grip of a violence and mental health crisis. It has also recently announced $50m for a new museum. Jared Sharp, general manager of the NT Jesuit Social Services, said there was “no higher priority” than youth protection and justice reform, and the NT needed to deliver a budget commitment to fully implement all recommendations. “This is our once in a generation opportunity to get this right, and we’ve got a royal commission that’s given us a blueprint,” Sharp said. He said the federal government went into the royal commission “backing it 50-50” with running costs, and now had to continue that share of the load in responding to it. Olga Havnen, the chief executive of the Danila Dilba health service, said she was waiting until the implementation was released, but she suspected the cost would require federal assistance. “It would be nice to see in this budget … that there is a reasonable level of commitment and some realistic resourcing made for implementing these reforms.” Havnen said a generational plan for investment over 10-15 years had never happened but was needed, particularly for housing, which was at the heart of many Indigenous disadvantage issues. Forensic accounting analyses over several years have identified a concerning trend within succcessive NT governments of apparent misspending of federal GST funds which were earmarked for Indigenous disadvantage. More than 80% of the NT’s Indigenous population lived outside urban areas, and Havnen estimated at least 50% of funds which should be spent on the NT’s remote and disadvantaged Indigenous communities were instead being siphoned elsewhere. “Try go looking for any level of detail around Indigenous expenditure, and it’s completely and utterly opaque.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/01/can-stars-like-lebron-james-save-college-basketball-from-corruption","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T10:00:07Z","webTitle":"Can stars like LeBron James save college basketball from corruption?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/01/can-stars-like-lebron-james-save-college-basketball-from-corruption","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/01/can-stars-like-lebron-james-save-college-basketball-from-corruption","fields":{"headline":"Can stars like LeBron James save college basketball from corruption?","bodyText":"Nobody is stepping up to fix college sports, so if LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony truly believe the NCAA is corrupt they are the ones who will have to change it. The power to alter the American college basketball system with its exploited players and multimillion dollar coaches lies in the hands of the NBA’s biggest names. They can demand an end to the ridiculous one-and-done stipulation that requires a top prospect to wait one season after high school to enter the NBA Draft. They can build a clause into their union’s contract with the NBA that allows kids to come straight into the league the way James and Kobe Bryant and Kevin Garnett once did. Don’t expect college presidents to clean up their athletic departments. Not with endowments booming and wealthy alums craving a basketball fix. Don’t believe the NCAA’s leadership welcomes reform. Not with $10bn coming from Turner and CBS for three weekends of a tournament each March. Don’t hope the coaches find a soul. Not when their $2m a year is tied to making sure that a teenager in extra long gym shorts hits his jump shot. If Carmelo and LeBron don’t start a revolution then the same show will go on and everyone will say college basketball is dirty, the players still will get nothing, the coaches will get rich and the cycle of a broken system will keep spinning around and around. Less than a year after the NCAA looked away while North Carolina won the men’s basketball championship despite academic fraud in the athletic department, the FBI has exposed the sordid process of kickbacks and bribes that deliver players to colleges. Several college assistants have been charged with bribery, fraud and corruption for money paid to youth coaches to help procure their players. Just last week Yahoo! Sports printed a list of top players who have taken money from agents hoping to represent them after college. ESPN reported that the FBI has a phone recording of Arizona coach Sean Miller arranging $100,000 payments to a player. And while there are questions about the Miller report there are none about Louisville vacating their 2013 national championship after a woman said she had sex with basketball recruits for money. After the FBI revealed their investigation last fall, the NCAA formed a commission to study the problems in college basketball. The commission is led by former US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and is filled with former players, coaches and athletic directors. It sounds a lot like other commissions that have studied the various problems over the years without much change. “The recent news of a federal investigation into fraud in college basketball made it very clear the NCAA needs to make substantive changes to the way we operate and do so quickly,” NCAA president Mark Emmert said when he announced the commission. He went on to add that he believes “the vast majority of coaches follow the rules” and added that there are a few “bad actors” who have been aided by “a culture of silence in college basketball.” Emmert is good at such pronouncements. A few years ago, when he was the president at the University of Washington he scoffed at the notion of college sports as out-of-control monster. “Sports is obviously not the biggest priority, or even close to it,” he said when we talked in a room at the school’s 70,000-seat football stadium a few hundred feet from a football training facility bigger than many airport hangers. “But it’s important that the athletic department represents the university the way you want it to.” Six years later, he left to run the NCAA, overseeing a dysfunctional amateur system where basketball players – many from low-income families – are not allowed to touch the millions that flow to the coaches and administrators. It is these players who often are scarred when money is slipped their way, as if the need to keep lights on in their mother’s house is some criminal act. Among the meetings taken by Rice’s commission, the most significant might be the one they had last fall with NBA commissioner Adam Silver and Michele Roberts, the head of the players union. After that meeting, ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski reported that Silver is determined to end the one-and-done rule, opening the door for top high school players to go straight to the NBA. The tradeoff is that those who enter college will be required to wait two years before turning pro. This is where James and Anthony and the other NBA stars come in. Since it seems the NBA and the union will have to be the ones to change the way college basketball operates it is their voices who will have to be the loudest. If they want to end the one-and-done system they must push their union to alter the collective bargaining agreement. If they want college players to be paid they must demand the NCAA listens. Currently, there are no easy solutions. Those, like former president Barack Obama, who believes the NBA should use the G-League to develop young players, haven’t spent much time around the G-League, which is more like a basketball bus station where coaches are lucky to keep the same roster for more than four days. Even worse are the overseas professional leagues which only allow two American players on each team and are notorious for breaking contracts and casting players into the cold without the dignity of a plane ticket home. The only way college basketball is truly going to be saved is if the NBA’s biggest names take up its rotten culture as their cause. Never have athletes’ voices carried so much power. If James and Anthony and other NBA stars want to carry the college players’ fight, the NCAA has no choice but to listen. A revolution awaits. James and Anthony have fired the first shots. Now, do they have the desire to fight the rest of the war?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/04/most-expensive-house-los-angeles-niles-niami","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T07:00:12Z","webTitle":"America's costliest house: developer takes $500m gamble on Bel Air eyrie","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/04/most-expensive-house-los-angeles-niles-niami","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/04/most-expensive-house-los-angeles-niles-niami","fields":{"headline":"America's costliest house: developer takes $500m gamble on Bel Air eyrie","bodyText":"Niles Niami stands on the rooftop of the most expensive house in America, the latest property he has built for billionaires, and considers the best way to describe his design aesthetic. “Badass,” he grins. “Yeah. Badass.” Sweeping in every direction is a panoramic view of Los Angeles and the Pacific Ocean. Beneath him is a gargantuan glass and marble residence with moats, four swimming pools, 20 bedrooms, a nightclub, a bowling alley, a cinema and walls and ceilings made of jellyfish aquariums. Price: $500m. From this hilltop eyrie in Bel Air, LA’s plushest neighbourhood, other estates belonging to the likes of Jennifer Aniston and Elon Musk look puny in comparison. Niami has named this property, which is due to go on the market later this year, The One. Apt, he says, because there is no other like it. “I don’t think it’s cheeky. I think it’s true.” The construction of this and other so-called giga-mansions underscores a new gilded age in the United States and especially in LA. Tech tycoons and other plutocrats are splashing fortunes for homes breaking records for scale, opulence and excess. The splurge comes amid a housing shortage that has fuelled a homelessness crisis, with 57,000 people without permanent shelter in LA county, a ragged army that pitches tents on sidewalks and sleeps in cars, doorways and on the beach. The Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez compared the city’s hilltop mansions to giant tombstones marking the death of humility. Niami, interviewed this week at The One and another property called Opus, shrugged off a question about inequality. “You’re asking the wrong guy. I try to provide things that don’t exist to buyers that can afford them.” For him such properties embody audacity and success. “Anyone who buys one of my homes is making a statement about who they are. These properties reflect LA living at its finest.” The 50-year-old developer is a showman. He drives a Rolls-Royce and sports a Tom Ford jacket, $2,000 sunglasses and a pearly smile. “Braces and veneers,” he says, tapping a tooth. The Los Angeles native is self-made, the son of a single mother schoolteacher. “The house I grew up in was as big as some of my bathrooms now.” He started out doing makeup for films and graduated to producing B movies, including a 1998 Steven Seagal flick called The Patriot. When films didn’t make enough money he switched to real estate. His clients include the rapper Sean Combs, also known as Puff Daddy, and the Winklevoss twins, who minted Bitcoin fortunes. Niami’s brashness has a touch of Del Boy, the wheeler-dealer in the British TV sitcom Only Fools and Horses whose motto was “who dares wins”. “When I do things I just do ’em,” he says. “Wherever it lands, it lands. You only live once. There is no guarantee of anything in life.” That includes finding buyers. The One, once finished later this year, may be a Xanadu fit for Kubla Khan but if Niami doesn’t get a buyer he risks emulating Ozymandias, another figure from antiquity synonymous not with luxury but hubris and ruin. Niami is gambling that a billionaire – any billionaire - will find the opportunity irresistible. He bought the lot, which included a 10,000 sq ft house, for $28m in 2012. Six years and lots of bulldozers later a 105,000 sq ft behemoth fills the site. LA has since tightened building regulations so another home on this scale is unlikely. Size plus panoramic views and interior wonderland will, he hopes, fetch a price that eclipses the $137m paid for a pile in the Hamptons, a US record, and the $300m Saudi Arabia’s crown prince reportedly paid for a French chateau, a world record. The promotional video is not subtle: a handsome fiftysomething man pulls up in a red Ferrari, strolls past glittering waterfalls and hosts a party where beautiful women throng his VIP booth. “One made for the one,” says the tagline. Niami’s clients tend to be single men who have made fortunes in tech, finance or oil and own multiple other properties.

He gave the Guardian a tour of the Opus, a 20,500 sq ft mansion on a cul-de-sac known as Billionaire’s Row. It went on the market last year for $100m, including Damien Hirst paintings and a luxury car museum. No one bit so Niami excluded the art and the cars and recently dropped the price to $77.5m. A dream bachelor pad, says Niami. Televisions slide from the ceiling and spin 360 degrees. Instead of “a pantry with tuna cans” there is a Cristal champagne vault. There is a kitchen but he doesn’t expect it to be used. “Anyone living here will go out for dinner. Or maybe order from the chef in the catering kitchen downstairs.” Niami is seeking investors for other projects in LA and New York.

Donald Trump has stunned Republicans and his supporters in the National Rifle Association by endorsing universal background checks and other gun control measures. In an extraordinary televised White House meeting, the president rebuked congressional Republicans for being “afraid” and “petrified” of the NRA as he offered support to revive a plan that failed to pass the Senate after the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre of 2012. “You have to be very, very powerful on background checks,” Trump told the gathering, endorsing a measure supported by 84% of Americans. “People want to see something happen.” Trump also repeated his promise to ban “bump stocks” and talked about age restrictions. It sounds promising but given the president’s erratic nature Republicans appear unsure how to proceed: “Everybody’s trying to absorb what we just heard,” said John Cornyn, a gun control advocate in the party. As to whether Trump would stick to his views, one Democrat, Dick Durbin, said: “I wouldn’t bet the farm on it.” There are other hopeful signs on gun control though, with Walmart and Dick’s Sporting Goods announcing they will no longer sell firearms or ammunition to under-21s. Dick’s, a major retailer, said it would also join Walmart in taking assault rifles off its shelves. Elsewhere in the White House, the president’s communications director, Hope Hicks, has resigned one day after giving congressional testimony that she sometimes told “white lies” to appease Trump. Hicks denied having lied about substantive matters pertaining to Russia. * * * Border skirmishes – Lots of wailing and teeth-gnashing in the government today after the EU effectively rejected Theresa May’s demand to leave the customs union and common market while magically keeping the Irish border open. Brussels insists Northern Ireland will have to stay in the EU customs union if the British government continues to fail to produce an alternative plan. But May has told the Commons that “no UK prime minister could ever agree” to that. Meanwhile, it was revealed that May has been forced into a major concession allowing EU citizens who arrive during the post-Brexit transition period to stay permanently – which will deepen Tory divisions. May at least managed to split sides in a benign way when she told some jokes last night about being the Maybot, working with David “Mad Max” Davis and calling another snap election. * * * The first snows of spring – It’s the start of spring and don’t be deceived by the continuing snowy weather (more on which here) because the trend of the season’s blooms and wildlife arriving earlier and earlier is continuing, according to the Woodland Trust. But the National Trust disagrees, saying this spring isn’t as early as the one in 2016 (seriously, who to Trust on this?). If you, like many others, have been calling the current state of affairs “Snowmageddon”, Steven Poole looks at how “-mageddon” has been hived off from the Bible’s “Armageddon” and tagged on to a host of comparatively mild inconveniences. Significantly in this case though, both Armageddon and Snowmageddon involve a Beast. End times? * * * Cosmic dawn – “Didn’t I read how astronomers had already detected this?” you ask. But no! The signals just picked up from the earliest stars in the universe are indeed the first of their kind. It is being dubbed the “cosmic dawn” – about 180m years after the Big Bang – when enough hydrogen had clumped together for the first stars to ignite. They were massive, blue and didn’t last long, but they kicked off hydrogen reactions that have left a fingerprint in the background radiation of today’s universe. The discovery might help scientists prove the existence of dark matter (no, you didn’t already read about them figuring that one out either). * * * And finally – Keith Richards has apologised to Mick Jagger after telling the Wall Street Journal Magazine that his bandmate was a “randy old bastard” who should get “the snip”, ie a vasectomy. In fairness they should probably have cut that bit. Lunchtime read: Dying for a bit of bacon Too late if you’ve already eaten it – bacon really does cause cancer, writes Bee Wilson. The conclusion is backed up by years of research and warnings about the nitrate and nitrite chemicals used in processed meats. So why is it still sold everywhere? Why are we still eating it? The “bacon scare” blew up in 1975 in America, Wilson explains, but the meat industry argued that these chemicals are to bacon “as yeast is to bread”, that they protect against botulism poisoning, and bacon simply could not exist without them. Food safety authorities backed off. Today, bacon is even defended as a health food by some advocates of the paleo diet – yet, writes Wilson, “the epidemiological data, based on surveys of what people eat, is now devastatingly clear that diets high in ‘processed meats’ lead to a higher incidence of cancer … The technology now exists to make the pink meats we love in a less damaging form, which raises the question of why the old kind is still so freely sold.” Sport England’s head coach, Eddie Jones, says he no longer feels safe using British public transport after being verbally and physically abused on a train following his side’s Calcutta Cup defeat on Saturday. Andy Murray is so pleased with his quickening recovery from recent hip surgery that he hopes to return to the practice court ahead of schedule, within a month. One of Chris Froome’s most likely defences against a possible anti-doping charge does not appear to be supported by UK Anti-Doping data released via a freedom of information request. Jason Kenny, Jack Carlin and Ryan Owens won silver for Great Britain in the men’s team sprint at the UCI Track Cycling World Championships in Apeldoorn. Tottenham romped home in the second half of their FA Cup last-16 replay against Rochdale with a cocky display on a carpet of snow to set up a quarter-final at Swansea after the first half at Wembley had belonged to VAR. And Formula One lost a day of testing in Barcelona because of the cold weather that has engulfed Europe. Business Asian shares have mostly been lower, though the Shanghai Composite made a slight gain. The region’s indices tracked losses on Wall Street where the Fed chairman’s speech hinting at quicker interest rate rises is still reverberating. If you’re looking for a change, sterling is buying $1.375 or €1.127 at the moment. The papers It’s the first day of spring (apparently) yet it’s snowing on the front pages. The i goes with “Whiteout Britain” while the the Guardian has a snowy picture with the headline “The beast bites” – we splash on Brexit, however, with calls for Theresa May to reveal her Irish border plan. The Times also leads on Brexit, saying that David Davis is warning Britain would not pay its EU divorce bill unless Europe reverses its stance on Northern Ireland staying in the customs union. The Telegraph is upset, saying Remainers are trying to stop Brexit with a “proxy war”. The Mail manages to combine weather and other news with a picture of Max Mosley in a snowstorm and a story saying police are examining whether he committed perjury over his knowledge of a racist election pamphlet. The Sun uses a similar picture and has a similar story on its front but with a headline that manages to combine CS Lewis and a sex orgy. The FT joins the winter theme but is talking about a different kind of freeze: one on the high street as chain stores Maplin and Toys R Us close down. The paper says it has been a brutal winter for the economy. Unusually, the Mirror follows the FT: “Heartbreak on the High Street” is its lead, but it also has a picture of snow chaos and the title “Ice Age Britain”.

The change, effective from July, comes as doctors’ groups, politicians and a Senate inquiry criticised Australian health insurers for being overpriced and “useless”. Bupa, a UK-based company, made 49% of its worldwide profits from Australia and New Zealand alone in 2016. It is Australia’s biggest private health insurance provider. Jennifer Doggett, a fellow for the Centre for Policy Development, said the move was focused on creating cheap, basic, low-cover packages that were attractive to younger customers. She said this trend towards less effective cover spoke to an underlying failure within the private health model. It means that private health insurance does not ease pressure on the public system. The Bupa changes cancel cover for cataract procedures, hip and knee replacements, pregnancy and IVF, and kidney dialysis for those on “minimum benefits” policies. A Bupa spokesman told the Australian it would cut costs and lead to lower premiums, but would not reveal how much would be saved. In October, the government announced a plan to discount private health premiums for those under 30, while existing policy also imposes a penalty for those over 30 without insurance. “With the current government’s carrot and stick approach, there is a certain percentage of the population who will take out insurance even if it offers no benefit at all,” said Doggett. Many low-risk customers choose to buy cheap, “junk” insurance because it is cheaper than paying the Medicare levy, she said. “What’s in the product is irrelevant to them. That shows how ridiculous the situation is. The government is subsidising a product that people are buying to avoid tax. It’s obviously an incredibly inefficient way to fund healthcare.” On Tuesday, a survey conducted by Essential found a large number of Australians wanted the government to stop subsidising private health, and use the money to make dental care free on Medicare. In the survey 48% supported the move and 32% opposed it. In October, the head of the Australian Medical Association said too many health policies were “useless”, and a Senate committee in December found the number of low-cover polices had “increased dramatically”. For the newly-amended Bupa policies, the affected procedures had previously been listed as “restricted cover”. This meant customers would likely still have paid large out-of-pocket fees to access them. Doggett said this meant most private policies did not take any pressure off the public system. “If they go private they could be out of pocket by several thousand dollars, even with a decent policy. So a lot of people would say well I’ll just go to the public hospital. “The public hospitals say they have to deal with the fallout from these junk policies because they’re not taking any pressure off them.” She added there was a risk that younger or low-risk customers would be caught out by their low-cover plans. “It is a bit of a dangerous game ... the more you [remove cover], the less it is a genuine insurance product. “Hip and knee replacements are one of the main benefits for people in private health insurance. For elective surgery they can jump the queue and get it done earlier. Removing joint replacements really downgrades the worth of the policy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/01/monas-david-walsh-donates-250000-to-tasmanias-anti-pokies-movement","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T06:33:41Z","webTitle":"Mona's David Walsh donates $250,000 to Tasmania’s anti-pokies movement","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/01/monas-david-walsh-donates-250000-to-tasmanias-anti-pokies-movement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/01/monas-david-walsh-donates-250000-to-tasmanias-anti-pokies-movement","fields":{"headline":"Mona's David Walsh donates $250,000 to Tasmania’s anti-pokies movement","bodyText":"David Walsh, the multimillionaire gambler and founder of Hobart’s Museum of Old and New Art (Mona), has revealed he donated $250,000 to Tasmania’s anti-pokies movement in an attempt to “de-bias” a state election campaign believed to be flooded with pro-pokies money. It comes as the Hodgman Liberal government is facing calls to reveal before Saturday’s election how much it has received in donations from the hospitality industry, particularly Federal Group, the family-owned company with the exclusive pokies machine licence in the state. Analysts say the election appears to have been the most expensive in Tasmania’s history, with advertising spending on behalf of the Liberals dwarfing that of Labor and the Greens, which both support removing poker machines from pubs and clubs. In a blog post on the Mona website, Walsh accused the pro-pokies lobby of “trying to bias our population” by spending heavily in the campaign. “That’s why I’m involved. I can live with pokies, provided they are what the people want, so I’m spending money (but much less money that the pro-pokie people) to attempt to de-bias the election,” he wrote. Walsh said opinions in democracy, unlike betting markets, should be weighted evenly. “When they aren’t (because some, like me, can get their opinions heard) the right to express an opinion should be voided by skin in the game,” he said. “You shouldn’t be able to buy an election for the purpose of enriching yourself.” Walsh acknowledged he made his fortune from gambling, but said he got lucky. He said pokies appeared to be the only form of gambling that was addictive by design. He said his support of the Rein in the Pokies campaign could cost him if, as polls suggest is likely, the Liberals retained government. “The Liberal party has been a significant ally, particularly with the [Mona] festivals, but it is the favourite to win the election, and, even though I stated my opinion before they did, some Liberals might be grumpy at me thereafter,” he wrote. “I might regret my decision to spend $250 grand opposing pokies, but that won’t make it the wrong decision.” Walsh’s voluntary disclosure comes as the government continues to decline to say how much it has received from the hospitality industry. Asked repeatedly at a Sky News leaders’ debate on Wednesday whether voters deserved to know who was bankrolling the Liberal campaign, the premier, Will Hodgman, said: “Yeah, and they will and it will be in accordance with the rules by which we are all bound.” Tasmania does not have campaign-finance disclosure laws. It is subject to federal legislation requiring annual release of total donations and the specifics of any donation greater than $13,500. Donations made this financial year are not required to be made public until 2019. Labor claims the government and its hospitality industry supporters would have spent about $5m on advertising. If elected, the ALP leader, Rebecca White, has promised legislation requiring public reporting of all donations above a threshold less than $2,000 within 14 days of the money being received. But Labor says it will not release more than the existing law requires unless it is changed. The Greens and the Jacqui Lambie Network say they reveal donations in as close to real time as possible. Labor has pledged to remove pokies from pubs and clubs by 2023, but would allow Federal Group’s gaming machine monopoly in casinos to stand. Critics accuse it of threatening hospitality jobs and denying the state a revenue stream. Hodgman says the government would end Federal Group’s monopoly outside casinos by licensing individual pubs and clubs directly under contracts that would last until 2043. Critics say the government is just giving the industry what it wants, having adopted a Federal Group and Tasmanian Hospitality Association submission as its policy and ignoring evidence of the social harm of poker machines. Federal owns 12 of the state’s 20 biggest gaming machine venues. In his blog, Walsh highlighted a 1993 quote by the Federal Group chief executive, Greg Farrell, that “direct access to gaming machines in pubs and clubs would have a disastrous effect on the social and special culture of Tasmania”. The comment came as the state government was first considering allowing pokies in pubs and clubs after two decades of the machines being restricted to Federal Group casinos in Hobart and Launceston. Walsh wrote that Farrell “believed that he might not get the poker machine licence, and if he didn’t, and others did, it would impact his casino business”. “In terms of probabilities he was right. In terms of ethics, he was also right. But I bet he wishes he hadn’t said it.” A Federal Group spokeswoman declined to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/03/embrace-ugly-fruit-and-compost-cutting-back-on-food-waste","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T21:13:43Z","webTitle":"Embrace 'ugly' fruit and compost: cutting back on food waste","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/03/embrace-ugly-fruit-and-compost-cutting-back-on-food-waste","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/03/embrace-ugly-fruit-and-compost-cutting-back-on-food-waste","fields":{"headline":"Embrace 'ugly' fruit and compost: cutting back on food waste","bodyText":"Imagine filling five shopping bags with fresh fruit and veggies, paying for the lot and then dumping one entire bulging bag in the bin. Sounds crazy? That’s the reality of how much food Australians waste – up to 20% of everything we buy, according to FoodWise. The $8bn worth of edible food we collectively turf each year isn’t just a giant waste of money; the water, energy and resources put into growing and transporting it are squandered too. The IHE Delft institute for water education for example, estimates about 1600 litres of water is needed to grow just one kilo of wheat in Australia – discard the bread that wheat turns into, and that water has been spent for nothing. Worse yet, rotting food in landfill gives off greenhouse gases, further harming the environment. The solution? More edible food must end up in bellies rather than bins. Here’s our guide on how to help. Stop buying so much food We’re all guilty when it comes to the scourge of food waste. Each year, Aussie households throw away 345kg of food – almost a kilogram a day – wasting an average $1036 of food per family each year. The worst offenders are 18- to 24-year-olds, families with children, and households bringing in more than $100,000 a year. Food gets binned because we shop for things we don’t need, cook too much food, fail to use leftovers and buy takeaway even when the fridge is full. Avoid making all that waste in the first place by bringing home only what’s needed. Keep an eye on home stocks and shop to a list. Be extra careful with bread, milk, cheese, bananas, chicken, eggs, lettuce and fresh herbs – according to FoodWise, these are some of Australia’s most wasted foods. (Accidentally over-shopped? Check out FoodWise’s ingredient guide for storage, cooking and reusing tips.) “Reducing food waste is similar to recycling. One person doing it is not a big deal, but when millions of people do it, the results quickly add up to a very big result,” says Jon Dee, who helped establish Planet Ark and now runs the DoSomething! charity, which initiated FoodWise. “The other benefit is that when you save food you also save money. Most households could easily save many hundreds of dollars a year.” Embrace “ugly” fruit and veggies When Craig Reucassel last year stood atop a giant pile of freshly picked Queensland bananas – edible yet destined to rot because they didn’t meet supermarkets’ bizarre cosmetic requirements – the millions watching ABC’s War on Waste series were rightly outraged. Turns out up to 40% of Australia’s edible fruit and vegetables are rejected before they even reach the shops, just because they’re a bit wonky or blemished. Shoppers can help to halt the madness by embracing “ugly” food. Woolworths offers the cheaper “odd bunch” range, although beware produce wrapped in unsustainable plastic. Likewise, New South Wales’ Harris Farm grocery chain has “imperfect picks”, while Food Connect Brisbane offers the “unruly box”. Farmers markets are a good option, too, as they sidestep strict supermarket standards. Or buy direct from farmers themselves – Queensland’s LuvaBerry this summer sold 1kg bags of rejected raspberries for just $10 as part of its own war on waste. Small businesses are also popping up to rescue ugly yet edible produce, such as Eat Me Chutneys in Sydney, Ugly Duck Preserves in Brisbane and north Queensland’s green banana flour, invented by a farmer tired of turfing perfectly good lady finger bananas due to stringent supermarket requirements. “Each week we had five tonnes of waste due to size, shape and oversupply,” says Krista Watkins, whose husband Robert invented the flour. “This wasted produce is still nutrient dense, it’s been grown with the same love and attention that the A-grade produce has. What we offer is a different take on an old favourite.” Rescue food that’s on its way out Once food has made it inside your home, don’t be so quick to send it to the bin. Use-by dates do show when food has to go, but best before dates are more of an indication; food can be eaten after this date if stored well. Make chutneys and sauces out of wilted fresh produce and get inventive with leftovers and scraps: resources such as the NSW government’s free Love Your Leftovers app, Sarah Wilson’s Simplicious cookbook and Sustainable Table’s The Clever Cook eBook can help. Support those organisations helping businesses to reduce their food waste. Not-for-profit OzHarvest rescues more than 100 tonnes of food waste each week from 3000-plus donors, including supermarkets, hotels, airports and farmers, delivering it to charities for free. The Yume food app allows hospitality businesses to sign up and buy surplus produce from Australian producers for at least 20% below regular wholesale prices, saving on landfill. Or go “freegan” and join the dumpster diving movement; a treasure trove of perfectly edible food is turfed into supermarket skips each week. “There is a serious thrill to lifting a lid, looking inside a bin, and realising that you’re about to bring home chocolate bars, avocados, loaves of bread fresh from that morning, and everything you’d need for a week’s worth of fruit salad – all for free,” Larissa Milo-Dale wrote on Medium last May, after dumpster diving around Australia for a year. “So much is wasted that shouldn’t be, and so many people go hungry that needn’t.” Sustainably deal with any food that can’t be eaten Even when produce becomes unsafe to eat, it shouldn’t go in the bin. Mixed with other junk in landfill, rotting food is starved of oxygen and so creates methane, a greenhouse gas 25 times more potent than carbon pollution from car exhausts. In contrast, when composted or run through a worm farm, food waste turns into vital nutrients crucial to a healthy garden. Live in a tiny apartment? NSW-made Bokashi bins require little space and use microbes to break down food waste without any smells. Even easier: some councils now allow food scraps in green waste bins. When purchasing your own home unit, go through Compost Revolution for massive discounts offered with council support. Workplace food waste is a major issue, too, but companies serviced by Sita can easily add organic waste removal to their contract, or check with councils for green waste recycling initiatives. Eating is an inevitable part of life – wasting food doesn’t have to be.

The government hopes to save $1.2bn by making new migrants wait three years instead of two before they can access certain government payments, including family tax benefit, paid parental leave, and carers’ allowance. The changes would hurt those arriving on family and skilled visas, but would not apply to humanitarian visas. The Australian Council of Social Services (Acoss) has condemned the measures as harsh. The delays threaten to push migrants into poverty and hardship, creating a new “underclass of migrants”, Acoss says. On Thursday, Senate estimates heard the measure would affect 110,000 children between July 2018, when it takes effect, and 2021. It would also affect 50,000 families eligible for family tax benefit part A, and 30,000 individuals waiting for other payments. The Department of Social Services said on Thursday it did not consult migrant resettlement services or anyone outside government about the changes. The government says the changes are designed to help new migrants become “self-sufficient” when they first arrive in Australia. But new Labor senator Kristina Keneally questioned how denying people government support would achieve that aim. Keneally recounted her own experience as a migrant arriving in Australian, saying social security was critical in supporting her while she established herself and found a job. “In my circumstance I arrived here and went and sought assistance in terms of finding a job and accommodation, and my entire intent was to be able to support myself,” Keneally said. “I was seeking employment and indeed found employment, but without those types of support when I first arrived here, those two things would have been much more difficult.” Liberal senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells rejected the criticism. She said she knew of individual migrants who had come here without a cent of social security support, and were now among the most wealthy in the country. “Let’s just park your experience,” Fierravanti-Wells said to Keneally. “From our perspective we believe that new migrants who are granted a permanent visa or a relevant temporary visas on or after the first of July 2018 should be placed and well-placed to support themselves through work, existing resources, or family support. “That is a decision of government and might I say, plenty of people have come to this country and not got a cent in terms of support, and today are amongst our most wealthy in Australia.” Keneally responded: “So is that what you hope will happen for every person who comes? If we deny them support they are going to become amongst our most wealthy citizens?” There are a range of exemptions from the changes to account for hardship or difficult circumstances. Humanitarian visas are completely exempt. Those who come on a partner visa but then have their relationship break down will also be exempt. Acoss’s director of policy and advocacy, Edwina MacDonald, said late last year the changes would only serve to harm a group that makes “an enormous contribution to our society”. “This will hurt people who lose their job, people who need to care for a child with disability, or a family member with a terminal illness,” MacDonald said. “It will disproportionately affect women and see more children live in poverty. This will drive more people to our charities for meeting the essentials of life, such as food and shelter.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/02/lessons-in-feminism-via-jacinda-ardern-michaelia-cash-and-bill-shorten","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T01:25:35Z","webTitle":"A lesson in the power of feminism via Jacinda Ardern, Michaelia Cash and Bill Shorten | Van Badham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/02/lessons-in-feminism-via-jacinda-ardern-michaelia-cash-and-bill-shorten","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/02/lessons-in-feminism-via-jacinda-ardern-michaelia-cash-and-bill-shorten","fields":{"headline":"Lessons in feminism via Jacinda Ardern, Michaelia Cash and Bill Shorten","bodyText":"It says much about the political and media moment we are in that it’s not the bait in the headline but the morsels of truth buried deep beneath that provide stories of the day worth chewing over. Three incidents this week offer tasty proof of this. The first concerns an interview with Labor’s Bill Shorten in GQ, which Newscorp reviewed with the title “Shorten drops F-bomb and reveals biggest career regret”. Shorten swearing is hardly news – at least not for anyone with the ability to imagine what goes on in a Labor caucus room. But the “bomb” was dropped in regards to Shorten’s criticism of the government’s attachment to the infamous TPP free trade deal – a document to which no one but the Coalition has been privy. For generations, the right-faction Labor leadership from which Shorten was spawned has exercised excruciating caution in its public views on trade and finance. Yet “What the fuck?” came from Shorten to GQ, “They can’t even provide us with how the agreement benefits people.” In terms of a Labor paradigm shift, it’s not the language but the suggestion of an abandoned orthodoxy underneath it that’s tectonic. And what I think has allowed Shorten to reposition with such confidence – let us not pretend a party leader’s statements are ever, ever glib – is a brand new, emerging political reality suggested by the week’s two other hidden stories. Much has been made of how Jacinda Ardern found herself the subject of intrusive questioning into her personal life in a 60 Minutes interview this week. To watch New Zealand’s prime minister interrogated on the circumstances of her unborn child’s conception in such a way that would even get your uncle banned from Christmas dinner was revolting and rightly provoked condemnation worldwide. But more interesting than the condemnation was the disparity reported between interviewer Charles Wooley and his audience. His defence was: “I know that some people in New Zealand might be annoyed that we didn’t talk about housing, or university fees ... but Australian audiences aren’t very interested in the minutiae of New Zealand politics.” Mr Wooley might do well to read the Guardian – then he’d learn how deeply uninterested Australians are in the private lives of politicians, a fact borne out in the latest Essential poll to follow the Barnaby Joyce scandal. Any Australian news publication can apprise Mr Wooley just how significant to our electorate the issue of housing affordability is. How Ardern intends to overcome her conservative predecessors’ legacy of failure on this issue in a country now described as “divided by wealth” has important insights for us given our own preoccupation with inequality. Whether Charles Wooley thinks she’s “hot or not” might be less a gauge of her popularity than her phased reintroduction of free tertiary education for New Zealanders, her respectful engagement with Indigenous policy and her leadership on recompense measures for abuse survivors. Her old-school leftwing politics have taken her own Labour party from a dismal 23% standing in the polls into both government and a primary that’s increased to 48%. The post-interview outrage is not just because a woman’s achievement has been minimised. It’s about what substantive policy issues were left unaddressed while the minimising took place. And this, I think, is the spectacular misjudgment made by Michaelia Cash when she detonated herself in Senate estimates yesterday. Labor’s Doug Cameron may have been preparing to wreck her on the subject of her office’s relationship to a dodgy raid on the AWU, but he was hardly in combat tank mode with questions about her new staffing arrangements. “If you want to start discussing staff matters be very, very careful,” Cash threatened, then snapped, “Because I’m happy to sit here and name every young woman in Mr Shorten’s office about which rumours in this place abound. If you want to go down that path today, I will do it.” It was an inept attempt to smear Shorten with the political entrails of Joyce, but it came across as conspicuously gendered slinging of mud. Audible gasps in the estimates room were nothing compared to either the horror of the press gallery, the roar of social media or the cold political homicide performed on Cash by Labor’s Penny Wong, who came in, forced the minister to apologise and swept out. Cash herself did not return to the room, but the space she left behind in the political conversation was filled by fellow conservatives in the media – Andrew Bolt, Peta Credlin, Sharri Markson - who filed in one after another to denounce her. But again, the story is not Cash, or her staffing arrangements or even what happened at the AWU. It’s her failure to heed an unsuspected, overwhelming feminist zeitgeist that’s entirely transformed the context in which political narratives now appear. Even months ago, an unpleasantly sexist interview was just unpleasant, a bit of spiteful rumour-mongering, a reason for personal shame. Since then, #MeToo has happened. #TimesUp has happened. A popular political feminist consciousness has solidified across the electorate and anything resembling the old paradigm has a brand that is not only stale but toxic. The most recognisable avatar of the anti-gun avalanche in the United States is an enraged teenage girl with a shaved head. Steve Bannon may be evil but he’s certainly a genius, and he made a very salient point in his own interview with GQ: “The Time’s Up movement [is] basically going against 10,000 years of recorded history. That’s the power of it,” he said. “You see here something that’s in a very early, raw stage, but I’ve never seen such potential power in something.” No wonder the local conservatives are rallying to disassociate themselves from their tainted kin. Because locally, it’s Shorten who’s realised the best leadership lesson for the labour parties of the west isn’t in Jeremy Corbyn or Bernie Sanders, both defeated. It’s the visibly distinct, victorious feminist brand of Jacinda Ardern. And feminism isn’t a brand you actually have to be a woman to share. Shorten’s alignment with a union movement led by Sally McManus, a deputy like Tanya Plibersek, a Senate champion like Penny Wong and a caucus heaving with 47% female talent – 48% if feminist star candidate Ged Kearney prevails in Batman – marks him in stark contrast to Turnbull’s pale, male and anti-feminist hordes. No wonder he’s bullish; those who can grasp that future is, indeed, female are the ones who will still be around when the future happens. Which is why the most important comment in Shorten’s GQ interview was one Newscorp stashed at the end. “I wish I had my time in the union again, in terms of promoting more women,” said Shorten. “I’m a big supporter of 50/50 in the ALP,” he said. Oh, Bill, yes. Of course you are.

Can we bring the Mooch back now?","bodyText":"This is a perilous time for Hope. One day she admitted telling “white lies” to spare the president’s orange blushes. But honestly, those lies were never ever about the whole Russian cover-up. At least, that’s what the communications director testified to the House intelligence committee during eight hours of questioning. The next day we learned that Hope Hicks is leaving the West Wing at some unspecified date because she wants to do something – anything – other than work for Donald Trump. But honestly it never ever had anything to do with the whole eight hours of interrogation about Russia. How do we reconcile Hope with reality in the Trump White House? Let’s see if we can find some clues in the official White House statements about her departure, which she presumably had a hand in writing, being the communications director and all. “I will miss having her by my side but when she approached me about pursuing other opportunities, I totally understood,” said Trump himself, sounding totally unlike the man who spends his mornings and evenings on the Twitter machine. “I am sure we will work together again in the future.” Translation: Even I wouldn’t want to work with me. And she knows where all the bodies are buried, so I only hope she never agrees a deal with Robert Mueller. Maybe the chance of future employment will entice her to keep quiet? “She has served her country with great distinction,” said John Kelly, Trump’s kamikaze chief of staff. “To say that she will be missed, is an understatement.” Translation: She was the only one who could tell the boss he was wrong without reading endless tweets about getting fired. Now who do I ask for help? “There are no words to adequately express my gratitude to President Trump,” said Hope herself. If you can’t express yourself in words, perhaps you weren’t the very best communications director the White House has ever seen. Fortunately, the White House added some extra “background information” to help us understand whatever happened to Hope. “Hope is the President’s longest serving aide having worked with him before he announced his candidacy,” said the statement, presumably approved by Hope. It’s kind of sad that his longest serving aide only lasted three years, but – on the other hand – it’s kind of an eternity when your boss is Donald Trump. “After three years, she approached the president and told him she wanted to leave so she could start exploring opportunities outside of the WH,” they added. So she’s quitting for no job prospect, just because unemployment is better than her current job. What’s the point of having a family if you don’t need to spend more time with them, at a time like this? “Her role evolved from what was initially considered to be an unconventional press and communications aide to formally being announced WH communications director in the summer of 2017,” they said. That’s an awesome career progression! Of course, “unconventional press aide” doesn’t look great on a resumé, and six months in a director role isn’t entirely professional either. Perhaps a little communications advice would help tighten up the job applications? “In this position, Hope has…worked with Press Secretary Sarah Sanders to stabilize the press and communications teams after initial phases of transition,” they helpfully explained. Ah yes, those plural phases of transition. There was that Jason guy who was supposed to get the job, but didn’t because his mistress embarrassed him. Then there was Sean Spicer, who lied about the inauguration crowd size and never recovered from his SNL spoof. Then there was Sean’s friend Mike, who didn’t want to sell his stake in his communications firms. Then there was Sean again, who was still getting spoofed by Melissa McCarthy. Then there was Anthony “The Mooch” Scaramucci, whose life-span was shorter than a frickin’ firefly. And then there was Hope. Six comms chiefs – soon to be seven – in just 13 months of a presidency. There are Italian prime ministers who would be embarrassed by such a short time in office. “Her exact departure is to be determined but it will be sometime in the next few weeks,” the White House added. Seriously Mr President: if this is the best your beloved communications director can do, you might want to ask your favorite Russian troll factory for help. Artful, it is not. Of course, it might not be easy to find a replacement for the Worst. Job. Ever. How exactly do you direct communications around a man who live-tweets what he sees on Fox News, when he’s not tweeting about how DISGRACEFUL his attorney general is? How do you explain away the words of a man who builds his campaign around toadying to the National Rifle Association and then urges members of Congress to stand up to the NRA? How do you allow your boss to go to a prayer breakfast after news has broken about him paying a rather large sum of cash to an actress who starred in morally dubious movies? How do you testify under oath about the press statement you helped draft about the president’s son meeting with Russians to get their stolen dirt about Hillary Clinton? How do you protect the president’s son-in-law when he’s so desperate for cash that he’s reportedly getting played by foreign officials, when he’s not getting played by companies lending millions to his family business? There is only one person who can live with this unique combination of corruption, deception, flip-flops and brain farts. There is only one person who can polish the proverbial turd into something shiny enough to feature on a prime-time show at Fox News. Maybe he can get a little graphic about male genitalia. Maybe his ambition is fueled by a container full of amphetamines. But nobody gets Trump quite like him. It’s time to abandon Hope. It’s time for the return of The Mooch.

Loretta Lee, who worked for Google from 2008 to 2016, filed suit this month against the Silicon Valley giant for sexual harassment, gender discrimination, and wrongful termination in California state court. In the complaint, which was first published by Gizmodo, Lee alleges that she was subject to “lewd comments, pranks and even physical violence” on a daily basis, including having male colleagues spike her drinks with alcohol, shoot Nerf balls at her, send her sexually suggestive messages and, in one case, slap her in the face. Lee was especially disturbed by an incident when she found a male co-worker on all fours beneath her desk and “believed he may have installed some type of camera or similar device under her desk”, the complaint states. The suit alleges that Google’s treatment of Lee was “consistent with a pattern and practice of ignoring sexual harassment in the workplace, making no significant efforts to take corrective action, and punishing the victim”. “We have strong policies against harassment in the workplace and review every complaint we receive,” said Ty Sheppard, a Google spokesman, in a statement. “We take action when we find violations – including termination of employment.” Lee’s is the latest in a string of lawsuits that have targeted the company over workplace issues involving harassment, speech and diversity over the past year, and especially since an internal controversy over James Damore’s controversial memo about gender burst into the open in August. Damore’s firing (for “advancing harmful gender stereotypes”) ignited outrage on the right that the technology company was biased against conservatives. Damore subsequently filed a class-action suit alleging that Google discriminates against white male conservatives. But another former Google employee, the site reliability engineer Tim Chevalier, alleged in his own lawsuit last week that he was fired for speaking out against Damore’s memo on internal message boards, which Chevalier’s lawyer described as a “cesspool of bullying and harassment”. Google’s response to the harassment of Lee was part of the problem, according to her complaint. The engineer feared that filing a formal complaint would result in her being “ostracized” by her co-workers, but she was pressured repeatedly by human resources. Lee’s fear of retaliation, the suit alleges, was justified when co-workers stopped approving her work. “Though she diligently wrote code, no one in her group would approve it, which stalled the entire project,” the complaint states. She was subsequently fired for poor performance. Lee and her attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ellen Pao, the prominent tech investor who lost a high-profile gender discrimination lawsuit in 2015, said on Twitter that the case was an example of “how code review can be used as a weapon of exclusion”. Liz Fong-Jones, a site reliability engineer at Google, compared Google unfavorably to another major tech company with well-publicized workplace culture problems. “When you’re doing worse than Uber at coming clean about and fixing the systematic problems in company culture and the significant levels of mistrust in/ineffectiveness of HR/ER,” she tweeted, “you know something has gone really wrong.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/mar/09/facetune-photoshopping-app-instagram-body-image-debate","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T08:01:32Z","webTitle":"FaceTune is conquering Instagram – but does it take airbrushing too far?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/09/facetune-photoshopping-app-instagram-body-image-debate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/mar/09/facetune-photoshopping-app-instagram-body-image-debate","fields":{"headline":"FaceTune is conquering Instagram – but does it take airbrushing too far?","bodyText":"The Oxford English Dictionary chose “selfie” as its word of the year at the end of 2013. At around the same time, four Israeli computer science PhD students and a supreme court clerk had an idea for an app that that would allow regular people to do Photoshop-style retouching of their smartphones photos. That app was FaceTune. The team behind it hoped they’d be able to sell enough copies of the app to raise a few hundred thousand dollars. Instead, the selfie-editing app was a runaway hit whose digital fingerprints can be seen all over the internet: pores, lines and zits are airbrushed to oblivion, teeth whitened and waists nipped. It has been endorsed by a swarm of Instagram influencers and celebrities including Khloe Kardashian – the social media equivalent of a royal warrant. The first version has sold more than 10m copies (at between $3.99 and $5.99 each) and was Apple’s most popular paid app of 2017. “We were really surprised. We didn’t think any single app would be significant enough to finance the entire growth of the company. It felt like we had won the lottery,” said Zeev Farbman, CEO of Lightricks, the Jerusalem-based startup that makes FaceTune as well as a handful of other photo and video-editing apps. At the end of 2016, Lightricks launched an upgraded version of their flagship app, FaceTune 2. It’s free to download but $5.99 per month to unlock all of the features, which include a live-editing tool for users to tweak their selfies even before snapping the photo. It has already been downloaded more than 20m times, with almost 500,000 subscribers paying an average of $40 per year. FaceTune’s success comes down to the way it makes it child’s play to alter images with far more precision than Snapchat filters but less complexity than professional editing tools like Photoshop. “I mainly use it for beauty product and lifestyle shots to brighten them up,” said beauty blogger Amelia Perrin. “I’m quite a technophobe and can’t use anything like Photoshop, so it’s nice to have a relatively simple tool to sharpen things up.” “If done properly, it should be hard to tell you’ve used it,” said Natasha Church, a makeup and beauty blogger who has made YouTube tutorials explaining how she edits her photos. “If I’m taking a selfie I might use the ‘heal’ tool to get rid of a spot. Or if you’ve got enlarged pores you can use the ‘smooth’ tool. If I’m wearing sparkly eyeshadow I might use the ‘detail’ tool to make it pop a bit more,” she said. All too often, however, FaceTune users go overboard, smoothing their selfies into amorphous avatars or slimming their bodies to the point of anatomical impossibility. Overzealous FaceTuning is so widespread that recently celebrity model Chrissy Tiegen weighed in: “I don’t know what real skin looks like any more.” Getting the balance right creates a huge dilemma for social media “influencers”. “Nobody wants to be called a fake,” said Brooke Erin Duffy, an assistant professor at Cornell University who is studying self-presentation on Instagram. “Influencers very much feel they need to present themselves authentically while getting the best image possible.” This can be challenging to negotiate within the larger “call-out” culture of policing people’s images on social media. “It’s not seen as acceptable to put up a photo with a big spot. So you either put up the spot photo and get hate in the comments or you remove the spot.” Be careful not to remove too many imperfections or the hate will return, she warns. An obvious giveaway that someone has used FaceTune to slim their body is the warping of straight lines such as doorways or railings in the background of photos. “We did not create FaceTune for body manipulations, but I’m not sure it’s our place to decide how people use the app,” said Farbman. “Social media is not a reality show, it’s a director’s cut of your life. Some people are more successful in creating that director’s cut than others.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/28/hope-hicks-resigns-trump-communications-director-white-house","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T07:28:48Z","webTitle":"Hope Hicks resigns as Trump's White House communications director","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/28/hope-hicks-resigns-trump-communications-director-white-house","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/feb/28/hope-hicks-resigns-trump-communications-director-white-house","fields":{"headline":"Hope Hicks resigns as Trump's White House communications director","bodyText":"Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and longtime aide to Donald Trump, has announced her resignation. The White House confirmed news of Hicks’ departure on Wednesday, one day after Hicks testified before the House intelligence committee for nine hours as part of the panel’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. “There are no words to adequately express my gratitude to President Trump,” Hicks said in a statement. “I wish the President and his administration the very best as he continues to lead our country.” Hicks had served as the press secretary for Trump’s insurgent presidential campaign before taking on similar duties in the White House. She previously worked at the Trump Organization and went on to become Trump’s longest-serving political aide. “Hope is outstanding and has done great work for the last three years,” Trump said in a statement. “She is as smart and thoughtful as they come, a truly great person. I will miss having her by my side but when she approached me about pursuing other opportunities, I totally understood. I am sure we will work together again in the future.” The White House said Hicks’ exact departure date had yet to be determined, but that she would leave in the coming weeks. Hicks, 29, a former model, had no political experience when she joined Trump’s tumultuous campaign for the White House. She quickly rose as one of his closest confidantes, ranking among the few aides to develop an understanding of Trump’s brash persona and unpredictable temperament. Hicks initially served as a press secretary within the White House, before taking on the role of communications director following a series of high-profile departures last year. In that role, Hicks was tasked with bringing stability to Trump’s unruly press shop, which in its early stages was dominated by leaks and constant reports of infighting. Although Hicks maintained an unusually low profile over the past three years, she recently attracted more scrutiny in her role, as special counsel Robert Mueller escalated his investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. Hicks’ proximity to the president, and presence on his campaign from its infancy, placed her in the spotlight as a potentially key witness to the FBI’s inquiry. Questions loomed in particular over her role in crafting a highly misleading statement about the infamous June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between Donald Trump Jr, Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. The White House at first said the meeting was to discuss adoptions, but it was later revealed that the meeting had been arranged when the Russians offered to provide Trump Jr with highly sensitive and incriminating information about Hillary Clinton. Hicks allegedly promised that Trump Jr’s emails with the Russians “will never get out”. A lawyer for Hicks denied the claim. Trump Jr was forced to release the emails after reports uncovered the true nature of the meeting. Hicks told congressional investigators on Tuesday she occasionally had to tell white lies to appease Trump, but denied having lied about substantive matters pertaining to Russia. Hicks was also interviewed in December by the special counsel’s team, which has zeroed in both on the White House response to the 2016 Trump Tower meeting and Trump’s firing of the former FBI director James Comey. Hicks also became engulfed in the scandal involving Rob Porter, who served as Trump’s staff secretary until he was forced to resign this month amid accusations of domestic violence by both of his ex-wives. Hicks had been dating Porter, but the two reportedly split following the controversy. Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and aide, tweeted on Wednesday evening: “Hope Hicks is loved &amp; admired by all who know her. It’s with a heavy heart, but tremendous gratitude, that I wish her well in her next steps.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/01/sexual-predators-you-can-hide-but-you-cant-run-says-actors-union","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T00:01:54Z","webTitle":"Sexual predators: you can hide but you can't run, says actors' union","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/01/sexual-predators-you-can-hide-but-you-cant-run-says-actors-union","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/01/sexual-predators-you-can-hide-but-you-cant-run-says-actors-union","fields":{"headline":"Sexual predators: you can hide but you can't run, says actors' union","bodyText":"Sexual predators, harassers and bullies in the entertainment industries who are lying low, hoping that people will forget, must never be allowed to repeat or get away with their behaviour, the actors’ union Equity has said. On Thursday it published a report titled Agenda for Change, its response to the sexual harassment scandal, with a raft of recommendations covering subjects including safety at work, sex scenes, nudity, casting and gender balance. Among the main measures is the launch of a “safe space” campaign, which will include posters, a helpline, and productions being encouraged to have a safe space statement read before rehearsals begin. The union is also promising to investigate non-disclosure agreements, which it says potentially protect perpetrators of harassment. The actor Maureen Beattie, Equity’s vice-president, who led the union’s working group on sexual harassment, said the report was “an opportunity which may not come our way again for many years” to harness the energy released after the Harvey Weinstein scandal. She said some people were lying low as public interest in the subject continued. “People who have behaved badly are, I suspect, behaving well and hoping that nobody remembers they behaved badly, and slowly but surely what will happen is that the perpetrators will start to think they can do it again. That’s when we will still be there.” On nudity, Equity said it would reiterate its existing provisions: that people at auditions should not be asked to undress unless a mutually agreed observer is present and that auditions should not include requests to perform simulated sex acts. There had been reports that the union was considering bringing in more stringent guidelines and backing the use of specialist intimacy directors, but Beattie said not all actors wanted more people involved. The report says the union was “examining the value and role of intimacy direction”. Beattie said the union had always supported members when it came to harassment and bullying. “But I do believe things have got worse, and this was a chance to look at ourselves and see what we were doing. Were we doing enough? Were we doing it right? What more can we do?” The safe space campaign would involve posters in rehearsal rooms, TV studios and at stage doors encouraging people to have the confidence to challenge inappropriate behaviour. A form of words to be read at the start of every project and production has been drafted and includes a statement on everyone being entitled to work in a space free of fear, bullying and harassment. The report lists duties of care for people who manage actors and performers. Casting directors should, for example, actively discourage one-to-one meetings in non-professional environments. Venues are being asked to recognise that audiences can also be the perpetrators of bullying and harassment. Agents need to have a “clear and robust code of practice” on how to deal with allegations. They also need to ensure that performers are advised in writing about the extent and nature of any nudity in any job. Boards should strive for gender balance, diversity and inclusion in their organisations. Beattie, who has appeared in Casualty and Doctor Who and will appear in the upcoming Broadway transfer of Yerma with Billie Piper, said she had experienced sexual harassment in her career, both as a victim and bystander. “It is my fervent hope that the work that follows this report will lead to a future where no one has to suffer harassment of any kind ever again. “When the media has moved on, the reason for the posters, this report, the statement, is … we are not going away. We will be there. We will keep on going until everything shifts.” The report by Equity, which represents 43,000 people across the entertainment industry, is one of a number that have come out since details of Weinstein’s behaviour emerged. The Royal Court theatre was first off the mark, publishing a code of behaviour in November. In mid-February the BFI published eight “clear and simple” principles to tackle bullying and harassment in the UK’s screen industries”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/feb/28/emotional-ben-stokes-says-he-is-privileged-to-play-for-england-again","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T11:11:58Z","webTitle":"Emotional Ben Stokes says he is privileged to play for England again","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/28/emotional-ben-stokes-says-he-is-privileged-to-play-for-england-again","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/feb/28/emotional-ben-stokes-says-he-is-privileged-to-play-for-england-again","fields":{"headline":"Emotional Ben Stokes says he is privileged to play for England again","bodyText":"Ben Stokes spoke of his relief and happiness after leading England to victory in the second one‑day international against New Zealand. A five-month absence brought about by his arrest on the morning of 25 September meant the all-rounder missed seven ODIs, four T20 internationals and an Ashes series. A star turn in his second match back with the national side has underlined Stokes’s worth as a player but also what playing for England means to him. “Walking off tonight made me understand how much of a privilege it is to represent your country,” he said. This was Stokes’s fourth ODI man-of-the-match award, following an all-action display that featured 63 not out with the bat, two for 42 with the ball and two run-outs in the field. New Zealand were restricted to 223 all out and their target picked off by six wickets and with 12.1 overs to go. Facing the press for the first time since the incident on a night out in Bristol, the 26-year-old, who notched his 11th ODI half-century, spoke of an exasperating few months watching from afar as England lost 4-0 against Australia to relinquish the Ashes. The England and Wales Cricket Board lifted a suspension on Stokes in mid-January after he was charged with affray following a police investigation but he missed the subsequent one‑day series win against Australia. The 26-year-old joined his team-mates in Hamilton on 15 February after indicating in court that he would plead not guilty to the charge, though he played no part in the Trans-Tasman T20 Tri-Series. “It was frustrating to watch the Ashes,” he said. “I went through all the emotions as I would have done playing but there’s not a lot I can change about that now. I’ve been following all the cricket the lads have been playing but what I have to do now is focus on going forward. I want to contribute every time I play for England.” He did not doubt whether he would play a part this winter, throwing himself into Durham’s pre-season programme along with his own personal training sessions. He even forced his body clock on to Australia time for the start of the Ashes, just in case. “That was the focus [to play again this winter],” Stokes said. “I’ve been working hard at home making sure that when the opportunity came again I wasn’t going to let anyone down. When I got the nod I wanted to expect to be asked to participate fully rather than be eased back into the team. I wouldn’t expect anything less of myself and I don’t think Morgy [Eoin Morgan, the captain] would expect anything less of me, either.” While Stokes faces trial for affray, he is not required at the first hearing on 12 March that sits between this series and the forthcoming Tests against New Zealand. The pleasure of leading his side to victory here has underlined his desire to crack on with his career. “It was very satisfying for me,” Stokes said. “I was quite emotional walking off there at the end. It was a different feeling to what it is normally. There was relief, happiness and obviously it’s been a long time. Hopefully now this is a stepping stone to trying to keep on helping England win games.

This week, in what is being described as its biggest launch in 30 years, the Sylvanian Families toy range is, for the first time, introducing a town that includes a department store, restaurant and ice-cream parlour, all served by public transport in the form of a tram. Those with deep pockets could buy several of the connecting buildings and create a whole urban sprawl. It is certainly a departure from the existing rural, bucolic Sylvanian habitat. Maybe, like me, you grew up with Sylvanian Families and are now foisting them on your own children. Even if that is not the case, you will probably know that Sylvanians, the anthropomorphised mammals from the cuter end of the animal kingdom, live in the wholesome woodland Sylvanian Village, set, it seems, sometime in the 1950s. Yet times change, even in this previously timeless forest-based world. “The town is a bit more modern than the village,” says Michihiro Maeda, the CEO of Epoch, the Japanese company that invented and makes the toys, when we meet in a London hotel where the town series is on display. “In the village, children are doing roleplay of daily life. In the town series, we are proposing dreams – what would you like to be?” There are new older sister characters of existing families – Stella, the rabbit, is a fashion designer; Lulu, the cat, is a make-up artist; Laura, a poodle, is a chocolatier. They are, he says, independent working women – which I suppose is progress, even if they are in pretty gendered jobs; the tram driver is a man, or rather a male polecat. There is no reason, though, why one of the women couldn’t drive the tram, says Maeda. “Thirty years ago, some occupations may have been only for men but not now. It’s changing, so we are following society.” It was Maeda’s father who introduced Sylvanian families, first in Japan in 1985, then in the UK (and around the world) in 1987. The look was inspired by chocolate-box British villages and was deliberately nostalgic from the start. “When they started to think about what it should be, the scene-setting was the time of their grandparents.” It was a “utopia” he says. Nothing bad ever happens. There is a hospital, but no medical emergencies; a police officer, but no crime. “Probably, when we started to think about the kind of world we wanted to make, we wanted to feel happy about life and people. That’s why only good things happen.” The toys have had huge success – as of 2016, more than 150m figures sold, along with 18m building sets, such as houses, schools and bakeries. You can buy furniture, vehicles and even places for the animals to go on holiday (such as a log cabin). It becomes about collecting, says the cultural historian Deborah Jaffé, author of The History of Toys. That is obviously good for toy manufacturers as it makes them a lot of money. “You have the large unit [for instance, a school] but then you have the small pocket-money add-ons.” Children like to collect things, she points out, “historically, whether it was stones, marbles, tea cards [from boxes of tea]. It was a 1950s thing to get pocket money, so now children could purchase in order to collect, rather than scavenge and find. There is a danger with anything like that that if the kids are made to feel they’ve got to have every bit of it, rather than making things and doing things around those toys, they just become consumers. Play should be highly creative and encouraging children to make, do and improvise.” With Sylvanian Families, it bothers her that they are marketed to girls. “Twenty or thirty years ago, I thought we were getting over this gendered toy thing. But the idea of girls’ toys and boys’ toys are now emphasised even more.” In London, there is a dedicated (but independent) Sylvanian Families shop, the only one of its kind in the world, which has been open for 25 years. There are thriving adult collectors’ groups, and the store’s manager, Ben Miller-Poole, estimates about 40% of his customers are grown-ups – he himself was the fairly rare boy who grew up loving Sylvanians. “It’s either people who had them as kids and stuck with them, or people who didn’t have them as children but always wanted them, and now they have a spare bedroom or cupboard,” he says. “Their appeal is twofold, I think. It’s partly the cuteness and characterisation, and how each animal’s personality is captured so well. Then, especially for the adult collectors, there is the level of detail.” “For the collectors, it’s more about creating a detailed arrangement, or diorama, and making it look as fantastic as possible. You tend to find that anything miniature is fantastic for the focus of the mind, it’s good for stress relief. A lot of the adults who had Sylvanians as children refer to this warm, comfortable feeling it gave them when they were playing with them, and it’s almost like a regression into a safe place.” In a sometimes bewildering and frightening modern world, it is easy to see the appeal of nostalgia – for the adults at least. It’s not just nostalgia for one’s own childhood, but an for an ideal of a rural village that most children who grew up with Sylvanians in the late 80s and 90s would never have experienced. The fantasy of an idyllic English, bygone life – the traditional values and a strong sense of community – are embodied in the Sylvanian Village. I love Sylvanian Families, but it isn’t the most progressive place. Mothers, whose outfits often involve aprons, tend not to have jobs and instead stay at home and knit or bake (according to the stories that accompany the characters). It is the fathers who have professions – the mouse father is an entertainer, the male bear is the mayor, one rabbit dad is a carpenter, another rabbit dad is the village doctor (his wife is a nurse). Where the mothers have jobs, they tend to be feminised – one is a dress-maker, another runs the ice-cream shop, another is a nursery teacher. At least the community is diverse (if erring towards a paler palette), featuring monkeys, polar bears, cats, dogs, squirrels and rabbits, living side by side without predatory behaviour. But the families are nuclear – mother, father, and usually two children, plus babies you can buy separately. Would the company ever introduce single parents or same-sex couples to its idea of “family”? Maeda pauses. “Society is changing so we need to move gradually,” he says. “At this moment we don’t have such a product, we’re kind of the follower of society.” Sylvanian Families reflects the majority, he says. “But [if] society is changing, then even among the Sylvanian Families there is no reason to deny such things.” Change, though, is slow in the sedate world of Sylvanian Families."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/grogonomics/2018/mar/01/full-time-jobs-are-few-and-far-between-if-youre-new-to-the-labour-force","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T00:26:04Z","webTitle":"Full-time jobs are few and far between – if you're new to the labour force | Greg Jericho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/mar/01/full-time-jobs-are-few-and-far-between-if-youre-new-to-the-labour-force","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/grogonomics/2018/mar/01/full-time-jobs-are-few-and-far-between-if-youre-new-to-the-labour-force","fields":{"headline":"Full-time jobs are few and far between – if you're new to the labour force","bodyText":"New data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics reveal that the hurdle of getting into work is a high one for many and that, overwhelmingly, full-time work is going to those already working rather than to new entrants into the labour force or the unemployed. One of the problems with the monthly labour force figures is they don’t really show just how much change occurs. When you hear stories of a company employing 100 new staff or, conversely, retrenching a similar number what is often not understood is just how many people each month get and lose jobs. Over the past 12 months, on average, 82,640 people went from being employed in one month to being unemployed in the following month – either due to retrenchment or by choice. And at the same time, about 117,500 people went from being unemployed one month to being employed the next month: While this is going on there are also nearly half a million people either moving from being employed to leaving the labour force (due to retirement, raising children, going back to education, health or any other reason) or shifting from not being in the labour force to being employed (due to leaving school, going back to work after raising children, etc). But while these are large numbers that give some context whenever any politicians boast or criticises a policy that will deliver (or lose) X number of jobs, as a rule what your labour force status is this month greatly determines what you’ll be doing next month. About 93% of people employed full-time one month will be so employed in the following month; similarly, 82% of those employed part-time this month will be in the same employment next month – with 11% moving into full-time employment: And while more people go into employment from outside the labour force than they do from being unemployed, just over a quarter of unemployed were not in the labour force a month ago. But where the overall percentage movement each month from employment to unemployment and vice-versa is rather small, we can see big changes when we look at more long-term periods. This week the ABS, as part of its Australian Census Longitudinal Dataset, has released data that tracks the movement of people aged 15-59 in 2011 in and out of the labour force from 2011 to 2016. As expected, most of those employed (89%) in 2011 were still employed five years later. But such workers were more likely to be employed full-time than those newly arrived into the labour force. Currently, around 51% of all people aged 15-64 are employed full-time, whereas 61% of people who were employed in 2011 were working full-time in 2016: This suggests that the growth of part-time employment has mostly been for new entrants. This is also reflected in the changes in status of those people who were unemployed in 2011. Of those who were looking for work in 2011, only 32% were working full-time in 2016. As with overall employment, women who were unemployed in 2011 were more likely to be working part-time in 2016 than were men in the same situation. And while women were less likely to be still unemployed, they were more likely to have left the labour force: For those who were not in the labour force in 2011 the situation is even more stark. Only 17% were working full-time in 2016, and 21% were working part-time. Just over half of those not in the labour force in 2011 were still in such a status five years later, and 7.4% were unemployed: But when we look at the level of full-time employment among only those who were employed in 2016, the difference becomes even more clear. In 2016, around 66% of all those with a job were employed full-time, but a mere 55% of those who were unemployed in 2011 and had work in 2016 were employed full-time. Even worse is that only 43% of those who were outside the labour force in 2011 but were employed in 2016 were in full-time work. Also evident from the data is the difficulty of getting into work when unemployed. The unemployment rate in 2016 of those who had work in 2011 was just 3.6%, compared with the overall rate of 5.9%. Whereas the unemployment rate in 2016 of those who were unemployed in 2011 was a whopping 22.3%: One other difference that is quite clear from the data is the employment status of those by the type of school they attended. Of those who attended public school in 2011, 69% were employed five years later, compared with 77% of those who attended a Catholic school and 72% of those who went to a non-Catholic private school. Those who attended non-public schools were also much more likely to be employed and still studying: Those who attended public school in 2011 were also more likely to be either not in the labour force or unemployed than those who attended private school. While a similar percentage of public school and non-Catholic private school attendees from 2011 were out of the labour force in 2016, many more of those from private schools were still studying compared with those from the public school, who were more likely to be neither studying nor in the labour force. The long-term data give us some good insight into the labour force that we don’t get from the monthly snapshot. Rather than just look at employment by gender, age and state, the long-term data show the importance of your current work status on the likelihood of being employed in the future. Entrants into the workforce have a much tougher time getting a full-time job than do those who are already employed, suggesting that a high proportion of part-time work is going to younger people and those returning to work, and that any growth in full-time work is overwhelmingly going to those already employed.

The other is a cherry blossom-inspired superhero. Meet the new Olympic and Paralympic mascots that the Tokyo 2020 organisers hope will whip up enthusiasm for the Games – and drive merchandise sales. All up, 2,042 individuals and groups submitted designs that they hoped would capture the public’s affection. Experts whittled the list down to three design pairs, which were then opened up for voting by millions of school students across Japan. Nearly 600 cheering schoolchildren attended a ceremony in Tokyo’s Shinagawa ward on Wednesday to hear the results of that vote. The winning Olympic and Paralympic mascots have not yet been given names, but they are said to “respect each other” and are “very good friends”. With a futuristic blue and white chequered pattern, the Olympic mascot is described as having a special power allowing it to move anywhere instantaneously. “The mascot has a strong sense of justice and is very athletic,” the biographical notes said. The Paralympic mascot features a pink and white design inspired by cherry blossom flowers, and it can apparently move things just by looking at them. “It has a dignified inner strength and a kind heart that loves nature,” according to the description. The winning designer, Ryo Taniguchi, is an illustrator from Fukuoka in southern Japan. “I’m just so spaced out at the moment,” he said when the decision was announced. “I just want to tell my beloved wife that I’ve been chosen.” The selection of mascots had attracted wide publicity across Japan. Some 200,000 classes at 16,000 schools took part in selection process. Mascots are big business in Japan, with many towns and companies trying to come up with distinctive design to promote their region or product. Staffers wearing big cuddly costumes often turn up at trade and food festivals to meet and greet visitors – and hand out business cards. The best-known mascots can drive sales. Sales of food and toy products bearing the image of Kumamon, ubiquitous black bear from Kumamoto region, hit a record 128 billion yen (£859 million) in 2016. The organisers presumably hope that the mascots will have a more successful reception than original Tokyo 2020 logo unveiled in 2015. The design had to be replaced after accusations of plagiarism."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/01/hazing-isnt-a-way-of-life-change-college-culture-now","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T17:00:45Z","webTitle":"Hazing isn't a way of life.

Change college culture now","bodyText":"I went to a mixed-sex college at Melbourne University in the 1990s and our hazing rituals were quaint, involving mostly a play on words. We were forced to do silly things that punned on our surnames. So my friend Emma Callaghan was “Call-again Callaghan” and she had to ring all the freshers at 6am and get them out of bed. Another, Tom Dobson, had to dob on people doing naughty things at the pub. Otherwise in one stunt someone ate a sausage from a bin. A lot of people got drunk. We learned the words to various chants and drank beer from an old boot. But no one got hurt in O Week and the stupid games meant that about 100 people, most of whom didn’t know each other, had something to talk about at breakfast in those first weeks. After all, how do you give a kid from Malaysia, a private school kid from Mandeville Hall and a kid from a country town of 200 in the wheatbelt, some common ground? You give them an intense week and minor humiliations – the experience of being initiated together. This was as good as any. It felt like the ultimate icebreaker. Years later I regarded my experiences at college with real fondness. The friendships I found with my fellow freshers, started during that O’Week, have been some of the most enduring of my life. I feel lucky. The Red Zone report released this week about initiations at Sydney uni colleges shows a culture of cruelty, misogyny and extreme degradation. Students forced to drink toxic chemicals, male students masturbating into women’s shampoo bottles, students crammed into a small room being pelted with fish, and a student killing himself soon after arriving at college. What’s different? Perhaps it’s a generational thing, perhaps it’s the place, maybe a bit of both. In my mid-20s, I moved back to college as a tutor. I was in Sydney this time, and lived briefly in one of the Sydney uni colleges that features prominently in the Red Zone report. I arrived mid-year and didn’t see any hazing. But the atmosphere was off. I did six weeks there and then that was that. There were good kids there, but the place had a crazy, dark vibe. Female students had just been admitted to the college. There was no more than a dozen of them – you’d see them in pairs around the dining room. They were not a relaxed group. Some of them told stories about boys trying to break into the rooms at night. Others left for the all-women’s college or share housing. They had an air of besiegement about them. You had to be on your guard. Students would tell me stories of kids getting drunk and falling off the roof, or tearing across Missenden Road and being hit by a car. One night some boys in a ute drove at great speed at a female member of the senior common room who was walking up the college driveway. They braked at her feet, giving her a good ol’ scare. I was also working as a journalist at time, as a cadet at the Sydney Morning Herald. I was no longer a good fit for college life. Sometimes I’d be late for formal dinner (that I was required to attend three times a week) and would rush from the newsroom to the dining hall, academic gown flapping behind me to the sound that I began to dread. It was 200 boys (and possibly those dozen girls) hissing – as I made my way to high table. By the time I got to my seat it was like a plague of locusts had been let loose. Physically it was a beautiful place, full of shady spots to sit and read, cool sandstone and cloisters. But all beauty would fade when in the morning I’d open the door to find the outside streaked with vomit (not mine) or that undeniable smell of piss on the carpet. I’d get invited to student parties, including a toga party, where I was told not to wear anything underneath. For a story I later did on college culture, much of what I was told by former and current students was unpublishable for legal reasons. Their experiences were barbaric, cruel and criminal, and many of the students were scared. If they went on the record they may not get jobs, they told me. And they might be further ostracised or bullied if their names were attached to any article. With some of the material I gathered, I wrote a novel for Harper Collins called Wild Things about a violent hazing at an Australian university college. Very bad things happened in my book, yet somehow the worst of what I imagined doesn’t beat the degradation that we impose on each other in real life. The Red Zone report shows that levels of violence seem to be rising rather than falling. And some of the examples of hazing in the Sydney uni report involve clearly criminal acts. You’d think the colleges would have their houses in order by now. US colleges and fraternities are being sued by parents for the hazing deaths of their children. In one case filed this week in Florida, the parents of a Florida State University student who died while pledging a fraternity last fall sued Pi Kappa Phi and several individuals claiming they negligently allowed the young man to consume “overwhelming amounts of alcohol to the point of extreme intoxication.” Secondly, corporations – such as the big banks, law firms or accounting firms – are desirable places to work for many of these middle class college kids. Three years of thinking it’s heroic to drink until you vomit, or throw fish on a room full of freshers, or make someone drink shampoo is not really good preparation for the real world – unless you are going for a job at Abu Ghraib. The big end of town has (at least in theory) strict standards about behaviour and are heavily invested in their reputation. Colleges with their hazing rituals are doing the students a disservice by instilling in them values and behaviour that are likely to get them fired or arrested once they enter the “real world”. Thirdly, more students will die. And if students keep dying at college – are parents going to want to fork out $34,000 to send their children there? When old boys groups stack the college council, it can be hard to change the culture. But the colleges should make a start. Changing the college culture needs the current batch of nasties to finish up or be thrown out. It happened in a small way at my time in Melbourne: my first year was full of hearty types, but by the time I left a lot more of the freshers were oboe-players and drama kids. Give places to the bright kids who can help change the atmosphere, not those who will maintain it with some misguided, puerile notion of tradition.

Listen to the endlessly mutating semiquavers tumbling from Charlie Parker’s saxophone and it could be the top line of a Bach fantasia; the jolting cycle of chords in John Coltrane’s Giant Steps could come straight from a Bach fugue and Bach’s contrapuntal techniques crop up in countless jazz pianists, from Bill Evans to Nina Simone. Bach certainly casts a long shadow over US pianist Brad Mehldau: even when he’s gently mutilating pieces by Radiohead, Nick Drake or the Beatles, he sounds like Glenn Gould ripping into the Goldberg Variations. Which is why it comes as no surprise to see Mehldau recording an entire album inspired by Bach. However, this is not a jazz album. Instead of riffing on Bach themes, as the likes of Jacques Loussier or the Modern Jazz Quartet have done in the past, After Bach sees Mehldau using Bach’s methodology. Mehldau plays five of Bach’s canonic 48 Preludes and Fugues, each followed by his own modern 21st-century response. For instance, after a straight performance of the Prelude No 3 in C-sharp major, Mehldau responds by resetting Bach’s original riff in a jerky 5/4 rhythm and taking it into a harmonically adventurous labyrinth. Similarly, a romantic, rubato-heavy reading of the F minor Prelude and Fugue is followed by a dreamlike meditation on some of the themes hinted at in Bach’s original. The effect is as if someone has taken pages from The Well-Tempered Clavier, turned them upside down and reflected them in a wobbly fairground mirror. Where Bach’s preludes and fugues are like gentle sudoku puzzles, Mehldau’s cryptic harmonies sometimes feel as if you’re grappling with an insoluble 5x5 Rubik’s Cube and the results – as with the opening track, Benediction – can sometimes be headache-inducing. However, by the two closing tracks, Ostinato and Prayer for Healing, Mehldau is wearing his chops lightly and starting to tug at the heartstrings. Also out this month For those in search of something less dense, Niklas Paschburg’s Oceanic sees the 23-year-old German composer playing ruminative, low-volume piano pieces inspired by the Baltic Sea, complete with suitably icy field recordings. The muted minimalism will appeal to Nils Frahm fans, although Paschburg integrates electronics into his work rather more effectively."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/01/pollutionwatch-wood-burning-is-not-climate-friendly","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T21:30:31Z","webTitle":"Pollutionwatch: wood burning is not climate friendly","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/01/pollutionwatch-wood-burning-is-not-climate-friendly","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/01/pollutionwatch-wood-burning-is-not-climate-friendly","fields":{"headline":"Pollutionwatch: wood burning is not climate friendly","bodyText":"With snow on the ground, many people will have been huddling around a wood fire, but researchers are questioning if wood burning is really climate neutral. Burning wood is not CO2 free; it releases carbon, stored over the previous decades, in one quick burst. For an equal amount of heat or electricity, it releases more CO2 than burning gas, oil and even coal, so straight away we have more CO2 in the air from burning wood. This should be reabsorbed as trees regrow. For logs from mature Canadian woodland, it could take more than 100 years before the atmospheric CO2 is less than the alternative scenario of burning a fossil fuel and leaving the trees in the forest. This matters to prevent climate tipping points such as an ice-free Arctic or shifting monsoon patterns before the wider decarbonisation can take place following the trajectories of the Paris and Kyoto agreements. Critics of this view say that the trees would never have been left to grow, but would instead have been chopped down for wood or paper. It seems that wood burning is not climate neutral in the short term and requires an increase in forested area to be climate neutral in the longer term."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/feb/28/dolly-parton-gives-100-millionth-free-book-to-children","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T10:10:46Z","webTitle":"Dolly Parton gives 100 millionth free book to children","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/28/dolly-parton-gives-100-millionth-free-book-to-children","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/feb/28/dolly-parton-gives-100-millionth-free-book-to-children","fields":{"headline":"Dolly Parton gives 100 millionth free book to children","bodyText":"Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library, the initiative she set up in honour of her illiterate father, has handed out its 100 millionth free book. The book, a copy of Parton’s children’s picture book Coat of Many Colors, was donated to the Library of Congress in Washington DC, with which Parton has set up a partnership to live-stream story readings. Parton began the Imagination Library in 1996 in Sevier County, Tennessee, where she was raised. Children whose families sign up are posted free books, funded via charitable giving. Parton, who grew up with only the Bible in her house, has said she was inspired by the example of her father, who worked hard but didn’t have the chance to learn to read or write. “I thought, well, I’m gonna do this: to get books in the hands of children, because if you can read, you can educate yourself,” she told CNBC in 2016.

(See 2.39pm.) Major, whose own premiership was undermined by constant criticism from Tory Eurosceptics and who campaigned passionately for remain, used a major speech to deliver a damning verdict on the government’s handling of Brexit. Its aims were “just not credible”, he said. (See 2.22pm.) He said MPs should be given a free vote on the final Brexit deal, implying that calling a second referendum or rejecting Brexit outright should both be options. Major said that parliamentarians had to consider, not just the will of the people, but their wellbeing too. He implied that a soft Brexit, involving Britain being in the single market like Norway, would be the best and most acceptable compromise solution, but he also hinted that he thought there was a case for reversing Brexit and staying in the EU for good. (See 2.18pm and 2.34pm.) Since his election defeat in 1997 Major has normally been loyal to his party and its leader, but today’s speech has infuriated Tory Brexiters (see 5.21pm) and will embolden his party’s pro-Europeans, as well as those (mostly in the Lib Dems) calling for a second referendum. But Major made it clear that he personally did not favour a second referendum; he wants parliament to take the final decision. (See 2.43pm.) And his call for a free vote is likely to be a non-starter. May and Jeremy Corbyn would be most unlikely to agree to such an idea (which runs counter to the whole tradition of using party as a basis for organising in the Commons - something to which party leaders, for obvious reasons, are rather attached.) Also, Major did not seem very clear as to what the free vote would be on. (See 2.39pm.) He seemed to imply that various options should be considered. But parliamentary votes need to be binary. When Labour offered MPs a choice of options on Lords reform in 2003, it was a disaster because all seven options were rejected. The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has conceded that border checks within the UK may be necessary in the future as Brussels published a draft withdrawal agreement under which the Northern Ireland would effectively stay in the single market and customs union after Brexit. At PMQs Theresa May said the draft in its current form was unacceptable. In reply to the DUP MP David Simpson, she said: The draft legal text that the commission has published would, if implemented, undermine the UK common market and threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK by creating a customs and regulatory border down the Irish sea, and no UK prime minister could ever agree to it. I will be making it crystal clear to President Juncker and others that we will never do so. We are committed to ensuring that we see no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, but the December text also made it clear that there should continue to be trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom, as there is today. The Irish government has said the UK needs to come up with alternative solutions if it will not support the EU’s legal document on Brexit. Speaking in the Dail, Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, said: Hardline Brexiteers and some politicians in Northern Ireland will say ‘No’ and will be angry at what they see today, but just saying ‘No’ and being angry is not enough. If people do not like what they see today, it is incumbent on them to come up with alternative solutions and to flesh out option A and option B, write it down in a legal form that can be enforced and then we can negotiate on that. Theresa May has conceded that new EU migrants who come to Britain during the Brexit transition will have the right to settle permanently in the UK, in a major climbdown over future residency rights. Boris Johnson has faced accusations of cowardice and discourtesy from Labour MPs after he failed to appear in the Commons to answer an urgent question about reports that he privately argued a hard Irish border was possible after Brexit. Ministers have rejected a call from MPs to immediately suspend the disclosure of confidential NHS patient data to the Home Office to trace potential immigration offenders despite evidence it is deterring migrants in England from seeking medical help. Labour will no longer accept donations from the privacy campaigner Max Mosleyfollowing accusations that he published a leaflet in the 1960s linking immigrants with tuberculosis and leprosy, Jeremy Corbyn’s spokesman has said. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, did not get to question Boris Johnson in person about his leaked letter on the open border. But she has released an open letter to him, making many of the points she made in the UQ on this subject (answered by David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister.) Here’s the text. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is set to face a new campaign from his supporters to significantly soften his stance on immigration. Two influential trade union leaders, as well as Momentum activists and around a dozen other supporters, have signed a letter to the Guardian saying Labour must “defend and extend” freedom of movement. Corbyn and his shadow home secretary Diane Abbott have previously been sympathetic on freedom of movement, although Corbyn has said free movement will by definition end with Britain’s exit from the EU and any future system must not allow exploitative working practices. TSSA general secretary Manuel Cortes, one of the letter’s authors, said Abbott and Corbyn had fought against racism and for workers rights their entire lives. He said: Given this, I really can”t see why they would want to roll back on the right of workers to free movement. But there’s pressure everywhere to surrender on this principle, and it’s absolutely critical that the Left of the labour movement fights back and pushes the other way. Another of the letter’s co-authors, Sahaya James, a member of Momentum’s ruling national coordinating group, said Corbyn had “a record of standing up to the tabloid narrative on things like immigration.” James said Momentum did not have an official position on Brexit or free movement, but said the vast majority of members were in favour of free movement. She said: I can guarantee that a huge bulk of members and activists are in favour of defending free movement and fighting for migrants’ rights. It’s not enough to sit around and wait for Jeremy to come out with policies - the left needs to wake up and make its voice heard on this. The full letter can be read here. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter, told BBC News that Sir John Major’s speech was “riddled with errors and humbug”. He said: You would expect John Major, a former prime minister, to make a statesman-like speech free of propaganda and cheap comments, but in fact it is all cheap comments and propaganda. This isn’t a statesman-like speech. This is one of somebody grubbing around in the weeds for weak arguments. It is a very poor speech. I think he should go back, do his homework and try and make a statesman-like speech rather than one riddled with errors and humbug. The Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn has posted on Twitter a copy of a letter that David Davis, the Brexit secretary, has sent to Tory MPs about today’s draft withdrawal treaty published by the EU. Pro-Europeans have warmly welcomed John Major’s intervention. Open Britain, which is campaigning for a soft Brexit, released this response from the Labour peer and former European commissioner Lord Mandelson. This is a seismic speech which no voter should ignore and every member of parliament should heed. John Major has stripped away every fig leaf, exposed every lie and revealed the truth about the unmitigated disaster that the government’s Brexit deal would be for our country. A former prime minister has offered the government a way out of the mess they have made. They should take it. MPs should get a free vote on Brexit, so they can put country before party. parliament should take its responsibility and reject any deal that will damage our country and then give back to the people the final vote on the Brexit deal. From the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake John Major is right, the deal must go back to the people. This is the biggest issue facing the nation in over half a century. This deal will define our future. We have one chance to get this right and yet Theresa May is fighting to keep the final say in the hands of her inner circle. Theresa May must put her trust in the public. Whatever deal she comes back with, the people must be given a voice. The UK must have a chance to exit from Brexit. (Actually, this is a misreading of what Major said. Major made it clear that his preference was for parliament not take the final decision. See 2.43pm.) And Best for Britain, the group fighting Brexit, has put out this statement from the Labour peer Lord Adonis. Sir John Major is a very distinguished former prime minister who knows all too well the dishonesty that the Brexiteers in his party deploy in pursuit of ideology. His warnings today - about the threat that Brexit poses to our economy, to our security and to the enduring peace that was his own legacy in Northern Ireland - can not be dismissed. Sir John’s speech highlights a stark and unavoidable fact, the Leave campaign did not win on the basis of this chaos, disruption and destabilisation. They won, just, on a false prospectus. The truth is they cannot deliver on any of their promises. The only way forward, as Sir John implies, is to give the British people their final say on the realities of Brexit. We need a referendum on the realities of Brexit, not the fantasies of its proponents. That must be the focus of all democrats from now on. At the afternoon lobby briefing Theresa May’s spokesman refused several invitations to give any thoughts on John Major’s speech. May herself had not watched it, he said, as she was hosting a modern slavery taskforce event at No 10. Asked if the timing of the speech – two days before May’s own set piece Brexit speech – was helpful, the spokesman said: “He is perfectly entitled to make his views known at his time of choosing.” As my colleague Alan Travis reports, the government has sneaked out (“sneaked out”, because it coincides with a particularly busy Brexit news day) an announcement showing that the government has backed down on the issue of the rights of EU nationals coming to the UK during the transition. As Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, said in his press conference yesterday, and again today (see 11.43am), this was one of the areas of dispute between the UK and the EU holding up an agreement on the transition. Here is Alan’s story. Scotland’s most senior law officer, the Lord Advocate James Wolffe, has just given a statement to the Scottish parliament saying that the Scottish government’s alternative to the EU withdrawal bill will be within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament. Yesterday both the Scottish and Welsh governments issued emergency legislation or “continuity” bills to prepare for leaving the EU in a significant escalation of their dispute with UK ministers over their powers after Brexit. The measures are intended to transfer EU regulations directly into Scottish and Welsh law if the three governments fail to agree a deal next month on how those powers are shared out after Brexit. Subsequently, Holyrood’s presiding officer Ken Macintosh announced that he does not believe the bill currently falls within the Scottish parliament’s remit. Saying that there was no precedent for his statement, Wolffe said that his analysis reflects the approach of the supreme court in the Gina Miller case, and that he does not believe the bill breaches UK obligations under EU law. The Tory/Brexiter backlash against John Major has started. This is from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg. These are from the Telegraph’s Steven Swinford. And Guido Fawkes has a full quote on his blog from the Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg. Rees-Mogg said: Did John Major give a free vote on Maastricht? This is where he really is guilty of being a complete humbug. He whipped that through in the most aggressive whipping in modern history. For that PM to then say ‘oh it should be a free vote’, is either forgetting how he behaved himself, ignoring how he behaved himself, or just straight forward hypocrisy. Q: Aren’t you worried that, if parliament were to take responsibility for this decision back, having contracted it out to the people, that might generate more bitterness? Major says this was supposed to be about restoring parliamentary sovereignty. And he suggests voters are sometimes inconsistent. He says some people said at the time they wanted to leave the EU but stay in the single market. Also, people change their minds, he says. He says David Davis said if you cannot change your minds, you are not a democracy. He says in a democracy you cannot just ignore the views of the 16m who voted against, and opt for a hard Brexit. Both sides need to be willing to compromise, he says. And that is it. The Q&amp;A is over. I will post reaction and analysis shortly. Major says we have learnt a lot from the continent. During the referendum he met someone in his old Huntingdon constituency. The person told Major he was a European, while he was a proper Anglo-Saxon. “So where do you think Saxony is?” Major asked him. He says we all migrants in our ancestry. Major says he does not decry the concern there is about immigration. It has put great strain on services in some parts of the country. But EU migrants are overwhelmingly here because they bring a skill we need. He says he hopes the government can find a solution that allows this sort of immigration to carry on. Major says many EU nationals coming to the UK do not stay for good. They bring their skills when they are needed, and then leave. Q: Do you think what the EU is proposing today is acceptable? And is that what Theresa May signed up to? And what do you think about Boris Johnson’s congestion charge idea? Major says he will not comment on Johnson, on the grounds that “I’d still like to be a seen as a serious politician”. He says the EU document was only published as he was on his way to this speech. But from what he knows of it, he does not think it is “an idea that will fly” in parliament, he says. He says the UK, morally and politically, is under an obligation to find a solution to this. But, apart from staying in the customs union, he cannot think of one. Major says staying in the customs union could be the only solution to the Irish border problem. Major says the chances of the UK being able to have its cake and eat it are “between nil and zilch”. Q: What would happen if there were another referendum and it were close? Major says that, if it were won by one vote, the matter would be settled, as far as he is concerned. “We’ve got to draw a line under [this],” he says. He stresses that he would prefer parliament to take the final decision. But if there were a referendum, he would have no truc with the argument that it should be “the best of three”. Q: What do you say to people who think the warnings made remain in the referendum have not come to pass and hence will not take you seriously? Major accepts that is an issue. Some people in the campaign over-egged the threats, he says, when they were talking about long-term economic impacts. But now almost all experts say Brexit will be bad for the economy, he says. Personally, he is rather in favour of experts. If he has to have a tooth pulled, he would rather go to someone who has done it before, he says. Major says Brexit will hurt people “at the bottom of the heap” first. Q: As PM you complained about people undermining you. So why are you undermining the PM? And will you quit the party? Major says he has no intention of quitting the party he has belonged to since he was 16. He says he is trying to put the party on the right course. And he points out that he hardly mentioned Theresa May in his speech. Q: Why are you so sure that Theresa May will not be able to get what she wants? Major says when he was negotiating Maastricht, he had leverage. The EU needed his vote to get the reforms it wanted. And, when Margaret Thatcher got the veto, she had leverage. It took her five years to get the rebate. She only succeeded when the EU wanted to enlarge its budget, and needed British money. Those circumstances don’t apply, he says. Theresa May does not have that kind of leverage. Q: What is your message to pro-European Tories? Major says MPs have a responsibility to their party. But they have a responsibility to their constituents too. He says it is now likely that people will be worse off under Brexit. Q: Do you think the Northern Ireland problem is soluble? Major says there is no more complex problem in the talks than the problem of Northern Ireland. That was obvious from the start. But some people who should have known better denied this was a problem. The can was kicked down the road, he says. He says staying in a customs union would solve the problem, he says. But he says the extraordinary improvement in peace in Northern Ireland is a significant prize. And people may not think trade with Ireland is that important. But the UK does more trade with Ireland than with South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand put together, he says. Major says, if business were to speak out against Brexit, that would have a “significant impact on public opinion”. He thinks business leaders have been too reluctant to speak out. Major is now taking questions. Q: Are you calling for a second referendum? No, says Major. He says he thinks parliament should decide. He is not in favour of referendums. But he says parliament should have the option of voting for a second referendum. Q: Has Theresa May handed the keys of Number 10 to Jeremy Corbyn? No, says Major. He says under a different leader Labour would be 15 points ahead. He does not think the public want Corbyn as prime minister. Major goes into more detail about what he means by parliaement having the final say. I spoke earlier of the “divisiveness” of Brexit across our United Kingdom. But, in due time, the debate will end and – when it does – we need the highest possible level of public acceptance for the outcome. It is in no-one’s interest for the bitterness and division to linger on. I see only one way to achieve this. It is already agreed that Parliament must pass legislation giving effect to the deal. A “meaningful vote” has been promised. This must be a decisive vote, in which Parliament can accept or reject the final outcome; or send the negotiators back to seek improvements; or order a referendum. That is what Parliamentary sovereignty means. And he says there should be a free vote. But, to minimise divisions in our country – and between and within the political parties – I believe the government should take a brave and bold decision. They should invite parliament to accept or reject the final outcome on a free vote. I know the instinct of every government is to oppose “free votes”, but the government should weigh the advantages of having one very carefully. It may be in their interest to do so. There are some very practical reasons in favour of it. Brexit is a unique decision. It will affect the lives of the British people for generations to come. If it flops – there will be the most terrible backlash. If it is whipped through parliament, when the public are so divided, voters will know who to blame if they end up poorer and weaker. So, both democracy and prudence suggest a free vote. The deep divisions in our nation are more likely to be healed by a Brexit freely approved by parliament, than a Brexit forced through parliament at the behest of a minority of convinced opponents of Europe. A free vote would better reflect the reality that – for every 17 voters who opted for Brexit – 16 opted to remain in the EU. Major says parliament should take the final decision. We have ruled out full membership. Ruled out the single market and customs union. Ruled out joining the European Economic Area. Dismissed talk of joining EFTA. A Norway deal won’t do. Nor will a Swiss deal. Nor a Ukraine deal; a Turkey deal; or a South Korea deal. No, to them all, say the government’s “red lines”. So, little is left, except for “cherry picking” – which the EU rejects. Or a comprehensive deal – which will be very hard, if not impossible, to get. So compromise it must be – or no deal at all. It is now widely accepted that “no deal” would be the worst possible outcome. The compromise must, therefore, focus around our accepting single market rules (as Norway does) and paying for access. Or an enhanced “Canada deal” – and it would need to be enhanced a very great deal to be attractive. The Canada deal largely concerns goods – whereas the bulk of UK exports are services. But what we achieve to protect our interests may depend on what we concede: it is, as I say, “give” and “take”. If our “red lines” dissolve, our options enlarge. Our minimum objective must be that “deep, special and bespoke” trade deal the prime minister has talked about. So, some unpalatable decisions lie ahead – with the cast-iron certainty that the extreme and unbending Brexit lobby will cry “betrayal” at any compromise. But it is parliament, not a small minority, that must decide our policy. Major says voters should get the chance to think again. Although the referendum was advisory only, the result gave the government the obligation to negotiate a Brexit. But not any Brexit; not at all costs; and certainly not on any terms. The true remit can only be to agree a Brexit that honours the promises made in the referendum. But, so far, the promises have not been met and, probably, cannot be met. Many electors know they were misled: many more are beginning to realise it. So, the electorate has every right to reconsider their decision. Major turns to Northern Ireland. The prime minister is seeking a “frictionless” border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. She is absolutely right to do so. This is a promise that must be honoured, and I wish her well. But, so far, this has not materialised – nor, I fear, will it – unless we stay in “a” or “the” Customs Union. Those of us who warned of the risks Brexit would bring to the still fragile Peace Process were told at the time that we “didn’t understand Irish politics”. But it seems we understood it better than our critics. We need a policy to protect the Good Friday agreement – and we need one urgently. And it is our responsibility to find one – not the European Union. Major says nearly all promises made by Brexiters have been broken. It is not my purpose to stir controversy, but the truth must be spoken. The ultra Brexiteers have been mistaken – wrong – in nearly all they have said or promised to the British people. The promises of more hospitals, more schools, lower taxes, more money for transport were electioneering fantasy. The £350 million a week for the NHS was a ridiculous phantom: the reality is if our economy weakens – as is forecast – there will not only be less money for the NHS, but for all our public services. We were told that nobody was threatening our place in the Single Market. That tune has changed. We were told that a trade deal with the EU would be easy to get. Wrong again: it was never going to be easy, and we are still not sure what outcome will be achieved. We were told “Europe can whistle for their money” and we would not pay a penny in exit costs. Wrong again. Europe didn’t even have to purse her lips before we agreed to pay £40 billion to meet legitimate liabilities. I could go on. But suffice to say that every one of the Brexit promises is – to quote Henry Fielding – “a very wholesome and comfortable doctrine to which (there is) but one objection: namely, that it is not true.”. People should pause and reflect: if the Brexit leaders were wrong in what they said so enthusiastically before – are they not likely to be wrong in what they say now? Major says Brexiters are wrong to advocate leaving the single market. Leading Brexit supporters believe there is nothing to fear from losing our special access to the single market. But that is profoundly wrong. Swapping the single market for WTO rules would mean our exports facing the EU external tariff, as well as hidden non-tariff barriers that could be adjusted to our disadvantage at any time. A minister has speculated we might face tariffs of 3%. Not so. It is more likely that we will face tariffs on cars (10%), food (14%), drinks (20%), and dairy products (36%). Even if a successful negotiation were to halve these tariffs, our exports would still be much more expensive to sell – and this would apply far beyond agriculture and the motor industry. And if, in retaliation, the UK were to impose tariffs on imports, this would result in higher prices for the British consumer. If we and the EU agreed to impose nil tariffs – as some have speculated – WTO rules mean we would both have to offer nil tariffs to all countries. That isn’t going to happen. This is all very complex. But it is crucial. And none of it has yet been properly explained to the British people. Major says the government is losing business support over Brexit. Alarmed at the negotiations so far, the financial sector, businesses, and our academic institutions, are pleading for commonsense policy to serve the national interest and now – fearful they may not get it – are making their own preparations for the future. Japanese car-makers warn they could close operations in Britain unless we maintain free access to the EU. That would be heart-breaking for many people in Sunderland or Swindon or South Wales. This isn’t “Project Fear” revisited, it is “Project Know Your History”. Any doubters should consult the former employees of factories, now closed, in Bridgend, Port Talbot and Newport, where jobs were lost and families suffered. In 1991, employment by Japanese firms in Wales was about 17,000 people: today, it is 2,000. If free access to Europe is lost – that scale of impact, across the UK, could lose 125,000 Japanese jobs. Over many years, the Conservative party has understood the concerns of business. Not over Brexit, it seems. Across the United Kingdom – businesses are expressing their wish to stay in the single market and customs union. But “No”, say the government’s “red lines”. Businesses wish to have the freedom to employ foreign skills. “No”, say the government’s “red lines”. Business and academia wish to welcome foreign students to our universities and – as they rise to influence in their own countries – we then have willing partners in politics and business for decades to come. “No”, say the government’s “red lines”. This is not only grand folly. It’s also bad politics. The national interest must always be above the Party interest, but my Party should beware. It is only fear of Mr Corbyn and Mr McDonnell that prevents a haemorrhage of business support. Major explains what a good Brexit would be like. A good Brexit – for Britain – will protect our trade advantages, and enable us to: – continue to sell our goods and services without disruption; – import and export food without barriers and extra cost; – staff our hospitals, universities and businesses with the skills we need – where we most need them; – be part of the cutting edge of European research, in which British brains and skills lead the way; – continue with the over 40 FTAs we have with countries only as a result of our membership of the EU. He says government aims are “tilted to ultra Brexit opinion”. Major goes on to criticise the government’s stance in more detail. We simply cannot move forward with leaving the EU, the single market, the customs union and the ECJ, whilst at the same time expecting à la carte, beneficial-to-Britain, bespoke entrance to the European market. It is just not credible. A willingness to compromise is essential. If either side – the UK or the EU – is too inflexible, too unbending, too wedded to what they won’t do – then the negotiations will fail. The very essence of negotiation involves both “give” and “take”. But there are always “red lines” that neither side wishes to cross. In successful negotiations those “red lines” are traded for concessions. If our “red lines” are held to be inviolable, the likelihood of no deal – or a poor deal – increases. Every time we close off options prematurely, this encourages the EU to do the same – and that is not in our British interest. Major criticises the handling of the Brexit negotiations. Our negotiations, so far, have not always been sure-footed. Some agreements have been reached but, in many areas, only because the UK has given ground. Our determination to negotiate the divorce bill and a new trade deal at the same time was going to be “the fight of the summer” – but instead became an immediate British retreat. There was to be a “points based” immigration system. There isn’t, and there won’t be. We were to become the “Singapore of the North”. No more: we have retreated from a policy of lower taxes and de-regulation. No transition period was going to be needed. But we have now asked for one – during which we will accept new EU rules, ECJ jurisdiction, and free movement of people. I don’t say this to be critical. I do so to illustrate that unrealistic aspirations are usually followed by retreat. That is a lesson for the negotiations to come. They will be the most difficult any government has faced. Our aims have to be realistic. I am not sure they yet are. Major says Brexit has already hit the economy. The UK has been at the very top of European growth. We are now the laggard at the bottom. We have become the slowest of the world’s big economies, even before we surrender the familiar advantages of the single market. Major says Brexit will make the country poorer. The government must change course, he says. I want us to be richer, not poorer. Yet every serious international body, including the IMF, the OECD, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research – as well as Nobel prize-winners – forecast we will be poorer outside the EU. Such forecasts could be wrong, but to dismiss them out of hand is reckless. Our own government has assessed our post-Brexit position upon three separate criteria: that we stay in the Single Market; or reach a trade deal with Europe; or fail to do so. Each option shows us to be worse off: and disastrously so with no trade deal at all. And the poorest regions will be hurt the most. If, as negotiations proceed, this analysis appears to be correct, that cannot be brushed aside. I know of no precedent for any government enacting a policy that will make both our country and our people poorer. Once that is apparent, the government must change course. Major goes on about the effect of Brexit on the UK’s standing. For decades, we British have super-charged our influence around the world by our closeness to the US (which policy divisions are lessening); and our membership of the EU (which we are abandoning). As a result, we are already becoming a lesser actor. No‑one – leaver or remainer – can welcome that. We are all urged to be “patriotic” and get behind Brexit. But it is precisely because I am patriotic that I oppose it. I want my country to be influential, not isolated; committed, not cut-off; a leading participant, not a bystander. Major says people have started to think Brexit won’t be too bad. In recent weeks, the idea has gained ground that Brexit won’t be too bad; that we will all get through it; that we’re doing better than expected – and all will be well. Of course we will get through it: life as we know it won’t come to an end. We are too resourceful and talented a nation for that. But our nation is owed a frank assessment of what leaving Europe may mean – for now and the future. I fear we will be weaker and less prosperous – as a country and as individuals. And – although it grieves me to admit it – our divorce from Europe will diminish our international stature. Indeed, it already has. Major says Brexit has already diminished the UK’s international stature. Major says parliament must consider the will of the people, but also “the well being of the people”. It has been the most divisive issue of his lifetime, he says. Brexit has been the most divisive issue of my lifetime. It has divided not only the four nations of our UK, but regions within them. It has divided political parties; political colleagues; families; friends – and the young from the old. We have to heal those divisions. They have been made worse by the character of the Brexit debate with its intolerance, its bullying, and its name-calling. I welcome rigorous debate – but there must be respect for differing views that are honestly held. In this debate there are no “remoaners”, no “mutineers”, no “enemies of the people” – just voices setting out what they believe is right for our country. Sir John Major, the Conservative former prime minister, has just started giving a speech on Brexit to the Creative Industries Federation. He says he is not a Europhile or a Eurosceptic. He says: I am neither a Europhile nor a Eurosceptic. As prime minister, I said “No” to federal integration, “No” to the Euro Currency, and “No” to Schengen – which introduced free movement of people within the European Union but without proper control of external borders. But I am a realist. I believe that to risk losing our trade advantages with the colossal market on our doorstep is to inflict economic self-harm on the British people. Ireland has warned that it would be “hard to see’ how Theresa May can deliver on her promise of an invisible border in Northern Ireland if the UK leaves the customs union and the single market. The deputy prime minister has warned that it would be “hard to see’ how the prime minister can deliver on her promise of an invisible border in Northern Ireland if the UK leaves the customs union and the single market. Simon Coveney was audibly exasperated during an interview on Irish radio pointing out Ireland had “supported” Britain’s desire to move to phase 2 talks in December because of the very guarantees it had agreed on the Irish border. Nobody is looking to pick a fight, nobody’s looking to have a go at the British government,” he said on RTE's News at One. “The problem here is the British government’s stated position, [in December] and still now, is they want to make sure there is no border infrastructure between Northern Ireland and Ireland, they don’t want trade barriers between Northern Ireland and the UK and that the UK is leaving the customs union and the single market and those things are simply not compatible. “It’s hard to see that being done if the British government continues to pursue leaving the customs union and the single market; it’s hard to see how you avoid border structures in that kind of context,” he said. \"Our response is, look, this [option C] doesn't have to be the solution but come up with something better that we can agree and we'd be delighted to agree,\" he said. \"We are trying to protect the status quo which is also protecting the Good Friday agreement in terms of north-south co-operation.\" Coveney’s remarks comes amid accusations that the EU is using the Northern Ireland border to issue to force May to stay in the customs union and the single market. The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier faced a barrage of questions on the matter at a briefing in Brussels with British press asking him if he was not “meddling” with Britain’s constitution by forcing Northern Ireland to stay in the customs union as a workaround to the Irish border issue. Coveney said Britain had to move fast to come up with an alternative solution. “We have to see an approach coming from the British government that allows for trade between the EU and UK that’s doesn’t allow borders and that solves the problem for Northern Ireland which was agreed in December,” he said. According to the BBC’s Philip Sim, Michael Russell, the Scottish government’s Brexit minister, has called for Boris Johnson to be sacked. In the Commons Gregory Campbell, the DUP MP for East Londonderry, says he lives closer to the Irish border than any other MP. He says it would be impossible to introduce a hard border in Ireland anyway because, with the border being so long, residents would easily find a way of circumventing it. Labour and the SNP have both criticised the government for its handling of the Brexit talks with the EU. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said: The EU-UK government war of words needs to end. There can be absolutely no deviation from the solemn commitments made to Northern Ireland at the end of the first phase of Brexit negotiations. That means no hard border or any agreement that would undermine the Good Friday Agreement. Theresa May’s failure to offer any viable solution to the border in Northern Ireland has come back to haunt her. And Stephen Gethins, the SNP’s foreign affairs and Europe spokesman, said: The UK government’s response to the EU’s withdrawal agreement has shown the chaos consuming Downing Street, given that the draft should contain no surprises for the Tories as the terms were discussed and agreed in the December negotiations. We are fully 20 months on from the EU referendum, and it is beyond belief that the UK government is immobilised by incompetence and incapable of reaching a position amongst themselves on the UK’s future relationship with the EU. Labour’s Stephen Timms asks if cameras count as infrastructure. Is there any example of a border anywhere in the world with no customs union and no infrastructure? (He is trying to get a clearer answer to the question posed by Yvette Cooper. See 1.15pm.) Lidington says the joint report in December is clear; it says there should be no associated infrastructure. This is what the Press Association has filed about the May/Corbyn exchanges at PMQs. Theresa May accused Labour of betraying Britons over Brexit as she faced calls to put the country ahead of her cabinet’s “oversized egos”. The prime minister attacked Jeremy Corbyn’s latest policy after he confirmed the opposition will back a “new and comprehensive” UK-EU customs union to ensure tariff-free trade. But the Labour leader hit back, insisting May is “incapable” of delivering a “coherent and decisive plan” for Brexit due to divisions in her government. He also questioned Boris Johnson’s remarks over the Irish border, to which the PM insisted she and the foreign secretary are “absolutely committed” to ensuring there is no hard border. Brexit dominated the leaders’ exchanges at PMQs for a second successive week, having barely featured in previous outings. Speaking in the Commons, May said she was left confused by Corbyn’s speech on Labour wanting to “negotiate a new comprehensive customs union”. She said: “That would mean that we couldn’t do our trade deals and actually it would betray the vote of the British people. “In the next sentence he said he wanted a customs arrangement meaning we could negotiate our new trade deals - well that’s the government’s position, so what’s he want to do - let down the country or agree with the government?” Corbyn, rising to ask his first question, took aim at Mrs May’s Brexit day and asked her to tell the country what “ambitious managed divergence” will mean. He later said he understood May would make a Brexit speech on Friday and raised concerns of businesses and for the health service. Corbyn pressed the PM to outline which sectors of the government want to remain aligned and which they plan to diverge. Some opposition MPs shouted at May to question why she was making a separate speech outside parliament, which prompted the PM to say: “Just calm down.” The PM said she had already set out the government’s position and would elaborate later in the week. Corbyn criticised May for her “endless round of after-dinner speeches” on Europe and later attacked the government’s record on training health workers, adding it “doesn’t seem to understand it takes eight years to train a doctor”. He said they were also “completely oblivious” to 100,000 vacancies in the NHS, adding: “I suggest some members get a life and go and visit a hospital and see just how hard those people work in order to cover for the vacancies that are there.” Turning to the Irish border, Corbyn noticed Johnson was shouting at him and joked: “He’s obviously mixing up the border with the Camden-Islington border.” May, in her reply, told MPs: “He said it takes eight years to train a doctor - well, if he’s worried about the number of doctors there are now, eight years ago it was a Labour government that was deciding how doctors were going to be trained.” On the border, she said: “The foreign secretary and I are absolutely committed to ensuring that we deliver on no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. “That’s the position of the UK government, it’s the position of the parties in Northern Ireland, it’s the position of the Irish government and it was what we agreed in the December agreement of that joint report. “We are all committed to ensuring there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.” Labour’s Vernon Coaker asks why Boris Johnson spoke about the possibility of a hard border in Ireland in his letter when the government has repeatedly rule this out. Lidington says government policy is as it has been set out. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter, says the Irish economy, and particularly its agriculture, will be devastated if there is a hard border in Ireland. Has the government pointed that out to the Irish prime minister? Lidington says Ireland is actively trying to find a solution to this problem. John Bercow, the speaker, says he has been told that Theresa May will make a statement to MPs about Brexit policy on Monday. That will be the moment when she updates the Commons on the plans she is setting out in her speech on Friday. Theresa May to make Commons statement on her latest Brexit plans on Monday, MPs told. The SNP’s Joanna Cherry asks Lidington to confirm that what is in the draft treaty published today is “exactly” the backstop that Theresa May agreed to in December. Lidington says Michel Barnier himself has said that the text out today is just a first draft. He says there will be no cherry picking. It is important for the final draft to reflect “all the paragraphs” in the joint report agreed in December (pdf). He says, from what he has seen of the draft text so far, it does not do that. Lidington says EU draft withdrawal treaty does not fully reflect what was agreed in December. Labour’s Chris Leslie asks when the Foreign Office will publish the Johnson letter, as Johnson promised would happen this morning. Lidington replies: “We don’t publish internal government correspondence.” Boris Johnson reneges on promise to publish his private letter about the Irish border. Back in the Commons Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the Commons home affairs committee, says Boris Johnson compared border checks in Ireland with the congestion charge. But cameras in London are in built-up areas, she says. And she says there has been a long history of people between the people of inner and outer London. Northern Ireland is different, she says. She says there were four attacks on police officers last year, 58 shooting incidents and 33 bombing incidents. She says the Police Service of Northern Ireland has said that any infrastructure on the border would be under threat. Will the government rule out installing cameras at the border? Lidington says the government is committed to no physical infrastructure at the border. (That does seem to imply no cameras, unless the government is planning something involving hidden, micro-cameras.) And this is what Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Wesminster, said about the draft EU treaty. He said: I think the initial reaction is one of amazement that the EU thinks that these kinds of proposition both on the jurisdiction of the European court of justice and particularly on the Northern Ireland border issue could fly with either us or the British government. Here is Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, on the draft withdrawal agreement. Ken Clarke, a Conservative, asks if Lidington thinks it will just be up to the UK to decide how regulatory alignment in Ireland works. Lidington says, when the UK leaves the EU, EU law will no longer apply. Lidington says the government is looking at how it will keep the border in Ireland open. Theresa May will say more in her speech on Friday, he says. Thornberry is responding. She says it is a “disgrace” and discourtesy to the Commons that Boris Johnson is not here to answer the UQ himself, particularly since he gave an interview in the snow earlier. She quotes Johnson telling her in the Commons that he stood by his referendum claim that the border in Ireland would remain unchanged. But last night his letter was leaked. It speculated about a hard border being introduced. The letter shows that Johnson accepts the need for changes to the current border arrangements, and the needs for checks. Thornberry says Johnson should know by now you cannot he half pregnant. What is the truth? Will there be border checks or not? And how can you have border controls without cameras? Is this just another fantasy, she asks. She welcomes the fact Johnson has said he will publish his letter. How would Johnson’s proposed “invisible border” work in practice? She says Labour’s view is that the only way to avoid a border is to stay in the customs union. She says ministers are saying one thing in private, and another in public, and it is “about time this deception is ended”. Thornberry accuses Johnson of perpetrating a “deception” about Ireland. She says he is saying one thing about the Irish border in public, and another in private Labour’s Emily Thornberry asks the question. David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, is responding. He says the government will not accept anything that undermines the constitutional integrity of the UK, or that creates a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. PMQs is over. There is jeering in the chamber - I think from Labour MPs complaining about Boris Johnson leaving, and not staying to respond in person to the urgent question about his letter about the Irish border. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, used his first question to ask about devolution and Brexit. May replied: Of course I continue to stand by wanting to ensure that all parts of the UK continue to flourish, I think the best way of doing that is ensuring all parts of the UK remain in the UK. Then Blackford asked about Boris Johnson’s letter about the Irish border. He said: The foreign secreatry’s leaked letter shows he can’t get to grips with one of the most fundamental issues of Brexit. The foreign secretary compared crossing the Irish border to going between Camden and Westminster. Frankly you could not make this stuff up. This is a UK government prepared to put in jeopardy the Good Friday agreement. Does the prime minister agree with her bumbling foreign secretary, who is making the UK a laughing stock? May said she was committed to the Belfast agreement. I’ve taken the quotes from PoliticsHome. Simon Hoare, a Conservative, asks May to confirm the Good Friday agreement is safe in her hands. May says this year marks its 20th anniversary. She remains committed to it. Anne Main, a Conservative, asks if May is concerned about the links Max Mosley has with Impress, the press regulator, and some leading politicians. (She means Tom Watson.) May says some people will have been surprised by Mosley’s links with some politicians. She says the press must be free to shine a light on abuses. While she is prime minister, that will never change. Labour’s Frank Field asks May to stop a proposed cut for the victims of modern slavery. May says she is not aware of the details of this, but DWP will look at this. Philip Davies, a Conservatives, asks about women being discriminated against by Sharia councils. Feminists do not talk about this, he says. Isn’t it time this was ended? May says there is only one law in the UK. As home secretary she set up a review of Sharia courts. It has recently been published, and the Home Office will respond shortly. Labour’s Liz Kendall asks about the explosion in Leicester. Will May also pay tribute to residents who have pulled together to support each other? May expresses condolences to the family and friends of those killed. She is happy to pay tribute to local residents. Everything will be done to get to the bottom of why this happened, she says. Plaid Cymru’s Jonathan Edwards says Wales will be a “vassal country” under the government’s Brexit devolution plans. May says she does not agree. She says the government wants EU powers being repatriated to go to the devolved administrations. Labour’s Ian Mearns asks about youth unemployment in the north east. May says the apprenticeship levy is intended to ensure that there are more opportunities for young people. James Brokenshire, the Conservative former Northern Ireland, back in the Commons after cancer treatment, says early diagnosis is crucial. Will May ensure an early check programme is promoted widely? And will she tackle the stigma around lung cancer. May says she is delighted to see Brokenshire back. He is right about early diagnosis. She says people should realise that, if they have the slightest doubt about something, they should get it checked out. Many men particularly resist this, she says. Early diagnosis can make an enormous difference, she says. Labour’s John Grogan asks if May will support Yorkshire councils trying to get an all-Yorskhire devolution settlement by 2020. May says the government has agreed a city deal with Sheffield city region. She hears what Grogan is saying, and the communities secretary recently met Yorkshire councils to discuss this. Rachael Maclean, a Conservative, asks May if she agrees that it is the Conservatives who deliver most for women. May says she is happy to celebrate international women’s day. PMQs - Snap verdict: Corbyn’s Brexit speech on Monday clarified the divide between Labour and the Tories on this topic, and this may explain why today he sounded more confident than before tackling May on this topic. Her attempt to rubbish the new Labour position in response to an early planted question didn’t quite hit home, and so the Corbyn/May exchanges felt very much like a score draw, shedding little light on policy, but covering quite a lot of ground. Corbyn’s point about business groups having more credibility on the needs of business than Liam Fox (a doctor, before he became an MP) was good and well put, and he was effective too on recruitment vacancies in the NHS. But May had fairly decent responses, and her argument about eight-year timetables for doctor recruitment meant that, when she parried Corbyn with a reference to the last Labour government, for once it sounded as if she had a point. Corbyn’s best moment probably came when he mocked Boris Johnson, and his best question was the one about how May can square with what she is saying now about not having a hard border in Ireland with Johnson’s private letter suggesting that he clearly sees this as an option. But he did not push this charge repeatedly or aggressively, and it ended up feeling like a key attack line that didn’t get fully exploited. Corbyn says, if that is the case, why is Boris Johnson writing to May proposing the opposite. This is a government in disarray. All we get are soundbites. We had ‘Brexit means Brexit’, then ‘red, white and blue Brexit’, then ‘liberal Brexit’, then “ambitious, managed divergence’. May says the government is giving people optimism. Corbyn would betray voters, and let the public down. Corbyn says the government has cut nurse bursaries. The government does not understand that it takes eight years to train a doctor. And there are 100,000 vacancies in the NHS. We should give immediate reassurance to NHS workers in the NHs, he says. He says Boris Johnson said recently a hard border in Ireland was unthinkable. As Johnson jeers, Corbyn says he is obviously mixing it up with the Camden/Islington border. Can May confirm she will keep the Irish border open. May says the December agreement included assurances for EU nationals in the UK. On nurses, she says there are more nurses now than before. And if Corbyn says it takes eight years to train a doctor, then eight years ago it was a Labour government in charge. On Ireland, she says the government is committed to having no hard border. Corbyn says Fox thinks groups like the CBI are wrong. But maybe they have got more of a clue than he has. Can May say where the UK will remain aligned, and where the UK will diverge. May says she will be making a speech later. She makes a peculiar “Urgh” sound as MPs jeer, and says “just calm down”. She says she wants to ensure trade does go across borders, and that there is no hard border. She says Labour does not have a clue about business. It wants to borrow £500m. Corbyn says health and social care is already suffering badly. It is reliant on migrant workers. Isn’t May concerned the health workers are leaving the UK in unprecedented numbers? May says the latest immigration figures show there are still more people coming in from the EU than leaving. The government wants to improve opportunities for people in the UK to work in the NHS. Jeremy Corbyn starts by paying tribute to those killed in the Leicester explosion. He says May promised “ambitious, managed divergence” after Brexit. What on earth does that mean? May also pays tribute to the work of the emergency services in Leicester. On Brexit, she says she wants to deliver on the wishes of the British people to get control of borders, laws and money. Labour wants the opposite, which would be a betrayal of the British people. Corbyn says 94% of small and medium-sized business say the government is ignoring their concerns. Who is best at representing the views of businesses? He lists three business groups, and offers Liam Fox as an alternative. May says the Federation of Small Businesses backs the government position. The Conservative MP Ranil Jayawardena asks May to explain the difference between a customs union and a customs arrangement. May says the government wants to be able to negotiate its own trade deals. She says Corbyn said he wanted that, but he also wanted to be in a customs union. Labour’s Paul Blomfield asks about Sheffield Young Carers, a group that helps young carers. Will Theresa May meet them? May says there are many young people caring for their parents who all too often go unseen and unheard. The government plans to publish a plan to help them, he says. PMQs is about to start, so I’m turning away from the Barnier press conference. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. My colleague Lisa O’Carroll has tweeted what the draft treaty says about Ireland. Q: In December the whole divorce agreement almost fell through. You must be aware of how explosive this is. Do you want to shock the UK into action? Barnier says he is familiar with the UK political situation. But there are complicated situations in other EU states. He says it was the UK that decided to leave the EU, unilaterally. And it initiated the exit in March, with the article 50 letter. And it was Theresa May who set the date for Brexit. We are 13 months away. He says he respects the UK and its citizens. He says we need a treaty, one that is legally binding and valid. He is not talking about just warm words. Q: Do you not accept it is inevitable, that if the regulatory alignment backstop measure is approved, a border will be established in the Irish sea? Barnier says he does not accept that. He says there is no certainty the backstop will be used. He says he hopes they will find a solution under the first option (a new trade deal). Q: Are you trying to force Theresa May to stay in the customs union? Or are you trying to force a border between Britain and Ireland, which could topple her government? Barnier says he knows the constitutional order of the UK, and respects that. But he is trying to find solutions, he says. He is trying to take a “calm and pragmatic” approach to this subject. Barnier says his attitude is keep calm and be pragmatic. After his opening statement Barnier is now taking questions. Q: The protocol on Northern Ireland would change the territorial status of Northern Ireland. That is unacceptable to any UK government. So isn’t this protocol worthless? What’s the point? Barnier says he does not understand the question. Barnier says there are “significant divergences, too many divergences” on transition issues. He will mention two. First, the UK wants to give EU nationals arriving in the UK during the transition different rights from those here before. This is a “major issue” for the EU, he says. He says the EU thinks they should be treated fairly, in the same way as those in the UK earlier. Second, the UK is asking for the right to oppose new EU rules coming into force during the transition. He says the EU does not agree. That would create the risk of regulatory divergence, he says. He says, for these reasons, “the transition is not a given”. Barnier says there are “too many” differences between the EU and the UK on the transition. He says the transition “is not a given” as a result. Barnier says there are no surprises in the text on the other separation issues. He says the EU’s position on the ECJ has not changed. The EU thinks the ECJ should play a role wherever the withdrawal agreement refers to EU law. That is the EU position, he says. Having a draft text will make it easier to speed up talks. He says the UK and the EU have agreed to hold a round of talks next week. Barnier announces fresh round of EU-UK talks next week. Barnier says the EU is willing to discuss all three options in the joint report in parallel. He will meet Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, and Michelle O’Neill, the Sinn Fein leader in Northern Ireland, early next week, he says. On Ireland, Barnier says the points in the draft treaty have been agreed with the EU. He says the joint report agreed in December (pdf) included, in paragraph 49, three options for dealing with the border issue. The first related to a trade deal. But that will not be in place at the time of Brexit. The second related to specific proposals to simplify border arrangements. The EU has not had those yet. The third involves regulatory alignment. It is the backstop solution, he says. He says the EU has applied imagination and creativity to find a solution to the threat Brexit poses to Irish border arrangements. He says the EU’s approach is focused on areas where it is necessary to avoid border checks. Daily life around the border should continue as today. Barnier says all financial commitments undertaken by the EU28 will be respected. And the Irish border will be protected, he says. Barnier says he has three points to make. First, if Brexit is going to happen, we need to “pick up the pace”, he says. He says there are only 13 months to go before the UK is due top leave the EU. Barnier says Brexit talks need to be accelerated. He says the EU wants to work with the UK on a legal text, which will bring clarity. Second, this is a draft, he says. He says he will only place it on the table with the UK once talks with the EU27 and the European parliament have concluded. He says he is committed to transparency. This transparency is important. He says the draft is based on legal principles and fact. Third, he says the draft text contains no surprise for the UK. It expresses what was agreed in December. But it does contain the EU view on issues where there has been no progress in talks since December. And it includes the EU view on the transition, he says. Barnier says the draft withdrawal treaty has just been published. Here it is. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, is holding a press conference in Brussels now. You can watch a live feed here. According to PoliticsHome’s Kevin Schofield, the Foreign Office is sending Mark Field, a junior minister, to respond to the UQ about Boris Johnson’s Irish border letter, not Johnson himself. John Bercow, the speaker, has granted a Commons urgent question on the Boris Johnson Irish border leak. Labour want Johnson to appear in the Commons to respond, but it is possible that he could send a junior Foreign Office minister in his place. At the Northern Ireland affairs committee the DUP MP Ian Paisley told Karen Bradley that the EU Was trying to “annex” Northern Ireland. He said he wanted the government to “show some teeth” and resist the EU. He told Bradley: I’m appalled and disgusted at how the EU can dare to say that they want to annex a part of the United Kingdom and take it away from the governance of the rest of the United Kingdom. I’m delighted at what you said in your opening comments about how Northern Ireland will be treated in the same way as the rest of the United Kingdom. [See 10.41am.] That’s absolutely critical going forward. We are now facing the biggest test in the resolve of the character of this government, in terms of how they deal with the EU. And I wish you well, I wish the government well. But I would ask the government now to show some teeth now to the European Union that we will not be rolling over to their demands about annexing part of our country. And I want to leave that on the record with you and I want you to take that message back to the cabinet. When Paisley talks about the EU wanting to “annex” Northern Ireland, that is his analysis of what option C in the joint report would amount to, as codified in the draft EU withdrawal treaty. (See 10.59am.) The FT’s Alex Barker has started tweeting extracts from the draft EU withdrawal treaty being published by the EU this morning. I’ve just called the Foreign Office to ask if they will be publishing the Boris Johnson letter about the Irish border, as Johnson said he would this morning. (See 9.26am.) They said they would get back to me ... And this is what Bradley said about the draft withdrawal treaty text being published by the EU today. It is important to note that this is an attempt, an initial attempt, by the European Union to codify what option C, which is the fallback option if we are unable to resolve the border through the overall relationship or through the overall relationship in option B with some specific solutions recognising the unique circumstances in Northern Ireland. And this is the EU’s document. It is not the British government’s document. The United Kingdom government has not had input into this document. And I look forward to seeing it. But it is not a final position. Here is the key quote from Karen Bradley on the border. The British government stands resolutely behind the joint report of December ... That means that, as the joint report says very clearly, there will be no hard border. We have said that, the Irish government have said that, the EU have said that. No new physical infrastructure at the border. And that is north/south, but also east/west. So, to be absolutely clear, the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom is paramount and something that the United Kingdom government will ensure is what we achieve. Andrew Murrison, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, starts by asking Karen Bradley to clarify the government’s stance on the Irish border. Bradley says she cannot comment on leaked documents. But the British government stands resolutely behind the joint report from December. That means, as the joint report says, there will be no hard border. The UK government has said that, the Irish government have said that, and the EU have said that. That means no physical infrastructure at the border, she says. She says she has not seen the EU document being published later. But this will be “an initial attempt” to codify how option C - the fallback option, if other options do not work - could operate. It will be an EU document, not a government document. She goes on: It is not a final position. Bradley reaffirms government’s commitment to avoiding a hard border in Ireland. She plays down significance of EU draft legal text, saying it is “an initial attempt” by the EU to draft a treaty and “not a final position”. And it does not represent the UK government’s position, she says. Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland secretary, is about to give evidence to the Commons Northern Ireland committee. The hearing is not explicitly about Brexit - it will focus mainly on the attempts to restore power sharing in Northern Ireland - but it would be odd if Brexit does not come up. You can watch a live feed here. I will be monitoring the hearing and posting highlights. Sammy Wilson, the DUP’s Brexit spokesman, has accused the EU of trying to use the Irish border issue to keep the whole of the UK in the customs union. He told the Today programme that, of the three proposals in paragraph 49 of the joint report intended to ensure there is no need for a hard border in Ireland after Brexit, the EU was only interested in the UK government’s fallback one, regulatory alignment. Wilson said: The EU have been trying to manoeuvre the negotiations to ensure that the United Kingdom as a whole stays within the single market and customs union and have been using - or abusing - Northern Ireland to try and bring that situation about. It seems that the EU have made it quite clear that the only option they are interested in is regulatory alignment which would either remove Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom, separate us from our main market and politically create an issue where we are separated from the rest of the United Kingdom, or else force the whole of the United Kingdom to stay in the single market and the customs union. This is much the same as what Boris Johnson was saying, although Johnson did not make it explicit that he was referring to the EU. (See 9.05am.) In this interesting Twitter thread Peter Foster, the Telegraph’s Europe editor, speculates about the Johnson leak being part of an operation to intensify pressure for the UK to remain in the customs union. On the Today programme David Jones, the former Brexit minister and a prominent Tory Brexiter, said that what the EU would be proposing in its draft withdrawal treaty today would be “completely unacceptable”. He told the programme: What is proposed is that Northern Ireland should remain part of the customs union, it should effectively be part of the single market, and should, I understand, remain subject to the European court of justice. That effectively amounts to an annexure of Northern Ireland by the European Union ... I think that it would be pretty catastrophic and I think that the European Union in actually proposing this is behaving wholly irresponsibly. Here is a full summary of what Boris Johnson said in his post-run doorstep interview with Sky News. Johnson, the foreign secretary, claimed that concerns about the Irish border were being exploited by those trying to “frustrate Brexit” and to keep the UK in the customs union. (See 9.05am.) He defended the letter leaked to Sky News implying he would be willing to accept some form of hard border in Ireland. It was “a very positive letter”, he said: What the letter says is that, actually, there are are very good solutions that you could put in place that would obviate, prevent any kind of hard border but would allow goods, people - people of course move totally freely anyway because of the common travel area - allow goods to move freely without let or hindrance whilst allowing the UK to come out of the customs union, take back control of our tariffs schedules, take back control of our commercial policy, take back control of our regulation. It is a very positive letter .... The DUP, as far as I understand the matter, are worried about the possibility of an east-west border which would be necessitated by having a system on the island of Ireland that didn’t allow for some sort of verification of traders going north-south, but what the letter points out is that there are all sorts of ways of doing that without having a hard border. He said he would publish the full text of the letter himself. After challenging Sky to publish the full text, he went on: I’ll put it online myself, how about that? I don’t have it now - but we’ll certainly do that. He defended his comments yesterday about how the congestion charge showed how technology could minimise the need for border checks in Ireland after Brexit. Challenging the Sky reporter, he said: I don’t know whether you have ever driven into the congestion charge zone from outside the congestion charge zone - have you? Do you slow down? Do you feel any let or hindrance? Do you check your progress? Do you brake? Do you? When asked if this meant Ireland could expect a Transport for London-style border, he replied: All I’m saying is there are solutions that we can envisage, we have got to be positive about this. It’s another big Brexit day and the EU is publishing its draft text of the withdrawal treaty setting the terms for the UK’s departure from the EU. It is based on the joint report (pdf) agreed in December but, while the joint report was agreed by London and Brussels, the UK government is gearing up to protest strongly about some aspects of today’s 120-page legal text. That is partly because today’s document in some respects just represents the EU’s opening bid for negotiation. But it is also an example of how intentional ambiguities in a 15-page political document (which allowed Theresa May to put one spin on the December agreement, while the EU interpreted it differently) get vapourised when that gets translated into legalese. Here is our overnight story about the draft text. The key sticking point is what to do about Northern Ireland, a problem exacerbated by the Sky News reporting last night on a leaked letter sent by Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, to Theresa May suggesting that he would be willing to accept some form of hard border in Ireland - contrary to assurances given repeatedly by the government. This morning Sky doorstepped Johnson outside his official residence at Carlton Gardens and, as he got back from a run in the snow, he gave them an interview, claiming that fears about the Irish border were being exploited by those who wanted to “frustrate Brexit” and keep the UK in the customs union. He said: What is going on at the moment is that the issue of the Northern Irish border is being used quite a lot politically to try and keep the UK in the customs union - effectively the single market - so we cannot really leave the EU, that is what is going on ... If I may respectively say so, I think that the particular problems around the Irish border are being used politically to drive the whole Brexit argument, and effectively to try to frustrate Brexit. I think there are better ways forward. Johnson did not say whether he was accusing Brussels of exploiting the issue in this way, or soft Brexiters in the UK, or both of them. He also ridiculed the “inverted pyramid of objections” being raised by his critics. We can do this - we can come out of the customs union while solving the Northern Ireland border problem and we must not allow this great sort of inverted pyramid of objections to be built over this problem, which I think is eminently solvable. The last time he used the phrase “inverted pyramid” in public was when he dismissed the claims that he was having an affair with Petronella Wyat as an “inverted pyramid of piffle”. But they were true, and he ended up having to resign from the opposition front bench. I will post more from his interview shortly. Here is the agenda for the day. 10.15am: Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland secretary, gives evidence to the Commons Northern Ireland committee. Late morning: Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, gives a press conference in Brussels as the EU publishes its draft text for the Brexit withdrawal treaty. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 2pm: Sir John Major, the Conservative former prime minister, gives a speech on Brexit. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here.

The prime minister went on the political offensive against Shorten after the businessman and environmentalist Geoff Cousins revealed a series of conversations with the Labor leader over the past three months about stopping the controversial Adani coal project in Queensland. Cousins told Guardian Australia on Wednesday Shorten had contacted him just before Christmas to seek his advice on toughening Labor’s position on Adani, and the two men had travelled with experts to the Great Barrier Reef in late January – a trip which resulted in Shorten signalling to him that he would commit to revoking the licence for the project over the ensuing weeks. Keen after a torrid fortnight consumed by Barnaby Joyce and his private travails to resume the Coalition’s preferred tactic of muscling up aggressively against the Labor leader, and questioning Shorten’s character, Turnbull seized on the account early in the day, accusing the opposition leader of trying to be all things to all people. “This is a guy who says one thing to the greenies and another thing to the miners,” the prime minister said. “He isn’t straight. He isn’t fair dinkum and he’s being shown up for precisely what he is – someone who will sell out workers and miners and his own union members in order to pick up some Green votes in inner-city electorates like Batman.” The prime minister then amplified his theme in the parliament, declaring a “two-faced” Shorten had been on a secret trip with Cousins, with the Labor leader only declaring the January travel supplied by the Australian Conservation Foundation this week. While Shorten’s dialogue with Cousins has not been reported before this week, the trip was not a secret. The fact Shorten had been in Queensland to fact-find on Adani, and had been in dialogue with environment groups before the resumption of parliament in early February, had been publicly reported. The ACF’s chief executive, Kelly O’Shanassy, said Shorten made contact with Cousins, who was no longer the president of the organisation, last year, and “the Labor leader proposed that they travel to the Great Barrier Reef to witness the damage from climate change-fuelled coral bleaching and to discuss the Adani coal project”. “Geoff approached ACF asking for our assistance in organising such a trip and arranging scientific experts to explain the further damage the Adani coalmine would inflict on the reef, the climate and our native species,” she said. “ACF was happy to organise the trip as it provided one of our senior elected representatives in Canberra with a chance to see firsthand the damage climate change is doing to our Great Barrier Reef. “In the past ACF has made similar offers to Coalition and crossbench MPs so that they too might witness the unprecedented mass coal bleaching that hit the Great Barrier Reef in 2016 and 2017.” Shorten has been telegraphing publicly since late January a toughening of Labor’s position on the controversial coal project, but has not specified what if anything the ALP would do by way of concrete action to shut down the project. According to Cousins – an account which has not been contradicted by Shorten – the Labor leader told him after their trip in January that he would make Labor’s position clear imminently, but then subsequently adjusted that timetable, suggesting he’d met some internal resistance. The internal resistance has been in the public domain for several weeks. The mining union made it known publicly that Labor should not harden its position on the Carmichael project, because if it did, it would trigger a divisive internal debate about the future of coal – a debate the party wasn’t ready to have. Some frontbenchers, including Anthony Albanese, argued Adani had already been through approval processes and Labor needed to be consistent in its approach. “What you can’t do is look at any one electorate and say this is why we are going to determine national policy on something like mining or energy or climate change action,” Albanese said, in a clear reference to the Batman byelection where Labor is currently facing off against the Greens in Melbourne’s northern suburbs. Guardian Australia has contacted Shorten’s office on multiple occasions to seek a response to the comments by Cousins."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/28/national-gallery-of-victoria-dumps-wilson-security-over-offshore-detention","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T07:29:56Z","webTitle":"National Gallery of Victoria dumps Wilson Security over offshore detention","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/28/national-gallery-of-victoria-dumps-wilson-security-over-offshore-detention","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/28/national-gallery-of-victoria-dumps-wilson-security-over-offshore-detention","fields":{"headline":"National Gallery of Victoria dumps Wilson Security over offshore detention","bodyText":"The National Gallery of Victoria confirmed it has dropped its security contractor, Wilson Security. It follows protests from international artists and activists against the security firm, which provided services at offshore detention facilities on Manus Island and Nauru. Following Guardian Australia’s release of the Nauru Files, Wilson Security has been subject to serious allegations of sexual assault and violence by its employees against refugees and asylum seekers, including children and women, detained at the centres. Wilson’s contract with the centres expired on October 2017; it has been under contract with the NGV since July. The Artists’ Committee – a group of arts workers who have been petitioning the gallery to drop Wilsons – said on Wednesday they had received a message from an NGV official saying “SecureCorp has been appointed as the NGV’s long-term security provider”. The gallery has been under increasing pressure to cancel the contract. The Artists’ Committee have staged a number of stunts at the gallery, including blockading the entrance, adding red dye to the outside water feature and covering Picasso’s Weeping Woman with a black veil branded by Wilson Security. At the recent NGV Triennial – the inaugural major design exhibition – international artists including Richard Mosse, Candice Breitz and Rafael Lozano-Hemmer joined the protest, renaming or changing their exhibiting works in solidarity. In August, following an open letter signed by more than 1,500 members of the arts community urging the gallery to cancel the contract, the NGV released a statement clarifying that Wilson Security was the gallery’s “interim security service provider”, chosen by the Victorian government security services panel following a wage scandal involving their previous contractor, Business Risks. However in a statement issued on Wednesday, an NGV spokesman said the gallery had changed security providers, but he did not state that it was due to public pressure, or because of Wilson Security’s association with detention centres. “Wilson Security was the NGV’s interim security service provider while we were in a Victorian government procurement process to secure a long-term security services provider,” the statement said. “We have commenced the short transition to our new provider.” In response, Artists’ Committee member Kylie Wilkinson said the NGV had “done the right thing ... We hope that these discussions have resonated in the state offices and will have an impact on other contracts that the Victorian government is involved in”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/01/labor-absolutely-committed-to-demand-driven-university-funding-plibersek","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T20:45:47Z","webTitle":"Labor 'absolutely committed' to demand-driven university funding – Plibersek","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/01/labor-absolutely-committed-to-demand-driven-university-funding-plibersek","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/01/labor-absolutely-committed-to-demand-driven-university-funding-plibersek","fields":{"headline":"Labor 'absolutely committed' to demand-driven university funding – Plibersek","bodyText":"Labor is “absolutely committed” to demand-driven university funding and will end the government’s two-year freeze on commonwealth grants, Tanya Plibersek says. On Thursday, Labor’s deputy leader and opposition education spokeswoman will tell the Universities Australia conference in Canberra that the party “won’t walk away” from the uncapped enrolment system introduced under former prime minister Julia Gillard. The Coalition announced a two-year unlegislated freeze in commonwealth grants funding in its midyear budget update after the $2.8bn package of funding cuts and fee rises announced in the 2017 budget was blocked by the Senate. While it did not directly cap student places, the decision effectively ended the previously bipartisan agreement on demand-driven funding because universities will no longer receive additional direct commonwealth grants funding if enrolments increase. While Labor opposed the decision, it had yet to publicly declare whether it would reverse it. The education minister, Simon Birmingham, had questioned why Labor announced plans for a review of tertiary education if it supports uncapped places. Extracts of Plibersek’s speech seen by Guardian Australia reveal she will promise to end the freeze if Labor is reelected. Plibersek will say the demand-driven system “unlocked opportunity for smart, hard-working kids” and that the freeze will “put a brake on enrolment growth in regional and outer suburban areas and among poorer students”. “Under Labor, we were proud that we oversaw an increase of 190,000 students, many of whom were the first in their family to go to university,” her speech says. “That’s why Labor is absolutely committed to the demand-driven system. And we won’t walk away from it.” The universities sector has argued the freeze is effectively a $2bn cut which will see the equivalent of almost 10,000 student places go unfunded in 2018. Simon Birmingham says the sector has seen its wealth expand rapidly since demand-driven funding was introduced in 2012, and that universities were able to fund places above the cap before the system was established. He wants to introduce a performance-based funding model from 2020 in a bid to increase graduate outcomes and improve attrition rates. Plibersek will also promise to push for changes to university college behaviour after a report released by action group End Rape on Campus on Monday detailed decades of institutionalised hazing and misogyny in residential colleges, especially those at the University of Sydney. Plibersek will say the “shocking behaviour” and culture revealed by the report “must end”, and promise to force universities to ensure university colleges are safe. “I was at uni about 30 years ago [and] 30 years ago we saw the same kind of complaints, and heard the same kind of responses from residential colleges and universities,” Plibersek will say. “Put simply: if university residential colleges can’t provide a safe environment, universities should make them.” The University of Sydney vice chancellor, Michael Spence, has said the university is powerless to stop college hazing practices because the colleges are governed by acts of state parliament, not the university. It means the commonwealth has limited sway in addressing the issue. But Plibersek will argue that if universities can’t ensure the safety of residential colleges “they should sever links with them” and that Labor will “compel” university colleges to fulfil their duty of care. It’s understood that possible measures being considered include reform agreements with the states and territories or financial penalties directed at residential colleges or universities who breach the rules. “If some residential colleges and universities refuse to treat this seriously, governments must make them,” Plibersek will say. “I want to be very clear, if we need to force colleges to do the right thing by their students and staff we will.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/01/the-fiver-sort-of-about-arsenal-manchester-city-but-mainly-about-a-cancelled-flight","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T15:56:24Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | Building a water-feature just outside the entrance to Stafford services","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/01/the-fiver-sort-of-about-arsenal-manchester-city-but-mainly-about-a-cancelled-flight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/01/the-fiver-sort-of-about-arsenal-manchester-city-but-mainly-about-a-cancelled-flight","fields":{"headline":"Building a water-feature just outside the entrance to Stafford services","bodyText":"FRESH OFF THE BOAT Arsenal entertain Manchester City on Thursday night in a repeat of last Sunday’s Littlewoods Cup final slaughter, but with three Premier League points up for grabs instead of a shiny three-handled trophy sponsored by a Thai energy drink manufacturer named after a Philippino water buffalo.

Dame Sally Davies says pollution must be seen as a public health issue and not just an environmental concern. She recommends the government bring in tougher standards to cut air pollution and standardise any road charging introduced to cut nitrogen dioxide pollution from diesel traffic. In her annual report, Davies said leaving decisions on reducing toxic air to local authorities risked creating confusion for drivers and inconsistent implementation. She said: “Instead of being seen as a health issue, pollution is often seen primarily as an environmental problem. This needs to change. As a society we need to regain a focus on pollution as a threat to human health.” The government’s air quality plan has been condemned as so poor as to be unlawful by the high court. Last month ministers were slammed again by a high court judge for failing to produce adequate plans to reduce toxic air. Air pollution is thought to cause and contribute to as many as 40,000 deaths a year in the UK already, especially among vulnerable people such as those with existing respiratory problems, and young children, whose health can be permanently damaged by exposure to the pollutants at a young age. Davies said pollution should be recognised for what it is – a significant cause of non-communicable diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancer and asthma. “Addressing pollution is therefore disease prevention,” she said. Deprived groups in England, and those with underlying medical conditions, particularly the young and the old, suffered the most from exposure to air pollution, often leaving them with lifelong poor health outcomes. She welcomed work in London to improve air quality around schools exposed to the highest levels of toxic air in the city."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/01/tracey-crouch-sports-minister-announces-new-safeguarding-code-children-martial-arts-clubs","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T13:44:57Z","webTitle":"Sports minister introduces martial arts safeguarding code after abuse scandals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/01/tracey-crouch-sports-minister-announces-new-safeguarding-code-children-martial-arts-clubs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/01/tracey-crouch-sports-minister-announces-new-safeguarding-code-children-martial-arts-clubs","fields":{"headline":"Sports minister introduces martial arts safeguarding code after abuse scandals","bodyText":"The government has introduced a safeguarding code for martial arts in response to the duty of care and abuse crisis in British sport over the last two years. There had previously been no overarching safeguarding code for martial arts, which is governed by many different bodies. Tracey Crouch, the minister for sport, said the need for a code had become apparent after a review of safeguarding procedures in the wake of football’s sexual abuse scandal and revelations about bullying and abuse in British Olympic sports. “In the process of making sure safeguarding policies were up to date one of the things that came out of that review was that martial arts was a loophole,” said Crouch. “Because there are so many different governing bodies, they didn’t have a safeguarding policy. This code is designed to give reassurance to parents who are dropping their children off at popular martial arts centres that there are safeguarding procedures in place. It will allow parents to check what processes are in place.” Clubs, providers and coaches can pledge to sign up to the voluntary code, which will go live in June. British Taekwondo, the British Kickboxing Council, British Judo and the English Karate Council are all supportive of the code, and worked with Sport England to develop it. “Safeguarding in sport has changed a lot over the last two years,” said Crouch. “I think there are different aspects of safeguarding. There was the exposure around sexual abuse in football but also bullying and harassment are aspects of the safeguarding environment.” Mike Diaper, Sport England’s executive director, said: “Giving children and young people a positive start in martial arts means they will be more likely to flourish in the sport and stick with it. The safeguarding code in martial arts sets out the expected safeguarding standards and supports martial arts organisations and providers to ensure the sport is safe and enjoyable for all.” Crouch also defended the £28m given by UK Sport, the funding body, to winter Olympic sports over the last four years in contrast with the total funding cut applied to British Basketball at elite level. The CEO of British Basketball, Lisa Wainwright, said the sport is facing the prospect of having its men’s, women’s and youth teams being banned for two years as a result of being unable to fulfil qualifying commitments. “I’m sympathetic to British Basketball and we will look at possible solutions we might offer to the situation that it finds itself in,” said Crouch. “It’s an incredibly popular sport and reaches areas that other sports do not. “It’s clear the no-compromise approach [which dictates UK Sport’s funding model] has changed over the years but ultimately we’re seeing success and I hope we will continue to do so.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/01/spanish-student-cassandra-vera-conviction-twitter-joke-overturned","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T14:58:21Z","webTitle":"Spanish student has conviction for Twitter joke overturned","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/01/spanish-student-cassandra-vera-conviction-twitter-joke-overturned","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/01/spanish-student-cassandra-vera-conviction-twitter-joke-overturned","fields":{"headline":"Spanish student has conviction for Twitter joke overturned","bodyText":"Spain’s supreme court has overturned a sentence handed to a student who used her Twitter account to make jokes about the 1973 assassination of a Spanish prime minister. Last March, the country’s top criminal court gave Cassandra Vera a 12-month suspended sentence and barred her from doing a publicly funded job for seven years after she was found guilty of “humiliating victims of terrorism”. Vera, now 22, had posted jokes about Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco, who was murdered by an Eta bomb so powerful it blew his car more than 20 metres into the air and over the roof of the church where he had just attended mass. “Eta launched a policy against official cars combined with a space programme,” Vera wrote on 29 November 2013. Five months later, she tweeted: “Kissinger gave Carrero Blanco a piece of the moon; Eta paid for the trip there.” On Thursday, the supreme court quashed the conviction, saying it was clear that Vera had been joking, albeit in very poor taste, and had been using variations of familiar jokes about Carrero Blanco’s murder. “While the accused’s conduct is reprehensible and blameworthy from a moral and social point of view – it makes fun of a very serious human tragedy caused by unjustifiable terrorist acts – it does not seem to be a case that requires an answer from the penal system,” the judges said in their ruling. Vera said she was “very happy and incredibly relieved” by the supreme court’s decision. “I’ve had all this hanging over me and have been going through the courts for two years,” she told the Guardian. “It means I can carry on with my plans to become a teacher. My dream isn’t broken any more and I can continue fighting for it.” The case provoked an outcry at the time and increased concerns that the law was being used to stifle freedom of speech in Spain. The row erupted again last week after a work depicting jailed Catalan independence leaders as political prisoners was removed from a Madrid art fair and the rapper Valtonyc had his three and a half year prison sentence upheld after being convicted of distributing songs online that threatened a politician with violence, glorified terrorism and insulted the crown. Meanwhile, a judge ordered the seizure of copies of Fariña, a book about drug trafficking in Galicia, after a former mayor in the region brought legal action against its author. Vera described the cases as deeply worrying and said she hoped the supreme court would also reconsider Valtonyc’s sentence. “People shouldn’t have to be afraid of expressing their opinions,” she said. “What happened with Valtonyc and Fariña and the art exhibition showed that freedom of expression is under serious attack. I think freedom of expression has been dealt an almost fatal blow in Spain.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/01/serial-killer-with-piers-morgan-review","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T22:00:31Z","webTitle":"Serial Killer with Piers Morgan review – gawping at a psychopath","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/01/serial-killer-with-piers-morgan-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/01/serial-killer-with-piers-morgan-review","fields":{"headline":"Serial Killer with Piers Morgan review – gawping at a psychopath","bodyText":"Piers Morgan’s last big television interview – with Donald Trump – attracted criticism and mockery. A bit unfairly, I think. Yes, he was friendly with his interviewee, but we knew that. Ultimately, he did get the interview though, and news lines came from it. Morgan might have used the limited time better talking about Russia, or North Korea. And he might have pressed more, and not used such a matey tone. But he did tackle Trump about retweeting far-right videos, women, climate change, guns and whether he had been invited to Harry and Meghan’s wedding. God, I can’t believe I’m defending Piers Morgan. I don’t like him, I promise, but he is a good journalist. Now, he’s interviewing another dangerous American monster: Lorenzo Gilyard, also known as the Kansas City Strangler, killer of 13 women and serving six life sentences at the Crossroads Correctional Facility in Missouri. After talking a bit about his life before his arrest when Gilyard had a wife, Mercedes cars and a Rolex watch, Morgan shows him photos of some of his victims, just as the police did when he was arrested in 2004 (we see clips of the old police interviews). And just as he did then, Gilyard denies ever having seen them before. He feels bad about what happened to them, but it has nothing to do with him, he says. He is softly spoken, polite even, but he doesn’t like being associated with the term serial killer, and threatens to walk out if Morgan continues to use it. Gilyard has never spoken about his crimes before, the promotional blurb for the programme says. And he still hasn’t. Which makes you wonder what the point of it is. Morgan isn’t there to establish whether or not Gilyard is guilty: the court already did that, DNA evidence unequivocally convicting him. There doesn’t appear to be any suggestion of a miscarriage of justice; the only person saying Gilyard isn’t guilty is Gilyard. So perhaps we’ll get some kind of insight into the mind of a killer then, even if he’s not saying much himself. A colleague of Gilyard says he was helpful and good to work with. But a neighbour says she never trusted him. The detective who searched Gilyard’s house says it was extremely tidy, that he’s never seen a man’s house as neat as that. Morgan jumps on that one. “Incredibly tidy, clinical, precise, everything was organised, it was all very clean,” he says. “Does that tell you he was a man who liked to be completely in control?” “Yes, that’s exactly what that indicated,” the detective agrees. “And when you look at the precision with which he carried out these murders,” Morgan goes on, “and the way he left these poor women, again it was all very orderly, it was very carefully executed.” What? So, don’t trust a man with a tidy sock drawer, is that what we’re saying? He may be a serial killer. But also don’t rule out the nice guy at work … It’s not exactly Cracker, is it? Back in jail, and Morgan is pushing Gilyard on his views on women, which are disturbing. He hasn’t paid for sex, he says, but suggests that if a man takes a woman out to dinner or buys her a drink, he is essentially paying for sex because that is where he hopes it will lead. He says he didn’t have sex with any of the women he was convicted of killing, most of whom were sex workers, and can’t explain how his semen was found on their bodies, except that he was framed by the police. Perhaps his unsavoury views do say something about the man. But they’re also not surprising for someone who killed 13 women and was a suspect in five previous rape cases. So why, if the programme’s not providing a window on to his psyche, is he being given the opportunity to air them? “I’m trying to work out the truth here,” Morgan tells him. The truth, which was already worked out in court, and about which there seems to be little doubt. It’s not as if Gilyard is notorious in this country, or that an interview with him quenches any kind of public thirst. So what does that leave? Gawping, that’s what. Gawping at a serial killer. And an opportunity for Morgan to show what a tough guy he is, going into the ring with the killer, gloves off, and winning (Gilyard does eventually walk out). The punches might have been softer in the Trump bout, sometimes more like slaps on the back, but a lot more came out of that one. It was also more valid."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2018/mar/09/amazon-freephone-premium-rate-0843-customer-service","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T07:00:31Z","webTitle":"Amazon customers charged 62p a minute for calls to premium-rate number","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/mar/09/amazon-freephone-premium-rate-0843-customer-service","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/mar/09/amazon-freephone-premium-rate-0843-customer-service","fields":{"headline":"Amazon customers charged 62p a minute for calls to premium-rate number","bodyText":"Regarding your story about a customer who ran up a large phone bill by inadvertently calling Amazon on a premium-rate forwarding number, it is interesting to find Amazon itself giving such a number on its official Twitter account.

Following increasing unease from technology insiders and development experts that young and old alike are becoming increasingly addicted to smartphones, social media and the constant need for messaging, Samsung’s head of mobile in the UK says that something needs to change to stop the constant heads-down relationship we have with our devices. “Ultimately what we want to try and do is create more of a heads-up lifestyle,” Conor Pierce, Samsung’s vice president of mobile and IT in the UK and Ireland, told the Guardian at the launch of the company’s new Galaxy S9 smartphone. “Let’s not spend our life looking at these devices. You look around and everyone is doing it, leaning over [their] phones. Let’s make the device be the slave and we’ll be the master - let’s turn the roles completely on their head.” Samsung is currently locked in a duopoly with rival Apple for dominance of the smartphone market. But as the number of people who already have a smartphone reaches saturation point in developed nations such as the UK and US, and global smartphone sales start to plateau, the nature of what success looks like and what is needed to achieve it changes. “Samsung has the opportunity to reshape the market in the UK, rather than just to keep driving more and more volume, because in a saturated market that’s just not sustainable,” said Pierce. Instead, the Korean electronics firm intends to leverage its vast portfolio of devices, from fridges to cookers, vacuums and TVs, as well as its SmartThings Internet of Things platform, to shift the game towards a more intelligent, connected future that frees us from phone obsession. “When your smartphone becomes your remote control or your concierge, knowing where you are, what you want when you walk up to your house, for instance, you can create a very different world,” said Pierce. He envisions phones doing much more on their own, such as turning on the lights, setting the heating and messaging your loved ones to say you’ve arrived home safe as you step in the door, turning from an attention-seeking device to one that frees us from needing to manually command things. Google has a similar idea, allowing your phone to increasingly respond automatically to messages, for instance. “It will enable people to revert to what we should be doing: being eyes-wide-open looking around at the world, rather than having this constant view just into the palm of your hand,” said Pierce. Currently, 76% of Samsung’s portfolio can be interconnected, with the goal of all Samsung products being connected by 2020, and two-thirds of UK households, 27m, have at least one Samsung device. But Pierce is aware that the Internet of Things is currently a disconnected mess of uncooperative devices and brands, wrapped in worries of privacy invasion. “What I’m really looking forward to is making sure that not only customers have the best mobile experience, but also the best connectivity experience,” said Pierce. “Through our SmartThings open alliance, we’re bringing a ubiquitous, convenient experience in which users can control their privacy, as they need to be able to do, regardless of brand, to make it all a really joyful, easy, trusted experience for real people.” Whether it will be possible to wean people off checking their constant barrage of messages and social media posts remains to be seen, but the shift towards a more automated, predictive experience is already underway. Last year was the start of artificial intelligence being baked into smartphones, and in 2018 the use of AI will only expand as smartphone manufacturers struggle to differentiate their devices.

The 160-page study says the UK government should offer redress to victims of a “fundamentally flawed policy”. The sum paid should be “an equal award to every applicant”, although no precise figure is stipulated. Most former child migrants have died, the report notes. “This means that in many cases [the government] has missed its opportunity to offer redress to those who were affected by its failure. However, around 2,000 child migrants are alive today and [the inquiry] considers it essential that all surviving former child migrants are offered such redress.” The IICSA urges the government to establish a compensation scheme without delay and says it “expects that payments should start being made within 12 months”. The inquiry says that it considers past, successive governments to have been “primarily responsible”. There were immediate apologies on Thursday from the National Catholic Safeguarding Commission and the Royal Overseas League, one of the charities criticised in the report. The ROL had never previously apologised. The child migration programme ran for about 25 years after the second world war. Children as young as five were sent from their families, care homes or foster homes in the UK without their parents to institutions or families overseas. They were dispatched mainly to Commonwealth states such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the British colony of Southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. About 4,000 were shipped out to Australia alone. Many of them endured regimes that the report says involved physical and emotional abuse, neglect and in some cases sexual abuse. Some later described periods of constant hunger and inadequate education. One former child migrant described his experiences as “more torture than abuse”, recounting how he was locked in a place known as “the dungeon” without water or food for days. In some places there were “persistent beatings of boys and girls”, the report says. “In a particularly awful incident,” the IICSA report adds, “we heard of the killing of a pet horse loved by the children which a group of 15 children were forced to watch as a form of collective punishment for an alleged wrongdoing.” There were no means of reporting abuse and children lived in fear of reprisal if they did so, according to the investigation. One child was told not to tell anyone he had been raped; another was told to “pray for his abuser”. One of the most devastating aspects of the scheme, IICSA says, was that children were lied to about their family background – even about whether their parents were dead or alive. Some of the organisations involved, such as the Fairbridge Society and Barnado’s, both sent out children from the UK and received them at their operations overseas. This is the first full report by IICSA, which was established in 2014 by the then home secretary, Theresa May. The child migration scheme was one of the first strands of the inquiry, which is looking at abuse committed within many other UK institutions. In 2010, the then prime minister, Gordon Brown, publicly apologised to former child migrants for their experiences. Consequently the report does not call on the government to make a further apology. It does note, however, that some institutions have still not apologised for their role in the programmes. “We recommend that they make such apologies,” the IICSA urges. One of the organisations that had not apologised nor provided any support or reparations, the report notes, was the Royal Overseas League, which promoted social and cultural links throughout the empire and subsequently the Commonwealth. It had argued that because it had not faced allegations of sexual abuse directly, there was no need to respond to such allegations. The IICSA report, however, states that the league “did not take sufficient care to protect its child migrants from the risk of sexual abuse”. After the report’s publication the ROL issued an apology. In a statement on its website it said: “The Royal Over-Seas League (ROSL) deeply regrets and apologises for its support of government initiatives from the 1920’s onwards relating to child migration and condemns unreservedly the abuse and ill treatment of children.” Meanwhile Bishop Marcus Stock, vice-chair of the National Catholic Safeguarding Commission, who gave evidence before the inquiry, apologised to all of those who were involved in the British government’s migration programmes as children. The IICSA’s chair, Prof Alexis Jay, said that the policy had continued despite evidence over many years that children were suffering and blamed “successive British governments”. She added: “We hope that this report offers acknowledgment to those who experienced abuse resulting from the child migration programmes.” A Department for Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The child migration policy was misguided and deeply flawed. Successive governments have accepted that the policy of child migration was wrong. The 2010 national apology has been reaffirmed in each subsequent year. Over £9m has been made available to former child migrants to help them be reunited with their families. “We will carefully consider the findings of the inquiry’s report and respond in due course.” Oliver Cosgrove, a core participant in the inquiry, said: “Whilst I welcome apologies and compensation which is way overdue, I deserve more; those who suffered sexual abuse deserve more. “It is not enough to acknowledge and apologise for what happened in the past – we need to learn from the obvious failures to ensure that no child suffers as I did. Because sexual abuse is still taking place in our society. This report does nothing to ensure that it stops. It has missed a golden opportunity to do so.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/01/grenfell-tower-site-to-be-turned-into-memorial","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T12:27:47Z","webTitle":"Grenfell Tower site to be turned into memorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/01/grenfell-tower-site-to-be-turned-into-memorial","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/01/grenfell-tower-site-to-be-turned-into-memorial","fields":{"headline":"Grenfell Tower site to be turned into memorial","bodyText":"The site of Grenfell Tower is likely be turned into a memorial to those who lost their lives in last year’s fire, after the council said it would put the community at the heart of decisions over its future and had no other plans for the site. A document outlining a set of written principles states: “The common assumption is that the consultation will lead towards agreement on a fitting memorial to remember those who lost their lives; and a request for Transport for London (TfL) for the renaming of Latimer Road underground station to commemorate Grenfell Tower which will require TfL’s processes to be followed in reaching a decision. “Kensington and Chelsea council, supported by the government, clearly state that they have no plans for the site and that the future of the site will be determined by the community.” Shahin Sadafi, the chair of the survivors’ group Grenfell United, said the future of the site had been a major source of anxiety for the bereaved, survivors and local community. “We are pleased that eight months on from the fire we finally have agreement that the bereaved, survivors and community will be at the heart of deciding the legacy of the site,” he said. “We hope working together to create a fitting memorial will be part of a healing process for everyone affected. “The government and Kensington and Chelsea council have treated this issue with dignity and respect. We can only hope the government applies the same seriousness to our need for truth and justice at the inquiry, this includes listening to our requests for changes to ensure a thorough inquiry. “Our door will always be open for genuine cooperation on substantive issues.” Sajid Javid, the secretary of state for housing, said he was pleased the government and council had confirmed there were no existing plans for the site, as it was fundamental to rebuilding the community’s trust. “This public commitment is a demonstration of us being true to that word and I am pleased we have been able to agree a way forward,” he said. Last week, Downing Street defended the prime minister after comments from Stormzy at the 2018 Brit awards. The south London MC attacked Theresa May for her response to the fire. The prime minister’s spokesman said the government had committed millions of pounds to the community in the aftermath of the blaze at the west London tower block in June 2017. The tower will be demolished after forensic teams finish their work, which is unlikely to happen before the end of 2018. In October, work began to cover the tower in white sheeting to shield it from public view. Alan Everett, the vicar of nearby St Clement’s church, told the Guardian at the end of last year that the psychological damage of seeing the tower was extreme. “Residents have the daily trauma of seeing the tower standing in their midst,” he said. “It’s the first thing some people see when pulling up their kitchen blind in the morning; children are walking past it every day on their way to school. It will be a massive relief when it comes down, and then we can take time to decide what to do with the site.” The death toll from the fire rose to 72 this week, after Maria del Pilar Burton, a 74-year-old who was rescued from the 19th floor of the tower, died in hospital."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2018/mar/02/my-students-support-our-strike-they-dont-want-to-be-passive-consumers","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T07:30:01Z","webTitle":"My students support our strike – they don't want to be passive consumers | Academics anonymous","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/mar/02/my-students-support-our-strike-they-dont-want-to-be-passive-consumers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2018/mar/02/my-students-support-our-strike-they-dont-want-to-be-passive-consumers","fields":{"headline":"My students support our strike – they don't want to be passive consumers","bodyText":"Students are turning up on picket lines, writing to their vice-chancellors, posting on social media and telling their lecturers that they support the pension strike. Their encouraging, surprising reaction should make universities reconsider their wider view of students as passive consumers. In my view, the stubborn position of Universities UK on pensions is based on the assumption that students don’t care about their lecturers’ pensions as the issue does not directly affect them. They are counting on students seeing themselves solely as customers and their lecturers solely as service providers. But what UUK didn’t plan for was solidarity. And solidarity is what we are witnessing as students understand that the people who teach them need decent conditions, and that the same forces that charge them fees cut our pensions. In the run-up to the strike, I was explaining why I wouldn’t be able to deliver the week’s lectures, framing things with shamefaced caution, expecting a certain degree of justified mutiny. But while students are disappointed at the loss of classes, they have also been saying to me, quietly in office hours, that they think the pension proposals are unacceptable and that they support our fight. One student, who I’d never seen as particularly political, ended a recent meeting with me by saying she thought the proposals were wrong and that she’d signed a petition. They are exercising the very skill we’re here to teach them: the ability to think critically. This reaction is a teachable moment for us as educators: it speaks to how we think about student agency. The marketisation of universities is based on the assumption that if we treat students as consumers, they will act like consumers, that they will choose one degree over another based on perceived value for money. At open days and in brochures, it is easier to see gyms and touch screens than promises that your lecturer will give you feedback, that there are enough copies of texts in the library, or that classes will be small. Rather than giving students this value that reveals itself over time, we end up giving them the first impression we think they want. After all, what students want at the moment of choosing a degree might be different from what they want once they’ve finished. Indeed, it should be different if we’re doing our jobs properly. Big, shiny building projects offer physical manifestations of what students are perceived to want. We think that students want leisure – in the form of sensible things like sports complexes but also things like outdoor movie screens, permanent access to ping pong and giant chess sets. Many of these now sit rained on and unused. This shows the gap between what we think students want and what students actually want if you ask them. Students tell me that they find these projects gauche, too. They quickly noticed that one recent installation looked embarrassingly like the Holocaust memorial in Berlin. Similarly, a hill that offered simple pleasures like sitting on the grass was recently, expensively transformed into steps and spot-lit fountains, with a big screen at one end and a pagoda at the other. I had thought that it was the landscaping equivalent of over-processed food. But in the days after the fountains were installed, two students, unbidden, brought up the fountains to me, framing them as part of the waste of money that’s occurring in an era of high fees and vice-chancellor salaries. It turns out that what students want is for their timetabling to work, their essays to be marked on time and their classes kept a reasonable size. They will notice if we give them the usual neoliberal treatment where the services you need are eroded but you are given a nice place to sit. Their reaction to the current strike maps onto their reaction to the broader marketised university system and the way it constructs, rather than reflects, their needs. We should be heartened by their ability to see that staff and students are in the same boat. Many students may seek the path of least resistance to a 2:2 classification and treat the university with little more than weariness. But we do students as a whole a disservice by playing to this minority. In the classroom, we still give them rigorous expectations: we give them a chance to show up for themselves. And on the picket lines too, they’ve showed up. As political actors rather than passive consumers, they’ll continue to show up – if we let them.

Yet little more than a year later, it appears that an unlikely assemblage of housewives, students, ex-teachers, truck drivers and others has brought Ireland to the brink of radical change to its abortion laws. They met as a Citizens’ Assembly at the end of 2016, a mix of pro-lifers, pro-choicers and undecideds whose views broadly reflected opinions in the wider Irish population. In all, it took five weekends. But at the end of it, they voted for change. In doing so, they did not just pave the way for an abortion referendum in May, details of which were announced today. They showed the world what democrats can do with a little imagination. In a world in which democracy desperately needs revitalisation and new ideas, innovators point to Ireland. They see the move to randomly select a jury to thrash out the issue before a public vote as a breakthrough moment. “Many people were concerned this would be a can-kicking exercise; that proved not to be the case,” says Colm O’Gorman, the executive director of Amnesty International Ireland. A referendum was scarcely imaginable when the idea of an assembly was first mooted in 2016. Back then, few politicians dared even raise the subject of a public vote, let alone voice support for abortion rights. To do so risked electoral oblivion, or so the conventional logic went. As a result, Irish women faced the perpetuation of some of Europe’s most restrictive abortion laws, under which at least 170,000 women travelled abroad for abortions in the years since 1980, mainly to England and often in secret. The citizens’ assembly helped break the deadlock. “I think this issue, in Ireland, could never have gotten to the point we’re at today, were it not for the citizens’ assembly,” says Fine Gael’s deputy, Kate O’Connell. “I think we would have been years getting there, if we ever got there.” During five weekends of meetings over five months, much of it broadcast live on the internet, the jury of 99 citizens broke open taboos around sex and women’s reproductive health. Passionate speeches in favour of and against liberalising abortion laws were heard, including from medical, legal and ethical experts. They also witnessed audio testimonies by women who had faced crisis pregnancies. O’Connell has her own story of a crisis pregnancy. She faced the prospect of having to abort her 20-week foetus due to a potentially fatal abnormality, an illegal act in Ireland. After tests, and consulting with medics among friends and family, the pharmacist carried her pregnancy to term. Her child, a now healthy boy, will turn eight in September. Many Irish women would have struggled to find the advice she got. “There is huge value in people telling their stories,” O’Connell says despite the sometimes brutal responses she and others have endured by going public. A majority of assembly members ultimately recommended amending the Irish constitution to allow lawmakers to address the issue of abortion access. Almost two-thirds also recommended legalising abortion without restriction up to certain gestation limits. An all-party parliamentary committee charged with considering the work of the citizens’ assembly subsequently recommended legal abortion without restriction up to 12 weeks of pregnancy. Proponents of citizens’ assemblies highlight their use of random selection to create representative samples of any given society. That contrasts with narrower, more elite gatherings of elected representatives. Supporters also vaunt the deliberative process that is cultivated, with members responding to what is presented and listening to others’ responses. That diversity of views, so often missing in elected parliaments, helps deepen collective understanding. Participants feel less pressure as there are no elections, and this in turn improves the quality of their decisions. In Ireland’s case, voters can access all the assembly submissions and recommendations before casting their ballots next May. Assembly participants certainly seem delighted to have taken part. Of more than half a dozen consulted, chosen from those who agreed to speak to the media, all were hugely positive. “I’m almost sad it’s coming to an end. It’s been a life-changing experience for me,” said Liz Connell Jones, 63, a retired teacher and mother-of-two from Wexford, southeast Ireland. She doubted she would have ever considered abortion herself but was pleased the assembly recommended reform. “I look back to my mother’s generation, my mother had 11 children, she never had a choice. She didn’t want to have 11 children, she even said it wasn’t right that women had to have children as they did.” While Ireland prepares for its referendum, and likely a rancorous campaign, others look to what is already won. For Oliver Escobar, a lecturer in public policy at Edinburgh University and the co-director of What Works Scotland, Ireland’s effort was singular and significant. “It’s quite a milestone in the field of democratic innovations.

To salvage his own career, the talkshow host desperately needed to get Tricky Dicky to admit his guilt and apologise to the American people for the Watergate scandal. Why revive it now? Fake news, spin and the Robert Mueller inquiry into White House connections with the Russians all loom over Kate Hewitt’s beautifully choreographed production. It turns the huge Crucible stage into both a TV studio and the gladiatorial arena in which David takes on an already toppled Goliath. Both are fighting for their professional lives. Is Frost capable of delivering the knockout blow? The pleasure of Morgan’s piece, not the greatest play but always a ferociously entertaining one, is that it milks the drama as it pits two flawed men, both seeking rehabilitation, against each other. Jonathan Hyde is magnificent as the tarnished president, his features a defensive cliff that crumbles in a flood of tragic self-knowledge. Daniel Rigby’s Frost is no less fascinating, a man who is such a self-invention he conducts his entire life as if spinning plates in the air. The play – which knowingly melds fact and fiction – is a slippery interrogation of accountability and truth and the way that our perceptions are influenced by media images. Andrzej Goulding’s video design repeatedly demonstrates what Nixon so prophetically observes: “Television and the closeup create their own set of meanings.” • At Sheffield Crucible until 17 March.

This was Soccer AM at its best, unlikely heir to the junior anarchy of Tiswas and Going Live!, flying the flag for Great British silliness long after former host Tim Lovejoy had defected to the beige tide of cook’n’chat shows. From its inception in the mid-90s, Soccer AM understood that professional footballers are mostly tedious creatures and it would be wise to develop an independent comedy framework on which to hang that week’s soccer chat. With several hours to fill each Saturday, elaborate running gags were allowed to flourish. Apart from the emergence of hulking former Hull City striker Dean Windass as an excellent comic foil, it got to a point where there wasn’t much football on the show, which was precisely the appeal to all those jaded by wall-to-wall analysis, but evidently a concern for the Sky Sports bosses, gatekeepers of the priceless Premier League product. Soccer AM had become too irreverent. And as we all know, football isn’t a matter of life and death; it’s much more expensive than that. And so, at the beginning of the last season, the daftness was dialled right down to bring it in line with the rest of the network’s blaring, nuance-free football coverage. The vibe was transformed from “hungover flatshare” to “hi-tech gym”. Giggly presenter Max Rushden was replaced by John “Fenners” Fendley, who conducted earnest chats with lad bands perched on fake flight cases. Loose-cannon interviewer Tubes stopped ripping his shirt open at film junkets in favour of ingratiating fist-bumps with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Even the car-park challenge, where teams of tubby supporters squeezed into replica kits tried to kick balls through a hole, was tediously professionalised with the introduction of a proper goal and goalkeeper. The old show may have been juvenile and occasionally boorish – as recently as 2015, a “Soccerette” was still being paraded around the studio in skimpy shorts – but for the most part its goofy larks helped undercut the win-at-all-costs macho posturing that still permeates football culture. Now, with its emphasis on skills challenges and “Sunday league hacks”, Soccer AM is in danger of taking itself far too seriously. The last straw was when long-serving Helen Chamberlain left last year to be replaced by more blokes. We are now staring at a wall of charcoal Superdry knits. With no one around to puncture male egos, the banter has taken on a desperate quality. With its running time slashed, Soccer AM can’t be long for this world, probably to be replaced by something more closely reflecting the rest of Sky’s football coverage while falling in step with the contemporary blandness of Saturday morning TV.

Burberry is best known for its classic trenchcoats. Riccardo Tisci made shark teeth and nose ring motifs at Givenchy, the label which he designed for 12 years until January 2017. At Givenchy, Tisci took a Parisian house best known for its links with Audrey Hepburn and put smoking, burnt-out wrecks of cars on the catwalk, Kardashians in the front row, and emeralds dangling from the septums of models. Burberry champions British traditions, and dressed a smiling Duchess of Cambridge for last year’s Vogue cover. Tisci is known for darkly subversive, unapologetically sexual, deeply urban, boundary-pushing fashion and talked Kanye West into wearing a black leather kilt during his 2011 Watch the Thrones tour. What links Riccardo Tisci to Burberry is its CEO Marco Gobbetti. It was Gobbetti who appointed Tisci, then a relatively unknown 30-year-old designer showing an own-name collection at Milan fashion week, to Givenchy in 2005. The appointment suggests that Gobbetti, who joined Burberry from Celine last summer, will not be relying on a light touch in his turnaround plan for the company, which grew from a heritage brand into a fashion powerhouse during Bailey’s tenure but has struggled in recent years as the luxury market enters a slowdown phase. The announcement indicates Gobbetti intends a root and branch overhaul of Burberry’s brand image. He has an impressive track record: after the re-energisation of Givenchy alongside Tisci, he moved to Celine, where he masterminded the transformation of that brand into a profitable and agenda-setting star of Paris fashion week. Gobbetti has already jangled shareholder nerves at Burberry by indicating that he intends to reposition the brand to be more upmarket. “By reenergising our product and customer experience to establish our position firmly in luxury, we will play in the most rewarding, enduring section of the market,” he said in a statement. The appointment of Tisci to a role where many were expecting a British appointment is a bold move, but analysts cannot fail to be impressed by Tisci and Gobbetti’s joint history of commercial success at Givenchy, where stores did a brisk business in crisp modern tailoring and sleek black leather handbags during their tenure. Tisci will bring a mass audience, and a youthful following, to Burberry. He was the designer of Kim Kardashian’s wedding dress for her marriage to Kanye West, of the leather hot pants and thigh-high boots worn by Rihanna on her Diamonds world tour in 2013, and of Beyonce’s latex gown at the 2016 Met Gala. He will be based in London, where he last lived during the 1990s as a student at Central St Martins. Tisci has been ahead of the curve in almost all of the most important ways fashion has shifted over the last decade. He has a longstanding love of streetwear. He pioneered the sweatshirt as a statement fashion piece during his tenure at Givenchy, and is a respected designer of trainers, partnering with Nike for a long-running collaboration. When Tisci began putting the Givenchy slogan onto sweatshirts, critics sniped that it was moving a storied brand downmarket, but now that streetwear brands are power players – the New York based skatewear label Supreme was recently valued at $1bn – the alignment looks impressively prescient. One standout line from Burberry’s announcement notes that Tisci’s “skill in blending streetwear with high fashion is highly relevant to today’s luxury consumer”. His spring/summer 2013 collection was one of many Givenchy shows which experimented with religious imagery, a theme which has stayed in the fashion consciousness since. In two months’ time, Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination will open at the Metropolitan Museum in New York. Androgyny and gender fluidity are also recurring themes in Tisci’s collections, and he has championed the career of Lea T, who became the first transgender model to land a major beauty contract when she signed for Redken in 2014. Tisci employed Lea as an assistant and fit model, and cast her in a Givenchy advertising campaign in 2010. In the year since Tisci left Givenchy, rumour had persistently linked him with Versace. His close friendship with Donatella, and the fierce, unapologetically sexual aesthetic which he shares with her, led many to believe he was being lined up as her successor."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/01/five-ways-smartphones-not-ruined-social-lives","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T13:14:00Z","webTitle":"A distraction?

Far from it – your smartphone is your best friend\r\n","bodyText":"Whether you’re someone who keeps yours on the table during dinners with friends, or one who gets offended at new-message-checking between courses, there’s no denying that mobile phones cause problems. Tools of distraction and distancing that chip away at our attention spans with every vibration and ping, they steadily steal the real connection of person-to-person communication. At least, so say older relatives who comment on your WhatsApp use during family gatherings. And so say the psychologists who worked on the University of British Columbia’s study titled “Smartphone use undermines enjoyment of face-to-face social interactions” academic study. More precise and evidence-based than a parent’s “put your phone away, you’re always messing with it”, the smartphone study ends with some equally disapproving points. “When phones were present … participants felt more distracted, [reducing] how much they enjoyed spending time with their friends/family,” it reads. “Despite their ability to connect us to others across the globe, phones may undermine the benefits we derive from interacting with those across the table.” Which is fair, sure. If you have had a phone slapped out of your hand, you know this. But, similar to how you’d enjoy a Wispa just fine if you didn’t know Wispa Gold also existed, social lives are just a little sweeter with mobile phones. Because who would want to go back to social lives without them, when: They prevent petty disagreements turning into petty violence The bud you’ve met up with can’t remember the name of the film they’re talking about – you can. IMDb will prove you’re right, and stop the growing suspicion that your best friend doesn’t trust you (because if they don’t believe you know the plot to Tango &amp; Cash when you hear it, what happens if it’s something less important?). With a smartphone in easy reach, there’s no need to pin your friend’s hand to the table with a steak knife while you go searching for proof that you’re right and they’re wrong. You know where your friends are at all times Maybe you’ve got one person in your friendship group who is late to every meetup you organise – but how do you know they are definitely just late again, and haven’t been swallowed up by one of those sinkholes you heard about on the Discovery Channel? A quick text message: no sinkhole, they’re just a disrespectful prick who still doesn’t understand the etiquette of arriving on time. A quick Google: sinkholes happen sometimes, but disrespectful pricks are more common. You can find better friends Not everyone collects close pals as they go through school, college, university, various retail jobs, offices – we certainly don’t make many friends by striking up random conversations with strangers in day-to-day life anymore. Too many weirdos out there. It’s much more acceptable to talk to random strangers online instead, and easier to find people into the same things as us, no matter how niche. Talking to the person who sat next to you on the train about your secret love of Transformers erotic fan fiction, for example, might not go over well. Finding a website where you can share your interest with fellow fans across the globe: better. They will provide inspiration when conversation runs dry Without the safety net of a smartphone with access to misguided political tweets from people you went to school with, you’d be forced to drum up some decent conversation around the dinner table yourself. From your own mind. Maybe this would lead to you becoming a more skilled conversationalist. Or you would panic and blurt out something inappropriate about the Transformers fan fiction you’re currently working on. Isn’t it more prudent to laugh at others together over a phone screen than ruin a social event because you ran out of things to say? They’re a barrier Let’s face it, most people are quite irritating after too much direct exposure. What’s not irritating and won’t let you down? The truest friend to all: the smartphone. That is, until the battery runs out and you’re forced to interact face-to-face with the people around you again. • Phoebe-Jane Boyd is a freelance journalist who writes on politics and pop culture"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/01/i-hope-corbyn-will-try-to-match-john-major-your-best-comments-today","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T15:28:05Z","webTitle":"'I hope Corbyn will try to match John Major': your best comments today","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/01/i-hope-corbyn-will-try-to-match-john-major-your-best-comments-today","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/01/i-hope-corbyn-will-try-to-match-john-major-your-best-comments-today","fields":{"headline":"'I hope Corbyn will try to match John Major': your best comments today","bodyText":"Former British prime ministers have been speaking out on Brexit, much to the interest of our commenters. First up was John Major, with his call for a Commons vote on a second referendum. The former PM did not mince his works, describing his own Conservative party’s approach as “a folly” and “bad politics”. Then Tony Blair joined his predecessor in doubting the realism of Theresa May’s plans, ahead of her own keynote Brexit speech on Friday. Former PMs take on Brexit John Major’s speech yesterday was what Jeremy Corbyn should have been saying for the past 12-18 months. Major’s anger, passion and attitude of “not standing for this anymore” were remarkable, and I never thought that I’d favourably compare a former Tory PM, least of all John Major, to a Labour leader. I now hope that Corbyn has watched the speech, and understands that we must at least try to oppose a devastating Tory Brexit. YorkerBouncer Good grief, I never thought I would be agreeing with both Blair and Major. I am going to lie down in a darkened room. zitan Cuts to children’s centres mean lifelines are disappearing. Since 2010, more than 500 children’s centres have closed as local authorities struggle with eight years of austerity. Readers talked about the impact of childrens’ centres on their own lives. Children’s centres are not just there for disadvantaged families or ‘feckless’ parents. My children’s centre supports me with my mental health, including providing me with a family worker who comes to my home twice a month as well as weekly Revive sessions. These are small groups of mothers with mental health issues where a nursery nurse plays with our children and we do something creative or get support through meditation, mindfulness and talking. It is absolutely a life-saver, some of the women in my group have attempted suicide before and the support given to us by the children’s centre staff is invaluable.

I work at a mix of client sites and at home, where I run a new MacBook Pro and Synology NAS. I would like to set up a small home office. I’ll need basic items like a monitor, keyboard, mouse and printer, but floor space is limited, so any creative desk solutions would also be appreciated. Gareth I’ve set up home offices in four different houses now, so I’m familiar with the problems. However, I’ve not used any of the desks that are currently available, so my advice will have to be somewhat general. Readers who have bought desks recently may be able to offer more specific recommendations. Either way, I know that you should start with a retractable, lockable tape measure, or similar device. Examples include the Stanley STA030696 and the Rolson 50565. Pretty much everything depends on measurements, and guesswork usually comes out wrong. It’s certainly possible to work with a laptop on a kitchen table or an old-fashioned writing desk and pretend you have a “home office”. This is the sort of nonsense that you usually see in lifestyle magazines and on websites like Pinterest. The problem is that it’s hazardous to your health. Bad workstation ergonomics put you at long term risk of physical strains and injuries that, in my experience, need expensive physiotherapy to alleviate. It’s far better to set up a home office that will both make you more productive and help you to stay healthy. Of course, there are areas where not everyone agrees on the best approach. Still, try to get as close to the ideal posture as possible, while being prepared to vary things later as necessary. Keyboard trays To get the right posture, your feet should be flat on the floor, with your thighs and arms parallel to the floor, at something close to a 90-degree angle. (Some people prefer a very slight downward angle.) The tops of the keys should be at elbow height. Measurements will tell you how far above the floor your keyboard and the seat of your chair need to be. You may well find that the top of your keyboard needs to be 60cm or 65cm high, while a typical desk height might be 75cm. For decades, the industry answer to this problem has been the keyboard tray. Keyboard trays are usually retractable and slide in and out from under the surface of the desk. You can buy mounts to fit trays to most ordinary desks and tables. The best keyboard trays may allow for variable height and positioning, and sometimes a backward keyboard tilt. Examples include the Kensington Modular Keyboard Platform with SmartFit (K60718US) and the KT1 and KT2 Ergonomic trays. Some DIY skills required. If the keyboard is too high, you will have to raise the chair seat – an essential feature even in cheap office chairs – and add a foot rest to raise your feet. Watch out for narrow keyboard trays as you will need enough space to move a mouse around. I haven’t found this a problem with compact keyboards, but a full keyboard with a numeric keypad could cramp your mouse space. If you move the keyboard to the left to compensate, you must also move your chair and your screen to the left as well. Screen choice The other key measurement is the height of your eyes when you are sitting in an upright, typing position. This fixes the height of the screen. The top of the LCD screen (not the bezel) should be roughly level with your eyebrows. This may feel slightly uncomfortable at first, but it will discourage the slumping that leads to hunched over laptop syndrome (Hols). This shouldn’t be a problem if the screen height is adjustable. If not, the traditional solution is to stick a couple of books under the stand. When it comes to picking a monitor, you face a difficult choice of screen resolution. The industry has moved to 16:9 panels, so the standard for high-resolution screens is 2560 x 1440 pixels. If your MacBook Pro’s resolution is 2560 x 1600 (16:10) then you would have to pay silly money to match it. I’d go for a 24in Dell S2417DG or 27in Dell S2718D – both Quad HD, and also available from PC World – rather than, say, a 30in Dell U3014. If you are happy to drop to a 1080p screen, the 24in Dell U2417HG is a bargain at £129.95. But shop around. Asus, Samsung and AOC are among the companies that provide good monitors at reasonable prices, and the 24in Asus VS248HR is well worth a look at £119.97. Keyboard types Laptop keyboards are not ergonomic because you have to twist your wrists to align your fingers to the keys. Using a separate keyboard allows you to choose an ergonomic version: either a one-piece “comfort” model or a properly split keyboard. Using a Mac restricts your choice of ergonomic keyboards, and even when they work, they may have limited functionality. However, the Microsoft Natural 4000 is a cheap, conservative option that is easy to adopt. The Sculpt is a better keyboard, slightly more of a challenge, and can be configured for the Mac using Karabiner Elements. Your options for split keyboards include the Black Goldtouch V2 and Matias’s USA Ergo Pro Low Force Mac. I use a Kinesis Freestyle 2, but you may have trouble getting a Mac version in the UK. You can start with the two keyboard halves as close together as you like, and increase the separation gradually as your typing adapts. Keyboard tray desks There is a vast selection of desks and keyboard tray desks on Amazon and at suppliers such as Wayfair.co.uk, which is an American company I’d never heard of. (They turned up in my searches. Their product range is wide but their service may be variable.) Most people can probably manage with a simple trolley. These take up little space, and castors make them easy to move (handy if you need to fiddle with wires round the back). However, you need space for two screens – assuming you use the MacBook Pro as a second screen – and a printer. If you have the space, an L-shaped corner desk might suit you best. The Songmics looks like a good choice, though HLC offers a cheaper option. Of course, if you fancy a sitting/standing riser like the Songmics or 1home models, a simple (but not a high) table will do. These devices sit on top of a desk or table, so the keyboard may be too high for use when sitting down. If so, you will need to raise your chair, again, and perhaps add a foot rest. Clearly, Amazon has a plethora of choice. Happily, you can filter your search results by material, so you may want to choose wood, metal, glass or whatever, to suit the rest of your furniture. You can also filter by supplier, in which case Songmics, Piranha Trading and SixBros have plenty of options. Quick exits Your home office setup will involve plugging various things into your MacBook Pro, and unplugging them when you want to take it somewhere. The obvious solution is to buy a Thunderbolt docking station. Plug everything into the dock and you will only have to remove one Thunderbolt cable when you need to make a quick exit. Docking stations provide a mixture of DisplayPort, HDMI, Ethernet and headphone connections. Most also have several USB ports that you can use for external hard drives as well as for mice, keyboards and printers. It’s an extra cost, but you will appreciate the convenience.

With hundreds of drivers stranded in their cars for up to 13 hours in Scotland, forecasters extended a red alert to parts of Wales, including Cardiff, and south-west England on Thursday morning, warning of the dangers the wind and snow could pose. A red alert for snow had already been in place in central Scotland. And the National Grid warned that the UK would not have enough gas to meet demand on Thursday. In Lincolnshire, police asked the Ministry of Defence to send help as the county continued to be hit hard. A critical incident was declared after reports of dozens of traffic incidents. “At about lunchtime yesterday, we realised we were overrun with requests from the 82 volunteers that we had out. And, at that point, we made the request to central government for military assistance,” said Lincolnshire’s deputy chief constable, Craig Naylor. He told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “Thankfully, our military as usual have come to our aid. So we have military officers and troops on the ground with four-wheel-drive vehicles assisting our volunteers again today.” Naylor said military personnel were helping those who were housebound or who needed medical assistance. The MoD said: “The RAF is assisting in helping to transport health staff to hospitals and support health workers in visiting vulnerable people in the community in Lincolnshire following heavy snowfall.” A red alert of snow – the most severe – was issued across central Scotland on Wednesday and was due to remain in effect on Thursday. Overnight, drivers were stranded on the M80 after traffic came to a standstill on Wednesday afternoon. Police said an estimated 1,000 vehicles were stranded, with tailbacks of approximately eight miles (13km) both northbound and southbound. Some motorists spent the night in their cars, while others abandoned their vehicles. Emergency responders and volunteer agencies including mountain rescue teams checked on stranded drivers. Graeme Murray left Aberdeen at 2.45pm on Wednesday. Speaking at about 10pm, he said: “Everything was going well until just after Gleneagles, then we hit the traffic jam at 5.05pm and have been here ever since. “We have no idea what’s happening, we’re just getting messages from home. I think we’re going to get ready to spend the night here.” Police were advising people not to travel on Thursday, except emergency workers. Supt Helen Harrison of Police Scotland said: “We are now 24 hours into the red- and amber-related advice not to travel on the roads and rush hour last night was noticeably less busy thanks to people heeding our message. It remains the same this rush hour coming: do not travel.” Other major routes also faced disruption, with reports of minor accidents on some roads. Hundreds of Scottish schools were closed for a second day on Thursday. Flights were also grounded, with Glasgow airport announcing it would be closed until 3pm on Thursday. The extreme weather also saw NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde cancel all non-essential operations and outpatient appointments on Thursday. Virgin Trains closed all its routes to and from Scotland for the day, while ScotRail halted all operations in the affected red area until late morning.

Davis doesn’t use the drone to spot prey, which he believes would give him an unfair advantage. Instead, he uses it to analyze ice conditions – blue ice is considered stronger than white ice. Because the climate, and ice formation, is ever more variable, Davis hoped the drone would help “set a course for everybody” when they went out seal-hunting in the springtime. With a population of about 600 on a barrier island at the state’s extreme western tip, Shishmaref’s days are numbered. Rapid erosion is eating away at its beaches, and for years the community has appealed for federal funds to move to a new location. But in the meantime, residents still need to eat and pay bills. So hunters like Davis, contending with unstable environmental conditions, are having to find new ways to survive. Climatic shifts are ever more apparent to Alaskans who depend on the land and sea for nourishment, from indigenous subsistence hunters to weekend warriors. Moose are extending their range. But they also face a looming threat from ticks encroaching on warming northern latitudes. The timing of migrations among everything from bowhead whales to caribou are shifting, becoming less dependable. More ominously, unusual mortality events among birds and marine mammals are becoming more common in the region. Last year, 39 dead walruses washed ashore in the Bering Strait region. Four tested positive for biotoxins from algae blooms, a new presence in Arctic waters. Such issues come into sharp focus in Shishmaref, which embodies the extreme dichotomies in rural Alaska. It lacks basic infrastructure, such as plumbing for sewage and potable water, and is reachable only by small planes flown out of nearby hub communities. But there’s also an abundance of natural resources and the traditional knowledge of how to harvest them. Balmier weather has meant ice doesn’t get as thick and will disappear much faster in the spring. The conditions create a problem for hunting ice seals, walruses and bearded seals, which everyone in Shishmaref calls by their Inupiaq name, oogruk. “Going oogruk hunting or walrus hunting, you can go, like, 30, 40, 50 miles without seeing something,” Davis said of the last few years. It isn’t that there are fewer animals, but as they follow retreating sea ice, they are distributed further from the town – prompting hunters to travel greater distances searching for them. Last year Davis went almost all the way to Kotzebue, about a hundred miles away, looking for oogruk. On the way back, the weather took an unexpected turn, nearly costing the hunting party all their equipment when his boat became stuck in the ice and had to be abandoned. “The way we hunt oogruk or seal hasn’t changed. The conditions have,” said Percy Nayokpuk, 65, who runs a store in town and is Davis’s father-in-law. This season has seen the latest freeze-up of the ocean he can remember. Climate change is having other profound impacts. Traditionally, people in Shishmaref relied more heavily on marine mammals for food. In the last few decades, residents say more caribou are venturing closer to town, increasing the local harvest. Outside homes all around town, ruby-red haunches cure in the sun and tangled piles of antlers rest on roofs. The shifting distribution could be the result of a changing food supply on the tundra or fluctuations in herd size. But with fewer opportunities to hunt marine mammals, caribou is becoming a more dependable option. It’s a similar story with musk oxen, shaggy prehistoric goats that were wiped out of Alaska in the 1800s, reintroduced to the mainland just 50 years ago, and are now steadily working their way back into people’s diets. For some hunters, terrestrial animals like these are a relatively new opportunity to reliably put food away. Like most people in Shishmaref and indigenous communities across Alaska, hunting is no idle pursuit for Davis. Back at his cluttered three-bedroom home home on a chilly January evening, he fried up a house special: musk ox burgers. “I compare musk ox to wagyu beef, because it’s so marbled,” Davis said. All seven of his kids still live at home. By the time everyone is finished with dinner, eight pounds of musk ox meat is gone. Buying this much frozen ground beef at the store would have cost up to $70. That per-meal cost is out of reach for many in Alaska’s rural communities, where jobs and cash are scarce and everything costs several times as much as it would at a supermarket in the lower 48 – even water. A gallon is $11 at the store. Shishmaref is running out of time. Buildings are perched perilously close to the ocean’s edge. Millions of dollars have been spent on a seawall, but that’s a short-term solution, expected to fail in the coming years. More than a dozen buildings have been moved to the other side of town to keep from being swallowed by the sea. In 2016, residents voted 94 to 78 to relocate the village to a new site, but the federal dollars and coordination to handle the move are outstanding. Prospects for oogruk hunters seem unlikely to improve. A few weeks after Davis sent out his drone, scientists sounded the alarm about “crazy” temperature rises in the Arctic. In Shishmaref and the surrounding areas along western Alaska’s rugged coastline, stormy warm weather caused the ice to break apart and blow out to sea. For many in the region, it was the first time they heard an odd sound for February, when the solemnly silent sea ice approaches its thickest extent. It was the sound of breakers crashing on the shore."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2018/mar/29/advice-for-law-students-four-ways-to-make-legal-contacts","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T14:11:54Z","webTitle":"Advice for law students: four ways to make legal contacts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/mar/29/advice-for-law-students-four-ways-to-make-legal-contacts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2018/mar/29/advice-for-law-students-four-ways-to-make-legal-contacts","fields":{"headline":"Advice for law students: four ways to make legal contacts","bodyText":"Academic talent may boost your chances of getting into law – but frankly, it’s also who you know. Connections are perhaps even more essential for students who – like me – didn’t attend a prestigious school or university. Once I started attending networking events as a law trainee I began to see the benefits of building bridges in the industry. These people can assist, directly or indirectly, with getting your foot in the door. They may be able to share their first-hand experiences, or help with applications and work experience placements. Networking events are an opportunity for students, regardless of background, to get to know people in the profession. You just need to know where to look: The Junior Lawyers Division The Junior Lawyers Division (a branch of the Law Society) is a community that represents law students, trainee solicitors and junior lawyers in England and Wales. Its annual conference and ball is a great way for you to meet a mixture of senior and junior legal professionals. Aspiring lawyers can attend and start building connections immediately. There are local sub-groups that often run events and offer opportunities to socialise with junior lawyers who work and live in your local area. Membership is free for most people. Join a law diversity organisation There are several organisations that help deliver easier access into law – including Urban Lawyers, Aspiring Solicitors, Power Up, SEO London, and The Bright Network, to name a few. Each organisation may differ in whom they provide support for, but they each partner with law firms and host free events where you can meet lawyers face to face. “The first time I had an in-depth conversation with lawyers was when I attended a Bright Network event,” explains Abena Mensa-Bonsu, a recent law graduate. “From this, we have kept in contact and they have both become my mentors.” Twitter Do not underestimate social media as a tool for making contacts. Many diversity organisations use Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn to share upcoming events. Many law firms also share their upcoming networking events and open evenings on Twitter. For example, “Magic Circle” firm Clifford Chance and Silver Circle firm MacFarlanes have graduate Twitter accounts and regularly post details on upcoming events and advice for aspiring lawyers. Many legal professionals are on Twitter and are open to connecting with others interested in law. You could start by following these people and simply send a tweet to introduce yourself. “Law can be quite lonely when you have no connections, so I’m always open to assisting students who reach out to me on social media. I often share law events with my followers,” explains Dawn Chase, legal counsel at Berendsen. Once a rapport has been established online, you could suggest meeting up for a coffee. You’d be surprised at how many people are open to this. Sometimes all you have to do is ask. Friends of friends You may well know people who know legal professionals. Don’t be shy to ask your friends if they know anyone in law who would be willing to connect with you. Ramnish Sharma, who attended an ex-polytechnic university, says: “I knew a friend whose sister is a lawyer, so I asked if I could meet with her. The advice she gave me was invaluable.” Coleen Mensa is a trainee solicitor at EY and a vlogger"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/28/liam-fox-trade-deals-britain-brexit-single-market-customs-union","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T10:32:36Z","webTitle":"Liam Fox’s shiny new trade deals won’t compensate for hard Brexit | Sam Lowe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/28/liam-fox-trade-deals-britain-brexit-single-market-customs-union","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/28/liam-fox-trade-deals-britain-brexit-single-market-customs-union","fields":{"headline":"Liam Fox’s shiny new trade deals won’t compensate for hard Brexit","bodyText":"Liam Fox, the secretary of state for international trade, is right about one thing: a UK-EU customs union would leave the UK “in a worse position that it is now”. Economically speaking, compared to being a full EU member, a EU-UK customs union would leave us worse off. However, there is little evidence to back his assertion that it would leave us worse off than if we were to follow his plan, and free ourselves to trade with the world. Being in a customs union doesn’t, in and of itself, prevent the UK from running its own trade policy – it would constrain our ability to make concessions on goods tariffs, but we would still be free to negotiate in the areas of services, data, investment, procurement and intellectual property. Fox, who delivered a “road to Brexit” speech on Tuesday, worries it would tie our hands. Perhaps. Perhaps not. Regardless, the idea that future free trade agreements will compensate for the losses of Brexit is for the birds. It is an open secret – albeit one that’s under-acknowledged by trade policy professionals – that signing a free trade agreement does next to nothing for a country’s headline GDP. For reference, the flagship EU-Canada free trade agreement is only predicted to increase European GDP by 0.03% – a rounding error. Without harmonisation of rules, supranational regulatory architecture, and effective accountability mechanisms – such as those that exist within the EU – it is difficult for governments to do much more than lower some (often already low) tariffs. This is especially true of services trade, which is difficult to measure at a border, and can fell governments if something goes wrong (see the financial crisis, for example). How much access does any one country or bloc want to grant to a systemically risky sector it has no control over, no say in how it is governed, and no means of holding to account if something goes wrong? Answer: not much. What about qualifications? Is the public really happy for a doctor from another country to set up shop and operate on them with little guarantee that their qualifications are of an equivalent standard to those trained domestically? (Those criticising the EU on its approach to services also need to ask themselves why the EU is the only modern example of multi-country, comprehensive cross-border liberalisation in services trade.) Compounding matters, countries tend to trade more with partners that are near than ones that are far away. Distance matters, and the EU is right on our doorstep. The government’s own numbers undermine Fox’s bravado. In an economic analysis leaked to Buzzfeed, it’s estimated that post-Brexit trade deals with the US, China, India, Australia, the Gulf and the Asean bloc would add between 0.3 and 0.6% to GDP in the long run. Even if you assume all these deals are completed (an incredibly optimistic assumption) Brexit is still estimated to leave the UK 2-8% poorer than we would have been had we remained. As Sir Martin Donnelly – formerly the top civil servant in Fox’s department – told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: we risk giving up “a three-course meal … for the promise of a packet of crisps in the future”. The irony is that, rather putting Fox out of a job (as the joke goes), a UK-EU customs union would actually assist him when it comes to his most pressing concern: replacing the 50-plus trade agreements the UK is already party to by virtue of its EU membership. These include agreements with countries such as Turkey, Korea and Switzerland that UK companies already rely on. And as it stands, we can’t guarantee they will continue to apply throughout a transition period, never mind once we leave. While new shiny trophy free-trade agreements might spruce up his ministerial desk, they are good for little else. And a government acting in the rational, economic interests of the country would adjust its policy accordingly. • Sam Lowe is a trade expert at the Centre for European Reform"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/feb/28/uk-political-divide-openness-to-the-world-left-right-labour-conservatives-polling","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T09:07:53Z","webTitle":"New political divide in UK is over openness to the world, polling finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/28/uk-political-divide-openness-to-the-world-left-right-labour-conservatives-polling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/feb/28/uk-political-divide-openness-to-the-world-left-right-labour-conservatives-polling","fields":{"headline":"New political divide in UK is over openness to the world, polling finds","bodyText":"British politics is no longer as simple as left against right, according to research highlighted by senior Conservative and Labour strategists. Traditionally loyal voters have never been more prepared to cross party lines, said Andrew Cooper, David Cameron’s former director of strategy, and Spencer Livermore, a Labour adviser on four election campaigns, who described how shifting attitudes have created new divisions in the UK. “Open versus closed is becoming more and more significant,” said Lord Cooper, launching a report with polling that suggests it is easier to predict voting habits by how internationalist people are, whether they live in diverse communities, their feelings towards minorities and their age. “It means that lots of people who once were good bets to be Conservative now turn out to be Labour. And people that pollsters might have predicted would be Labour are now Tories,” he said. An analysis carried out by Cooper using the polling company Populus on behalf of the thinktank Global Future laid bare a stark divide between people aged 18 to 44 and those over 45, with a huge gap in attitudes to internationalism, multiculturalism and immigration. In comments that suggest the trend could be particularly worrying for Theresa May’s Conservatives, Cooper argued that there was no good reason to believe the “generation that has come of age in the last 25 years is going to change its worldview as it grows older”. Unlike previous shifts, where people have become more conservative in their 50s and 60s, he said the “open worldview is baked in, it is not a function of life stage”. Lord Livermore described the research as “by far the most compelling and rigorous explanation” for the 2017 general election result, when the age at which people shifted from Labour to Conservative rose from 34 to 47. “He shows where old alliances are breaking down and new electoral coalitions are beginning to be formed. He outlines how the real division in British politics now is not between left and right, so much as being open to the world or closed,” he said. “And he explains why there was such a significant swing to Labour, and away from the Conservatives, among voters under the age of 45. The axis of British politics is rotating and, as it does [so], it presents Labour with a huge opportunity.” Livermore argued that the route to government was through “progressive, inclusive politics”. Global Future supplemented the polling by a demographic model from Populus based on census data. This looked at factors such as income, occupation, housing tenure and health as well as ethnicity, immigration and whether people lived in urban or rural areas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2018/feb/28/qs-world-university-rankings-2018-hospitality","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T13:30:20Z","webTitle":"QS world university rankings 2018: hospitality","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/feb/28/qs-world-university-rankings-2018-hospitality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2018/feb/28/qs-world-university-rankings-2018-hospitality","fields":{"headline":"QS world university rankings 2018: hospitality","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/feb/27/toys-r-us-administration-jobs-risk","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T19:45:11Z","webTitle":"5,500 jobs at risk as Toys R Us and Maplin face administration","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/27/toys-r-us-administration-jobs-risk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/feb/27/toys-r-us-administration-jobs-risk","fields":{"headline":"5,500 jobs at risk as Toys R Us and Maplin face administration","bodyText":"More than 5,500 retail jobs are at risk as two of the high street’s best known names teeter on the edge of collapse. Toys R Us, with more than 3,000 staff, is set to go into administration in the next 24 hours, and 11th-hour rescue talks designed to shore up Maplin are also said to have broken down, meaning that the 200-store electronics chain also faces imminent bankruptcy. The loss-making Toys R Us retailer has been hunting for a buyer for several weeks, but the formal appointment of administrators is now imminent. The 105-store chain is a subsidiary of the eponymous US company, which filed for bankruptcy protection in the US and Canada last year after amassing $5bn (£3.7bn) of debt. The brand, which runs large out-of-town stores, has struggled to keep pace with shifts in shopping habits as Britons increasingly buy toys online or in supermarket aisles. Maplin, which is owned by the private equity investor Rutland Partners, has been struggling to find new funding since last autumn when it lost its credit insurers, which means that suppliers demand cash payment for stock upfront rather than one to three months after delivery. Maplin sales fell by 7% over the Christmas period, partly because the shops were short of stock as a result of its credit insurance problem. Maplin’s problems have reached a critical point because the stores faces a £15m VAT bill, which is due for payment by 1 March. The chain has been in talks with Philip Day, a billionaire retailer whose business interests span Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Peacocks, Jaeger and Austin Reed, but the talks are understood to have broken down on Tuesday afternoon. Many high street names are finding trade tough. House of Fraser is asking its landlords to cut its rent bills, and Debenhams and New Look are trying to cut costs by shutting stores. The major supermarkets have recently announced thousands of job cuts. Large volumes of trade have switched online – 20% of fashion is now bought on the internet – and a huge shift is under way in the way households spend their time and money. Leisure, travel, eating out, eating in and technology are all taking time and cash that would once have gone to shops. The specialist beds retailer Warren Evans went into administration earlier this month and the fashion chain East collapsed at the end of January. The furniture chain Multiyork and the shoe retailer Shoon both folded in the weeks before Christmas. Retail experts said Toys R Us’s problems were down to a lack of investment in its stores and website. “It would be easy to blame Amazon, but the reality is that Toys R Us has been a victim of complacency,” said Natalie Berg, an analyst at NBK Retail . “As a specialist retailer, the Toys R Us experience should have been a magical one with in-store events, dedicated play areas and product demonstrations. The reality was a soulless shed.” The company’s UK chain won a stay of execution in December when landlords agreed to take back the keys to a quarter of its shops and accepted less rent for those that stayed open, but after weak trading in the new year its US owner cut it adrift. The retailer had been trying to drum up a buyer before the end of February when several payments were due. “The combination of rising prices and subdued demand is putting considerable pressure on retailers and particularly exposing those with underlying issues,” said Berg. “Burdened by debt, Toys R Us has simply been unable to adapt to a changing retail environment.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/17/fit-in-my-40s-dance-class","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T07:00:15Z","webTitle":"Fit in my 40s: ‘This dance class is like being 13 again’ | Zoe Williams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/17/fit-in-my-40s-dance-class","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/17/fit-in-my-40s-dance-class","fields":{"headline":"Fit in my 40s: ‘This dance class is like being 13 again’","bodyText":"When you’re a kid, and you get on a horse, or roller skates, or into some Levi’s, in your head you look as heroic as someone you saw doing those things on telly. That’s all maturing is, learning how to spell parallel, and mapping the full difference between yourself doing a thing, and someone doing it who knows how. Then you stop doing the thing. That’s why I went back to Ianthe Mellors’ dance class. I couldn’t master anything last time, and this time’s worse. It’s in a different gym – Frame Shoreditch – that has a foyer like Fight Club, everyone is a superbreed in a crop top and all the food is made of protein. And its title is Music Video, by which is meant, we’re doing a routine that you might find in a music video. Ianthe is a professional, a core dancer for Africa Utopia, the person vogueing in the MTV How To Vogue video. So I’m watching her, like a terrier watching a squirrel, because if I so much as blink I’ll forget where I even am, and she most certainly is in a music video. Somewhere in my head, so am I. This is like being 13 again, before I lost my innocence and realised I would never be Starlight Express. You start without music, practising moves to Ianthe counting to eight, in batches of about three bars, slowed down to about half speed until it’s gone into your head. Then, when the music starts, you’re video-ready. The tolerance band of human physical intelligence is incredible. There were 13 of us; at the crap end, about three of us couldn’t move and learn at the same time, so in between each practice round we’d stand there baffled, trying to figure out what just happened. At the good end, there were about three naturals; their dance had personality. Their shoulders had character, their ankles had sass. “You could get away with a lot of errors, moving in that beautiful, natural, street-ish, music-video way,” I thought bitterly, “but it seems that you are not making a lot of errors.” I struggled with every transition, left to right, forwards to backwards, I found swinging my arm while shaking my butt as intellectually demanding as reading Ulysses while trying to explain Doctor Who, but I still felt vividly there, part of the tableau. I could really carve a role for myself standing with my arms crossed, nodding. But that would not be good exercise: you can’t figure out how hard you’re working when you’re mentally immersed. In retrospect, I’d say it was in the same range as commuter cycling; you feel better when you’ve done it than when you haven’t, but you don’t get a day of self-righteous exhaustion afterwards. It probably has a toning effect, but in quite specific places not necessarily all that aesthetic, like your upper chest. It would improve your flexibility over time, but only if you could figure out what you were doing enough to relax. It greatly improves your knowledge of the pop lyrics of the day. But I think the main reason you’d do it is for the simple joy of being alive. What I learned The salsa has a universal application, from aerobics to dance. The grapevine does not.

What’s next? Don’t let them tell you what to do.” The ads are the work of Love Your Local, a campaign by pubs and clubs set up to fight Labor opposition leader Rebecca White over her historic pledge to remove poker machines from their venues. And they are fighting hard. With a little more than a week to go until election day, Tasmanians have been bombarded with anti-Labor and pro-Liberal advertising – on TV, radio, newspapers, billboards and social media. The blitz began well before the election was called in late January. Analysts believe it is almost certainly the most expensive election campaign in the state’s history, driven in part by a national gaming industry concerned to make sure the anti-pokies push does not spread to the mainland. The Love Your Local campaign has run alongside a similarly themed push by Federal Group, the privately owned Sydney hotel company that holds the exclusive right to licence the state’s pokies. Liberal party advertising – black-backgrounded when a voice warns of the risks of a Labor-Greens minority government, stately navy blue for premier Will Hodgman in positive mode – has been no less ubiquitous. Love Your Local chairman Michael Best, who owns nine gaming venues as head of the Goodstone Group, is not sure if it is the largest campaign in the state’s history, but agrees it is hard to miss. He says his campaign is driven “by anger [and] extreme disappointment” with Labor. Of the billboard, he says: “It is straight to the point, but we’ve been attacked – our business, our staff, our future. We wanted to put our position out there, and that’s what it is.” Counter-advertising backing Labor’s policy gamble was much slower to appear. White announced the pokies phase out in December; an anti-pokies campaign by advocacy group Bad Bets Australia – funded by the Museum of Old and New Art creator David Walsh, and portraying poker machines as parasites, scuttling around the suburbs – began only midway through the campaign. Labor, running short on money, has held back much of its advertising until the final weeks. None of the major players will say how much they are spending on the campaign, and under existing donation disclosure laws they will not have to until next year. Labor sources estimate the Liberal party and hospitality industry would have collectively spent $5m on advertising, and say the TV ad ratio is running 10:1 in the Liberals’ favour. The impact of that is difficult to measure. There has been no public polling of voting intention since last year, but insiders from across the political sphere agree that the government has run a more effective campaign, with a larger and more targeted swag of policies. Last December, the major parties were level pegging. Many now tentatively put the Liberals to be ahead, a point the government has tried to reinforce through the selective release of internal polling. Labor’s break with Federal was historic by any measure. According to social historian James Boyce’s book Losing Streak, in the early 1970s the ALP ensured Federal would hold a casino monopoly in the state. 30 years later, it agreed to the extension of its pokies’ monopoly in all venues. That deal was overseen by Paul Lennon, who later became premier. He is now employed by Federal Group as a lobbyist. Under the ALP’s new stance, Federal would face two blows. From 2023, it would lose its licence rights for pokies in venues outside casinos, and be forced to remove the machines from its own pubs. The Liberal party is also proposing a change – handing the licences directly to the pubs and clubs. While that may seem to just be taking on Federal’s long-held monopoly in another way, Boyce says it is transparently driven to please the company. He says the Hodgman government had planned to hold a tender for the pokies licence, but changed its position after receiving a submission from Federal Group and the Tasmanian Hospitality Association calling for an arrangement almost identical to the one it now proposes. Under new tax rates associated with the plan, the pubs and clubs would see their take increase from about a third to nearly half of poker machine revenue. Federal Group would lose its monopoly, but could benefit at its 12 pokies’ venues. It is also pushing for the change to coincide with a lower tax rate on its casinos. The government is yet to respond. Anti-pokies campaigners say by agreeing to the industry’s proposal, the government is not only continuing a highly addictive and socially damaging industry, but short-changing taxpayers. In part by using numbers put forward by the Federal Group, they estimate a tender process for the pokies licences could yield the state $250m. Based on the Victorian experience, Monash University academic and social activist Charles Livingstone calculated it may be as much as $380m. A government spokesman says the analysis is “completely wrong” because it did not factor in an expected $16m a year increase in taxes, levies and licence fees, adding up to $320m over two decades. By comparison, the Labor plan would forego tax and cost $55m for a promised transition package. Livingstone says it is mystifying the state government appeared to not want the full value for pokies licences in the state. “They are granting a gift that is costing the Tasmanian economy hundreds of millions of dollars.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/23/friday-briefing-flake-news-russia-spawns-beast-from-the-east","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T06:35:26Z","webTitle":"Friday briefing: Flake news!

Russia spawns 'beast from the east'","bodyText":"Top story: Get ready for -8C as snowy weather hits Hello, I’m Warren Murray and this is what we’re looking at. A blast of frigid Siberian air arriving in Britain this weekend is threatening to give the country its coldest end to winter in five years. Temperatures are predicted to plunge to -8C in some areas from Sunday night and then struggle to get above freezing on Monday. The Met Office says there could be heavy snowfall in parts of east and south-east England, with snow likely in London from late on Monday and into Tuesday. Public Health England has issued a reminder that this weather could be dangerous for over-65s, people with heart or lung conditions, or the very young. “Check on friends, family and neighbours who may be at risk and make sure they’re heating homes to at least 18C, see if they need any particular help or just someone to talk to and keep an eye on the Met Office’s forecasts and warnings,” said Dr Thomas Waite, of Public Health England’s extreme events team. * * * Union of sorts – Not “the” customs union but “a” customs union. A lot hinges on the indefinite article here, as Labour looks increasingly aligned with Tories who want to keep borders open for trade after Brexit on more or less the current terms. There are signs Jeremy Corbyn is preparing to back a rebel Tory amendment to that effect, in what would be a damaging defeat for Theresa May. “We have to have a customs union,” Corbyn said this week. Tory rebel Anna Soubry has responded by tabling a refreshed trade bill amendment calling for “a customs union”. A speech Corbyn is due to give on Monday should shed some light on how far Labour will go. At the same time, May is preparing to ask her full cabinet to sign off on the outcome of Thursday’s all-day meeting of her 11-strong Brexit “war cabinet”. The outcome of those talks will be reflected in a speech by May next week – but you can normally count on a leak, and this morning Radio 4 has been reporting an “outbreak of unity” at the meeting led to an agreed position that left “everyone happy” (as unlikely as that sounds). * * * Manafort on more charges – The Trump-Russia investigator Robert Mueller has ramped up pressure on associates of the president by filing 32 new charges against Paul Manafort, who was Donald Trump’s campaign manager, and his business partner Rick Gates. Both men were already charged with money-laundering and failing to register as a foreign agent. The new charges allege millions of dollars of bank and tax fraud stemming from the collapse of their secretive deals advising pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine. Gates has reportedly been negotiating a deal with special counsel Mueller and this is likely to increase the pressure on Manafort to co-operate in the investigation of alleged links between the Trump campaign and Russia. * * * Who is Barnaby Joyce? – Australian politics has entertained the world with a palace coup or three in recent years, and the trend of leaders getting the boot continues this morning with the departure of Barnaby Joyce from the upper echelons. The deputy prime minister has resigned after he got a ministerial staff member pregnant and had sexual misconduct allegations levelled against him. Joyce, a country MP famed for his bumpkin prose, was deputy PM by virtue of leading the National party, which governs in coalition with the Liberals. Perhaps most memorably, Joyce was the “minister for Pistol and Boo” who got Jonny Depp’s smuggled terriers deported. Joyce’s final legacy is the “bonk ban” – because of his office dalliance, sex between ministers and staff has been outlawed. * * * Rather steep – The scandal of extortionate ground rents has taken another twist with the sale for £180,000 of a Birmingham block of flats regarded as the worst example of leasehold abuse in the country. Some buyers of one-bedroom apartments in Blythe Court already face ground rent of £8,000 a year and that figure, on paper, is pegged to rise to £8m over the life of the lease. The new owner has not been named. On the subject of housing market absurdities, don’t miss this gallery of equally gorgeous and depressing photographs taken inside hovels that are on the market for millions. * * * Troll or sockpuppet? – Russia’s “Internet Research Agency”, which churns out fake news to disrupt global politics, has been called a “troll factory”. But it might be more accurately described as a “sock puppet factory”. Word-watcher Steven Poole explains why. In an era of abundant fake news it is important to understand and maintain these fine distinctions, which is one reason the Oxford English Dictionary is currently embarked on producing a third edition – a goliath project that involves overhauling every entry, some untouched since the late-Victorian era, and adding tens of thousands of new or missing words. With abundant neologisms like “mansplain” and “snowflake” adding to the pile, will the job ever be complete? Winter Olympics Day 14 in Pyeongchang could be the day Great Britain reaches its medal target. The women’s curling team meet Sweden on the ice in a semi-final where victory will secure at least bronze – and a fifth medal, to scoop Britain’s highest ever tally at a Winter Olympics. The match starts at 11.05am UK time – make sure you’re keeping up with our live blog. Already completed today are the women’s ski-cross final, with a Canadian one-two bringing gold for Kelsey Serwa and silver for Brittany Phelan, and the women’s figure skating, won by 15-year-old Alina Zagitova who claimed a first gold for the Olympic Athletes of Russia team. American speed skating king Shani Davis goes for gold one last time in the men’s 1000m final, while gold is also up for grabs in the men’s biathlon 4x7.5km relay. Norway has powered to the top of the Winter Olympics medals table on a budget one-tenth of Britain’s thanks to an inclusive approach based on camaraderie and grassroots participation. And Elise Christie, who crashed or was disqualified in all three of her events, will consider moving abroad to take up long-track speed skating in a bid to end her Winter Olympics jinx.

Lunchtime read: 37 injuries but no murder charge Tara Newbold was found dead with a shocking litany of injuries: among them, seven broken ribs, a partly collapsed lung, and marks from head to toe. The postmortem found she had been attacked with a “rod or a bar-shaped object”. Tara’s boyfriend, Duane Ballin, turned himself in to police and said he thought he had killed her. There was evidence of prior domestic abuse, which police and social services knew about. Yet Ballin was not charged with murder – because the coroner concluded she died not of her injuries, but from taking cocaine. Instead, Ballin faces some jail time for grievous bodily harm after being convicted at trial this week. The outcome has devastated Tara’s family. During the investigation her mother and stepfather, Julie and Peter, sought a review of the case. A Home Office pathologist backing their contention that Tara’s injuries could not be ruled out as a factor in her death. But Nottinghamshire police declined to pursue this, and prosecutors went ahead with the lesser charge. Peter and Julie have been left with Tara’s three children, and the echo of her last words to Julie when they crossed paths in a pub: “Love you Mum.” Sport At long last, Arsenal won a two-legged knockout tie in Europe but last night’s 2-1 defeat to Östersund at the Emirates was not the way they envisaged it; the Gunners’ performance was so dismal, Arsène Wenger questioned the mindset of his Arsenal players and said they were guilty of complacency during the Europa League tie. Eddie Jones has dismissed concerns over England’s discipline and claimed statistical analysis shows “the most successful teams infringe”, a day after remarks from Scotland that questioned the legality of his side’s defence. Ireland have not been beaten at home in the Six Nations since 2013 but they will have to defend that record against Wales on Saturday without four players who toured New Zealand with the British &amp; Irish Lions last summer.

When we came to Darlinghurst Road, Kings Cross, the police turned it into a riot. We had no idea that so many of the marchers would suffer in various ways: job loss, forced comings-out, police bashings, family breakups. The parade has since lost its political and satirical strength. It is too commercial – large with a lot of glamour. There are very few individual entries now. A positive aspect, though, is that our community’s diversity is really on display during the parade. The extraordinary number of events during the whole Mardi Gras festival are wonderful, inspirational, and such a bonus. Where to now? How are we going to mobilise our community to oppose the “religious freedom” issues that arose during the marriage equality debates? There are also pockets within western Sydney where our sisters and brothers are struggling with issues that we as a community encountered about 40 years ago. We need to reach out to them. I believe that transgender and intersex people experience a variety of issues to be dealt with. No doubt there are sisters and brothers among those who are held in detention like criminals at Manus Island and Nauru. ‘The community can make a difference’ Steve Warren Looking back at those momentous events on 24 June 1978 we never could have known where it would lead us. Thank goodness the actions all round on that night moved us forward to genuine law reform in our community’s favour! Even though the climate has improved somewhat I can’t help but think that some of those who recently stood up for marriage equality also did so under tough circumstances, when public opinion was initially against us. It shows that the community can make a difference. Sydney’s Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras has become a beacon for positive change! We now need to get back to those important grassroots community ties to consolidate this further. Where to now? Many things have changed for the better in Australia but we still have areas of discrimination to overcome, including transphobia and reducing suicide rates and depression and anxiety in our LGBTQI community. We mustn’t forget how easy it is for rights to go backwards. This is reflected all around us internationally. Too many countries still have severe, harsh barriers to sexuality. We must stand up for them too. Our work is not over yet. The revolution continues! ‘A celebration of our diversity, love and strength’ Titi Chartay As a participant in the initial Mardi Gras in 1978 there are strong memories, powerful memories, sad memories and inspiring memories. The 1978 Mardi Gras, against so many odds and difficulties, with tenacity, humour and creativity, grew into the largest LGBTQI protest and celebration in the world. A celebration of our diversity, love and strength, a protest against ongoing injustice here in Australia and around the world. The legacy of the 78ers wasn’t thwarted by violence nor the vindictive naming in the press of those arrested, leading to job loss, child custody threats, harassment etc. Where to now? I hope that young LGBTI people realise that they are not alone, that there is a community and a history that goes back to before 1978 waiting to embrace them. ‘Mardi Gras has given hope to many young people’ Robyn Plaister In 1978, we marched down Oxford Street, where all the gay bars were, and called out to those in the bars to join us: “Out of the bars and into the streets!” The march was in solidarity with our sisters and brothers overseas who were being discriminated against, and in particular, it was in memory of the raid made by police on Stonewall, in New York, where gay people fought back for the first time. We felt that more people, if educated about what we were protesting, and if it was done in a fun way, might join us in protest and swell our ranks. Today’s Mardi Gras is not how I would have imagined it would become in terms of the politics. As a woman, I found the Mardi Gras became all about men and their sexual freedom rather than fighting the wider concerns we had originally of homophobia, sexism and racism. Many lesbians left the Mardi Gras in droves at that time and although some men tried to attract women into the organising committee, it took a while before women would be involved. The politics of educating people to think differently and not just accept heteronormativity faded. Now some of the floats take a political turn, however many are just advertising different lesbian and gay groups. The positive aspect of having Mardi Gras is that it increases our visibility and has given hope to many young or isolated lesbians and gay men who would not have seen or heard about all these groups. It has created an attitudinal change in the general public where they can see the fun side of being lesbian or gay and hopefully get educated about our concerns. Where to now? Marriage equality has been good for some people, and before that the recognition of de facto couples. For some of us who are not interested in getting married or being recognised as de facto, some of the same fights still exist, such as ensuring that there is not covert discrimination against lesbians and gay men in the workforce, in education, in health.We need to deliver appropriate services for older members of our community. There is still bullying of young gays and lesbians in schools which requires dedicated programs of education of teachers and students to stop discrimination. There needs to be more education about sexism and racism within the movement, too. • Riot premieres on ABC TV and iView on Sunday 25 February at 8:31pm"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/22/stoneman-douglas-shooting-armed-guard-did-not-go-in","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T23:50:11Z","webTitle":"Armed guard at Florida high school failed to enter building and stop shooter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/22/stoneman-douglas-shooting-armed-guard-did-not-go-in","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/feb/22/stoneman-douglas-shooting-armed-guard-did-not-go-in","fields":{"headline":"Armed guard at Florida high school failed to enter building and stop shooter","bodyText":"The armed deputy who was on campus at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school when a gunman massacred 17 people stood outside the building as it occurred and did not go in to engage the shooter, the Broward County sheriff, Scott Israel, said on Thursday. Deputy Scot Peterson, who was the school resource officer at Stoneman Douglas in Parkland, Florida, resigned from the department on Thursday after being told he would be suspended, Israel said. He did not say if Peterson would face criminal charges. Israel said he made the decision after reviewing video surveillance and interviewing witnesses, including the deputy himself. The sheriff says Peterson responded to the building where the shooting took place, took up a position outside a door and never went in. When asked what Peterson should have done, Israel said the deputy should have “went in, addressed the killer, killed the killer”. The sheriff said he was “devastated, sick to my stomach. There are no words”. Nikolas Cruz, 19, fatally shot 17 people at the high school on 14 February in the second deadliest shooting at an American public school. The student survivors, supported by their families and teachers, have spoken out against Washington’s inaction and statements by the president. The news of the deputy’s resignation came just hours after the NRA’s chief, Wayne LaPierre, broke his silence over the Parkland massacre, lambasting gun control advocates and repeating his notorious mantra from after the Sandy Hook school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012: “To stop a bad guy with a gun, it takes a good guy with a gun.” In his speech on Thursday to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at the National Harbor in Maryland, he insisted that “the whole idea from some of our opponents that armed security makes us less safe is completely ridiculous. If that’s true, armed security makes us less safe, let’s just go ahead and remove it from everywhere”. He continued: “We must immediately harden our schools. Every day young children are being dropped off at schools that are virtually wide open, soft targets for anyone bent on mass murder. It should not be easier for a madman to shoot up a school than a bank or jewellery store or some Hollywood gala. “Schools should be the hardest target in this country. Evil must be confronted with all necessary force to protect our kids.” This week, Donald Trump has repeatedly backed a proposal to arm teachers in US schools as a way to defend students in school shootings, despite opposition from the country’s largest teachers’ unions, school security guards and military veterans. The state senator Bill Galvano, who is helping craft a bill in response to the shooting deaths, said an idea gaining traction is a program that would allow local sheriffs to deputize someone at a school to carry a gun on campus. Galvano insisted the idea is not the same as arming teachers. He said the program would be optional and the deputized person would have to be trained by local law-enforcement agencies. Joe Negron, the Florida Senate president, said both chambers are working on the legislation in response to the Parkland shootings. He said a final draft should be available “early next week at the latest”. What won’t be considered is a ban on assault-style rifles. That falls short of reform demanded by students who converged on Florida’s Capitol to take their concerns to state lawmakers Wednesday. Outside the building, many protesters complained that lawmakers were not serious about gun control and said that in future elections they would oppose any legislator who accepts campaign contributions from the NRA.

The deal leaves buyers of the small one-bedroom flats – who thought they would be paying just £250 a year in ground rent – locked into bills of up to £8,000 a year and ultimately spiralling to £8m a year over the life of the lease. The block of 12 flats in Coleshill, Birmingham contains what critics describe as the most egregious leasehold contracts in the UK. Some of the apartments in Blythe Court, identical in size, contain leases where the ground rents are fixed at a modest £12 a year for the life of the lease. But others double every 10 years, with one already at £3,200 and the worst at £8,000. The soaring ground rents have left buyers of the flats – who originally paid between £50,000 and £100,000 for their homes – with properties they say are now completely unsaleable. The freeholder who put the ground rents up for auction is Martin Paine, described in a 2016 Commons debate as a “crook” who had “taken lease beyond sleaze”. The total ground rent roll on the building is £17,000 a year, so the new owner of the freehold will have effectively guaranteed themselves an income of 9.5% a year on their money. “Mr Paine perhaps saw the writing on the wall. Having created appalling ground rents at the Blythe Court site they have now dumped their ownership through an auction,” said campaigner Martin Boyd of the Leasehold Knowledge Partnership. The Law Commission, which advises the government on law reform, this week said that leasehold is living “on borrowed time” and that a switch to a system called commonhold may be advisable. The government has already set out that it intends to stop all ground rents higher than a peppercorn on all new homes. It has also promised to change legislation to make the extension of existing leases easier, quicker and cheaper for all leaseholders."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/23/zelda-daprano-fought-for-equality-all-her-life-the-fire-in-our-bellies-is-her-legacy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T23:48:15Z","webTitle":"Zelda D'Aprano fought for equality all her life.

The fire in our bellies is her legacy","bodyText":"Zelda D’Aprano was an unstoppable force, and if you didn’t like it, you best got out of the way. It’s through my work as a director of the Victorian Women’s Trust that I got to know Zelda, and she has been a personal hero of mine ever since. I feel lucky for every conversation we had together. Each time I walked away feeling like I could do anything, and she utilised those powers very skilfully. She told me to ask for more from the world, even if I wanted the sun. So, to honour my friend: I’ll have your moon too, thanks. Zelda D’Aprano passed away on Wednesday, at the age of 90. A staunch feminist, labour unionist, and pay justice advocate, Zelda had a profound and everlasting impact on the women’s movement and labour movements within Australia. She also took the time in her later years to mentor and nurture young feminists. I, and many others, are beneficiaries of that kindness, and we find ourselves grieving an immense loss. She left school at 14 to join the workforce, and it was in this factory work she began to witness first-hand the inequity between male and female workers. With each job she took she would point out the injustice of this disparity to her employers and would be swiftly sacked. She didn’t care about personal consequences, she cared about fairness. In 1969, fed up with the lack of progress for women, Zelda secured herself to the doors of the Commonwealth Building to protest the dismissal in the arbitration court of the equal pay case, of which she was a test case with the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (AMIEU). In an all-too-familiar pattern, for this “outspokenness” she was fired from the AMIEU. Women weren’t allowed to drink in pubs, just in the ladies lounges, so she held pub crawls and invited all her friends. Women were only making 75c to the dollar, so she only paid 75% of her tram fare. I remember suggesting on one of my visits that she was the head of the “Ain’t Havin’ It Union” and she laughed. The legislation Zelda fought for has been all but eroded. The Equal Pay Act of 1972 has been aggressively watered down to become the “Fair Work Act” and no longer even mentions “pay equity”, “gender discrimination” or “equal pay”. We allowed ourselves to be the frogs in the hot water. Zelda noticed, and I’m heartbroken she couldn’t stay long enough to see us fix it. But fix it we will. When Zelda was chained to the doors of parliament, a police officer (foolishly underestimating her commitment) began to chastise her. “Aren’t you embarrassed? It’s just you on your own,” he said. Without hesitating, she replied “No. Because soon there will be three, then there will be five, and then there will be …”. She was right. Ten days after her protest she was joined by Alva Geikie and Thelma Solomon. From that action, the three women founded the Women’s Action Committee and the Women’s Liberation Centre, from which the Women’s Liberation Movement in Melbourne was born. This changed the landscape of feminist organising in Australia forever. In her 1995 biography, Zelda described wanting to get more women involved in activism, because “we had passed the stage of caring about a “lady-like” image because women had for too long been polite ... and were still being ignored”. She didn’t care about what people thought of her, she cared about fairness. The Women’s Action Committee organised the very first pro-choice rally in 1975, with an impressive turnout of over 500 women. It was reported by the media as a “horde of angry barefoot women” taking to the streets. Zelda assured me they were definitely wearing shoes. She really did walk the walk, throughout her entire life. As she outlived many of her friends and comrades, in her later years she described herself as lacking “good conversation” with fellow lefties and unionists. Someone from the Trades Hall’s women’s team would come every month to talk shop, and it was a highlight for everyone involved. In 2015, the Victorian Trades Hall Council introduced the Zelda D’Aprano Award for union activism. In a bittersweet coincidence, the nominations for the 2018 award opened on the very day she passed away. The flag at Trades Hall was lowered to half mast in her honour. The legacy of Zelda D’Aprano cannot be contained within memorial writings or obituaries, and it cannot die. It lives within the hearts of feminists – young and old – who, inspired by her spirit, will continue to fight for equality and fairness. It lives in the fire in our bellies. It lives in the smirk we wear when we are doubted. Even through the heartache of loss, it lives. “Oh sisters, you’ve done me proud” – Zelda D’Aprano, 2015. • Leena van Deventer is a writer, game developer and teacher from Melbourne"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/22/tiger-woods-honda-classic-alex-noren-morgtan-hoffman","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T20:53:12Z","webTitle":"Tiger Woods round in level par at Honda Classic and four shots off lead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/22/tiger-woods-honda-classic-alex-noren-morgtan-hoffman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/feb/22/tiger-woods-honda-classic-alex-noren-morgtan-hoffman","fields":{"headline":"Tiger Woods round in level par at Honda Classic and four shots off lead","bodyText":"The umpteenth coming of Tiger Woods remains captivating viewing. So many elements of day one at the Honda Classic felt just like old times. By 9am on Thursday, Woods sat atop a leaderboard for the first time since a brief but identical position at the Wyndham Championship of 2015. Profanity, a club slam into the turf in frustration and basic errors were among what followed but so too, crucially, was plenty of reason for encouragement. Maybe Woods, still clearly a long way short of his imperious best, has the capacity to compete after all. Woods’s 70, level par at this Florida venue, arguably represented his boldest statement of the year. Wind whipped around the infamously testing site, where the greens are in strangely poor condition. Woods didn’t buckle, physically or competitively. The good outweighed the bad and ugly. “I was proud of that,” said the 14-times major winner. “I’m trying to get better, more efficient at what I’m doing and also I’m actually doing it under the gun, under the pressure of having to hit golf shots, and this golf course is not forgiving whatsoever. I was very happy with the way I hit it today. “Today was not easy. It’s only going to get more difficult because these greens are not the best. It was tough all around; the wind was blowing pretty hard, the rough’s up, and it’s really tough to make putts out there. It was very positive today. It was a tough day out there for all of us, and even par is a good score.” Woods had raced to two-under within four holes. He knew his leaderboard position all right. “Yeah, but there were how many holes still to go?” he later said with a smile. “Come on.” An aberration arrived at the 16th, his 7th, as he found a greenside bunker from the middle of the fairway and proved unable to retrieve par from nine feet. “Nice fucking putt” was the audible cry towards himself as he stepped from the green. Woods remained under par until the 3rd, where his most ugly performance of the day was to ensue. He had just 165 yards left to the green, again from fairway, on this par five but tugged his approach into sand. It took a decent effort to hole out for a double bogey having tried to be overly cute with a bunker shot and being spooked by a gust of wind as he attempted what should have been a tap-in for a six. The Woods response was admirable and perhaps unexpected. Vast galleries and cynical onlookers thought he may unravel. Instead, the 42-year-old made birdie at the 4th and was narrowly denied a move back under par on his penultimate hole. Woods found 10 greens in regulation, seven from a possible 14 fairways and took 27 putts. The key test, of course, will arrive on Friday afternoon as he bids to maintain this early promise to the point where he survives for the weekend. “I’ve just keep on going,” he added. “I’ve got to keep doing what I’m doing and give myself some [birdie] looks.” By close of play, Woods was only four from the 18-hole lead as claimed by Alex Noren and Webb Simpson. Noren, a nine-time winner on the European Tour, continues to edge towards victory on this side of the Atlantic. Rory McIlroy had only missed birdie opportunities on the back nine to worry about before finding water with his second shot to the last. The Northern Irishman’s 72 was largely due to the double bogey that followed. This wasn’t really representative of his overall play. “It was a disappointing finish but I’ll try to rectify that mistake tomorrow morning,” McIlroy said. Martin Kaymer’s Honda Classic lasted just 18 holes, the two-time major winner withdrawing after his 75 because of a wrist injury. Rickie Fowler, the defending champion, will resume on Friday at one over."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/feb/23/monsanto-demands-avaaz-hands-over-all-of-its-campaign-data","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T12:29:22Z","webTitle":"Monsanto demands Avaaz hands over all of its campaign data","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/23/monsanto-demands-avaaz-hands-over-all-of-its-campaign-data","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/feb/23/monsanto-demands-avaaz-hands-over-all-of-its-campaign-data","fields":{"headline":"Monsanto demands Avaaz hands over all of its campaign data","bodyText":"A US court will today hear a request from Monsanto for access to a huge batch of internal communications by Avaaz, in a move that the campaign group says could have grave repercussions for online activism and data privacy. Monsanto is seeking the release of all lobby documents, emails, correspondence and notes “without limitation”, where the firm or its herbicide ingredient glyphosate have been mentioned. Avaaz says this would include personal information about its employees, as well as the email addresses of more than four million signatories to petitions against Monsanto’s GM and glyphosate policies. Emma Ruby-Sachs, the group’s deputy director told the Guardian that if it was successful, Monsanto’s suit would have a “chilling effect” on the group’s activism. “Our staff are already unsure about what to write down – and what not to write down,” she said. “Our parters are nervous that anything they say to us could be turned over. “Our members are writing to us saying that they’re afraid their data will be handed over. We are doing our best not to let it slow us down but at the end of the day, there is now this scary cloud hanging over our organisation.” A victory for Monsanto in today’s hearing would cost the online advocacy group thousands of person-hours of work time, and hundreds of thousands of dollars, according to Avaaz’s lawyers. It could even raise the prospect of a migration out of online activism by campaigners concerned about corporate surveillance, they fear. But Monsanto argues that it is merely following standard procedure to uncover links between Avaaz and non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL) sufferers in a separate lawsuit. Scott Partridge, Monsanto’s vice president for global strategy said the firm had itself complied with court orders to release 10m documents in the past, and called claims that it was seeking personal information on Avaaz employees “completely false”. “If they wish to redact email addresses or personal information that gives an individual concern, I’m open to that,” he told the Guardian. “This is not an effort to intimidate individuals or make them think their personal information is going to be used by Monsanto.” “This [subpoena] is directed entirely at the coordinated campaign between Avaaz and the plaintiff’s lawyers, spreading misinformation about the safety of glyphosate, or characterising it as being a carcinogen.” The subpoena was issued in a case against Monsanto by Ronald Peterson and Jeff Hall, who claim they contracted NHL through exposure to Monsanto’s Roundup weedkiller, in which glyphosate is an active ingredient. “We have never spoken to the plaintiff’s lawyers,” Ruby-Sachs said. “We didn’t even know this case existed until we got the subpoena. I’m 100% confident of that, as we had to look it up and it took a while to figure out what it was.” Monsanto’s documents request calls for the release of all communications between Avaaz and the plaintiffs’ counsel, lawyers, and law firms. But it also seeks disclosure of all communications – “in the broadest possible meaning” – with governments, NGOs, public relations and advertising firms. It likewise demands all documents Avaaz employees have created, maintained, received, sent or copied, where these involve discussion about glyphosate, Monsanto, or the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer, which found glyphosate to probably be carcinogenic. An exhaustive list of communication forms, from telegrams to power point presentations, is listed in the subpoena. Monsanto filed its request shortly after a bitter EU regulatory battle ended with its license for glyphosate – the core ingredient in Roundup – being extended by just five years, rather than the 15 years originally sought by the European commission. As the issue was debated, the firm found itself dogged by allegations emerging from the Monsanto Papers – unsealed documents from a US lawsuit that led to a hearing in the European parliament. The allegations were ultimately dismissed by the commission, which declared Roundup to be safe. This was one front in a campaign that Avaaz contributed to with a 2 million-strong petition. The group’s lawyers argue that the Peterson and Hall case is being used as “a pretext” for Monsanto to obtain access to private information about Avaaz’s EU campaign strategy. Monsanto though maintains that it is waging a battle for fair disclosure. “We are only asking Avaaz to be as open and transparent as we have been,” Partridge said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/23/eddie-jones-progress-england-anniversary-scotland-six-nations","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T06:30:38Z","webTitle":"Eddie Jones pleased with progress on his second anniversary | Robert Kitson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/23/eddie-jones-progress-england-anniversary-scotland-six-nations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/feb/23/eddie-jones-progress-england-anniversary-scotland-six-nations","fields":{"headline":"England’s Eddie Jones pleased with progress on his second anniversary","bodyText":"Eddie Jones has a vivid recollection of the buildup to his first game as England coach against Scotland in Edinburgh. Two years on, before Saturday’s Calcutta Cup reunion, he has been replaying the video footage to his squad this week and says it still sends a shiver down his spine. “After the first training run I was thinking: ‘Goodness me, what have I got myself into here? After 20 minutes they were just shot. They couldn’t run any more.” Twenty-four wins in 25 Tests later and Jones, as might be imagined, is a good deal happier. Not totally satisfied, naturally, because he never is, but reassured that his squad have made sufficient percentage improvement inside two years to make any successful stock market analyst blink. “We’ve been looking at a bit of data and, conservatively, we’ve improved 40%. Conservatively. And we’ve still got another 20% to go.” All part of the sabre-rattling Calcutta Cup hype, perhaps? Or perhaps not. Ominously for Scotland this England team appear entirely convinced by their own gathering momentum, which is half the battle at this level. For that 2016 fixture they had only four training runs under Jones before the Murrayfield fixture in which they sneaked home 15-9. The difference in their self-belief now, regardless of where they are due to play, is almost tangible. Jones and his conditioning staff, clearly, have to take a lot of credit but, as the head coach points out, it is the players who have done the hardest yards. No one is yet proclaiming them the best side in the world but they are increasingly among the hardest to beat, arguably a more practically useful yardstick. There is also a clarity in terms of mindset for which English rugby has seldom been renowned, some feat considering 13 of the starting XV from two years ago are in the matchday 23 now. The faces are largely the same but, mentally, there has been a transformation. “They’ve probably learned more from themselves than me,” Jones says. “They’ve learned to develop a mindset to find a way to win Test rugby.” Out of this renewed sense of purpose has also emerged a collective desire to explore their physical limits which their Australian guru, for one, struggled to locate when he turned up. “They weren’t fit. They wanted to play a system of attack and a system of defence and I thought: ‘This is going to be hard work.’ I was massively surprised how quickly they changed. It is hard for good players to change and it is a great credit to them that they have been able to accept they needed to. “The basis of Test match rugby is physical condition. You’ve got to be fit enough to play. And when you win games, as we have consistently in the last 20 minutes, part of it is fitness and part of it is tactical nous. How many games have you seen the All Blacks win in the last 20 minutes? Plenty. And that’s because they practise it. We practise it now, too. We’ve got the base now to be able to do that.” Whether that will necessarily apply to Nathan Hughes, only just back from injury and unlikely to last the entire 80 minutes at No 8 in place of the injured Sam Simmonds, is possibly debatable. With Joe Marler also returning to the bench following suspension, however, England do not look a team ripe for slaughter – unless it is them about to do the slaughtering. Last year they stuck 61 points on Scotland at Twickenham and the captain, Dylan Hartley, believes they are ready for any eventuality. “I’ve got confidence in my team-mates that when the going gets tough we’ll come out the other side,” said the hooker, set to win his 92nd cap and replace Jonny Wilkinson as England’s second most-capped player. Those wondering exactly what kind of sporting team Jones would like to recreate, meanwhile, will be surprised by the answer. As a kid back in Sydney, Jones was an admirer of the West Ham side of the 1970s and can reel off the names just like that. “I used to love Billy Bonds, Trevor Brooking, Frank Lampard, all those guys. They had those big tough defenders and Brooking was the artist at the front. He always reminded me of Greg Chappell playing football, a bit of an artist, and I liked that claret-and-light-blue jersey.” An ideal Jones team, then, has to contain a bit of mongrel as well as its pedigree champs. For every Brooking-type creative figure in the current England rugby squad – “Anthony Watson is a bit like that. And Jonathan Joseph. They’re artists in their own way” – the relentless Jones wants someone snapping at opposition heels. “We’re developing a team that is robust, a team that is mentally tough and has a lot of leadership. That’s going to be the key growth area as we go forward. How can the players absorb tight situations, fight their way out of it and find a way to win?” Saturday, he hopes, will reinforce just how far England have already come."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2018/feb/22/teacher-walkout-west-virginia-strike-pay-cuts-protest","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T20:45:44Z","webTitle":"West Virginia teachers stage walkout over wages and benefits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/feb/22/teacher-walkout-west-virginia-strike-pay-cuts-protest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/feb/22/teacher-walkout-west-virginia-strike-pay-cuts-protest","fields":{"headline":"West Virginia teachers stage walkout over wages and benefits","bodyText":"“We gotta keep the blood moving,” said union leader Kim Martin as she revved up a picket line of 50 teachers dancing in the freezing rain to Michael Jackson’s Don’t Stop Til You Get Enough. Teachers in West Virginia, who are the 48th lowest paid in the nation, quit school for a two-day illegal wildcat strike on Thursday, the first time they have taken such action since 1990. They are demanding that state legislature vote to increase their wages, health care, and stop the proposed elimination of traditional teachers seniority. With starting salaries set at $31,000 a year, union leaders say that after deducting for health care costs, many teachers in the state make less than $15 an hour. Now, the Republican lead state legislature is proposing to give teachers only a 2% raise while drastically increasing healthcare costs so high that some teacher’s deductibles would more than triple. “It’s scary. I worry constantly about how I am going to afford my medicine” says 20-year teaching veteran Jackie Shriner who already pays $500 a month just to afford her insulin. Despite the state enacting anti-union “right-to-work” legislation in 2016, support for the teachers among the public remains strong in the once union stronghold of West Virginia. On the picket line outside of Bridge Street Elementary, cars drove by honking and yelling in support of the striking teachers. “Out of the last three hours, we have only gotten one middle finger,” said Bridge Street Elementary teacher Lindsay Armmirante. “The rest has been all honks, thumbs up, fist bumps, smiles, it’s actually been a lot of fun” Horns blared as Sub Express shop owner Perry Wade stopped his car to get out and thank the teachers. “It’s not much, but it’s more than they are giving you in Charleston,” joked Wade as he hands them cards for free six-inch subs. However, support for the teachers isn’t nearly as strong with the area’s State senator Ryan Ferns, the Republican majority leader in the state Senate. “The teachers and their unions are threatening to strike and are making a threat to lock schools down and leave students in the cold,” Ferns told the Wheeling News-Register last Friday. “As a Legislature, we are not willing to respond to that,” The comment outraged many of Wheeling’s teachers. “I have taught girls that were pregnant that were raped by their fathers,” said Lindsay Armmirante. “We have paid electric bills, we have paid water bills, we have taken kids shopping for clothes. There is nothing that we don’t do for our kids here if they need. So to insult us that we don’t care about our kids its way over the line”. As the state’s board of education weighs bringing legal charges against the state’s teachers unions for engaging in an illegal strike, teachers out on the picket line at Bridge Street Elementary said they were undeterred as the public rallies to support them. “It’s been really neat to see a state come together with the way like we have because there are so many areas that we are divided as a state, but this seems like one thing where we have a lot of support,” says Armmirante."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/feb/22/winter-olympics-womens-figure-skating-free-program-mirai-nagasu-scores","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T05:08:05Z","webTitle":"Winter Olympics women's figure skating: 15-year-old Alina Zagitova wins gold – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/feb/22/winter-olympics-womens-figure-skating-free-program-mirai-nagasu-scores","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/feb/22/winter-olympics-womens-figure-skating-free-program-mirai-nagasu-scores","fields":{"headline":"Winter Olympics women's figure skating: 15-year-old Alina Zagitova wins gold – as it happened","bodyText":"You can read a full report from today’s action here: And follow the remainder of the day’s action in Pyeongchang here: But let’s be clear about one thing. You can break out all the spreadsheets you want. (I finally closed mine.) You may hear some grumbling that the Russian skaters gamed the system. Here’s the bottom line: The Russian skaters executed. So did Osmond, and so did the Japanese skaters. The Americans did not. Each of the three skaters made significant errors. Tennell and Chen will surely be back. They’ll have some work to do. And maybe there’s an 11-year-old American out there ready to be a 15-year-old gold medalist like Alina Zagitova. This time belongs to Zagitova, Medvedeva and Osmond. And they deserve it. So is that it? We’re done? Awww. Thanks to everyone for reading and for the email and Twitter encouragement. This has been a great ride. Follow me at @duresport, where you’ll see entirely too much nonsense about soccer but also an alert when I’ll be back in the Guardian live-blogging seat again. Good night, all. My favorite email comment comes from one Jean Wan, who suggests a cap on jump bonuses: “Cause what I’m watching now ain’t skating. It’s ice hurdles.” And yes, if you were to show Zagitova’s program and Medvedeva’s program to a group of people without explaining the math, I think 90 percent of people would say Medvedeva’s was better. The ISU will need to tweak some things. Zagitova (OAR), 239.57 Medvedeva (OAR), 238.26 Osmond (Canada), 231.02 Medvedeva actually tied Zagitova in the free skate, each with 156.65. The short program makes the difference. The veteran Kostner (Italy), in her fourth Olympics, takes fifth. The Americans are ninth (Tennell), 10th (Nagasu) and 11th (Chen). The required change of pace in the music works for her. It switches to some piano chords with a distinctive rhythm, and she plays to it well. She lands a couple of flawless combos and a dazzling sequence of spins. Artistically, she’s light years ahead of Zagitova. (Yes, I realize I’m saying that after not liking the music in the first half of the program. That’s how good the second half was.) It’s going to be 1-2 for Olympic Athletes of Russia. We’ll see about the order. She’s only 18. She’s the two-time defending world champion. She’s battling a fellow Russian who’s even younger, and we’re hearing stories from the broadcast crew of upcoming juniors who sound like the next Nuke Laloosh. (Watch Bull Durham, even if you don’t like baseball.) She lands an early unplanned combo. The music from Anna Karenina frankly seems distracting to me. That previous personal best again: 142.34. The new personal best: 152.15. With Evgenia Medvedeva the last skater left, the podium places are: Zagitova (OAR), 239.57 Osmond (Canada), 231.02 Miyahara (Japan), 222.38 Osmond will get a medal. Osmond’s triple flip draws an ovation. Then she hits a triple-double-double. Then the double axel. This is going to be close. She’s skating to Swan Lake and it works. Riveting program. Huge roar from the crowd. This has to be ahead of Miyahara, right? Osmond also lands the double axel-triple toe. But she steps out of the landing on a triple lutz. Is that too much of a mistake to overcome? By the way, I do see all the email flying in, and thanks very much. I’ll answer some a bit later. She needs 160.71 for the lead and 143.52 to move into second and clinch a medal. Her personal best is 142.34. Bang. Triple flip-triple toe. Game on. Zagitova’s technical score smashes the 80-point mark. This isn’t even the same sport as what we saw in the first group here. Free skate score: 156.65, just shy of her personal best of 158.08. Zagitova (OAR), 239.57 Miyahara (Japan), 222.38 Kostner (Italy), 212.44 Double axel-triple toeloop, check. Triple flip-double toe-double loop, check. Triple lutz, check, and she adds the triple loop she abandoned earlier. So she’s on course. There’s apparently music playing and choreography to consider, but that hardly seems to matter. Zagitova is just 15. She’s the European champion and the Grand Prix Final champion. She won the World Junior Championship last year. Into the jumps we go ... Triple lutz-triple loop ... no! Just the triple lutz. And she won’t be jumping for a while because she’s putting all the jumps she can into the second half of the program for the bonus. So just enjoy Don Quixote and a few spins. Miyahara (Japan), 222.38 Kostner (Italy), 212.44 Sakamoto (Japan), 209.71 I don’t know how Sakamoto only got 136.53 on the free skate, barely ahead of Sotskova, but there you go. The Americans are now 6-7-8. And here we go ... Sakamoto doesn’t have the artistry in my stubbornly subjective opinion. But she makes every jump looks easy -- until a triple loop with an awkward landing. She has a personal best of 142.87. She won’t get that, but she’ll probably bump past Kostner into second with the big three to go. Japan’s Kaori Sakamoto is skating to ... a bunch of glockenspiels. She lands a triple flip-triple toe with little difficulty. (I know -- easy for me to say.) She may improve on her sixth-place finish at the Winter Youth Olympics in 2016. She was third in the World Junior Championships in 2017. Kostner gets a 139.29 in the free skate, 212.44 overall. Podium with four skaters to go: Miyahara (Japan), 222.38 Kostner (Italy), 212.44 Choi (South Korea), 199.26 Italy’s Carolina Kostner isn’t just the second skater to skate to Debussy today. She’s a four-time Olympian with a bronze medal from Sochi and a world championship in 2012. But she doesn’t have the leaping ability to match the Russian skaters (or the Japanese or the Americans). So a stumble on the landing of a triple loop, causing her to cancel the second part of the combo, will be costly. She’s simply not landing very well. She fights her way through a combination, and she’s only going to land two combos while others land three. But it’s all very pretty. And you have to be impressed that she has managed to hang on with all these young spring-loaded skaters bouncing onto the scene. And it’s a new personal best of 146.44. The total is 222.38. Tons of pressure on Canada’s Osmond now and maybe even on the OAR skaters. Japan’s Satoko Miyahara shouldn’t be overlooked. She came in her in fourth place. Her personal best in the free skate is higher than Osmond’s. And she simply came out and did everything she planned to do with very little in question. Her technical score is by far the best we’ve seen, and it’s a good-looking program. She punches the air when she finishes. And the judges aren’t finding anything to downgrade. We have a contender. I’ve added up the base value of the planned jumps for the top three in the standings and the three Americans: Nagasu 52.1 Zagitova 46.1 Tennell 45.1 Osmond 44.4 Medvedeva 43.9 Chen 43.9 I haven’t figured in the 10 percent bonus for jumps in the second half of the program. Assume that’ll add 3-5 points to Zagitova’s total. So it’s not as if what the Russians are doing is simply unbeatable. Nagasu could certainly match their jumps. It just didn’t happen tonight, and it hasn’t happened for U.S. skaters in quite a while. I did miscalculate about the top 10. With Daleman falling down the standings (currently ninth, likely to finish 15th), the USA will get two and possible three skaters in the top 10. But it’ll take some major mistakes by the last group to get anyone higher than ninth. Current standings with six skaters to go: Choi (South Korea), 131.49 / 199.26, up from 8th Sotskova (OAR), 134.24 / 198.10, up from 12th Tennell (USA), 128.34 / 192.35, up from 11th Nagasu (USA), 119.61 / 186.54, had been ninth Chen (USA), 119.75 / 185.65, had been 10th Then it’s a long way back to Tursynbaeva (Kazakhstan), who’s likely to finish 12th. Then Kim (South Korea), Rajicova (Slovakia) and the unfortunate Daleman (Canada) just ahead of Hendrickx (Belgium) and Craine (Australia). The good news: Nagasu was terrific in the team event. She landed the triple axel and racked up 137.53 points in that free skate. The bad news: After finishing fourth in the Olympics as a 16-year-old in 2010, her return to the women’s event has not gone well. This is a 119.61. Total of 186.54, taking the place between Tennell and Chen. The commentary crew speculates about the possibility of turning a double axel, the lead jump of a combination of three, into a triple axel. She does not. Her technical score has a big 0.00 by the first element. Then a triple lutz-triple toe combination becomes a single lutz. This is officially a wipeout for the USA. Might not get a skater in the top 10. The triple axel is up first. She’s 1-for-2, and ... She’s 1-for-3. Didn’t even come close. She did a half-revolution instead of three and a half. That’s 8.5 points gone. Choi moves into first place with a personal-best 131.49 in the free skate and a total of 199.26. Weir thinks he spotted an underrotation the judges missed. Choi makes up for the missing half of the combination late in the program, and it’s very good. She was eighth coming into the free skate. You don’t suppose she could sneak up on the podium, do you? It would still take some mistakes by those ahead of her, but this is a pretty good effort. Her triple lutz-triple toe-double toe is checking in at 13.16 points, which is the highest element score I can recall so far today. South Korea’s Dabin Choi gets the expected home-ice roar. But she only does half of her opening triple-triple. Nails the double axel-triple toe, though, and it’s a stirring program to music from Doctor Zhivago. The crowd is clapping along. Not quite in rhythm. That’s not going to help. Daleman breaks out in tears at the finish. Let’s not even mention her score until the end of Group 3. You don’t get a World Championship medal on a fluke. She’s terrific. This wasn’t her day. The crowd is groaning now, then cheering her on. She’s fallen twice more. The 2017 World Championship bronze medalist is having a nightmare skate. The rest of this will be for pride. And it’s Rhapsody in Blue. Nice. She opens with a triple toe-triple toe. She adds a rotation after she lands, which is probably a mistake, even though she made it look cool. Then she falls on the triple lutz. And stumbles a bit on a triple flip. The music seems to be mocking her. Tennell’s personal best would put her in first place. She probably won’t get that, given the stumble on the combo. That jump and the next one get marked down as underrotated. A triple lutz has a base value of 6.0, and she gets marked down to 2.72. Might as well have fallen. Oops ... 2.62. These judges are probably still finding ways to mark down Michelle Kwan’s free skate from 2002. Scores are: 128.34 for the free skate, 192.35 total. Behind Sotskova, ahead of Chen. The choreography to music from Cinderella simply works. She stumbles a bit on the second half of a double axel-triple toe combination but remains upright. Then she puts a hand down on her next jump but rallies with a strong three-jump combo. The rest of them are pretty good as well, and the spins are world-class. She was brilliant in the national championships. She never ever falls, except in the short program. Bang. That’s how you do a triple-triple, folks. She never quite managed to add in that remaining combination jump, which basically means she did one fewer jump than planned. By my figuring, the jumps she wound up doing are worth about five points fewer than what she had planned, and the execution wasn’t great. The fall is a mandatory point off. Incidentally, I’m getting some email in response to my Weir and Lipinski “greatest cultural export” comments. One person agrees wholeheartedly. Another is aggressively ... well, rude. Chen gets a 119.75 in the free skate. She falls behind Sotskova overall. Chen looks a bit like she’s doing semaphore in her spin. But those are solid Level 4s. The jumps, though, just aren’t cutting it. They’re getting yellow boxes for “review this.” And then she outright falls. She’s 10th after the short program. She was supposed to start with a triple/triple, but her landing on the first doesn’t inspire confidence to do the second. Still, missing the back half of a combination isn’t that bad -- it can be added in. Much more difficult when a triple becomes a double. So she’s OK so far. Sotskova: 134.24, total of 198.10. Chen needs a personal best just to beat that. It’s a beautiful program. She has green dots across the board, though her step sequence is only Level 3 and she popped one jump (double instead of triple). You’d hate to be the one to follow that. Oh, hello, Karen Chen! OAR’s Maria Sotskova looks terrified as she takes the ice. But the triple lutz-triple toe lands, the latter with her arm over her head for added difficulty. Showoff. Then a triple flip looks flawless. And she’s skating to Debussy, so this is an improvement all around from most of our previous skaters. Everyone ready for the final 12? There should be a big split in scores between the top 12 and bottom 12. But you never know. If you’re in the United States, switch from NBCSN to NBC now to watch. If you’re not in the United States, our apologies that you can’t hear Johnny Weir and Tara Lipinski. They’re probably our best cultural exports right now. With Group 1 skaters mixed in if they moved up. Actually, they all did -- Williams dropped all the way from 17th after the short program to the end of the line and a presumptive 24th. I’m also adding their places after the short program to show the movement here. Big shakeup here. Tursynbaeva will finish at least 13th. Tursynbaeva (Kazakhstan), 118.30 / 177.12, 15th Kim (South Korea), Group 1 / 175.71, 21st Rajicova (Slovakia), 114.60 / 175.19, 13th Hendrickx (Belgium), Group 1 / 171.88, 20th Craine (Australia), 111.84 / 168.61, 16th Schott (Germany), 109.26 / 168.46, 14th Meite (France), Group 1 / 159.92, 22nd Peltonen (Finland), 101.86 / 157.14, 18th Paganini (Switzerland), Group 1 / 156.26, 19th Li (China), Group 1 / 154.43, 24th Toth (Hungary), Group 1 / 150.43, 23rd Williams (Brazil), 88.44 / 144.18, 17th (No, this will not be restated later. Bookmark it now.) Brazil’s Isadora Williams, like me, is from Georgia. The one in the United States. She trains in New Jersey. Her personal best in the free skate is only 100.77, lowest among the 24 skaters here. But it’s a fun program for the first half. Now a bunch of jumps in the second half. A triple lutz is all out of sorts, and she tumbles to the ice. Then a triple salchow turns into a single. She tries to tack on a combination on her next jump, and it’s awkward. Her technical box is a sea of red. That’s a pity. She’s the last of Group 2, so we’ll check the scores ... Slovakia’s Nicole Rajicova went to Fordham and trains in Hackensack-ack-ack-ack-ack. You oughta know by now. Weir spots a mistake on her spin, and she has a lot of yellow boxes for elements under review. But it’s clean, and this one ... please make sure you’re sitting down ... actually fits the music. Not bad at all. Her personal best would put her in first place right now. The technical panel is throwing darts at her scores, though, and she gets a 114.60 and a total of 175.19. She mutters something in Slovak. Third place for now, finally breaking up the Kim-Hendrickx duo in the standings. Germany’s Nicole Schott shares a coach with Carolina Kostner, who is skating later and has been skating as long as I can remember. I think she finished between Nancy and Tonya. OK, not that long ago, but a while. She gets through her first three jumps but with some issues. She seemed off balance at her first jump. Then she put a hand down on a triple flip and didn’t do the double toe that was supposed to follow. Her personal best would put her in second place for now. Those early errors will probably rule that out. She does add a combination toward the end. It’s not working for me. The music is a weepy violin from the Schindler’s List soundtrack, and it’s awfully hard to put that together with some shaky jumps and exuberant spins. Scores: 109.26, 168.46. So if you remember Group 1 -- Kim and Hendrickx are surging up the standings. Which is funny, because I was once in a musical ensemble with a woman named Kim Hendrix. She was a talented flute and piccolo player. I stood at the back and hit things. She underrotates a triple lutz, but everything else here looks pretty good. Level 4s on all her spins. Johnny Weir and Tara Lipinski don’t think the music suits her. I’ve seen worse. Waaaaay worse. Weir and Lipinski are geniuses, but we’re going to have a chat about music at some point. Whoa ... her technical scores just plummeted under review. Still Level 4 on spins, but she’s getting dinged on a lot of her jumps. Still, it’s a seasonal best 111.84 and a total of 168.61. Fourth place for now. Australian Keilani Craine looks pumped. It’s Moulin Rouge time. Finland’s Emmi Peltonen is also 18. She was born in Nashville. Does anyone ever skate to country music? I’d love to hear some bluegrass now. She starts with a triple-triple and almost falls on the second part. Then she does fall on a triple lutz. That’s two red boxes on the technical score. Her personal best of 107.05 wouldn’t get her into the top three so far, and neither will this. She turns a triple flip into a single, which gets a desultory 0.51 points on the running technical score. More egregious: This is entirely too much Barbra Streisand. It’s Papa Can You Hear Me from Yentl. On the bright side, she’s a third-generation Finnish Olympian. Her father and grandfather were ice hockey players. Score is 101.86. Total is 157.14, dropping her well down the standings. Kazakhstan’s Elizabet Tursynbaeva is one of many current Olympians coached by the great Brian Orser. Tara Lipinski tells us she has a hip injury. Her triple loop is fine, but her triple lutz deposits her on her backside. She rallies with a nice triple-triple, then a double axel-triple toe. Then a double axel-double toe-double toe. That’s a lot of takeoffs and landings. They should just call that a Hartsfield or Heathrow. Her spins getting Level 3 marks until she finishes with a nice Level 4. She’s in the 60s for technical marks, and it’s really hard not to root for her. Amusing glitch in the feed. I’m getting the audio of an ad for That 70s Show but the video for an Advil ad. I always thought it was a pretty good show. Anyway, Tursynbaeva makes Orser laugh in the kiss and cry. She gets a 118.30 in the free skate, 177.12 overall. Her mom spins and waves to the crowd. Johnny Weir calls her one of his favorite skate moms. That was fun. Just learned something from the expanded broadcast feed ... Jumps in ascending order of point value: Toe loop, salchow, loop, flip, lutz, axel. Kim (South Korea), 121.38 / 175.71 Hendrickx (Belgium), 116.72 / 171.88 Meite (France), 106.25 / 159.92 Paganini (Switzerland), 101.00 / 156.26 Li (China), 101.97 / 154.43 Toth (Hungary) 97.21 / 150.43 Toth did not look pleased after swapping places with Li. Paganini dropped three whole places. Kim moved up two. Quick break for Group 2 warmups. More math ahead. Hungary’s Ivett Toth skated to AC/DC in the short program. Here, it’s Carmen, and she has a flashy red dress and some sultry moves. She’s no Elizabeth Swaney, that’s for sure. That would be an interesting program. No triple jumps. A bunch of Level 1 spins. Unfortunately, Toth hits the ice twice. She does land a triple-single-triple combo. Then a triple salchow-double axel, which seems like it should have a much higher base value than it does. She gives a bit of a grimace when she finishes. That’s the end of Group 1, so it’s time for a scoreboard check ... China’s Li Xiangning is 17 years old, so you could call this a good chance to impress the national federation before Beijing hosts in four years. The spins look nice, though one is only Level 3. The jumps aren’t as fluid as the others, and her technical score is trending about 10 points off the lead. 101.97 in the free skate, 154.43 overall. She was 24th coming into the free skate and will most likely stay there unless Hungary’s Ivett Toth, who’s next, struggles. Leslie Jones enjoyed Kim’s program: South Korea’s Kim Hanul skates to Mamma Mia just after we saw an ad for the same. Synergy. She planned to start with a triple lutz, then a double axel. Just for fun, she added a triple toeloop on each one. That’s good, because she has rough landing on a the first of a planned triple-double-double combo. So it all evens out, sort of. And she messes with us again at the end, turning a double axel-triple toeloop into a double axel-double toeloop-double loop combo. Her technical score is close to Hendrickx’s, but that program just didn’t seem all that interesting. She smashes her personal best by nearly 10 points to vault ahead of Hendrickx. OK, then. France’s Mae Berenice Meite skated to Beyonce in the short program. Here, it’s Chopin. She skips the second half of a triple-triple combo, but a spin that slows down with the music is a beautiful effect. She’s one of the skaters with a “costume change,” peeling back part of her skirt to reveal some bedazzled stuff underneath. That’s after the Chopin ends, of course. Bedazzling and Chopin would just seem weird. It’s bouncy music, but she clatters to the ice on a triple lutz attempt. Fun program, but she’s not going to catch Hendrickx. It’s a 106.25, 159.92 overall, ahead of Paganini (who was one place ahead of her after the short program). Belgium’s Loena Hendrickx probably expected to be higher than 20th after the short program. She starts with four jumping elements, including a triple-double combo, and lands everything cleanly. Her spins are far more refined that Paganini’s, getting Level 4 grading (the top) across the board. She’ll be higher than 20th by the end of the night, certainly. She gets 116.72, actually a few points shy of her personal best. These judges seem tough. Maybe I’ll do some math to figure out why. She did step out awkwardly after one jump, but still. 171.88 total, easily ahead of Paganini. Switzerland’s Alexia Paganini is skating to a selection from Phantom of the Opera. She’s a 16-year-old from Connecticut who just switched her nationality to her father’s country. She lands her triple lutz-triple toe combination to start, but she singles a double axel to start her next element. Then she lands a triple-double. That’s a lot of jumping in the first minute of the program. She has another big clump of jumps just after the halfway point for the scoring bonus (jumps in the second half of the program are bumped up 10 percent, which is why the OAR skaters will do very little until then). It’s clean. Her technical score is in the low 50s. Total for the free skate is 101.00, close to her personal best. Total total is 156.26. She’s in first place. Only 23 skaters to go! Everyone ready? Here we go ... We’ll start in about 10 minutes, which will be 8:08 p.m. ET. The rest of these times are also ET.

(Go to bed.) But first, the music ... Best selections and their place in the start order: 4. Kim Hanul, South Korea -- soundtrack from Mamma Mia 16. Gabrielle Daleman, Canada -- Rhapsody in Blue Skating to Moulin Rouge 9. Kailani Crane, Australia (That’s it? Just one this time?) Skating to Debussy 13. Maria Sotskova, OAR -- Clair de Lune 20. Carolina Kostner, Italy -- L’apres-midi d’un faune There is NO, repeat, NO Coldplay in this free skate. And if you’d like to do the math for yourself, check out ISU Communication 2089 on base values. Then compare that to the planned programs. Watching NBC’s “pregame” show with Scott Hamilton and Tanith White (formerly Tanith Belbin). White is going over base values for the planned elements and explaining the math behind the OAR skaters’ advantages. I’ve seen economic professors who provide much less clarity to much less complex topics. NBC’s crew is really good. But I never want to see any of these ads ever again. Ever. Memory lane ... Barenaked Ladies teaching Canadian skater Jamie Sale (2002 Winter Olympics judging controversy) how to play guitar. Good evening/morning/afternoon everybody. Yes, I’m feeling a little sad already. This is the last session of competitive figure skating in these Olympics and therefore our last live figure skating blog for a while. We’ll have the World Championships next month in Milan, but that’s not quite the same. So let’s enjoy these four hours or so of figure skating. Let’s not worry so much about the fact that the top two are virtually untouchable unless they fall like me on a ski slope. Just enjoy. I’ll be here to talk you through it. Skating starts in about an hour."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/23/morning-mail-toxic-mould-crisis-on-nauru-revealed","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T19:47:53Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: toxic mould crisis on Nauru revealed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/23/morning-mail-toxic-mould-crisis-on-nauru-revealed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/23/morning-mail-toxic-mould-crisis-on-nauru-revealed","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: toxic mould crisis on Nauru revealed","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 23 Ferbruary. Top stories The Australian government was repeatedly warned over the last four years that mould growing throughout Nauru’s regional processing centres was making people sick, but refugee families, including young children, are still being forced to live under rotting canvas in Nauru. At least 330 refugees and asylum seekers, including 36 children, live in mould-prone tents on Nauru. Some tents and work buildings have previously been found to be “highly toxic”, with the level of mould measured at up to 76 times the safe level. At least a dozen former staff who have worked in the regional processing centre are understood to have developed conditions from exposure to mould. The conditions include toxic mould syndrome, cognitive and neurological symptoms, chronic pain and chest infections. A class action against the commonwealth government, for failing in its duty of care to those housed in its immigration centres, and those contracted to work there, is being considered by Australian law firms. Thousands of refugees and staff may have been exposed to toxic mould. The health impacts could last years and any damages payout could run to millions of dollars, a source close to government told the Guardian. The Department of Home Affairs rejects the allegations, telling the Guardian there had been “no cases of anyone developing health issues following exposure to mould at the Nauru RPC”. The deputy executive director of Unicef Justin Forsyth has quit in the wake of accusations of inappropriate behaviour towards female staff while chief executive of Save the Children. It emerged this week that Forsyth was accused of sending inappropriate texts and making comments to female staff about their appearance while heading the charity in 2011 and 2015. Forsyth said: “I want to make clear I am not resigning from Unicef because of the mistakes I made at Save the Children. They were dealt with through a proper process many years ago. I apologised unreservedly at the time and face to face. I apologise again.” Tesla’s big battery in South Australia is consistently working to serve the peak energy demand each day, taking the “straw off the camel’s back,” according to the Australia Institute’s latest national energy emissions audit. Energy expert Hugh Saddler examined its consumption and output of electricity. He found a consistent pattern of the battery charging overnight when wind generation was abundant and cheap, and discharging into the grid during the late afternoon when demand and spot market prices reached peak levels. Only 30% of the battery’s 100MW capacity was devoted to this sort of trading, the rest stabilises the energy system by maintaining the frequency of the grid at the required 50Hz and 240 volts. Saddler said it demonstrated the valuable role energy storage could play in the system. The head of the US National Rifle Association (NRA) has broken his silence, with a bitter attack on gun control advocates, accusing them of exploiting the tragedy to push their agenda. Wayne LaPierre, whose lobby group faces an unprecedented challenge from the activism of students, slammed his opponents as “elites” and “socialists” hellbent on undermining Americans’ constitutional rights. “The elites don’t care not one whit about America’s school system and schoolchildren,” he said. “If they truly cared, what they would do is they would protect them. For them, it’s not a safety issue, it’s a political issue.” Labor has pledged a major review of tertiary education if elected and “wants prospective students to see Tafe and uni as equally attractive study options”. Tanya Plibersek, Labor’s education spokeswoman, says it would be the first time a national inquiry has put Tafe and universities on an equal footing. Plibersek said there was much more that could be done to capitalise on the strengths of universities and Tafes. Sport A pivotal year lies ahead as Super Rugby seeks to emerge from troubled waters after a disastrous 2017. The new 15-team format is no panacea for the competition’s ills, but at least it is keeping the patient alive until a remedy is found, argues Bret Harris. Tonight, Carlton and the Western Bulldogs meet at Whitten Oval for the AFLW’s first pride game. “Lots of LGBTI people love footy, but footy hasn’t always loved us,” Bulldogs fan Wil Stracke tells Guardian Australia ahead of the match, which is helping break down multiple barriers of discrimination. Thinking time Dmitri Shostakovich’s 1928 opera, The Nose, has been brought back to life at the Sydney Opera House by Australian director Barrie Kosky. The opera follows a social climbing civil servant who one morning wakes up sans nose. Sliced off accidentally by a drunken barber it grows in size to human proportions. Soon it is independent and strutting around St Petersburg. To add insult to (literal) injury, “nosey”, seems to command more respect, and have more status, than himself. But just as Shostakovich divided opinion during his lifetime – he was twice denounced by the Soviet authorities and his works banned – The Nose continues to provoke strong reactions with audiences. With a rapidly changing media environment, Margaret Simons asks why has no government taken investigations into the future of journalism seriously. Traditional funding models are dead. Power is shifting from media barons to internet behemoths, and Canberra fiddles while journalism burns. Neither side of politics has given any thought to what a modern, fit-for-purpose system of media regulation might look like, let alone what enlightened industry policy is needed to ensure that the bedrock of democracy – an informed citizenry – survives into the future. Spread over two night’s, SBS’s Muslims Like Us grouped a bunch of Australian Muslims together to live in a house for eight days. The housemates spanned political viewpoints and sexual identities, with their own interpretations of Islam – but, dominated by Sunni voices, the show failed to capture the full complexities of modern Islam. “Oh well,” writes Ruby Hamad, “there is always next season.” What’s he done now? Donald Trump has again talked about arming US teachers with guns so they can shoot back if a student starts firing. He has also congratulated the National Rifle Association for being “great people. “History shows that a school shooting lasts, on average, 3 minutes. It takes police &amp; first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. Highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive. GREAT DETERRENT!” Trump tweeted. Media roundup The Herald Sun splashes with the headline Wild Turkeys, revealing details of a dining room stoush that has plunged the state’s Labor party into crisis. The paper reports that sports minister John Eren accused fellow MP Adem Somyurek of threatening him with a butter knife during a heated exchange in their native Turkish in a private dining room on Wednesday night. The former Australian ambassador to the US Kim Beazley has said Trump’s plan to arm teachers is “nuts”, reports the ABC. And at the Conversation Michelle Grattan accuses the Nationals of being “paralysed” over the the unpredictable Barnaby Joyce. Coming up Malcolm Turnbull will meet Donald Trump on Friday in the US and the two will hold a joint press conference in the east room of the White House. The drawing of nominations in the Batman byelection will take place with final candidates due to be confirmed. Labor faces a strong challenge from the Greens to retain the inner-city Melbourne seat at the 17 March poll.

The relationship between award-winners and cultural excellence has always been coincidental, at best. How else to explain why How Green Was My Valley, not Citizen Kane, won the 1942 Oscar? How the Emmys managed to completely overlook The Wire for five whole seasons? Or the fact that, in 2014, Macklemore beat Kendrick Lamar to the best rap album Grammy? Based on the list of nominees for the 2018 Oscars – or, as Chris Rock once called them, “the White People’s Choice Awards” – change is afoot, however. This year, films such as Get Out, Jordan Peele’s horror-satire of white liberal racism, the gorgeous gay romance Call Me By Your Name, and the low-key mother-daughter relationship drama Lady Bird sit alongside the more traditional Oscar bait, such as The Post’s Hanks-Streep-Spielberg triumvirate and a fat suit-donning Gary Oldman. It is the mark of an institution in transition. Where the Academy Awards lead, other awards shows follow, albeit more slowly. This year’s Grammys pulled off one of the most moving manifestations yet of #MeToo power, in Kesha’s live performance of Praying, but its reputation is far from restored. There have been public boycotts by Drake, Frank Ocean and Kanye West (who once called the show, “completely out of touch”); this year’s no-shows (Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber) may have been circumstantial, but could suggest that its importance is waning. It is clear that, aside from awards responding to a wave of excellent artistic output, audience dissatisfaction has prompted part of this shift. In 2016, the Emmys broadcast ratings sank to an all-time low, with TV viewers deciding they would rather watch a grim documentary about murdered child JonBenét Ramsey than admire the stars’ couture gowns. That same year also saw record ratings dips for the Oscars, Grammys and MTV VMAs. The real insult came in February of that year, when YouGov released the results of a poll asking 1,000 Americans which of the Oscars, Emmys and Grammys they were most interested in. A whopping 68% choose the fourth option: “I don’t care about any of them”. However, the awards show cul de sac also seems to have contained the seeds of its tentative regrowth. Around 2013, the TV networks began to notice that Twitter had created an incentive for audiences to tune in to live events (awards shows included) by allowing viewers to get involved in their own play-by-play commentary. The ratings bump was fleeting, but the issues raised in such tweet-along conversations proved to have more momentum. Why didn’t awards shows reflect the diversity of audiences, #OscarsSoWhite wanted to know? Why, in the era of Wonder Woman, Fleabag and Rihanna were women still so under-represented and their alleged abusers so often celebrated? In January 2016, in response to these criticisms and others, the Oscars’ Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences overhauled its membership and voting rules, and the results may already be apparent. “For two years running, we’ve seen major upsets in the best picture category,” says Guy Lodge, chief UK film critic at Variety. “In both cases it was the smaller, more socially conscious drama [Spotlight and Moonlight] triumphing against the bigger, more escapist spectacle [The Revenant and La La Land]. I don’t think that’s accidental: the Academy’s younger members – and the membership has had a major demographic shift, racially and generationally, in the last few years – seem to be conscious of rewarding the film that wears its politics more conscientiously, that attempts to say something a little more challenging about modern America.” Each awards show seems to have reached a different stage in its evolution towards relevance, but all are now open forums for political statements of some kind. In the past, when Marlon Brando sent Native American rights activist Sacheen Littlefeather to the stage (1973); or when Vanessa Redgrave criticised “Zionist hoodlums” in 1978; or when Michael Moore protested against the Iraq war in 2003, their speeches elicited as many boos as cheers from the audience. When, during the 1975 Academy Awards, a winning producer read out a statement critical of the Vietnam war, co-host Frank Sinatra felt the need to issue an apology and disavowal from the same podium. Now, it seems that taking a strong stand on the issues of the day is as much a professional obligation as meeting the press. Just ask those few women who were foolhardy enough to ignore the Time’s Up all-black dress code at this year’s Golden Globes or Baftas. “The commitment to Times Up and #MeToo is admirable, but there is a lot of work to do.” Holly Tarquini The Hollywood iterations of #MeToo and Time’s Up were, of course, instigated by the multiple allegations of sexual misconduct against Harvey Weinstein, but it is an uncomfortable irony that he set Oscars change in motion in other, intentional ways. Miramax and, later, the Weinstein Company pioneered an aggressive style of campaigning for Academy votes. This involved negative whispering campaigns against rival nominees, plus Weinstein personally pressurising talent into relentless media meet-and-greet schedules. It was effective enough to steer the forgettable likes of Shakespeare in Love (1999) and The King’s Speech (2011) to best picture glory and help redefine the Academy’s notion of an Oscar-worthy film in ways that have likely benefitted several of this year’s nominees. So, while the Academy took the unusual step of expelling Weinstein last November – and he may even be repudiated by name at this year’s ceremony – that is no guarantee that the tactics he pioneered won’t continue behind the scenes. For all the attention that #MeToo and Time’s Up in particular have garnered, Hollywood stars are still relatively new to agitating for change. More experienced activists in the arts are divided over how far-reaching this movement will be. “I’m looking forward to the next step, when all of the female stars arrive at awards ceremonies in tracksuit bottoms, flat shoes and hoodies in defiance of being clothes horses,” says Holly Tarquini, executive director of Bath film festival and founder of the F-Rating system that allows viewers to support the work of women in film. “The commitment to Time’s Up and #MeToo is admirable, but there is a lot of work to do.” Andrea Holley, strategic director of the Human Rights Watch film festival also agrees that the badges, black dresses and big speeches must be followed up with sustained action. “If there is one thing you learn at Human Rights Watch, it is that lasting change takes time,” she says. “One female best director nominee? Not impressive. [And this] does not even touch on the question of where trans or gender-nonconfirming individuals fit into the current framework. See any nominees who identify as people with disabilities? I know that when enough allies use their privilege to leverage the system, we will see a difference.” So, how much have awards shows changed? The fiasco of the best picture award announcement at the 2017 Oscars was always destined to go down in history, right from the moment Warren Beatty first looked askance at that envelope. Yet it won’t be until after this year’s 90th ceremony (and perhaps after the 91st, 92nd and 93rd) that we’ll really know the reason why. Will the Moonlight v La La Land mixup be remembered as a highly embarrassing snafu? Or will it become known as the moment when awards shows finally matured into relevance? The time when the entertainment industry learned to recognise the merit of an independently produced, gay coming-of-age drama with a mostly African-American cast over the self-flattering charms of a Hollywood-celebrating Hollywood musical? Bringing change to awards shows may turn out to be the easy bit. It’s what happens next in the culture they represent that really matters.

The British driver won his fourth Formula One world title last year, equalling Vettel, after a tense struggle with the German, who led the championship until the 13th race at Monza, where Hamilton took top spot and held it until claiming the title five races later in Mexico. The pair had mutual respect until Vettel barged Hamilton at Baku. The Briton described it as disgraceful and later privately warned Vettel that should he repeat it they would have problems. When asked how he foresaw their rivalry this season, Hamilton issued a further note of caution. “You have to expect it could be worse,” he said at the launch of the Mercedes car at Silverstone. “Expect the worst and hopefully it will be better. This year, given the fact it is going to be a closer season, we have no idea what we are going to face. Last year was a positive year in handling the different situations that I faced and I will be even better this year. I am focused on making sure I perform at my best. Hopefully if I am performing at my best there will be issues – because they will be upset about it.” Anticipating what may prove to be another season with little to choose between the two drivers, Hamilton pointedly quipped: “I don’t play mindgames. I just drive faster.” Mercedes have won the past four drivers’ and constructors’ championships but though Hamilton won nine races and his team-mate Valtteri Bottas three in 2017, Ferrari were often a match, while Red Bull also ended 2017 strongly. Hamilton insisted Mercedes had worked hard over the winter to address problems that cost them at specific circuits but expect their rivals to have kept pace. “Given that we ended the season with Ferrari, Red Bull and ourselves very close, I anticipate this year will be quite similar,” he said. “I think we will see a tougher battle.” Ferrari, who launched their car at Maranello, will be optimistic they can surpass Mercedes. Vettel and Hamilton remain favourites for the title and both are in a position to equal Juan Manuel Fangio’s tally of five, the second highest behind Michael Schumacher’s seven. That Hamilton will try to achieve more with Mercedes seems likely to be confirmed shortly with the driver saying he expects to sign a new contract before the first race in Australia in March. The Mercedes executive director, Toto Wolff, has condemned the look of the halo cockpit safety device that the FIA has made mandatory. Integrating the halo, which adds 10kgand raises the centre of gravity, had been tricky but Wolff’s objection, shared by many, is that it has ruined the look of the car. “I’m not impressed with the whole thing,” he said. “If you gave me a chainsaw, I would take it off. We need to look after the drivers’ safety but what we have implemented is aesthetically not appealing. We need to tackle that and come up with a solution that looks better.” Fernando Alonso, meanwhile, expects McLaren to take a step forward this year after they unveiled their car for the new campaign. It sports a changed livery from last year’s design, with an all-orange bodywork and a blue front and rear wing. “I know just how important this car is to the team, and I just hope that it delivers in the way we all want it to,” said Alonso, who failed to finish more than half of the races last season. The new car is the first with a Renault engine after McLaren ended their association with Honda."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/04/katori-hall-writer-of-tina-turner-musical-on-metoo-diversity-and-inclusion","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T04:41:53Z","webTitle":"Katori Hall, writer of Tina Turner musical, on #MeToo, diversity and inclusion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/04/katori-hall-writer-of-tina-turner-musical-on-metoo-diversity-and-inclusion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/04/katori-hall-writer-of-tina-turner-musical-on-metoo-diversity-and-inclusion","fields":{"headline":"Katori Hall, writer of Tina Turner musical, on #MeToo, diversity and inclusion","bodyText":"While the arts has acknowledged its problem with diversity and talks about making things better, there remains a lack of action, according to the writer of the new musical about Tina Turner. Katori Hall, the American writer who won an Olivier for her debut play The Mountaintop, is back in the UK preparing for the world premiere in the West End of London of Tina Turner the Musical. Diversity and inclusion is one of the the most urgent debates in theatre and the arts more widely, but Hall fears it may not get beyond talking. “That requires a lot of giving up,” she said. “Giving up your seat to let people sit at the table who haven’t always been allowed to sit ... that’s often not on the stage, but where the decisions are made. That’s on the board. How many black artistic directors does the UK theatre scene have? I’m always asking, are we performing inclusion, are we performing diversity? Or are we actually doing it. Let’s see if the acknowledgment phase shifts through into the action phase.” Hall has written the book for a new show directed by Phyllida Lloyd, which tells the turbulent story of Turner. It starts with her troubled childhood, stardom and an abusive relationship with her husband, Ike; the wilderness years when she was performing at McDonald’s openings; and then her triumphant second act, becoming a superstar in her 40s. It is an inspiring story, Hall said. “Without Tina Turner there wouldn’t be a Beyoncé, there wouldn’t be a Rihanna, there wouldn’t be a Katy Perry. There wouldn’t be this shining example for so many young female performers and singers to look up to in the way she was so authentically herself.” Hall is as American as they come, born and raised in Memphis, Tennessee, about an hour away from Turner’s home town of Nutbush. Yet it is the UK that changed her life after the theatre director James Dacre asked if he could stage a play she sent him, at the tiny Theatre503 above a pub in Battersea, south London. The play, which starred David Harewood as Martin Luther King and Lorraine Burroughs as a hotel maid bringing him late-night coffee, won an Olivier for best new play. It transferred to the West End and, in 2011, Broadway with Samuel L Jackson and Angela Bassett as its stars. A first draft of the book for Tina Turner the Musical, by Frank Ketelaar and Kees Prins, already existed and she agreed to come on board to provide a new draft after being reassured she could tell the true story of Turner’s life, not a sugar-coated one. “This is a grown-up musical, this is not Phantom of the Opera,” she said. “We are really going to be brutally honest.” Lloyd is one of the UK’s most versatile and respected directors, with work that includes Mamma Mia! on stage and on screen, and her all-female Shakespeare trilogy at the Donmar. The show will feature the songs of Turner, but Hall uses the term bio-musical rather than jukebox musical. “Me and Phyllida we always say, we’re trying to do August Wilson and Beyoncé at the same time.” The show will not avoid the violence in Turner’s life, said Hall. “Understanding the roots of the cycle of violence is something that is very important to us and quite frankly, very important to Tina. She was like, ‘I don’t know if you’ll be able to do my life, I don’t want the Disney version’. I said ‘no, we’re giving you the Katori Hall version!’.” The show will star the American actor Adrienne Warren, making her West End debut, as Turner, and Kobna Holdbrook-Smith, last on stage as Laertes in Benedict Cumberbatch’s Hamlet at the Barbican, as her abusive husband, Ike. Hall said London was the perfect place for the show, given Turner’s huge fanbase. “If Broadway want it, they want it. We’ll see.” Hall, who is also developing a television version of her play Pussy Valley, about pole dancers at a Mississippi strip club, said there could be no better timing for the story of Turner’s life. “The #MeToo moment we are living in; a lot of women who are coming to terms with the intense oppression and sexism not only in the entertainment industry but in our world; the fact that so many women are standing up and saying this happened to me, too. I would say Tina was one of the first to start #MeToo, in that she was honest about the abuse she suffered and was willing to have people look at her life and how raw and vulnerable she was.” Just as the creative industries talk about the need for change around diversity, Hall said she worries about the same questions around #MeToo. “Will the acknowledgment shift into action to create a situation where women won’t have to be afraid? And if they do speak up something will be done, there will be consequences.” With Donald Trump in power she admitted: “I’m not holding my breath.” • Previews of Tina at the Aldwych theatre, London, begin on 21 March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/23/not-who-but-how-eu-split-over-choosing-juncker-successor","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T05:00:37Z","webTitle":"Not who but how: EU split over choosing Juncker successor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/23/not-who-but-how-eu-split-over-choosing-juncker-successor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/23/not-who-but-how-eu-split-over-choosing-juncker-successor","fields":{"headline":"Not who but how: EU split over choosing Juncker successor","bodyText":"It has been the talk of Brussels coffee bars for weeks, and now European leaders are gathering for a special summit to parse a troublesome question. No, it isn’t Brexit. It is the EU’s next jobs merry-go-round, starting with how to choose a successor to the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. The question is not yet who will replace Juncker, but how. EU leaders – minus Britain’s Theresa May – are meeting in Brussels on Friday and are expected to fight back against attempts by the European parliament to lay down the rules for choosing the next commission president. The two EU institutions are at odds over parliament’s push for a system that would tie the choice of commission president to the result of European elections. The parliament won round one in 2014, by devising a system under which each of the large pan-European political parties chose a “lead candidate” or spitzenkandidat to head the commission. The candidate of the group that won the most seats would be propelled into the top job at the EU’s executive, which drafts and enforces EU laws. The centre-right European People’s party (EPP) candidate, Jean-Claude Juncker, defeated his Socialist rival Martin Schulz in 2014 after the EPP emerged as the biggest party in that year’s elections. EU leaders were presented with a fait accompli and felt compelled to accept Juncker despite widespread concern that he was the wrong man for the job. Only David Cameron and his Hungarian counterpart, Viktor Orbán, voted against him, as other EU leaders worried they would be perceived as anti-democratic if they were to choose their own candidate. The European council president, Donald Tusk, does not want EU leaders to be outmanoeuvred by the parliament again. On Friday he will defend EU leaders’ right to choose Juncker’s successor as laid down in European treaties. “The European council cannot deprive itself of its prerogative to choose the person it proposes as president of the European commission without a change of the treaty,” he states in a letter to EU leaders. The EU treaty states that EU leaders choose the European commission president “taking into account the elections to the European parliament”, but the parliament must give its consent. Some senior EU diplomats think it is too late to reverse the spitzenkandidaten system, as any attempt to reject the lead candidate will be perceived as undemocratic. “The game is over,” said one senior diplomat, blaming EU leaders for not acting sooner in 2014. “They should have killed it then.” Others argue it is not too late for leaders to take charge of the process. The parliament argues the spitzenkandidaten process makes the EU more democratic by connecting it to citizens. Opponents think European elections, where turnout averaged 42.6% in 2014, fail to energise voters and see the process as a classic stitch-up between big groups. One of the biggest losers from the parliament’s preferred system would be the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who aspires to create a European equivalent to his En Marche! movement. He would struggle to break the stranglehold of the traditional parties if the spitzenkandidaten prevails. Macron, who is yet to affiliate with any of the pan-European political groups, also faced a setback in his ambition to create MEPs representing Europe when the European parliament itself rejected the idea earlier this month. MEPs voted down plans to use some of the 73 seats vacated by the departing British members to create transnational lists. EU leaders will also hold their first discussion on the EU’s next long-term budget, as they look to fill the €14bn black hole created by the UK’s departure. The next budget could be the most complex EU negotiation over money that has ever been undertaken in Brussels. Countries must reconcile the loss of British funds with ambitions to preserve traditional spending on farming and regional aid,and increase spending on migration and defence. Also on the table are numerous ideas to make EU funds conditional on good behaviour, from respecting migration quotas to adhering to the rule or law. EU leaders will not, however, get into the technical weeds on Friday, ahead of a formal proposal from the commission in May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/22/russian-arrested-over-euro-2016-attack-that-left-england-fan-in-coma","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T20:50:18Z","webTitle":"Russian arrested over Euro 2016 attack that left England fan in coma","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/22/russian-arrested-over-euro-2016-attack-that-left-england-fan-in-coma","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/22/russian-arrested-over-euro-2016-attack-that-left-england-fan-in-coma","fields":{"headline":"Russian arrested over Euro 2016 attack that left England fan in coma","bodyText":"A Russian man has been arrested on suspicion of causing serious injuries to an English football fan who was left in a coma after riots which blighted Euro 2016. The 31-year-old was arrested at a German airport while in transit to Spain to watch Spartak Moscow play Athletic Bilbao in the Europa League. He faces up to 15 years in jail in France for attempted homicide and grievous bodily harm. The alleged victim is understood by the Guardian to be Andrew Bache, a Portsmouth resident who was 51 when he was among those attacked during the tournament two years ago. Bache, affectionately known as the “Pepe of Pompey”, sustained severe brain injuries and had to be placed in an induced coma, from which he has only recently emerged. He was left bloodied on a pavement and fighting for his life when clashes broke out between fans before England’s opening game in Marseille. He has no recollection of the attack and now lives in a self‑contained flat where he is relearning how to do household chores. German federal police said the Russian suspect was identified after a joint investigation with British police over almost 18 months and had been the subject of an international arrest warrant issued by French authorities last year. Bache’s brother Dean began a crowdfunding campaign in the aftermath of the attack which raised more than £13,000 to contribute to private medical treatment. In a newspaper interview this month Dean said: “Andy is doing well. He’s moved into his own flat within the grounds of his rehab unit. He’s watching the football and rugby and his mates have said they’ll take him back down to watch Pompey as and when he’s ready. He’s getting his life back.” The German prosecutor Joachim Ettenhofer told Reuters news agency that the Russian suspect could be extradited from Germany to France in two weeks’ time. “These things usually go pretty quickly,” he said. France jailed Russia and England fans in the immediate aftermath of the Euro 2016 violence, and deported more than 20 others."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/22/donald-trump-insists-arming-teachers-guns-shootings","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T21:44:29Z","webTitle":"Trump insists on arming teachers despite lack of evidence it would stop shootings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/22/donald-trump-insists-arming-teachers-guns-shootings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/feb/22/donald-trump-insists-arming-teachers-guns-shootings","fields":{"headline":"Trump insists on arming teachers despite lack of evidence it would stop shootings","bodyText":"In the past 24 hours, Donald Trump has thrice backed a plan to arm teachers in US schools despite the lack of evidence showing this would end school shootings. Facing opposition from the country’s largest teachers’ unions, school security guards and military veterans, the president continued to endorse the plan in White House meetings and on Twitter. “I want my schools protected just like I want my banks protected,” Trump said Thursday morning in a meeting about school safety at the White House. In the Thursday meeting, the president suggested offering bonuses to teachers who are trained to carry concealed weapons. “If you had a teacher who was adept at firearms, they could very well end the attack very quickly,” Trump said at a Wednesday night listening session with loved ones of people killed in mass shootings. There are few examples available of armed citizens stopping mass shootings and it is difficult to track, in part because it is difficult to know what a gunman was planning before they were stopped. A 2014 Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) study of US active shooter incidents in the US between 2000 and 2013 said of the 160 total incidents examined, 21 were stopped by citizens, workers or off-duty police officers. Of the 21 people, six were armed. An active shooter incident is defined as a shooting that occurs in a confined, populated area and in which law enforcement or citizens could affect the outcome based on their response. Shootings related to gang violence, accidents and suicides were not included in the tally. The majority of the 160 incidents, 56.3%, were ended by the shooter before police arrived. Either the shooter committed suicide, stopped shooting or fled the scene. “The FBI recognizes that seeking to avoid these tragedies is clearly the best result,” the study concluded. Trump’s suggestion to arm teachers was immediately opposed by the nation’s largest teachers’ unions – the National Education Association (NEA) and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) – as well as the teachers’ union in Florida’s Broward County, where last week’s shooting took place. Individual teachers criticized Trump’s suggestion on social media under the #ArmMeWith campaign. There, teachers asked that the money that would be needed to fulfill Trump’s plan instead be used to improve schools resources such as mental health services and basic classroom supplies. A former assistant principal who stopped a shooting at a high school in Mississippi while armed told the New York Times the experience left him with nightmares and acute stress for six months afterward. “It doesn’t matter what a pistolero you are, or think you are,” Joel Myrick said. “You don’t need to be in school in charge of protecting children.” The National Association of School Resource Officers (NASRO), the nation’s largest school policing group, also said it opposed arming teachers. They noted law enforcement officers responding to an incident may mistake armed personnel not in uniform as the assailant. They also emphasized how law enforcement officers receive ongoing practice in high-stress and difficult shooting environments. At the Wednesday listening session, Trump also described a situation where there would simply be more armed people on campus – not just teachers. “They may be Marines that left the Marines, left the Army, left the Air Force,” Trump said. “And they’re very adept at doing that. You’d have a lot of them, and they’d be spread evenly throughout the school.” Veterans disputed this claim on Twitter. Jay Kirell, a combat veteran who served in Afghanistan, said it was “extremely difficult” to shoot under stress. “Cops &amp; soldiers literally get paid to do this &amp; most of them can’t shoot accurately under stress,” Kirell tweeted. Daniel Riley, an infantryman in the Marines who attended Columbine high school, guessed how many Marines would have been needed to prevent students being killed at his alma mater during the 1999 attack. “Using my knowledge of both, my guess on what it would take to prevent kids from being killed on 4/20/99: at least 20 Armed Marines (And it’s still a maybe),” Riley said. “And that’s somehow ‘common sense’?” Trump’s proposal ignores the efficacy of gun laws in other countries where there are far fewer incidents of gun violence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/feb/22/airbnb-hotels-expansion-travel","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T21:16:05Z","webTitle":"Not just homes any more: Airbnb expands into hotels and luxury spots","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/22/airbnb-hotels-expansion-travel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/feb/22/airbnb-hotels-expansion-travel","fields":{"headline":"Not just homes any more: Airbnb expands into hotels and luxury spots","bodyText":"Airbnb has expanded its offering to include hotels, luxury properties and a loyalty programme for guests as the California startup shifts towards a full-service travel-booking company. Hoteliers and B&amp;Bs have long been listing their rooms on the platform, but the company is adding extra search categories for users who are not looking to rent someone’s home or room. “Airbnb was designed for when we were much smaller,” said the company’s CEO, Brian Chesky, on stage at a packed event space in the Nob Hill area of San Francisco on Thursday. The platform, he said, has grown to include 4.5m places to stay, making it difficult to find what users were looking for. “We have a lot more than shared rooms, private rooms and entire homes,” he said, announcing new categories for vacation homes, boutique hotel rooms, B&amp;Bs and “uniques”, a classification that includes tree-houses, boats, yurts, igloos and a 30ft beagle-shaped house called Sweet Willy. The platform will also offer curated collections of homes for the family (homes that come with toys, books and games consoles), work, honeymoon and group travel. To reward regular and highly rated customers, Airbnb is also launching a “superguest” loyalty programme as a counterpart to its existing “superhost” programme. Superguests will get benefits such as discounts, airport pickups, flight upgrades and lounge access. A pilot with 10,000 guests starts this spring and it will be rolled out in the summer. “It’s your passport to a new travel lifestyle,” said Chesky. The company is also adding new luxury tiers, Airbnb Plus and Beyond by Airbnb, in an effort to attract high net-worth customers who may have balked at the idea of staying in someone else’s house. Airbnb Plus homes are inspected in person by Airbnb for cleanliness, comfort and design and come with a dedicated support team, making the company a direct challenger to the London-headquartered home rental firm OneFineStay. Beyond by Airbnb is a standalone site based on the company’s acquisition of Luxury Retreats in 2017. It will offer high-end properties, including optional concierge services, when it launches in spring. The announcement comes at a time when Airbnb, much like other “sharing economy” firms such as Uber, faces legal challenges in cities including New York, San Francisco, London and Berlin. Regulators argue that Airbnb’s short-term rental model drives up rents, creating problems for residents seeking long-term accommodation. The expanded offering will ruffle the feathers of some corners of the travel industry, particularly as the platform will significantly undercut the commissions taken from hotels by sites such as Expedia and Booking.com. “If Airbnb wants to enter the hoteling business, then it needs to be regulated, taxed and subject to the same safety compliances and oversight that law-abiding hotel companies adhere to each and every day,” said Troy Flanagan from the American Hotel and Lodging Association, which has butted heads with Airbnb for not playing by the same rules. Airbnb, which has a valuation of $30bn, needs to show that it can generate new revenue streams before its initial public offering, which could take place as soon as 2019. In November 2016, the company added “Experiences” to its offering, allowing people to sell excursions, workshops, classes and other experiences on top of renting out their homes. Since then, the company has expanded into restaurant reservations as well. However, a report in the Wall Street Journal this week suggested that growth of Experiences has been sluggish as customers are wary of paying strangers for experiences such as blindfolded dinner parties. Airbnb said the Experiences category was growing faster than home rentals did in its first year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/22/russia-un-resolution-eastern-ghouta-ceasefire-syria","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T18:41:44Z","webTitle":"Russia blocks UN resolution on eastern Ghouta ceasefire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/22/russia-un-resolution-eastern-ghouta-ceasefire-syria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/22/russia-un-resolution-eastern-ghouta-ceasefire-syria","fields":{"headline":"Russia blocks UN resolution on eastern Ghouta ceasefire","bodyText":"Russia has blocked a UN resolution that would have established a 30-day ceasefire and humanitarian deliveries in eastern Ghouta, saying that widespread reporting of heavy civilian casualties in the besieged area on the edge of the Syrian capital, Damascus, was a product of “mass psychosis”. The Russian envoy to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, told an emergency meeting of the security council on the situation in eastern Ghouta that Russia would not support the ceasefire resolution put forward by Sweden and Kuwait in its present form, calling it unrealistic. He circulated a list of proposed Russian amendments, thought to involve opening broad loopholes in the ceasefire, allowing a range of rebel groups to be targeted. A western diplomat said that at first glance the Russian amendments were “likely to be unacceptable”. Diplomats said the resolution could go to a vote on Friday. Moscow has vetoed 10 previous UN resolutions on Syria and has consistently used its permanent seat on the security council to shield the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, from concerted UN action on war crimes. In November, Russia used its veto to block a resumption of UN investigations into the use of chemical weapons by Syrian forces. The ceasefire resolution put forward by Sweden and Kuwait was first circulated in the security council on 9 February but its drafting had been slowed by Russian objections, while in Syria, the Assad regime and its allies pursued its offensive in eastern Ghouta. On Thursday, Nebenzia made clear that Russian support for Assad would continue, and portrayed the accounts and video footage of heavy civilian casualties in the rebel-held enclave of eastern Ghouta as fake news. “The mass psychosis in global media outlets acting in coordination, disseminating the same rumours in recent days, in no way does anything to help improve understanding of this situation,” Nebenzia told the council session that Russia had called. Before the Russian envoy spoke, the council heard a report from the UN undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs, Mark Lowcock, who said 50 civilians had been reported as killed and 200 wounded in heavy shelling in the 24 hours before the session. He said humanitarian deliveries to besieged populations in Syria were sharply down this year. Convoys were reaching 22,000 trapped people a month in the past three months compared with an average in 2017 of 175,000 a month. In a video link from Geneva, Lowcock read out messages from trapped civilians who were under fire, appealing for help from the international community. “You’re all as member states aware that your obligations under international humanitarian law are just that. They are binding obligations. They are not favours to be traded in a game of death and destruction,” he said. “Humanitarian access is not a ‘nice-to-have’. It is a legal requirement,” Lowcock said. “Counter-terrorist efforts cannot supersede the obligation to respect and protect civilians. They do not justify the killings of civilians and the destruction of entire cities and neighbourhoods.” Lowcock said seven civilian hospitals and clinics had been targeted with bombardment on Wednesday alone. Nebenzia replied that the reports that Syrian forces and their backers were bombing health facilities were “a well-known tactic in information warfare”. He said it was “fully clear” that fighters based themselves in medical and educational facilities. “However, this is an inconvenient truth that is not being disseminated,” he said. The Russian envoy said there were “several thousand fighters that have not yet been vanquished” in Ghouta. Other security council envoys rejected the Russian suggestion that the bombing of civilians in eastern Ghouta was necessary for counter-terrorism. Speaking for the UK, senior diplomat Stephen Hickey said: “The people of eastern Ghouta are not terrorists.” Hickey added that the al-Qaida affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra, had only a small presence, representing “less than a quarter of 1%” of the district’s population. “Nothing can justify the barbaric bombardment we’ve seen in recent days, or the blocking of humanitarian aid, or the denial of medical evacuations,” Hickey said. Before the vote, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, denounced the mass killing of civilians in eastern Ghouta. “What we currently see, the dreadful events in Syria, a regime fighting not against terrorists, but against its own people, the killing of children, the destruction of hospitals – all this is a massacre which needs to be condemned,” Merkel told Germany’s parliament. The chancellor said her government would talk to Moscow and would “do everything that is within our power so that this massacre comes to an end”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/feb/22/centrica-feels-heat-but-avoids-cutting-the-dividend-yet-again-iain-conn","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T07:44:12Z","webTitle":"Centrica feels the heat but avoids cutting the dividend yet again | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/feb/22/centrica-feels-heat-but-avoids-cutting-the-dividend-yet-again-iain-conn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/feb/22/centrica-feels-heat-but-avoids-cutting-the-dividend-yet-again-iain-conn","fields":{"headline":"British Gas owner feels the heat but pays a dividend yet again","bodyText":"The Centrica chief executive, Iain Conn, avoided the indignity of cutting the dividend for a second time in three years and has probably saved his job as a result, at least for now. It will be 4,000 colleagues who lose theirs as the company embarks on another round of cost-cutting in search of stability. Conn found himself issuing regrets on many fronts – to the affected workers and to investors for “a very poor shareholder experience”. You bet: he inherited a share price of 279p at the start of 2015 and it’s now just 142p, even with Thursday’s 7% relief bounce. The dividend calculations look mighty tight since 12p a share is being distributed from earnings of 12.6p, even when those earnings are totted up on Centrica’s “adjusted” basis. Next year the City expects earnings of 14p, which is hardly a great leap forward. Yet Conn was prepared to stick out his neck and say Centrica “expects” to keep the dividend intact until 2020. The weak promise comes with two caveats – annual cash flow must be £2.1bn to £2.3bn and debt must not explode. Neither assumption is heroic, but the point about Centrica is that nobody really knows what will happen to profits and cashflow at British Gas when the government’s price cap on standard variable tariffs (SVT) arrives. In anticipation, Centrica can shed staff and push more of its SVT customers on to fixed-price tariffs, with boiler-maintenance deals and smart thermostats as part of the package. But what’s the likely long-term profit margin for British Gas? It’s surely lower than the 5.5% reported last year – and maybe much lower. The same, one assumes, will apply to Conn’s bonus for 2017. After last year’s bonus debacle – he received a £4m pay package including a £759,000 bonus – zero would be another way for him to express regret, or be told to. Pensions Regulator in the dark By the end of her bruising session with MPs one almost felt sorry for Lesley Titcomb, chief executive of the Pensions Regulator. After all, she became boss only in 2015, meaning others were responsible for most of the regulator’s ineffectual dance around Carillion’s pension deficit. Yet the MPs’ outrage was legitimate for two reasons. First, two big pension blow-ups – the other being BHS – seem to have failed to inspire a sense of urgency at the regulator. Titcomb was asked a seemingly simple question about how many pension schemes have had very lengthy recovery periods similar to Carillion’s 16 years and couldn’t offer even a rough estimate. Isn’t that the sort of thing she should know, especially as MPs have made the sharpest pointed comments on the subject? Frank Field, co-chair of the inquiry, thought so. “If Rachel [Reeves, the other co-chair] and I bumped into you at a bus stop we would expect you to be better informed than you are now,” he said. Harsh but fair. The second reason is Titcomb’s apparent reluctance to concede that the regulator should have exercised its powers of intervention at Carillion and insisted on bigger and quicker contributions to the pension scheme in 2013, when the company was spraying dividends at shareholders and bonuses at directors. Instead it merely threatened to intervene, without actually doing so, before settling for a limp compromise. Maybe Titcomb was being loyal to colleagues but pleas about how “very difficult judgments were made at the time” inspire little confidence that the same mistakes won’t be repeated elsewhere. Pursuing Carillion’s former directors, as the regulator is now doing, is sensible but any recovered sums will be tiny in the context of the deficit. The time to get heavy is when a company says it’s flush with cash. Why is that so hard for Titcomb to say? Barclays needs to mind the gap “Today it is difficult to imagine the world of banking as a solely male environment,” runs a self-congratulatory piece on Barclays website. But, actually, it’s not terribly hard because Barclays’ own gender pay statistics suggest things haven’t changed that much over the years. The numbers are extraordinary: women in the international division, which houses the investment bank, were paid half as much as the men last year. We’ll wait to see what other banks report, but the gap feels far wider than average. Note that Barclays’ nine-strong executive committee was exclusively male for a while until Laura Padovani became “interim” chief compliance officer last October.

Maréchal-Le Pen is the granddaughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen, the founder of the far right National Front and the niece of the party’s current leader Marine Le Pen. She was elected to represent it in the French National Assembly in 2012 at the age of 22 but has since taken a step back from politics. Speaking to a crowd of conservative activists that booed every time she mentioned the European Union, Maréchal-Le Pen combined condemnation of the trans-national bloc with attacks on Muslim immigration and old fashioned social conservatism in an effort to link her political efforts against “the domination of the liberals and the socialists” with the election of Trump and the Brexit process in the United Kingdom. Maréchal-Le Pen claimed French sovereignty was under siege. “France is no longer free today,” she proclaimed. “After 1500 years of existence, we now must fight for our independence.” She also claimed that after 40 years of mass immigration, Islamist lobbies and political correctness, France was in the process of going “from the eldest daughter of the Catholic Church to the little niece of Islam”. She talked about a global conservative youth that wants to “protect their children from eugenics, the elderly from euthanasia and humanity from transhumanism”. Maréchal-Le Pen’s speech was well-received at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) with occasional shouts of “Vive La France” punctuating her remarks. However, her attendance brought controversy as many American conservatives expressed dismay over her attendance, comparing the National Front to the American alt-right. Former Fox News host Glenn Beck called her “a national socialist”. However, Matt Schlapp, the head of the American Conservative Union that organizes CPAC, has insisted that Maréchal-Le Pen is “a classical liberal”, unlike her aunt and others in the National Front."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/feb/28/country-diary-cock-chaffinch-feeding-wenlock-edge-shropshire","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T05:30:09Z","webTitle":"Country diary: cock of the bird table","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/28/country-diary-cock-chaffinch-feeding-wenlock-edge-shropshire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/feb/28/country-diary-cock-chaffinch-feeding-wenlock-edge-shropshire","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: cock of the bird table","bodyText":"For a brief moment, a cock chaffinch owns the world: a handful of seeds on a metre-square of concrete at the cold end of February. Watch the fighter’s forward shuffle, pushing towards the ropes of his entitlement; the eye-contact with invisible opponents. In a scattering of wild bird food, harvested somewhere else, bagged for the supermarket and broadcast here to rekindle a bond between person and bird, he asserts his antique right to gleanings. He selects a seed the way a waller lifts the perfect stone to fill a gap. The precision instrument of his beak applies just enough pressure along the ridges to split its seam, then he rolls it crosswise to crack and separate the case, which he drops. This empty husk is the chaff, and the chaffinch’s skill is in the threshing of each grain, the winnowing that separates the germ of life from the box it comes in. Chaffinch do not eat the chaff but create it, a litter cast for others; I suppose the bird’s name comes from its foraging the rubbish of harvest. The chaffinch swallows the seed, and the future of wheat, maize, millet or oat plants becomes the future chaffinch. His chest is dawn-lit, his head grey, the heraldry of his flash-feathers – which are only seen in flight – signalling the breeding season to come. Chaffinches that overwintered in single-sex flocks are all feeding together now; they wait at the margins of the world as his cock-ness performs his rites alone. He has no song yet but soon it will sound like coded whistling to a hidden charm of finches to show themselves, each phrase ending in a little instruction. Until it’s time to sing, he bulks up to energise his colours, sharing this food with robin, wren, blackbird, dunnock, house sparrow, wood pigeon and collared dove. There is a kind of pecking-order in the coming and going but no real conflict. The birds are edgy, there is cover, and escape routes, but they watch for sparrowhawks. Despite this, the cock chaffinch takes over the world, a meadow inside him, one grain at a time. • This article was amended on 1 March 2018 because an earlier version referred to “collard dove”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/feb/26/lessons-drive-dynamics-cost-refunds-tuition","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T07:49:02Z","webTitle":"Driving school's cut-price lessons leave learners on the road to nowhere","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/feb/26/lessons-drive-dynamics-cost-refunds-tuition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/feb/26/lessons-drive-dynamics-cost-refunds-tuition","fields":{"headline":"Driving school's cut-price lessons leave learners on the road to nowhere","bodyText":"It was an irresistible offer – 10 beginner driving lessons for £99 from a company that called itself “the most-liked driving school on Facebook”. Most of those who signed up to the national franchise, Drive Dynamics, were young people on tight budgets – students, single mothers and newly arrived immigrants. Now many have found they have paid out for nothing. The promised instructors never materialised, or vanished after a single lesson and requests for refunds fell on deaf years. Drive Dynamics has now gone into voluntary liquidation and, since it was taking new bookings up to its last days of trading, many more are left out of pocket. One Observer reader had paid £812 for a training course. The saga highlights the problem of headline bargains designed to lure the uninitiated behind the wheel. Drive Dynamics was one of a growing number of businesses to undercut a crowded market with unsustainable prices. While learners hasten to sign up to £99 packages, there’s a shortage of Approved Driving Instructors (ADIs) who can afford to live on £10 an hour once the costs of maintaining and insuring the vehicle and weekly franchise fees are deducted. Moreover, the small print often conceals less alluring realities designed to cut operational costs, such as 45-minute lessons rather than an hour, or obligatory overpriced lessons on top of the discounted package. Londoner Alice Carter paid Drive Dynamics £129 for 10 lessons last October. After receiving six, she was told by her instructor that she would have to pay extra for the seventh. “When I asked why, I was told one of my prepaid sessions is reserved to drive me to my test, one for the test and one to drive me home,” she says. Drive Dynamics told the Observer opaquely that the package didn’t include “the lesson in the middle” to get learners to the required standard, and that the final four can be “delivered in a number of ways at the discretion of the instructor” as per its terms and conditions. Except, its terms and conditions made no mention of this essential caveat. Unscrupulous companies risk tarnishing the reputation of driving instructors, according to Carly Brookfield, chief executive of the Driving Instructors Association. “Some operators, rather foolishly and desperately, play a short-termist game of racing to the bottom on price. “Those that do, generally don’t fare well. They can attract the less-than-discerning customer, but generally struggle to deliver lessons and to recruit trainers who will work for such a low fee,” she says. “I’ll hazard a guess that some of the trainers working for the more cut-price franchises are not high-performing.” While individual instructors have to be registered with the Driver &amp; Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA), and performance-checked every four years, driving schools and franchises are unregulated. The DVSA has no enforcement powers when they fail customers who have to rely on underfunded, overstretched council trading standards authorities to intervene. Drive Dynamic’s recent demise is a case of deja vu. In 2015 the Bradford-based company, then registered as Kan Kan Ltd, went into administration owing £500,000 following a BBC Watchdog report on its business practices. At the time, it blamed its dismal record on an inadequate computer system. But in a recent interview with the ADI trade magazine, Intelligent Instructor, it accused HMRC of having driven it out of business by revoking its VAT exemption, and demanding £300,000 in backdated payments. Within weeks it was reborn under the same trading name and with the same staff and website. Since then, more than 200 customers have contacted the Observer to complain that they received neither lessons, nor refunds. Last autumn some learners were told they had to prepay for their lessons by bank transfer rather than with a card, which meant that they could not reclaim their money from their bank when their lessons failed to materialise. Drive Dynamics claimed its card readers were malfunctioning. Three months later, it ceased trading. It had recently told the Observer that its problems were, once again, caused by a computer system overhaul, but in this month’s interview with Intelligent Instructor, it declares its downfall was caused by fraudsters who masqueraded as the brand to sign up customers and ruined its reputation. Intelligent Instructor’s editor Paul Caddick reckoned the quality of tuition was compromised because it was undervalued by government and public. He said: “ADIs perform an essential service to society, but there is a lack of respect for the profession, poor regulation, and low remuneration. “This has led, in some cases, to poorer applicants training in what is usually a second or third career after redundancy, rather than a professional first career choice,” he says. “Even though driving is the most dangerous thing most of us learn to do, people expect to pay less for a driving lesson than they do for kids to learn the piano or ballet.” He would like to see some of the road safety budget diverted into subsidies for tuition. “ADIs should be trained like other teachers, and then paid accordingly,” he says. “Currently, the standards to pass the three-stage test to become an ADI are very low, and so are professional expectations.” Since 2012 the number of qualified ADIs has fallen by 11% and those left are competing in a dwindling market as austerity bites. Plans by the DVSA to turn ADI training into a vocational qualification with transferable skills have so far come to nothing, nor has a government consultation, announced in 2015, on ways to “incentivise” learners to gain more practice before they sit their driving test. Kate Danby’s 19-year-old daughter Brooke Mather learnt the hard way how ruthless the market can be. She booked a course of lessons with Drive Dynamics in September and was asked to pay by bank transfer. The lessons never materialised and nor did a refund. Her bank couldn’t reclaim the money as it was not a card transaction. “She was thrilled at the prospect of passing her driving test and in her excitement, she didn’t research the company,” says Danby from Yorkshire. “She had saved hard for the money and was proud that she had organised her lessons and test herself, so the loss has left her devastated.” On the Drive Dynamics website, the company says “we will not be operating a telephone line from the 29 June 2017”. Since going into liquidation at the beginning of last month, it has not been possible to contact it for comment. Find a good driving school • Use the DVSA website to check that the instructor is fully qualified. Trainees display a pink, rather than green, licence on their windscreen. • The average fee for an hour-long lesson is £25. If a quote is well below this, be wary. It may reflect the inexperience of the instructor, or an over-reliance on theory, rather than practical teaching, in which case you will need more lessons to pass the test than if you paid more for better tuition. • If lessons are sold in prepaid bundles, check the refund policy in case you are unhappy with the instructor, and make sure you know the price of any extra lessons required. Most learners need 20 hours tuition to reach test standard. It’s wise to pay per lesson initially. • Find out the learner pass rate of your chosen school at www.gov.uk/find-driving-schools-and-lessons. If it’s less than 60%, look elsewhere. • Ask how long the lessons are. Some are as short as 45 minutes, while others are two hours or more, which can be exhausting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/23/blockchain-reshape-world-far-right-ahead-crypto-technology","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T11:04:42Z","webTitle":"Blockchain could reshape the world – and the far right is one step ahead | Josh Hall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/23/blockchain-reshape-world-far-right-ahead-crypto-technology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/23/blockchain-reshape-world-far-right-ahead-crypto-technology","fields":{"headline":"Blockchain could reshape our world – and the far right is one step ahead","bodyText":"Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain reads the title of a 2017 book. From currency speculation through to verifying the provenance of food, blockchain technology is eking out space in a vast range of fields. For most people, blockchain technologies are inseparable from bitcoin, the cryptocurrency that has been particularly visible in the news recently thanks to its hyper-volatility. Crypto-entrepreneurs have made and lost millions, and many people have parlayed their trading into a full-time job. But blockchain technology, which allows for immutable records of activities, stored on a ledger that is held not just in one place but massively distributed, has applications in every conceivable area in commerce and beyond. Soon, there will be blockchains everywhere that transactions happen. While the focus has so far been on currencies such as bitcoin, what’s less well known is the large and growing community of blockchain developers and evangelists, many of whom believe that the technology could herald radical changes in the ways our economies and societies are structured. But there’s a big question at the heart of that community: what might a world built with the help of blockchain technology look like? Unchain, a large bitcoin and blockchain convention based in Hamburg, seems to have a potential answer. Along with speakers from blockchain startups, cryptocurrency exchanges and a company that purports to offer “privately managed cities as a business”, the conference programme also features Alice Weidel, listed on the site as an “economist and bitcoin entrepreneur”. In fact, Weidel is the co-leader of Alternative für Deutschland, which recently became the third largest party in Germany’s Bundestag. Weidel’s election campaign in 2017 was the party’s breakthrough moment, and what many have seen as a watershed in German politics – the return of far-right, populist ethno-nationalism to the federal parliament. Since 2015 the AfD leadership has adopted increasingly hard lines on borders, migration, Islam and Europe. The party has also attempted to recuperate language associated with historic Nazism; in 2016, the AfD’s then chair, Frauke Petry, called for the rehabilitation of the word “völkisch”, which is seen to be inextricably linked with National Socialism. Weidel is thought to represent the more “moderate” wing of the AfD, in comparison with her colleague in the Bundestag Alexander Gauland, who has pushed for Angela Merkel to close Germany’s borders and to deliver ways by which immigrants can be repatriated. But the tension between the “moderate” and extreme wings of the AfD has been seen as a conscious tactic, in which Gauland pushes taboo subjects which Weidel then makes more palatable. Weidel herself, though, has also previously appeared to describe German Arabs as “culturally foreign” and to encourage a return to the paranoiac xenophobia of the Third Reich by describing Merkel’s government as “pigs” who are “puppets of the victorious powers” from the second world war. The rise of the AfD has caused deep soul-searching in Germany. But outside of the country’s borders, Weidel’s invitation to the Unchain summit also poses questions for the nascent blockchain community. On one side are those who believe that crypto technologies should be used to divert power away from states (particularly social democratic states) and into the hands of a righteous vanguard of rightwing libertarian hackers. Some of these people are now in positions of significant power: Mick Mulvaney, the director of the US Office of Management and Budget, is a staunch bitcoin advocate and his appointment was warmly received by some crypto news publications. Mulvaney has previously addressed the John Birch Society, an extreme rightwing pressure group that was formed to root out communists during the cold war but that now specialises in part in Federal Reserve conspiracy theories – a popular theme on some bitcoin forums. In June, the John Birch Society demanded that the Russia investigation be dropped; their “speakers bureau” offers talking heads on subjects including why the US must leave the UN, “the Trojan horse called immigration”, and “the global warming hoax”. But there is another tendency: one that believes blockchain tech should be used as part of a liberatory political project, one that can redistribute wealth and help to fund and safely connect participants in radical left activities. There is already significant overlap between the crypto community and those active in “platform cooperatives” – that is, organisations that are attempting to build alternatives to platform companies such as Uber and Deliveroo, with power and ownership in the hands of the workforce. Similarly, The New Inquiry magazine recently launched Bail Bloc, a system that leverages participants’ unused computing power to mine cryptocurrency to pay bail bonds in New York. Despite the wild fluctuations in cryptocurrency valuations, it seems clear now that blockchain tech is here to stay. In their book Blockchain Revolution, Don and Alex Tapscott insist that blockchains could revolutionise everything from business to government. But we are at a dangerous point for the adoption of crypto technologies. Alice Weidel’s invitation shows one potential route forward: the diverting of more power into the hands of the authoritarian right. Even crypto-sceptics must acknowledge this danger, and should be working with the crypto community to develop alternatives. Blockchain technology has the potential to help us build a better world – but we need to take action to ensure that it doesn’t lead us down the path preferred by Weidel and her companions. • Josh Hall is a writer and editor based between London and Berlin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"global-development/2018/feb/27/sumatra-palm-oil-ernest-zacharevic-sos-distress-call-indonesia-rainforest-orangutan","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T06:30:14Z","webTitle":"‘SOS’: the rainforest distress call carved into Sumatra's oil palms | Kate Lamb","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/feb/27/sumatra-palm-oil-ernest-zacharevic-sos-distress-call-indonesia-rainforest-orangutan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/feb/27/sumatra-palm-oil-ernest-zacharevic-sos-distress-call-indonesia-rainforest-orangutan","fields":{"headline":"‘SOS’: the rainforest distress call carved into Sumatra's oil palms","bodyText":"Dramatically carved into the landscape of a Sumatran oil palm plantation that borders one of the world’s most unique rainforests are three ominous letters: SOS. The message stretches half a kilometre alongside a snaking river; a bird’s-eye view gives the eerie sense the land has been given voice, and is issuing a mayday. “From the ground, you would not suspect anything more than just another palm oil plantation. The aerial view, however, reveals the SOS distress signal,” says the Lithuanian artist Ernest Zacharevic. For a week Zacharevic has been carefully plotting his concept out tree by tree – or oil palm by oil palm – all 1,100 that were cut down to etch out the message. The work in Bukit Mas, Sumatra, is intended to convey a pressing distress signal, drawing attention to the ongoing destruction of Indonesia’s rainforests and the critically endangered species, such as the Sumatran orangutan, that reside within it. “Save Our Souls is a message communicated to those at a distance, a reminder of the connectedness we share with nature,” he says of the acronym. “As more of the forests are lost, we lose a little bit of ourselves in the process.” This is the second year running that Zacharevic, a multidisciplinary artist famed for his Penang murals, has taken the state of Indonesian forests to heart in an artistic awareness campaign called Splash and Burn. The campaign is a play on the “slash and burn” technique used by some Indonesian farmers to clear swaths of rainforest for oil palm plantations. Indonesia is the world’s largest producer of palm oil – a substance widely used in food, cosmetics and cleaning products – and as the country’s rainforests shrink, the industry stands accused of complicity in mass deforestation. Inspired initially by the devastating forest fires of 2015, Zacharevic says this year he has delved deeper into the industry’s problems, as well as artistic ways to express them. “Last year I said if we ever come across a huge piece of plantation it would be very fun to carve an artwork into it. Even a simple piece could speak very loudly,” he explains. “And things just fell into place a few weeks ago.” Armed with ribbons, a drone and a chainsaw-wielding crew, Zacharevic and his team laboured over five days to carve the message into an area spanning 20 hectares. But it wasn’t until one of the final days when the clouds cleared that they were certain they had pulled it off. “We lived in the village so we would rise with the locals and it was very beautiful and sunny,” he recalls. “We launched our drone and we get this sharp, direct sunlight, the morning light, and it was so sharp and vivid. We all screamed, “It works, it works!” This year the artist has collaborated with the Sumatran Orangutan Society (SOS), which, together with the cosmetics company Lush, raised the funds to buy the 50-hectare (124-acre) oil palm plantation with the intention of reforesting it entirely. Before the oil palms are replaced with tens of thousands of native seedlings, Zacharevic was offered the chance to bring his idea to life. SOS’s director, Helen Buckland, was on site as the art project was under way and cheered as the oil palms were felled. “Mostly conservationists when they hear a chainsaw near a forest get a bit of a shudder down their spine, but this time it was a very positive experience,” says Buckland. “As we went across on a raft I could already hear the chainsaws and it was exciting because I knew they were clearing the land for two reasons: for Ernest’s creation of his artwork, but also reclaiming it for this new restoration site.” Funds for the site were raised in part through the sale of 14,600 orangutan-shaped soaps, produced by Lush last year – one for every critically endangered Sumatran orangutan left in the wild. The land is now owned by SOS’s Indonesian sister organisation, the Orangutan Information Centre (OIC), and will link up to an existing OIC restoration site that borders the Leuser ecosystem, the last place on earth where orangutans, rhinos, tigers and elephants coexist. In about four years the former plantation will have a well-established young forest structure, says Buckland, with trees up to six metres high. “It is really special to be able to go back to a restoration site and stand under the shade of a tree that was only planted a couple of years ago and hear birdsong,” she says. The reforested area will also create a buffer zone for the protected forest as well as new habitats for orangutans and other species. Zacharevic says he hopes the work can cut through the distractions and start a much-needed dialogue. “From my perspective it was bringing in a bit of social media culture,” he says of the concept. “I think a lot of us are very immersed and distracted by false values so I thought about putting up a distress signal, where people’s attention should be.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"healthcare-network/views-from-the-nhs-frontline/2018/feb/28/child-mental-health-continues-decline-government-plans-lacking","type":"article","sectionId":"healthcare-network","sectionName":"Healthcare Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T11:49:57Z","webTitle":"I work in child mental health – government plans will fail many who need help | Robin Barker","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/views-from-the-nhs-frontline/2018/feb/28/child-mental-health-continues-decline-government-plans-lacking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/healthcare-network/views-from-the-nhs-frontline/2018/feb/28/child-mental-health-continues-decline-government-plans-lacking","fields":{"headline":"I work in child mental health – government plans will fail many who need help","bodyText":"I never dreamed of becoming a mental health nurse and working in child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs). I was a youth worker, a Connexions adviser supporting young people’s mental health without referrals or thresholds and my office was the local park, schools, colleges and community centres. The introduction of austerity and the funding cuts that followed in 2008 left me out of a job and in need of a new profession. After retraining as a mental health nurse, I returned to the same work but with an NHS employer and saw those cuts follow me into Camhs. They have been difficult times to manage both professionally and personally; when less money means you can deliver less of a service, the impact is felt not only by the young people and their families not getting support, damage is also wrought on relationships with local communities, schools, colleges and GPs. Ten years later, there is growing recognition that the system needs help. The mental health outcomes of children and young people continue to decline and the system supporting their emotional wellbeing is more fragmented than ever before. Children and young people are in more need but less support is available both from NHS Camhs and voluntary organisations that play a vital role in providing information, advice and guidance. Schools and colleges are also struggling to meet their pupils’ educational and emotional needs. It’s for these reasons I welcome the consultation on the government green paper focused on transforming children and young people’s mental health provision, which is open until midday on 2 March. The main themes of the green paper – improving emotional and mental health support in schools, increasing access to early intervention, advice and guidance and improving access to specialist help – are hard to argue with. These are some of the areas where the need and evidence suggests we could have the greatest impact. The government’s proposals in the green paper to address these areas are to incentivise every school and college to identify a senior lead for mental health; to create mental health support teams focused on early intervention with their work supervised by Camhs and jointly managed with education; and trial a four-week waiting time for access to Camhs. While I agree with the sentiment behind these proposals, I question the feasibility. NHS Camhs are only funded to meet 25% of the estimated need with that expected to raise to 33% by 2020-21. Introducing a waiting time before we have the workforce, service models or security that further funding is making its way to frontline will further damage the public’s view of Camhs, which will have to raise thresholds to access care – meaning only the most serious cases will get help – or fail to deliver. Many children who need help won’t be able to get Money has failed to make its way into the children and young people’s mental health system – most recently the £1.4bn over five years announced in 2015. I wish these proposals went further to encourage a whole school approach to mental and emotional health; having a single person responsible for mental health risks reducing an amazing vision to a set of responsibilities added to an already overburdened member of teaching staff, without the protected time or authority to lead systemic change. Change should ensure children, young people and their parents and carers are involved in the mental health system. When I dream of what the children and young people’s mental health system and my profession could look like in 10 years’ time, I see all these possibilities: closer links with education, early intervention and a four-week – or even no-week – waiting time for specialist support. I’m just not sure we’ve captured the vision in the green paper as it is. Join the Healthcare Professionals Network to read more pieces like this.

Of all the awards, this is the one most drenched in glory – and hubris. It comes at the end of a long night, and it’s the one most keenly anticipated by the producers themselves who now have their moment of glory as the people for whom this award represents years of agonising work and instances of what Jerry Maguire called the “up-at-dawn pride-swallowing siege that I will never fully tell you about”. For the winner, it is a moment of euphoria and exhaustion, which last year Warren Beatty did his best to make as chaotic as possible, with Faye Dunaway, by accidentally awarding best picture to La La Land, when it should have gone to Moonlight. It is a measure of the suppressed hysteria that Oscar night engenders that this egregious cockup is the subject of its very own “truther” conspiracy – a theory that it was deliberately contrived to boost ratings. Looking down the list, it is disconcerting to see how many favourites and classics were not in fact rewarded with the best picture statuette. But there are quite a few that are, and here are some mouthwatering examples. Alfred Hitchcock’s Rebecca was the great man’s Hollywood debut; he was brought to the US by the shrewd David O Selznick, who effectively placed a crown on his head. The movie is stylishly adapted from the Daphne du Maurier novel by Robert E Sherwood and Joan Harrison. It is a gripping romantic mystery with superb performances from Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier — and an influence, incidentally, on Paul Thomas Anderson’s new film Phantom Thread. Olivier is the saturnine widower Max de Winter who marries Fontaine’s shy and mousy lady’s companion and brings her back to his magnificent Cornish home, which is all but haunted by his first wife: Rebecca. There is a terrible secret in this house, connected to the creepy housekeeper, Mrs Danvers, unforgettably played by Judith Anderson. Virile, passionate, patriotic: these adjectives apply to the male lead of Michael Curtiz’s Casablanca, as well as to the movie itself. It is that rare beast: a second world war picture that came out in the middle of the war, when the outcome of the war in Europe was far from clear. Humphrey Bogart is Rick, the tough American bar-owner in Vichy-controlled Morocco, secretly nursing a broken heart. Of all the gin joints, she has to walk into his – Ilse, played by Ingrid Bergman, the resistance leader’s wife he fell in love with in Paris, when the Nazis were moving in. The movie’s fierce anti-Nazi ethic is glorious, the dialogue crackles along and the romance is gorgeous. Find yourself watching the opening moments on TV and you have to stay to the end, no matter how often you’ve seen it before. With its sheer artistry, muscular idealism, and the passionate intensity of the acting — along with Leonard Bernstein’s bright, clamorous orchestral score — Elia Kazan’s On the Waterfront is a true classic. Marlon Brando’s wonderfully uninhibited performance set a gold standard for the new method style of acting. He and the movie in general are an obvious inspiration for Scorsese’s Raging Bull. Brando is Terry Malloy, a washed-up boxer now casually employed at the docks – a crooked closed shop controlled by mobster union boss Johnny Friendly (Lee J Cobb). Terry has a cushy deal taking pay for no work, because he’s the kid brother of Friendly’s top consigliere, Charley Malloy (Rod Steiger). But people who talk to the cops get whacked and Terry is secretly sickened by the murders that he has connived at – and at the way his brother betrayed him at the beginning of his boxing career. Hollywood history has given this film a patina of tragedy and irony: Terry wonders if he has the moral courage to name names for the authorities and later, Kazan would be pilloried for doing that during the McCarthyite era. At any rate, On the Waterfront is an operatic masterpiece. Romantic comedy is a genre now synthesised and commodified into something very predictable. But Billy Wilder’s The Apartment is a masterly mix of material that is both funny and romantic – with a uniquely charming and accessible male lead in Jack Lemmon. He is the put-upon salaryman in New York who has been bullied by his boss into lending out his apartment for this sleazebag’s extramarital liaisons. Meanwhile, he is falling in love with a heartbreakingly pretty elevator operator, played by Shirley MacLaine. It’s a smart and sophisticated big-city satire with a heart of authentic gold. Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather was the high point of the American new wave and revived the reputation of Hollywood itself. Like Spielberg’s Jaws, it brilliantly took a pulpy format and supercharged it with meaning and intensity. Brando is the ailing Vito Corleone, presiding over a postwar mafia clan; his sons are coming to terms with what their own destinies are to be when he goes. Al Pacino is Michael Corleone, the decorated war veteran who appears to want nothing to do with his toxic family inheritance. The secrecy, the dysfunction, the fear and self-hate which is transformed into fanatical dedication – it is all here. The mafiosi behave like soldiers in a war movie, only it is peacetime and the battle is on home soil. A magnificent achievement, aspiring to an almost Shakespearean grandeur. Kirk Douglas played the role on Broadway, but when it came to the movie version, his producer son Michael took the decision to cast the young hotshot Jack Nicholson and the rest is film history. One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest was directed by Milos Forman and adapted by Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman from the Ken Kesey novel. Nicholson plays Mac McMurphy, a small-time crook sent down for statutory rape who by playing up his natural craziness gets what he thinks is a cushy transfer to a psychiatric facility, where he leads a revolt of the patients against the system. A fascinating film, soaked in the anti-establishment zeitgeist. Louise Fletcher gives a great performance in the chilling, but complex role of Nurse Ratched. This is a difficult time to be remembering the brilliance of Woody Allen’s Annie Hall. Objection to his personal life has reached a critical mass, largely due to the recent TV interview that Dylan Farrow gave, effectively introducing a new generation to her original abuse allegations from 1992. However, no legal proof has been established, and Moses Farrow has crucially offered his own complicating testimony. It could be argued that, whatever we think, the reputation of Allen has now been so clouded that, like it or not, Annie Hall has ceased to be funny. I personally think it would be absurd now to airbrush this film out of history and behave as if we never had time for it. It is his fictionalised account of his lost romance with Diane Keaton, and it is a film that pretty well invented the relationship comedy, as well as giving birth to Seinfeld, Curb Your Enthusiasm and Girls. And it’s an ancestor of the work of Charlie Kaufman. Annie Hall has lost its innocence, but not its brilliance. Schindler’s List was a powerful and deeply honourable film for Steven Spielberg, an adaptation of the Thomas Keneally book, and an intensely felt attempt to find the possibility of hope in the very heart of darkness itself: the Nazi concentration camp. It is the true story of the German businessman Oskar Schindler, played with dignity and presence by Liam Neeson, a mercenary cynic who entered a mysterious state of grace and saved over a thousand Jews from death. The young Ralph Fiennes plays the unspeakable camp commander Amon Goeth and Ben Kingsley is Schindler’s bookkeeper Stern. The emotionally exhausting three-hour-plus movie is throughout (mostly) in black-and-white, often using handheld shots with Spielberg in personal charge of the camera. Cormac McCarthy’s apocalyptic western thriller No Country for Old Men was filmed with passion and style by the Coen brothers: a dark and disquieting Texan movie to compare with their debut, Blood Simple. Tommy Lee Jones is the impassive sheriff, who sets off on the trail of the good ol’ boy (Josh Brolin) who has chanced upon and fled with a bag of $2m of criminals’ money. On his trail also is the deeply creepy killer tasked with recovering this loot for the bad guys: the bizarre Anton Chigurh, played by Javier Bardem. It’s bleakly funny and exciting, but also terrifying in its presentiments of pure evil. Bizarre announcement cockups from Beatty and Dunaway to one side, Barry Jenkins’s Moonlight is a remarkable Oscar achievement: a film of real artistry and form, combined with emotional power. It’s a triptych portrait of a young gay black man, played by three different actors as a kid, a teen and then a young man: an almost Tolstoyan sense of childhood, boyhood and youth. Moonlight is about the nature of masculinity, conditioned by the determinant factors of race, class – and sexuality. Its rendering of time and the vicissitudes of identity are complex and enigmatic, but deeply moving at the same time. Its sheer, intoxicating sleekness and the panache and scope of its storytelling gets The Godfather the big prize, along with the colossal, iconic performance that Coppola gets out of Brando as Don Corleone. In On the Waterfront, Brando was facing up to the mob; now he is their king. Perhaps that sketches out a trajectory towards cynicism or bad-guy glamourisation in popular culture, but the villain has always been a potent force, and they don’t get more compelling than Corleone, a career-criminal who founded a dynasty and believed, in his own way, in the American Dream.

We all remain hopeful that a change of heart, attitude or strategy could return parties to deal-making mode. However, we also have a duty to be honest with ourselves and our people. As the deal wasn’t done last week, realpolitik tells us it will be very difficult to do anytime soon. Until now, the 13-month-long process has seen the insertion of commas following previous breakdowns – this week we are witnessing a hard full stop. This was not just a breakdown of a negotiation or of a relationship between two political parties – this now threatens to be a fundamental breakdown of all the progress we have achieved since Good Friday 1998. I’m very deliberately setting out the seriousness and the scale of that challenge. I see no point in talking it down. For politics on this island to reorient itself, our only choice is to return to the pillars that underlie the historic Anglo-Irish accommodations we collectively achieved. Many of those principles were initially mapped out in a room in Trinity College Dublin, by the man who proved central in building the architecture of our peace. In March 1970 a young John Hume was remoulding the very idea of Irishness. Hume challenged Irish society to reshape and reimagine the old notions that had driven our belonging to nationhood. It is probably difficult now to fully appreciate just how radical a view this was. Hume’s great insight was not to diminish the importance of nationhood and the powerful allegiance it continues to inspire, it was rather to understand that complexity need not be a vice. This could not be more pertinent in the current Brexit debate. Through Brexit, we are witnessing one island attempting to retreat into the false nostalgia of an imagined past, embracing a cocktail of political panic and economic protectionism. On the other hand, our own island retains its ambition of building an open economy and society, not beholden to globalisation but willing to shape the opportunity it offers. Those growing contrasts and changes will be demanding for all of us – perhaps particularly those of us in political life. The period ahead will ask us to replicate Hume’s bravery in breaking with much of what went before him. In Northern Ireland, the Good Friday agreement is sovereign. All democratic Ireland had a role in building and supporting that historic solution. In the absence of continuing negotiations to restore devolution, the first step must be the formation of the “British-Irish intergovernmental conference”, as outlined in the Good Friday agreement – there is no reason why that should be resisted. The alternative is to hand full power to a Tory-DUP direct rule government. The SDLP is setting out a proposal that we believe may now be the only way to break the deadlock of the past year. I am calling on the Irish and British governments, as part of the intergovernmental conference, to agree a package of legislation and implement it. I believe that package should include much of the draft accommodation that was agreed between the DUP and Sinn Féin. This package would include legislation for an Irish language Act and an Ulster Scots Act. It should include the establishment of legacy bodies and the release of inquest monies. I am also proposing that it should also include the reform of the petition of concern so that marriage equality can finally be brought to the North. If these two parties couldn’t bring the deal over the line then the two governments should do it for them. This forms part of their governmental duty as guardians and guarantors of the agreement. Ultimately, the Unionist and nationalist peoples of Ireland can retreat from each other or we can choose to work, live and govern together. As John himself would say, the problem hasn’t changed, therefore the solution hasn’t changed. Despite all the difficulties ahead, the Good Friday agreement remains the means to secure all our futures. Twenty years on is not the time to abandon it – but to defend it. • Colum Eastwood is the leader of Ireland’s Social Democratic and Labour Party, the SDLP"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/ng-interactive/2018/mar/05/italian-elections-2018-full-results-renzi-berlusconi","type":"interactive","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T13:51:20Z","webTitle":"Italian elections 2018 - full results","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2018/mar/05/italian-elections-2018-full-results-renzi-berlusconi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/ng-interactive/2018/mar/05/italian-elections-2018-full-results-renzi-berlusconi","fields":{"headline":"Italian elections 2018 - full results","bodyText":"Regional and demographic trends Which parties could make up a coalition government? Several permutations are mathematically possible, but none appear politically easy. Jon Henley explains Preliminary results from Italy’s general election show the country split three ways. None of the three factions – Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia and the anti-immigration the League; a centre-left coalition headed by Matteo Renzi; and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) – look likely to have enough seats to govern alone, and no government is possible without the support of either the League or M5S. Some kind of coalition will therefore be necessary for a majority in Italy’s 630-seat parliament. Several permutations are mathematically possible, though none appear politically easy: Populist and far right: Five Star Movement and the League Projections have M5S as by far the largest single partywith 231 seats and the League on 123, giving this potential alliance – which would send shockwaves through the EU – a total of 354. Having long rejected all talk of any power sharing, M5S now says it is willing to at least talk about common policies. “We will discuss with all other parties,” its leader, Luigi di Maio, said, adding that the party has “a responsibility to govern”. Many analysts believe the leftwing of M5S would revolt were there a hookup with the League. Populist, rightwing, far right: M5S, Forza Italia, the League This combination would have a total of 453 seats, 99 of which would be occupied by from Berlusconi’s Forza Italia. All three parties initially ruled out alternative post-election pacts, but with Forza Italia on course to win fewer seats than the League, a senior official from the latter, Claudio Borghi, has suggested a rightwing alliance headed by his party’s leader, Matteo Salvini, could find an accord with M5S. Salvini appears to have ruled this out, saying he is “committed” to his alliance with Forza Italia, but has stressed the League has “a right and a duty” to govern. Rightwing and centre left: Forza Italia, the League, the Democratic party A grand coalition would have a projected 327 seats in parliament, 222 from the rightwing parties and 105 from the Democrats, but bring together some highly unlikely bedfellows in the pro-European centre left and the anti-immigration, EU-critical League. As such, it is seen as highly unlikely. A senior Democratic party official, Ettore Rosato, has said that if results stay as they are, “for us it is a clear defeat and we will move into opposition”. Populist and centre left: Five Star Movement and the Democratic party This option, with 336 parliamentary seats, also looks difficult to achieve politically. Matteo Ricci, a former Democratic party vice-president, has said there is “no chance” of it helping the M5S form a government. “The only ally with whom the M5S can form a government is Matteo Salvini , that’s the only option for them,” he said. Fresh elections If there is no clear majority, the Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, could choose to leave the current centre-left government of Paolo Gentiloni in place, allowing time to set up a temporary government to organise new elections. That process could only start after parliament meets for the first time on 23 March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/22/wayne-la-pierre-nra-cpac-hate-bingo","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T20:27:46Z","webTitle":"NRA hate bingo: we decode Wayne LaPierre's loaded rant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/22/wayne-la-pierre-nra-cpac-hate-bingo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/feb/22/wayne-la-pierre-nra-cpac-hate-bingo","fields":{"headline":"NRA hate bingo: we decode Wayne LaPierre's loaded rant","bodyText":"Say what you like about Wayne LaPierre, the head of the National Rifle Association. He knows his audience. A week after the tragic mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, LaPierre took the stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington to defend America’s right to bear arms. The speech was also an opportunity for the audience to play NRA “hate bingo”, as LaPierre ticked off an exhaustive – and exhausting – list of the association’s bogeymen and women: Barack Obama, the media, Hollywood, “European-style socialists”, George Soros, Mexicans, China, Black Lives Matter and NFL players who refuse to stand for the national anthem. Having thoroughly triggered his audience, he went on to mention God, family, the flag, capitalism and all those other things his enemies – supposedly – despise. If you want to play hate bingo, see how many key words you can find in the speech. And here’s a selection of the most memorable quotes. Key quotes from the speech Their laws don’t stop illegal criminals from crossing our borders every single day. Their laws don’t stop the scourge of gang violence and drug crime that savages Baltimore, Chicago and every major American community. Their laws haven’t stopped the plague of opioids and Chinese fentanyl from Mexico that floods American streets.

That's an army we don't need – or want","bodyText":"Before I fell into journalism and writing, I taught in classrooms. In college, I studied to be an English teacher, and I was a substitute teacher in New York City. It was a gratifying experience that came just before the most recent wave of horrific school shootings, including Sandy Hook and Parkland. Teachers don’t ask for much. They want to be paid enough money so they don’t have to work a second job at Macy’s to earn a living wage. They want to be respected by their administrators and their students. They want enough resources, like books and school supplies, to actually be able to teach. They don’t want guns. Republicans like Donald Trump routinely try to undermine public education in America. Trump’s education secretary, Betsy DeVos, worships at the altar of privatization. This month, Trump proposed slashing $5bn from the Department of Education’s budget. Among the programs on the chopping block: those to help pay for counselors in schools and violence prevention programs. Yes, the same Republicans so slavishly devoted to the NRA that they can only cry “mental health!” when another man with an AR-15 mows down innocents can’t even properly fund programs to address the mental health of our students. Trump may have to reverse his own education cuts to start arming the 20% of teachers – he probably pulled the number out of thin air – he wants to send to battle in our classrooms. As the Washington Post pointed out on Thursday, Trump’s proposal, if taken literally, would mean giving guns to about 718,000 teachers. That’s almost as much as the army and navy combined. Training these teachers alone could cost the federal government hundreds of millions. That’s before the government starts purchasing pistols for each of these militarized educators. Why should teachers be armed combatants? Why should time and money be spent on anything other than educating children? Gun advocates like to point to countries like Israel and Switzerland where gun ownership is relatively high but shootings are rarer. Both countries, however, still manage to have lower rates of gun ownership than the US and impose far more stringent restrictions – mandatory background checks, for example – on acquiring weapons than Americans do. Public-carrying permits are rarely issued to the Swiss. In Israel, gun control is strict. Any individual who has access to a weapon must undergo some military training. Gun hobbyists don’t really exist. Few Israelis can obtain licenses for automatic weapons. Does Trump support making it harder for everyone to get a gun in return for arming and training teachers? Probably not. What he is proposing has no serious precedent in a modern democracy because other nations, even those that are more tolerant of gun ownership, are much more committed to preventing gun deaths. Trump still wants any American to be able to walk into a store and purchase an AR-15, an assault rifle that was banned from 1994 to 2004 and has since become a favorite weapon of mass killers. Designed for military combat, the AR-15 was clutched by the Parkland suspect, Nikolas Cruz, who is charged with murdering 17 high schoolers last week. Were Trump’s teacher-arming scheme realized, it would still mean the most deranged Americans could access murder weapons at will. Armed teachers – again, most want to focus on actual education, not war preparations – would then have to enter their classrooms ready to trade fire with military weaponry. This is Trump’s utopia, our dystopia. A war-world where gun manufacturers make billions, the NRA buys off an entire political party, and the rest of us cower in fear.

With Theresa May’s inner cabinet off to Chequers in the afternoon to see if it could agree – if only for a day or so – on a vaguely plausible Brexit negotiating strategy, it was expecting a lot of the junior Brexit minister Robin Walker and Tim Barrow, the UK’s ambassador to the EU, to provide any great clarity on the government’s position before the European scrutiny select committee in the morning. There again, even on the off-chance that the prime minister were to come up with some sort of Brexit Santa list later in the day it would be highly unlikely that anyone would bother to tell Walker. Or, if they did, that he would understand. So there was as much to be gained from grilling him before as after. Walker is what’s known in government as “a useful idiot”. A little-known but much-valued asset in Westminster. Someone whose sole function is to know almost nothing about anything and therefore can be relied on to hide the government’s incompetence behind his own uselessness. Whenever the Brexit department is in trouble, it’s Walker – or his sidekick, Steve Baker, another useful idiot – who gets sent out to defend the indefensible in parliament. Either to claim the economic impact assessments that David Davis had said existed in excruciating detail didn’t really exist at all, or to argue that the impact assessments that did turn out to exist didn’t exist after all. In any case, the European scrutiny committee were determined to get their money’s worth. With most of the Labour remainers unaccountably absent, the committee closely resembled the inner circle of the European Research Group. As well as the chair, Bill Cash, there were David Jones, Marcus Fysh and Andrew Lewer – all paid-up members of the 62-strong group of Tory MPs whose sole purpose in life is to declare war on the EU and to make the prime minister’s job almost impossible. To which you could also add Labour’s Kate Hoey. It’s only a matter of time before the ERG welcome her as an honorary member. It was the ERG members who dominated the session. They scent betrayal at every turn and had sent a warning letter to the prime minister earlier in the week threatening her with seven plagues and the loss of her job if she didn’t deliver on the will of the 62. Cash got things under way. If the transition period went on beyond December 2020 was it possible that Britain could end up paying more than the £39bn it had already promised? The useful idiot made the fatal mistake of trying to appear as if he knew what he was doing and predictably ran headlong into trouble. The government was very confident that a deal could be reached within that period, but if it couldn’t then, yes, we would probably have to divvy out a bit more. To any normal person this merely seemed a statement of the obvious. Not to Cash, who reddened with fury. In his world that could mean we would end up giving money to the EU indefinitely. “Servitude,” he muttered indignantly. “Vassal state.” Barrow tried to come to the rescue. He has the career diplomat’s knack of talking in aural valium, wittering on at length about not very much in a manner that makes you think you understand what he’s saying until you realise you can’t even remember what he said in the previous sentence. Still, 10 minutes of Barrow was enough to get the useful idiot back on track, and he was soon back to mouthing sweet nothings himself. He was sure everything was going to be fine because he had read a memo saying everything was going to be fine. Northern Ireland would miraculously sort itself out, and he was sure that we would be able to do free trade deals during the transition period apart from the ones we wouldn’t be able to do because we were engaging proactively going forward. The clock moved round to midday and the hearing came to an end. Still, it hadn’t been a total waste of time. The useful idiot had done his job by being a useful idiot. And the ERG had got a free session of anger management therapy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"games/2018/mar/14/tomb-raider-lara-croft-alicia-vikander-kickass-heroine","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T06:00:04Z","webTitle":"From kickass heroine to soppy student snowflake: the many lives of Lara Croft","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/mar/14/tomb-raider-lara-croft-alicia-vikander-kickass-heroine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2018/mar/14/tomb-raider-lara-croft-alicia-vikander-kickass-heroine","fields":{"headline":"From kickass heroine to soppy student snowflake: the many lives of Lara Croft","bodyText":"Lara Croft is one of the few video-game characters to have crossed over into real-world celebrity. As with James Bond, her various iterations have reflected the times. When the first Tomb Raider game was released in 1996, she was a sex symbol in sunglasses and a tank top, later featuring in Playboy and on the cover of style magazine the Face. Embodied by Angelina Jolie in the 2001 film, she is curvy and capable, kicking the collective ass of the Illuminati. In 2013, she was a shipwrecked student in torn cargo pants – an accidental metaphor for graduates struggling through the economic recession. Now, in a Tomb Raider movie out this week, Alicia Vikander plays a tearaway Croft dossing around in London. Although she is a multilingual archaeologist with extraordinary athletic abilities, it’s hard to call the original Lara a feminist icon. With her improbable proportions and minimal outfit (hot-pants and a tank top in the tundra?), she was a product for the male gaze. Women might have loved her, but she was all we had. The prevailing wisdom – now disproven – was that video games starring women wouldn’t sell. The game that became Tomb Raider originally had a male hero. Toby Gard, an artist working at Derby gaming company Core Design, suggested a female character and came up with the design for Croft. Ian Livingstone, then chairman of Tomb Raider’s publisher, Eidos, recalls that, while her exaggerated features prompted the most discussion, she was never designed to be a sex symbol. “While [Toby] was aware that most gamers were male, and lad mags were all the rage, he didn’t want to create a page three cyber-babe for Tomb Raider,” says Livingstone. “The Spice Girls were dominating pop culture and girl power was on the rise. Toby wanted to create an aristocratic woman who was strong, intelligent, independent, athletic and powerful.” Plummily voiced by Shelley Blond, the original Lara Croft was an upper-class English action hero with two guns and a talent for one-liners. The game saw her leaping from motorbikes on to speedboats in search of a lost Atlantean artefact. Due to its early 3D graphics and awkward controls, it hasn’t aged brilliantly – but at the time it blew critics away. “Lara is the perfect heroine,” enthused British games magazine Edge. It is embarrassing for video game fans that one of the most famous game characters was so obviously sexualised, but there was a disconnect between how Croft existed in the virtual world and how she was marketed in the real world. In the game, she was a gentlewoman, proficient with firearms, author of books. In merchandise and marketing, she was a big-breasted 3D model designed to lure teenage boys. A rumour that the first Tomb Raider contained coding that could remove Lara’s clothes became so notorious that it’s still commonly thought to be true. “I wasn’t a big fan of the way she was marketed then,” says Rhianna Pratchett, lead writer on 2013’s Tomb Raider, 2015’s Rise of the Tomb Raider and contemporaneous comics. “It wasn’t so much the sexualisation aspect that bothered me – it was pretty ubiquitous in the 90s – but the way she was being solely aimed towards male gamers.” However, Pratchett says, “that method of advertising undeniably worked in helping Lara become a household name.” Tomb Raider’s popularity was explosive: the first two games sold more than 13m copies and Croft became an international superstar. Her emergence coincided with the crossover of video games into mainstream culture; this was when Sony was marketing the first PlayStation at nightclubs. “Nobody imagined Lara would become a cultural icon who would grace the covers of lifestyle magazines, become a symbol of Labour’s Cool Britannia, or be a star on the silver screen,” says Livingstone. “But she gained celebrity status because the game was so good. Brands were queuing up to use Lara in their television adverts. Lucozade was even co-branded as Larazade for a time.” When Jolie took the title role in the 2001 film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, it represented the height of the character’s fame – becoming the highest-grossing video game movie (until it was outdone by Prince of Persia nine years later) and breaking records for a film with a woman in the leading role. However, Croft’s burgeoning fame was taking its toll on Tomb Raider’s developers at Core Design. They were asked to produce a game a year, and the quality began to decline. Released in 2000, Tomb Raider Chronicles sold 1.5m copies and did not impress players. This prompted Eidos to shift Tomb Raider from its British developers to a US studio for Croft’s second era, and Crystal Dynamics in California took over. Three moderately successful Tomb Raider games were released between 2006 and 2008, featuring a restyled Croft, who now had a ponytail instead of a braid, although the vest and skimpy shorts remained. As video-game audiences matured and started to expect more complexity, however, Tomb Raider’s next developers rose to the challenge. The Tomb Raider 2013 “reboot” set out to imbue Lara Croft with humanity – and vulnerability. “We were keen to give her a more relatable backstory that wasn’t based on having all the guns, gadgets and wealth to deal with any situation,” says Pratchett. “She’s cut herself off from her wealth and put herself through university, taking side jobs and living with her friends, the same way that millions of 21-year-olds do. We ditched the witty one-liners as Crystal felt they suggested confidence she didn’t yet have. We kept the traits people associate with Lara – bravery, resourcefulness, curiosity, tenacity - but rewound them to a point in her life where they are being properly tested for the first time.” Not everyone responded well to a Croft who was terrified instead of implacable in the face of danger. A scene depicting the first time Croft kills a man, in which a pirate’s hands start to stray threateningly down her body, sparked controversy. It is a well-worn trope that female characters’ strength must be forged by sexual assault. Narratively, the scene represents the moment when Croft transforms from victim into survivor, but it also marks the point at which the game pivots towards the more familiar and comfortable territory of action games – shooting and explosions – rather than Croft’s humanity. It says a lot about Lara Croft as a character that imagining her as a real human being was a challenging novelty. Although Camilla Luddington’s performance as the rebooted Croft had more range than the impassive star of the early Tomb Raider games, people couldn’t project their fantasies on to her as they once had. This is the Croft that Vikander plays in the new Tomb Raider film: the action heroine with friends, family history and a life beyond her escapades. Croft’s journey over the last 22 years has mirrored that of the video games industry – from commercial products marketed at adolescent boys to cultural creations that strive for narrative depth and significance. Pratchett no longer works on the Tomb Raider games, but she hopes the character continues to evolve. “I’d love to see an older Lara, maybe in her 50s,” she says. “I’d like to see how the tomb raiding way of life has changed her. “Male characters are allowed to get older during the course of their games, like [Metal Gear Solid’s] Snake and [Splinter Cell’s] Sam Fisher, but it doesn’t happen very often with female characters. Perhaps motherhood could even be explored. We are starting to see a lot of fathers and father figures in games, but not a lot of mums. Lara as a mother would throw up some interesting challenges.” Tomb Raider is in UK cinemas on 15 March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/13/extreme-winter-weather-becoming-more-common-as-arctic-warms-study-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T16:00:45Z","webTitle":"Extreme winter weather becoming more common as Arctic warms, study finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/13/extreme-winter-weather-becoming-more-common-as-arctic-warms-study-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/13/extreme-winter-weather-becoming-more-common-as-arctic-warms-study-finds","fields":{"headline":"Extreme winter weather becoming more common as Arctic warms, study finds","bodyText":"The sort of severe winter weather that has rattled parts of the US and UK is becoming more common as the Arctic warms, with scientists finding a strong link between high temperatures near the pole and unusually heavy snowfall and frigid weather further south. A sharp increase in temperatures across the Arctic since the early 1990s has coincided with an uptick in abnormally cold snaps in winter, particularly in the eastern US, according to new research that analyzed temperature data from 1950 onwards. Extreme cold winter weather is up to four times more likely when temperatures in the Arctic are unusually high, the study found. Researchers compared daily temperatures from across the Arctic region with something called the accumulated winter season severity index, which grades winter weather based on temperature, snow fall and snow depth, across 12 US cities. “There’s a remarkably strong correlation between a warm Arctic and cold winter weather further south,” said Judah Cohen, a climatologist at Atmospheric and Environmental Research. “It’s a complex story – global warming is contributing to milder temperatures but is also having unforeseen consequences such as this.” The Arctic has just experienced its toastiest winter on record, with parts of the region 20C (68F) warmer than the long-term average, a situation scientists have variously described as “crazy,” “weird,” and “simply shocking”. The far north latitudes are warming around twice as quickly as the global average, diminishing glaciers and sea ice and imperiling creatures such as polar bears. Two large winter storms recently swept the US east coast in less than a week, unloading up to three inches of snow per hour in places, resulting in several deaths, thousands of cancelled flights, closed schools and snarled traffic. The cold front even reached Florida, contributing to a recent surge in manatee deaths. So far this year, 166 of the marine mammals have been found dead off the state’s coast, with stress from the cold the leading cause of mortality. “Manatees may join polar bears as one of the first iconic victims of extinction in the wild from climate change,” said Jeff Ruch, executive director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility. The US storms follow freezing winds from Siberia – dubbed the ‘beast from the east’ – that battered parts of Europe, with the British army deployed to help liberate hundreds of stranded drivers on UK motorways. “This winter is a great example of what we can expect from climate change,” said Cohen. “In the US we had the ‘bomb cyclone’ in January, followed by July-like warm weather in February that I’d never seen before. And now we’ve had a parade of powerful winter storms and the beast from the east. It’s mind boggling.” The research didn’t look at the reasons behind the trend of see-sawing temperatures between the Arctic and areas to the south but Cohen said it was consistent with the theory that the polar vortex – which shot to public consciousness during a 2014 cold spell – is being disrupted as the earth heats up. The polar vortex is a low pressure system that swirls around the polar region. Sometimes it can stray further south, bringing cold Arctic air with it. There is continuing conjecture over the impact climate change is having but some scientists believe warming temperatures could be weakening the polar vortex’s flow, allowing it to meander towards the equator. This nuanced picture of the consequences of climate change has been derided by Donald Trump, with the president using Twitter to mockingly reference cold weather during almost every winter in recent years. In December, Trump tweeted that “perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming” amid plunging temperatures. Scientists say this stance overlooks the complicated changes underway in the environment as the world warms due to human activity, by an average of around 1C over the past century. This temperature rise hasn’t been uniform across the globe and has fueled an array of conditions, from increased flood risk in some areas to drought conditions and heatwaves in others. Richard Alley, a leading glacier and climate expert at Penn State who was not involved in Cohen’s research, said the study is “fascinating” and “important” but added the discrepancy between Arctic temperatures and winter weather elsewhere could have other drivers, such as a warm Gulf of Mexico feeding extra energy into storms along the US east coast. “The broadest picture is that we are indeed warming the world’s climate, primarily from carbon dioxide release from fossil-fuel burning, and this will impact us and other living things,” said Alley. The Arctic’s role is seen quite differently by some other scientists, however, who point out that occasional outbursts of cold weather haven’t altered the trend that winters in the US northeast have been getting warmer, particularly since the 1970s. “There have always been cold outbreaks. The cold air has to go somewhere,” said Kevin Trenberth, senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. “The issue is whether the air stays put or gets loose. Some years it is contained, other years it breaks out. The question is where and what is the cause. This study reaffirms the relationship but not its cause. The Arctic likely plays a modest role in terms of feedbacks but it is unlikely it is a cause.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/08/wojciech-szczesny-juventus-spurs-fans-went-missing-champions-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T22:30:21Z","webTitle":"Wojciech Szczesny: ‘The vocal Spurs fans went missing after 80 minutes’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/08/wojciech-szczesny-juventus-spurs-fans-went-missing-champions-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/08/wojciech-szczesny-juventus-spurs-fans-went-missing-champions-league","fields":{"headline":"Wojciech Szczesny: ‘The vocal Spurs fans went missing after 80 minutes’","bodyText":"Wojciech Szczesny made the point that “where others crumble” Juventus found a way to win, as the former Arsenal goalkeeper aimed a few lighthearted digs at Tottenham Hotspur. The Pole was an unused substitute in Juventus’s Champions League victory over Spurs at Wembley on Wednesday and it is fair to say he enjoyed himself after the second-half goals from Gonzalo Higuaín and Paulo Dybala turned the last-16 tie in his team’s favour. “I enjoyed it a lot,” Szczesny said. “There were a couple [of Tottenham] fans – very vocal – next to my bench, who went missing after the 80th minute, so yeah, I enjoyed it. Plus winning at Wembley is always special.” Szczesny, who joined Juventus from Arsenal in a £10m deal last summer, made the “chin up” gesture to Tottenham supporters as he walked towards the tunnel after the game and uploaded a celebratory picture to his Instagram account. “Great win and celebrations vs one of the best teams in north London?” he wrote. “Forza Juve! #northlondonisred.” The 27-year-old, who has kept 12 clean sheets in 16 starts in all competitions for Juventus, was diplomatic when asked about Arsenal. “I’m focused on my job at Juventus,” he said. “I still love Arsenal, I love the people and I wish them the best but to judge the situation is not appropriate.” Szczesny was more bullish when talking about the battle-hardened mentality at Juventus. “We’ve got players who have won the World Cup,” he said. “They’ve won six league championships in a row and you see that makes a difference in the difficult situations. Where others crumble, we manage to get out on top. “The players were relaxed throughout because we’ve been through it many times before. Even last weekend against Lazio we didn’t play the best of games and yet we stayed in it and in the 93rd minute, we scored the winner. That sort of belief right until the end gets you through games like Tottenham.

Will it stay that way?","bodyText":"There is always the danger of reading too much into any one election. Pundits and partisans try to divine the future through individual performance and assign momentum to one party or the other. Every election seems like the most important ever. So it goes with all special elections for congressional seats in the Trump era. Tuesday night’s was significant, however, regardless of whether Democrat Conor Lamb ultimately takes Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district over Republican Rick Saccone. (The result isn’t out yet, but Democrats have already declared victory). The two men, in a virtual tie, played the role of bellwethers for each of their parties. Lamb, given his performance, clearly came out ahead. The 33-year-old former marine and prosecutor matched Saccone, a state legislator, in a district Donald Trump won by nearly 20 points. Democrats hadn’t bothered to contest it in past cycles: Republicans won eight straight elections and the seat only became vacant once Republican Tim Murphy resigned after an extramarital affair and allegedly asking his mistress to have an abortion despite his pro-life views. Democrats all year have been outperforming the partisan leans of open congressional districts, one indication of a growing blue wave this November. Like Republicans raring up for the Tea Party wave of 2010, right in time for Barack Obama’s first midterm, Democrats are now fired up against a president who is remarkably unpopular with everyone except self-identified Republicans. Lamb is a moderate. He opposes abortion and abhors strict gun control laws in a suburban and rural district that hasn’t been hospitable to the left. It’s a district that also won’t exist much longer – the Pennsylvania supreme court struck down the state’s current congressional map as too gerrymandered in favor of Republicans. New district lines favorable to Democrats have been imposed. While Lamb outraised Saccone, the Republican benefited from heavier spending. Outside Republican groups poured in over $10m to defend Saccone and attack Lamb in a race that, just a few months ago, wasn’t believed to be competitive. Republicans can’t afford to spend so much on otherwise safe turf this year. If the outcome of this race demonstrates anything, it’s that Trump can only do so much for Republicans when his name isn’t on the ballot. His cult of personality isn’t transferable to the party. A raucous rally in the district, which like any Trump event ultimately served to feed his ego rather than prop up the candidate he was there to help, could not propel Saccone to obvious victory in a district he was supposed to lock down. This isn’t a problem unique to Republicans. In the Obama era, Democrats couldn’t muster much when their president didn’t appear at the top of the ballot. American politics is now predicated on backlash – a negatively polarized country perpetually voting against the other side, hoping desperately for single-party rule. The pendulum now swings in the Democrats’ favor. Republicans run the country but they won’t forever. It’s simple mathematics. For Democrats and progressives and anyone who prefers not see oligarchs and the most retrograde forces in society call the shots, the question is what’s next. Anti-Trump fervor can drive Democrats into a majority, but it won’t keep them there. It’s a sugar rush: nice for today and entirely ephemeral. Now is the time of good feelings. The resistance is strong. What happens when there is no Trump to resist anymore? Will Democrats grow complacent again? Will they allow districts like Pennsylvania’s 18th to return to safe Republican rule? Or will they seize power and keep it? No special election has the answer to those questions.

The housework myth","bodyText":"We never hear politicians or pundits arguing that men should be paid more than women. Yet this reality is fundamental to the organisation of our society. The mean gender pay gap for full-time work runs at 14.1%, rising to 18.4% if part-time work is included. And these pay gaps are just one aspect of the unequal division of wealth between the sexes. Women in Britain continue to undertake a greater share of unpaid caring duties within families, and are therefore more likely to work part-time or to not work at all. For these reasons, women’s share of the nation’s wage bill is even less than is implied by the pay gap. If we do not acknowledge the gendered nature of financial inequality in modern Britain, we cannot hope to change it. A historical perspective offers valuable insight into why unequal pay so resolutely persists. And it’s a custom that goes back a long way. In the Bible, the Lord tells Moses to place the value of female servants at three-fifths that of male servants. Papyrus from Roman Egypt reveals both a gender-specific division of labour and much lower rates of pay for women’s work. Setting women’s work at a lower value than men’s is not simply a characteristic of our own society. It has occurred in all human societies for which records exist. We encounter many different explanations for the ongoing gender pay gap: women work part-time; they take career breaks for family reasons; their work is low skilled; they work in the caring professions; they are under-represented in science and engineering. But these commonly cited explanations assume that pay is set according to the value of the work done in a straightforward and linear way. When we look at how men’s and women’s labour has been rewarded in the past, we are forced to drop that comforting assumption. For hundreds of years, virtually all work has been segregated by gender, and men have always been paid more. Occasionally men did physically demanding work, which might command a wage premium. But for the most part their jobs did not call for special skills or strength that only men possess. Why did men weave, and women spin, and, anyway, who is to say which task required the greater skill? If men are suited to heavy work, why was laundry work always women’s work, given its physical demands? Why was driving a tram man’s job? When the tram drivers left to fight the first world war it quickly became apparent there was nothing in the work that women could not do. In truth, there was rarely anything innate to the work itself that made some jobs male and others female, it was custom and tradition that determined who did what. Men’s jobs were paid at a higher rate because men did them and men were responsible for maintaining their families, not because the job in question was inherently more valuable. Meanwhile, low female pay made it very difficult for a woman to live independently. It forced her into a position of dependency on, first, her father and, later, her husband. These customs were consolidated with the Industrial Revolution. Whereas most work in pre-industrial England was carried on inside the home, the mechanisation of work involved the construction of large, expensive machinery and mills and factories to house them. As a result, paid work started to move outside the home and this created much sharper divisions between “housework” and work – between unpaid domestic work by women, and paid employment undertaken by men outside the home. Yet the perception that women’s work was less valuable than men’s was carried forward into this new world. Indeed, it was given a new lease of life. According to the Victorians, women were “naturally” inclined towards motherhood and home, while men were “naturally” destined to govern, conquer and work. And low female wages were not simply an expression of this worldview, they also helped to create it. High wages in the factory districts had initially caused women to abandon the home for the mills. Low wages were vital in ensuring that women remained in the home performing the necessary tasks of the household – fetching water, making fires, shopping, cooking, child-rearing and cleaning. Low pay was not simply a convenience for employers; it also played a critical role in ensuring men’s continued dominance over women in all spheres of life. The burden of housework has eased over the past century, with ever smaller families and modern appliances. But all homes – and particularly those with children – still require some domestic labour. We can pay for childminders and cleaners to do this labour; or we can do it ourselves for free. But it does need to be done. For centuries, high male wages and lower female wages have formed a central plank in ensuring that every household has some female labour available for cooking, childcare and cleaning. Today’s gender pay gap plays an important role in maintaining the status quo. It is little surprise, then, that the Equal Pay Act of 1970 has struggled to usher in a new world in which men and women earn equal pay. A historical perspective allows us to see that pay is connected to much deeper questions about paid and unpaid work. It is only by grasping the true extent and deep historical roots of unequal pay that we might take meaningful steps to address it. • Emma Griffin is professor of modern British history at the University of East Anglia and presenter of Mind the Gender Pay Gap on Monday 12 March, BBC Radio 4, 8pm"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/08/guardian-view-trump-steel-tarifffs-more-smoke-than-fire-editorial","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T21:46:49Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Trump’s tariffs: more smoke than fire | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/08/guardian-view-trump-steel-tarifffs-more-smoke-than-fire-editorial","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/08/guardian-view-trump-steel-tarifffs-more-smoke-than-fire-editorial","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Trump’s tariffs: more smoke than fire","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s decision to slap tariffs on steel and aluminium imports was intended to cause quite a stir, and it has. There have been warnings of a 1930s-style trade war from the head of the World Trade Organization, Roberto Azevedo. There have been threats from the European Union that it will retaliate and has US peanut butter and Levi jeans (among other things) in its sights. And it has cost Mr Trump his chief economic adviser, the former Goldman Sachs executive Gary Cohn, who resigned from the White House in protest. Although he says that trade wars are good and easy to win, Mr Trump is taking bigger risks than he appears to think. If tariffs lead to higher prices for US consumers, the result may be higher inflation and sharper increases in interest rates from the Federal Reserve, America’s central bank. What’s more, the tariff announcement comes at a time when federal tax cuts are set to boost demand in an economy already operating at close to full employment. As imports rise and the US trade deficit widens, Mr Trump will be tempted into further protectionist measures. If, as seems likely, China is the real target for the president’s action, he is going about things in a typically ham-fisted way, since China is not even one of the top 10 sources of US steel imports. There are better ways of dealing with the global glut of steel that has made life tougher for plants in the US and Europe, but they would involve collaborative action at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris. Mr Trump is not big on collaborative action. All that said, talk of a full-blown trade war, let alone a return to the dark days of the 1930s, is wildly overblown. First, steel and aluminium account for only 2% of world trade, so the impact of Mr Trump’s planned tariffs will have only a modest impact. Second, the other big global trade players are – for now at least – likely to be restrained in their response. Both the EU and China are export-led economies and Mr Trump is betting that in any eyeball to eyeball confrontation Brussels and Beijing would blink first. He is probably right about that. Finally, the state of the world economy is different from the 1930s. Back then, the tit-for-tat protectionism triggered by the imposition of the US Smoot-Hawley tariff in 1930 helped deepen the slump. Today the global economy is growing at its fastest pace since the financial crisis of a decade ago. Yet Mr Trump’s tariffs are significant for all that. They show that there will be no return to the period between the tearing down of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of Lehman Brothers, when globalisation was in the ascendant. Voters in the US and elsewhere no longer believe that free movement of goods, people and money are guarantors of rising prosperity. Stagnant real incomes, flatlining productivity and hollowed-out communities have taught them that there are costs to outsourcing production to countries that pay scant attention to labour rights and use the state to subsidise cheap exports. Mr Trump has tapped into the sense that trade is part of an economic system that seems configured to favour the rich and powerful. The fact that Mr Cohn was troubled by the president’s tariffs but not by his egregiously pro-rich tax cuts will do little to shake this belief. In an ideal world, trade would be governed by the doctrines of Adam Smith and David Ricardo. International specialisation and comparative advantage would lead to more efficient production, stronger growth and higher living standards. Countries would unilaterally tear down the barriers to trade. But this is not the way the world actually works. Trade is managed rather than free. Politicians – Mr Trump excepted – talk the language of Smith and Ricardo but act like Alexander Hamilton, whose life has found fame in the hit musical today but is also the original 18th-century architect of US protectionism. Not everybody gains from trade, and some gain a lot more than others. So if there is a trade war Mr Trump will be not the only one to blame. Those who trumpeted the benefits of globalisation said the benefits would be fairly shared. They have not been. They said there would be help for those who lost well-paying jobs. It never arrived."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/21/gambling-exclusion-app-gamban-software-tackling-online-betting","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T07:00:06Z","webTitle":"'A vicious circle I couldn't break': the software helping tackle online betting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/21/gambling-exclusion-app-gamban-software-tackling-online-betting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/21/gambling-exclusion-app-gamban-software-tackling-online-betting","fields":{"headline":"'A vicious circle I couldn't break': the software helping tackle online betting","bodyText":"“I self-excluded from the major online casinos but there was always a new company I could open with and some of them don’t make it easy to self-exclude,” says Michael, a bricklayer from Glasgow, who started betting on football and greyhounds when he was 15, before developing a serious gambling addiction. “I’d never even been to a casino but once I started playing roulette on FOBTs (fixed-odds betting terminals) in the bookies it became a serious addiction and the only way to satisfy it was to play more – mainly through online casino accounts,” he says. “I lost control, I was wasting the majority of my money every month.” Hundreds of thousands across the UK are faced with similar gambling addictions, which have only been exacerbated by the explosion of betting apps, with the number of problem gamblers up more than 50% since 2012. “Gambling is everywhere – on your phone, tablet, computer – 24/7, 365 days a year; constantly in your pocket or by your bed,” says Jack Symons, co-founder of gambling exclusion software Gamban. “People are finding it increasingly difficult to quit as it’s such a powerful and addictive source of stimulation and escapism. It’s like a drug ... it’s difficult to explain to someone who hasn’t experienced it first-hand.” Faced with this challenge Michael, like 10,000 of the UK’s 430,000 problem gamblers, turned to software to help kick the habbit. Gamban blocks more than 40,000 gambling sites and applications from users’ devices, and, by using a live database, it also removes the gambling element, skins betting, from e-sport games. “It was the best thing I ever did, allowing me to cut out the online casinos from my life,” said Michael. “I felt I would go through the rest of my life slipping up every now and then until I installed Gamban on my laptop.” Since Tony Blair’s liberalising reforms, the gambling industry has been able to not just meet, but to stimulate demand. Unlike many other developed countries, high stakes games are available anywhere on your smartphone in the UK. Through adverts, push notifications and bonus offers, these apps constantly remind you to have a flutter. When the opportunity to relapse is a mere click away, many people find it incredibly difficult to give up gambling. Self-exclusion struggles While individual operators run their own self-exclusion schemes, they only apply to casinos they operate, and recovering addicts have even received targeted ads attempting to lure them back after they have started to abstain. Self-exclusion schemes at high street bookmakers have also been shown to be flawed, and thousands of people who had attempted to voluntarily ban themselves from gambling have still been able to access their accounts online. “A responsible gambling company could put themselves in a situation where they ‘irritate’ the player with [responsible] initiatives that are designed to help them,” says Symons. “And so they may lose the player who is constantly bombarded with bonuses and incentives to join competing online casinos and who don’t have the same duty of care.” As a consequence, Symons claims that gambling companies have been very receptive to Gamban and other forms of exclusion software, because it removes the competitive disadvantage that comes with acting responsibly. The gambling industry is planning its own online multi-operator self-exclusion scheme, called Gamstop, for Spring 2018. But it will only apply to UK-licensed companies meaning many casinos will fall outside of its remit. “An effective solution for a problem gambler may be using Gamstop and Gamban in conjunction, possibly alongside therapy or other treatment options,” says Symons. Gamban isn’t the only gambling-blocking software available, but it is among the cheapest, costing £10 per year while others cost around £50 to £150 annually. “One of the reasons we started gamban was because we felt it was wrong to charge people so much money at their lowest point,” says Symons, who founded Gamban in 2015 following his own troubles with gambling. Gamban started out free for the first two years, and the current charge is a nominal fee reflecting the founders’ underlying desire to help problem gamblers while keeping the business sustainable – and they are offering it to students for free. It’s no panacea, but the majority of reviews online are positive across Android, Mac OS and Windows, with some users attesting to the transformational effect it can have. The software needs constant fine-tuning, and for now it can simply be removed from an iPhone – something Gamban is working with Apple to try and fix this spring, which will be a first for gambling exclusion software. Abstinence-based recovery from gambling addiction is closer than ever, and the software has already changed countless lives. “I tried to block sites online but I had joined so many casinos that I lost count and half of those I had excluded from just let me back anyway. It was a vicious circle that I could not break,” says Karina, a 68 year-old who had gambled compulsively online for 11 years until installing Gamban. “It is my saviour and that of many others also. It has allowed me to carry on with my life.” Some names have been changed"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/08/trump-round-table-meeting-will-blame-gun-violence-on-video-games-and-tv","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T18:46:55Z","webTitle":"Culture crusaders: who's who in Trump's gun violence roundtable","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/08/trump-round-table-meeting-will-blame-gun-violence-on-video-games-and-tv","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/08/trump-round-table-meeting-will-blame-gun-violence-on-video-games-and-tv","fields":{"headline":"Culture crusaders: who's who in Trump's gun violence roundtable","bodyText":"As Donald Trump convenes a meeting on Thursday to address violence in video games, in the wake of last month’s Florida school shooting, those in attendance will include a group that argues the Muppets drink too much, and another committed to exposing strident liberal bias on television. The president’s round table at the White House will be the latest in a series of discussions on school safety after a gunman left 17 dead at Marjory Stoneman high school in Parkland on 14 February. And although representatives of the mainstream Entertainment Software Association and executives from other gaming parent companies are slated to attend, they will be seated across from a bevy of culture crusaders who have sought to tie mass shootings to violence in video games and movies – despite decades of research failing to produce such a link. In attendance will be retired Lt Col Dave Grossman, the author of Assassination Generation: Video Games, Aggression, and the Psychology of Killing, a book that purports to “reveal how violent video games have ushered in a new era of mass homicide”. Grossman characterizes himself as an expert in “killology”. Also present will be Melissa Henson, an advocate from the Parents Television Council, a group that has stood in staunch opposition to depictions of or allusions to sex and violence in entertainment. The PTC has previously attacked TV content such as Britney Spears and Rihanna performing suggestively at a music awards show and lobbied the airline industry to protect passengers as “a captive audience” forced to witness a “barrage of adult-oriented entertainment” in in-flight entertainment. And even the Muppets have not escaped the PTC’s wrath. In 2015, the group released a study claiming that children who watched The Muppets “were exposed to adult-themed content every three minutes and 38 seconds during the first four episodes”. Meanwhile, Brent Bozell, the founder of the conservative Media Research Center, will also participate. Bozell is a longtime critic of the gaming industry, but at the same time a staunch opponent of gun control. “Somehow, Democrats isolate the inherent evil of a gun almost as if it’s self-shooting, while denying our violent media has any influence on these under-21 shooters,” he once said. Much of Bozell’s work has been dedicated to proving widespread liberal bias in both the media and entertainment industry. Trump has himself pointed a finger at violence in video games and entertainment while discussing school shootings, stating days after Parkland: “I’m hearing more and more people say the level of violence on video games is really shaping young people’s thoughts.” Although the president has called for stricter gun measures in the wake of Parkland, he has repeatedly wavered on what proposals he would sign into law. Last week, Trump drew the ire of conservatives for embracing new age restrictions for purchasing certain firearms and universal background checks, prompting his aides to privately reassure Republicans that the president was not firmly committed to the ideas. The only lawmakers expected at Thursday’s meeting are Representatives Vicky Hartzler of Missouri and Martha Roby of Alabama, both Republicans who oppose new gun safety measures. The Florida senator Marco Rubio, who has proposed a set of modest gun safety reforms since Parkland, will also attend. Dan Hewitt from the Entertainment Software Association, which represents companies including Ubisoft, Nintendo, EA and Activision, said his group hopes its attendance will help steer a “fact-based conversation” about video game ratings. But he denied the games themselves were responsible for gun violence. “Video games are plainly not the issue: entertainment is distributed and consumed globally, but the US has an exponentially higher level of gun violence than any other nation,” Hewitt said. Other participants include Patricia Vance, the president of the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), a non-profit body for the video game industry in the United States, which includes the assignment of age ratings to video games and mobile apps. In a statement on Thursday, the White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the purpose of the event will be “to discuss violent video-game exposure and the correlation to aggression and desensitization in children”. “This meeting will be the first of many with industry leaders to discuss this important issue.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/09/donald-trump-hints-that-australia-can-still-win-exemption-on-steel-tariffs","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T00:22:30Z","webTitle":"Australia can still win exemption on metal tariffs, Trump hints","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/09/donald-trump-hints-that-australia-can-still-win-exemption-on-steel-tariffs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/09/donald-trump-hints-that-australia-can-still-win-exemption-on-steel-tariffs","fields":{"headline":"Australia can still win exemption on metal tariffs, Trump hints","bodyText":"Donald Trump has given his strongest hint yet that Australia will be exempt from US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. The US will impose a 25% tariff on foreign steel and a 10% tariff on foreign aluminium imports, the president announced at a media conference at the White House on Thursday. Trump, who was flanked by steel workers as he made his announcement, said Canada and Mexico will be exempt from the tariffs and allowed a 15-day negotiation period for countries such as Australia to win similar treatment. Earlier in the day he made strong hints that Australia would be given special consideration. “We’re are going to be very fair, we’re going to be very flexible, but we’re going to protect the American worker,” he said before a cabinet meeting in Washington. “We’re negotiating with Mexico, we’re negotiating with Canada. We have a very close relationship with Australia. We have a trade surplus with Australia. Great country, long-term partner. We’ll be doing something with them. We’ll be doing something with some other countries.” But when it came to the formal announcement there was no mention of Australia. Trump said if Canada and Mexico would lose their exemption if the US did not get what it wanted in talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. Robert Lighthizer, the US trade envoy, will be leading negotiations with countries that want to be exempted from the tariffs. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said the government was “very encouraged” by the news but stressed there was “a bit further to go” over the next 15 days. Cormann said the Turnbull government had been wise to work calmly behind the scenes to secure an exemption, rather than fuelling tensions and speculation about a possible trade war. “We were very perturbed earlier in the week when the alternative view put forward by [Labor leader Bill Shorten] was to essentially escalate matters through retaliatory action,” he said. On Friday last week, when Australia was taken by surprise by Trump’s announcement that he wanted to impose tariffs, trade minister Steve Ciobo warned that Australia reserved the right to doing anything necessary to protect the national interest if it wasn’t exempted from the tariffs. Labor backed that view on Monday. Trump’s proclamation came on the same morning that Australia signed the renegotiated 11-country Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which is expected to take effect by the end of the year. The deal affects goods worth US$14tn. It covers Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. Speaking at the signing ceremony in Chile, Ciobo said legislation to formalise the pact would be introduced to parliament this month, before a joint standing committee an inquiry into the TPP. He expected Australia’s domestic processes to be settled by the end of September. “This is a very good day for trade,” Ciobo told a media conference in Santiago on Friday. “We are sending a mutual signal that we recognise the policy orthodoxy of trade.” The deal had been on life support after the US withdrawal but was resuscitated in January after lobbying from Japan and Australia. Labor also announced a new plan on Friday to strengthen Australia’s anti-dumping legislation in an attempt to prevent foreign companies dumping cheap steel into Australia. The party said it would triple the penalties for dumping cheap overseas steel and other products in Australia if it won the next federal election. It would give the Anti-Dumping Commission an extra $3.5m a year to make sure countries were not pouring below-cost steel into Australia. But the Turnbull government insists the changes aren’t necessary. Labor’s leader, Bill Shorten, said Trump’s plan posed a real risk to the Australian steel industry. “Labor will not let Australia become a dumping ground for cheap foreign goods sent here by trade cheats,” he said. The commission would be given 30 extra staff and the new responsibility for monitoring sudden and large increases in imports. He said Australia was lagging behind other countries, imposing just 24% duties on dumped steel in 2015 while the US imposed 256%. “Australia rarely imposes anti-dumping penalties in excess of 30%,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/08/four-minute-miles-forgotten-man","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T18:16:43Z","webTitle":"Four-minute mile’s forgotten man | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/08/four-minute-miles-forgotten-man","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/08/four-minute-miles-forgotten-man","fields":{"headline":"Four-minute mile’s forgotten man","bodyText":"The death of Michele Hanson has deprived us of a unique voice (Letters, 6 March).

The remote-controlled bands usually wrap around the legs or waist and are occasionally deployed to immobilize prisoners who turn violent or try to escape, despite ethical and safety concerns. Terry Lee Morris was not violent during his 2014 trial in Tarrant County, near Dallas. But George Gallagher, the judge, grew vexed when Morris demanded that Gallagher recuse himself. “Are you going to follow the rules?” Gallagher asked. Morris replied: “I have a lawsuit pending against you.” “Hit him,” Gallagher told a bailiff, who pressed the button to activate the belt. “Are you going to behave?” Gallagher then asked Morris, who responded, “I have a history of mental illness.” “Hit him again,” the judge said. Morris, who was convicted of soliciting the sexual performance of a minor and sentenced to 60 years in prison, was zapped once more after attempting to fire his attorney. But an appeals court in El Paso, Texas, reversed the conviction on 28 February and ordered a new trial on the basis that the judge was using the belt unconstitutionally, to “enforce decorum” rather than to subdue a dangerous man. Justice Yvonne Rodriguez wrote that “electrocuting a defendant until he provides the judge with behavior he likes” is an abuse of power. The court added that since Morris had been removed from the courtroom, he was too scared to return and refused to leave his cell, and therefore his constitutional right to attend his own trial was impaired. Rodriguez added that if it allowed such judicial conduct to be left unaddressed, it risked a “drift from justice into barbarism”. Morris’ trial attorney, Bill Ray, told Texas Lawyer, which first reported the story, that he had not objected to the use of the belt because his client had acted like a “loaded cannon ready to go off”. In a follow-up report by the Washington Post, Gallagher declined to comment, citing “judicial ethics”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/08/kfc-returns-to-original-supplier-after-chicken-shortage-fiasco","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T18:36:09Z","webTitle":"KFC returns to original supplier after chicken shortage fiasco","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/08/kfc-returns-to-original-supplier-after-chicken-shortage-fiasco","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/08/kfc-returns-to-original-supplier-after-chicken-shortage-fiasco","fields":{"headline":"KFC returns to original supplier after chicken shortage fiasco","bodyText":"KFC has gone back to its original recipe for chicken deliveries by rehiring Bidvest Logistics in the wake of last month’s supply fiasco. The American fast food chain was forced to temporarily close hundreds of stores after it ran out of chicken following the botched handover of its logistics contract to DHL and QSL. “To put it simply,” KFC tweeted at the time, “we’ve got the chicken, we’ve got the restaurants, but we’ve just had issues getting them together.” Bidvest lost out to its rivals when the contract was put out to tender in 2017, but on Thursday it announced that it had won some of that business back, after signing a long-term agreement to supply around a third of KFC’s 900 restaurants. “We are delighted to welcome KFC back to Bidvest Logistics,” said its business unit director, Paul Whyte, who could not resist a dig at its rivals’ failings. “As the UK’s leading food service logistics specialist, we understand the complexities of delivering fresh chicken … We will provide them with a seamless return to our network.” A small number of KFC outlets remain closed while others are offering a limited menu. The company said it had taken the decision to re-engage Bidvest as it tried to get “back to business as usual”. “Our focus remains on ensuring our customers can enjoy our chicken without further disruption,” said a KFC spokesman. “With that in mind, the decision has been taken in conjunction with QSL and DHL to revert the distribution contract for up to 350 of our restaurants in the north of the UK back to Bidvest Logistics. “The decision will ease pressure on DHL’s Rugby depot, to help get our restaurants back to normal as quickly as possible. As its stands, over 97% of our 900 restaurants are now open for business, although there will be some limited menus before we are back to business as usual.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/06/my-favourite-film-decade-1990s-seven-being-john-malkovich","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T05:00:25Z","webTitle":"From Seven to The Matrix – why the 1990s is my favourite film decade","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/06/my-favourite-film-decade-1990s-seven-being-john-malkovich","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/06/my-favourite-film-decade-1990s-seven-being-john-malkovich","fields":{"headline":"From Seven to The Matrix – why the 1990s is my favourite film decade","bodyText":"After the daring American new wave film-making of the 70s and the glittery excess of the 80s, the following decade played out like something of a compromise, with a rise in both audacious indie auteurs and flashy big-budget blockbusters. In the 90s, Hollywood grew in confidence and income, allowing for a broader spectrum of entertainment, and in 1999 it hit a new peak with a year commonly looked back on as one of the best ever, a greatest hits of what the decade had to offer. But the secret to many of the biggest 90s successes are embedded in some of the hits that concluded the decade before. The pop phenomenon that was 1987’s Fatal Attraction – which, adjusted for ticket price inflation, made a staggering $364m (£258m) in the US – led to a subgenre of insidious thrillers that planted a nefarious outsider into a seemingly perfect vision of domesticity and then let them wreak pet-killing havoc for our entertainment. While the formula became rusty by the mid-90s, it was big business as the decade began; and some sharply crafted, highly suspenseful examples – including Cape Fear, Pacific Heights, The Hand That Rocks the Cradle and Single White Female – played on recession-era fears of losing a carefully constructed middle-class lifestyle. The mid-budget, grown-up thriller was a staple throughout the 90s in a way that we rarely see now, with star vehicles such as Basic Instinct, In the Line of Fire, The Game, Breakdown, The River Wild, Arlington Road and A Perfect Murder all providing excitement without resorting to hollow effects. The thriller also found its way into the Academy’s favour (something it has struggled to do since) with nominees including Primal Fear and A Simple Plan and winners including Misery, The Usual Suspects and The Silence of the Lambs. The latter led to a smattering of horrifyingly effective serial killer films which went from the lurid fun of Kiss the Girls and Copycat to the nightmarish brilliance of Seven. Another vital late-80s success came from Steven Soderbergh, whose lo-fi drama Sex, Lies and Videotape won the Palme d’Or at Cannes in 1989 and kicked off a new generation of American indies. Three years later, Quentin Tarantino’s Reservoir Dogs premiered to wild acclaim at Sundance and the director’s figure loomed large over the 90s, for better or worse. While there was an increasingly tiresome procession of substandard crime pics that followed, there was also an independent renaissance with risk-taking mini-studios providing an outlet for a long line of eager, unconventional film-makers from around the world. Aside from Tarantino, the decade saw debuts from David Fincher, Darren Aronofsky, Sofia Coppola, Paul Thomas Anderson, Takashi Miike, Wes Anderson, John Singleton, Jonathan Glazer, Alexander Payne, Spike Jonze, Lynne Ramsay, Christopher Nolan, Richard Linklater, Baz Luhrmann, Guillermo del Toro, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Nicole Holofcener and Alejandro Amenábar to name but a few. Imagine cinema today without them. It was a decade that found room for film-making renegades to edge their way from the outskirts into plain view. Would the 80s have been so accepting of Michael Haneke’s brutal thriller Funny Games, Todd Haynes’ disturbing drama Safe, Danny Boyle’s uncompromising zeitgeist-catcher Trainspotting, Pedro Almodóvar’s thrilling heartbreaker All About My Mother and Thomas Vinterberg’s shocking Cannes hit Festen? Or would it have allowed for the return of Terrence Malick, whose soulful epic The Thin Red Line remains one of the greatest war films ever made? The rise of independent cinemas worldwide gave audiences easier access to films that challenged them like never before and shifted the system. The late-80s growth of high-concept family films such as Big and Who Framed Roger Rabbit? also opened the doors for a decade of PG-rated films that didn’t feel patronisingly targeted. We had mini-franchises such as Home Alone, Sister Act, The Addams Family, Wayne’s World and Father of the Bride; star showcases like Mrs Doubtfire, Groundhog Day, The First Wives Club, Death Becomes Her and Hocus Pocus; and gems from Disney’s sports division like Cool Runnings and The Mighty Ducks. It was also a banner period for the studio’s animated output, with Aladdin and The Lion King alongside the birth of Pixar gifting us the Toy Story franchise. Given the oversaturated state of the superhero genre today, it’s hard to remember a time when capes and codpieces didn’t dominate the multiplex – but in the 90s they were few and far between. Aside from a smattering of pre-Nolan Batman entries (including Tim Burton’s wonderfully grim 1992 sequel) and a few failed franchise starters, the floor was open for blockbusters that weren’t trapped in an airless cinematic universe. Audiences were gifted the groundbreaking thrills of Jurassic Park, the goofy B-movie pleasure of Independence Day, the ingenious sci-fi of The Matrix, the adrenaline rush of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, the wisecracking fun of Men in Black and the sub-Hitchcockian intrigue of Mission: Impossible. While there was an inevitable rise in CG spectacle throughout the decade, there were also enough action films that felt more grounded in their staging with Speed, True Lies, The Fugitive and The Long Kiss Goodnight all playing out with far less computer-borne sheen than we would see now. While the romantic comedy is now something of a loveless genre, the 90s saw charming meet-cutes all over the place. There was the advent of the Working Title Britcom (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill), the Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan decade bookenders (Sleepless in Seattle and the charming, underrated You’ve Got Mail), the postcard-perfect sojourns (Marisa Tomei in Only You, Meg Ryan in French Kiss), the ones with the high-concepts (It Could Happen to You, The Truth About Cats and Dogs, While You Were Sleeping) and anything starring Julia Roberts (who went from charming ingenue in Pretty Woman to backstabbing villain in My Best Friend’s Wedding). It was also a peak decade for gangster films (Goodfellas, Casino, Donnie Brasco, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels) and while the first half of the 90s was a wasteland for the horror genre (save for Bernard Rose’s haunting Candyman), Wes Craven’s groundbreaking meta-shocker Scream kickstarted a slasher revolution in 1996. Then followed Scream 2, I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Faculty and Halloween H20, all helping to make scaring people profitable again, a rediscovery that has remained vital to the industry until now. And if anything could justify the 90s as the best decade on record, it was the year of 1999 that provided us with one of the all-time great years. Take a deep breath: Magnolia, The Sixth Sense, The Matrix, Being John Malkovich, Three Kings, Fight Club, Eyes Wide Shut, The Iron Giant, Toy Story 2, The Talented Mr Ripley, Run Lola Run, The Blair Witch Project, The Thomas Crown Affair, Buena Vista Social Club, Drop Dead Gorgeous, Boys Don’t Cry, Beau Travail, Topsy-Turvy, The Straight Story, American Pie, Go, Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, Office Space, Audition, Rushmore, Summer of Sam, Election and All About My Mother. It was a year like no other, and one that we haven’t come close to since. There’s a reason 90s nostalgia has been inescapable of late, and why so many of the decade’s films are being rebooted or reworked. It was a time that found room for both the arthouse and the multiplex to shine, a game-changing period that’s worth revisiting without the need for irony. What’s your favourite film decade?

A House of Commons report later accepted that he was “orchestrating and inciting” terrorist attacks in Britain, but could not discover how imminent the attacks were or the legal basis for his killing. His British associate, Junaid Hussain, was killed by an American drone. Two years later, Hussain’s widow, Sally Jones, and their 12-year-old son were similarly wiped out. No trial preceded these executions of British citizens on foreign soil. They died by executive action for being a threat to national security. If we assume someone in Moscow took the same view of Russian spy Sergei Skripal, what is the difference? The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, implied this week that Britain was now a victim of Russian “acts of war”, notably cyber-attacks. He implied that if the Skripal case was traced to the Kremlin, he would “look again at sanctions”. He is right that the murder of anyone on a British street is terrible and, if sanctioned by a foreign power, is, in diplomatic jargon, “unacceptable”. But murder is a criminal act against individuals. It is silly to merge it into an act of war. Khan and Hussain were apparently involved in much savagery in Syria and in plotting terrorism in Britain. Yet there was no indication that killing them was the sole way of preventing further crimes. Hussain’s wife appears to have been extremely unpleasant on social media. But Britain is not at war with Syria – any more than Russia is at war with Britain. For governments to go about the world killing people without judicial process offends every international law, even if not much can be done about it. But for a British government to kill its own citizens without trial defies Magna Carta. When, in 2011, President Obama authorised the drone execution in Yemen of the US citizen and al-Qaida propagandist Anwar al-Awlaki, it provoked outrage as an offence against American liberty. Obama claimed Awlaki “posed a continued and imminent threat to US persons or interests”. The result was years of legal dispute, the case championed by the American Civil Liberties Union and the New York Times, no less. In Britain there was no outcry at the killings of Khan and the Hussains, just a mumble from the opposition. We were merely told that 21 passports had been revoked from unnamed Britons, presumably to leave them vulnerable to drone killing. This suggests the Home Office accepted that a passport ought to confer judicial protection. The absence of any legal debate of drones is a sure sign of a guilty Whitehall conscience. Do such doubts appear at the defence ministry? In December the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, advocated the drone killing of “all” British citizens on the wrong side in Middle East wars. The implication is that UK citizens abroad cannot consider themselves immune from extrajudicial killing by their own government, should they meet with government disapproval. Does this include gangsters on the Costa Brava? Both these sagas may fall into the category of small earthquake, not many dead. What is indefensible is the hypocrisy on the British side. Both are instances of the arrogance of power taking the law into its own hands. I imagine Vladimir Putin and his henchmen view turncoat spies such as Skripal as “enemies of the state” wherever they live. That Skripal was the beneficiary of a spy swap would hardly have mattered in what appears a squalid vendetta. Putin would barely have to wink for him to be targeted. This is why it seems pointless to respond to his machismo with the parliamentary bombast of Britain’s foreign secretary. A Salisbury park bench is not the invasion of Poland. In proportion, drone killings are far more significant. Britain is not threatened by Syria or Iraq. We have been bombing these countries largely at the behest of the Americans, and doing so as an alternative to a painful commitment of troops on the ground. If this means demolishing a whole block (and everyone in it) to take out one sniper, so be it. To the British government, at least British soldiers were not at risk. It is estimated that about 6,000 civilians have been killed by coalition bombs in the past three years alone. I sense that the real difference between Syria and Salisbury is sadder. It is that we view killing from the air as somehow more “legitimate” than killing on the ground. The drone is clean, digital, hi-tech, “targeted”, even if it slaughters innocent people in the process. Since faulty technology can be blamed if missiles miss, airborne death is somehow more acceptable than ground-level massacres by “terrorists”. In reality we are back to the old maxim that the AK-47 is the poor man’s B-52. But the AK-47 is at least more accurate – as is Russian poison. If Moscow had used a British drone against Skripal, it might have done to Salisbury cathedral what drones have done to the ancient sites of Mesopotamia. In just three and a half years, British taxpayers have spent a staggering £1.75bn bombing Isis-held towns. The cost of the bombs alone (£268m) is more than was spent on British humanitarian relief in Iraq. These drones have now been “at war” for 10 years. Since they are considered risk-free (to our side) and “hyper-asymmetric”, they can go anywhere, at anyone’s bidding. They show no respect for law or jurisdiction. They are strictly foreign policy for psychopaths. In comparison, Putin in Salisbury looks like a wimp. • This article was amended on 9 March 2018. An earlier version said that “the costs of the bombs alone (£268m) was more than the sum spent on British humanitarian relief in the entire theatre” (of war). That reference should have been to the sum spent in Iraq."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/08/how-shadow-chancellor-morphed-from-shady-trot-to-businesss-bff","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T17:07:32Z","webTitle":"How shadow chancellor morphed from shady Trot to business's BFF | John Crace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/08/how-shadow-chancellor-morphed-from-shady-trot-to-businesss-bff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/08/how-shadow-chancellor-morphed-from-shady-trot-to-businesss-bff","fields":{"headline":"How shadow chancellor morphed from shady Trot to business's BFF","bodyText":"No speaker could have asked for better warm-up acts. Both Liam Fox and Rebecca Long-Bailey had been greeted in near silence as they opened the annual conference of the British Chambers of Commerce. Long-Bailey because no one – not even herself – really seemed to know who she was and Fox because everyone knew precisely who he was. After a much-needed coffee break, the chief executive of an energy company then put everyone into a coma by talking repeatedly of “prosumers”. No one had a clue what he was talking about. Or cared, for that matter. A woman in front of me turned to her colleague and said: “Much more of this bloke and I’ll celebrate International Women’s Day by going shopping.” So the stage was set for John McDonnell. Thanks both to the government’s apparent insistence on pursuing a hard Brexit and the Labour party’s recent enthusiasm for remaining in a customs union, the shadow chancellor has morphed from being an untrustworthy Trot to the businessperson’s friend and saviour. It’s an unlikely transformation that appears to have taken McDonnell by surprise every bit as much as it has small business leaders. The shadow chancellor started off by talking about the need for women to break “the glass seagull” – shades of Eric Cantona at his most cryptic – before going on to say how much he loved small businesses. His audience momentarily purred. If he had left it at that, along with a brief reference to how Labour would give them the Brexit they wanted, he might have left to a standing ovation. Instead, he went into a mini-rant about the evils of banks and large corporations. Neither of which small businesses have any great affection for, but nor were they what anyone had particularly come to engage with. They can moan about those things quite easily on their own. What they wanted was reassurance and plenty more strokes. The romance between McDonnell and small business is still at a tender stage and loud and frequent expressions of devotion are still both expected and required. They’re still dating but no one is certain the relationship will last. The final speaker before the lunch break was the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, who has made a career of never making concessions to anyone. When she looked out at the BCC delegates from the conference stage, what she saw was a bunch of spineless wimps who were so busy moaning about the difficulties of Brexit that they were blind to its possibilities. She was there to inject a “can-do” spirit. Brexit was a done deal, she said. So people just had to stop living in the past. Even for Foster, this was a bit brazen as few people have spent more time living in the past than the DUP. Only it’s a highly selective version of the past. Foster came across quite powerfully when she spoke of the IRA shooting her father and blowing up her school bus, and she was clearly in no mood to forget. Other than about the things she was quite happy to forget about. How Northern Ireland had voted to remain in the EU. How the DUP had always vehemently opposed the Good Friday agreement she now apparently found herself so keen to preserve. How she wanted Northern Ireland to be subject to exactly the same rules and regulations as the rest of the UK apart from stuff like abortion and same-sex marriage. Things like that. She also forgot to mention just how she imagined a frictionless border between Northern Ireland and the Republic might work without a customs union. Though to be fair, that’s something the prime minister and every member of the cabinet also seem to regularly forget. “Any questions?” asked the BCC host presenter nervously.

The police officer who was exposed to the nerve agent used on the Skripals, named on Thursday as DS Nick Bailey, remained in a serious but stable condition. Bailey was described by Wiltshire’s temporary chief constable, Kier Pritchard, as “a massively dedicated officer”. Pritchard said Bailey was “very anxious, very concerned” but sitting up in bed and talking. The prime minister, Theresa May, said: “We are all thinking of him, his family, friends and colleagues – and the two other victims – at what is an incredibly difficult time. “The events of Sunday are a stark reminder, if ever one was needed, of the dangerous situations our emergency services face and the dedication and courage they display every day in order to keep us safe.” Earlier, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, described the use of a nerve agent in a busy city centre as “attempted murder in the most cruel and public way” as pressure on the government and police for answers continued to grow. Forensics officers began a major search for evidence at Skripal’s semi-detached house. They also cordoned off the graves in Salisbury cemetery where Liudmila and Alexander Skripal were both interred, and sealed off a garage and recovery service elsewhere in the city. Rudd condemned the poisoning of Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, as a “brazen and reckless act”. They remained “unconscious and in a critical but stable condition” in hospital, Rudd told MPs. She refused to give details of the agent used in what Scotland Yard has said was an attack specifically targeting the Russians. She said experts at the government’s laboratory at Porton Down had positively identified the substance. “It is very rare,” she said. The use of a nerve toxin, usually only held in state military stockpiles, is being seen as a key indicator of possible Kremlin involvement. On Thursday, the Russian embassy in London sent a sarcastic tweet, saying of Skripal: “He was actually a British spy, working for MI6.” Moscow has repeatedly denied it has anything to do with the attack, the same line used when the FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned in 2006 with a radioactive cup of tea. A public inquiry a decade later ruled the Kremlin had ordered the hit. The Salisbury attack left Skripal and his daughter in a comatose condition last Sunday afternoon, on a bench in the Maltings shopping centre. Detectives will be seeking to establish how the toxin was delivered – and, crucially, where. One source suggested that Bailey was exposed to the nerve agent from inside Skripal’s house and not in the city centre, as was previously thought. It is understood that the cordon at the cemetery is in place primarily to keep media away from the graves of Liudmila Skripal, who died of cancer in 2012 aged 59, and Alexander Skripal, who died in March last year in St Petersburg, aged 43. There was no sign of activity taking place on the site, but the family’s run of ominous bad luck is likely to prompt police to examine whether Liudmila and Alexander may have been victims of foul play. Police sealed off a new location on Churchfields industrial estate about five minutes by car from Skripal’s home. Officers in protective suits could be seen in the yard of Ashley Wood vehicle recovery services, and paramedics stood by. One car they looked at was a BMW that was partially hidden under a tarpaulin. It is understood that Skripal drove a BMW. Officers from the counter-terrorism command removed boxes from the site. Friends of Yulia Skripal’s in Moscow described her as an intelligent young woman, fluent in English and Spanish, as well as Russian. They said her comfortable life was destroyed in 2004 when her father – a career officer in GRU military intelligence – was accused of spying for MI6. “We were all totally shocked when her father was jailed,” her school friend Irina Petrova told the Guardian. “These were very tough years for Yulia. She was deeply affected by her father’s sentence.” On the ground in Salisbury, detectives have divided the investigation into three separate sites: the Skripals’ home, the Mill pub, where they had been drinking, and the Zizzi restaurant where they had eaten before collapsing at around 4.15pm. New photographs taken at 5.10pm showed the aftermath of the police operation, minutes after Skripal and his daughter were taken to hospital. Officers in ordinary uniforms were working at the scene and members of the public were strolling nearby. None of the police wore protective clothing. Unlike in the case of Litvinenko, who was poisoned with slow-acting polonium, detectives got to the scene in Salisbury quickly. Hundreds of officers are examining CCTV footage from the city centre and building a detailed timeline of events. Speaking to ITV’s Good Morning Britain, Rudd said: “Whatever attribution takes place in the future, we have to make sure we have all the evidence. The key thing is to have a cool head and allow [those investigating the incident] to continue that job, which they are doing with speed and with detail and with the support of professionalism we can expect.” Asked if she believed the poisoning was a Russian assassination attempt, Rudd said: “I’m determined to wait before any attribution [is made] until we have the facts. I’m completely confident that the police will be able to get that.” The defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, told the programme that Russia was “becoming an ever greater threat”. He declined to say, however, whether he held Russia responsible for the attack, saying only: “What’s happened is absolutely disgusting and it is so important we give the police the space and opportunity to do a proper and thorough investigation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/mar/08/nicola-sturgeon-scottish-youth-theatre","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T17:02:39Z","webTitle":"Nicola Sturgeon will 'explore all options' to halt Scottish Youth Theatre closure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/mar/08/nicola-sturgeon-scottish-youth-theatre","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/mar/08/nicola-sturgeon-scottish-youth-theatre","fields":{"headline":"Nicola Sturgeon will 'explore all options' to halt Scottish Youth Theatre closure","bodyText":"Nicola Sturgeon has promised to “explore all options” to keep open Scottish Youth Theatre after it announced it would be forced to close this summer because of a failure to secure regular funding from Creative Scotland. The pioneering theatre group, whose alumni include Gerard Butler, Karen Gillan and Douglas Henshall, confirmed on Wednesday that it had been left with “no realistic option” but to cease trading on 31 July, as the funding gap for 2018-21 represents a third of its required income. Speaking during first minister’s questions on Thursday, Sturgeon said that while the Scottish government has no say over Creative Scotland’s funding decisions, the announcement was “of serious concern to people across Scotland and to me”. Questioned by the Scottish Greens leader, Patrick Harvie, who also described how the theatre group has “enriched and transformed” the lives of young people across the country since it was founded 41 years ago, Sturgeon said that she had already asked the Scottish ulture secretary, Fiona Hyslop, to meet with the SYT. Sturgeon went on: “While I can’t give detail about what those options might be, today I certainly give a commitment that we will do everything we can to fully explore all options to allow young people in the future to benefit from the Scottish Youth Theatre in the way that young people in the past have done.” Henshall, recently acclaimed for his role in Network at the National Theatre, described the cuts as “baffling”. He told the Guardian: “The SYT was a place that, in the most encouraging of ways, introduced and nurtured the possibility that acting was a career for the likes of me and thousands of other young people who had thought it impossible and impenetrable.” Creative Scotland said that it was disappointed by SYT’s announcement and that it was “fully committed to supporting access to creativity for young people”. The funding body has been subject to heavy criticism over the past few months for a series of controversial decisions about who would receive public funds over the coming three years, with the fallout leading to the resignation of two board members. Ruth Wishart and Maggie Kinloch stepped down amid anger that the funding list omitted a number of respected youth and disability arts companies as well as two hugely respected musical ensembles. Following the resignations and a reconsideration of the initial applications, Creative Scotland announced it would restore funding to the Dunedin Consort, Scotland’s premier baroque ensemble, as well as the children’s theatre groups Catherine Wheels and Visible Fictions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/09/morning-mail-landmark-challenge-to-nt-clearing","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T20:15:18Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: landmark challenge to NT clearing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/09/morning-mail-landmark-challenge-to-nt-clearing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/09/morning-mail-landmark-challenge-to-nt-clearing","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: landmark challenge to NT clearing","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 9 March. Top stories A landmark court case in the Northern Territory is set to consider a challenge to a massive land-clearing approval based on its impacts on climate change. The case, brought by the Environment Centre NT, is believed to be the first of its kind in Australia, using the consideration of greenhouse gas emissions to seek to have an approval overturned. “I think it’s groundbreaking,” said Shar Molloy, the centre’s director. In November 2017 the NT government approved the clearing of 20,432 hectares of land on Maryvale station – an area more than three times the size of Manhattan. Despite the regulator concluding the clearing would make “a considerable contribution to the NT’s annual greenhouse gas emissions” it decided a full environmental assessment was not needed. British police say 21 people have now been treated as a result of the nerve agent attack on the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, with the home secretary, Amber Rudd, describing the attempted murder as “brazen and reckless”. Rudd said the father and daughter, 66 and 33, were still unconscious and in a critical but stable condition, as forensic officers moved to cordon off the graves of the Skripal’s wife and son in a Salisbury cemetery. Amid mounting speculation that the attack was ordered by the Kremlin, Rudd said: “This was attempted murder in the most cruel and public way … the investigation now involves hundreds of officers following every possible lead to find those responsible.” The police officer left seriously ill after attending the poisoned pair was named as DS Nick Bailey, who is now sitting up in bed and talking. Donald Trump is pushing ahead with plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports – a plan that threatens to undermine decades of liberalisation of international trade – but has also hinted at an exemption for Australia. “We have a very close relationship with Australia,” he said. “We have a trade surplus with Australia. Great country, long-term partner. We’ll be doing something with them.” The US president met with metal industry executives and workers at the White House on Thursday to discuss the controversial levies, but officials from China and Europe have threatened retaliation if Trump goes ahead. His administration has framed the tariffs as an issue of national security. Victoria and NSW have become the first states to join the commonwealth’s redress scheme for child sexual abuse survivors in a significant win for the prospect of a truly national response. The announcement means at least 15,000 people abused in government institutions will be able to access compensation, counselling and other support. A further 21,000 would be covered if churches, charities and other institutions operating in NSW and Victoria opt in, according to government figures. Malcolm Turnbull urged reluctant states to follow Victoria and NSW’s lead and “make sure that this national tragedy is never repeated”. A new child protection report has found surging rates of substantiated notifications, care and protection orders, and out-of-home care, with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and remote areas continuing to be over-represented. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report found that one in 32 Australian children were subject to a protection investigation or response last financial year. Sport Pauline Menczer, the former world surfing champion who was inducted into the Australian Hall of Fame this week, now drives a school bus.

It is the intentional first step on a long road undertaken with a view to the next generation. Thinking time It’s the golden age of television drama but the ABC is missing in action, writes the Sydney author Lauren Carroll Harris. As streaming giants ride the global upswing in long-form serialised storytelling, the cash-strapped national broadcaster has stepped away from homegrown drama as a programming staple. From 157 hours of locally made drama in the late 1990s, when SeaChange was on the box, to just 70 hours in 2017, Harris laments the ABC’s loss of “plentiful, sustained, serious, culturally diverse, narrative-based dramas that tap the pulse of life and society”. “We had to pull all the videos down. [We had people saying] ‘You deserve to die.’” After Mark Latham used social media to brand the Bankstown Poetry Slam “Islamic political ranting”, organisers have had to hire security guards and request undercover police for the first time. “He portrayed all of these young people turning up – having the balls and the skills to speak their mind in a really interesting manner – as Islamist hate speech,” said an organiser. Most schools hold assemblies and start social-media campaigns for International Women’s Day. But less than 24 hours later, girls are still dealing with the consequences of living in an unequal world while it’s back to business as usual for the boys, writes the high school student Grace Lagan. “The apathy towards feminism they’re developing extends far beyond lazy indifference and into misogynistic attitudes, which are shared by some of the teenage boys and girls I know. I see these views manifest among my peers, growing from jokes and nasty quips into something much deeper, and more dangerous.” What’s he done now? CNN is reporting that Donald Trump is upset with the White House, press secretary Sarah Sanders, over her response to reporters’ questions regarding the president’s alleged affair with Stormy Daniels, in which she seemed to confirm that it took place. “POTUS is very unhappy,” the White House source told CNN. “Sarah gave the Stormy Daniels storyline steroids yesterday.” Media roundup The Age has an exclusive interview with the woman who accused Melbourne’s former lord mayor Robert Doyle of sexual harassment.

If small amounts of pure agent can be recovered, scientists at Britain’s military research lab at Porton Down will analyse them for telltale impurities that can potentially reveal which process was used to make the agent, and hint at where it was produced. Nerve agents are made in several steps, and each one creates byproducts that are carried over to the next stage of the reaction, meaning that the final agent usually carries a chemical signature of how it was made, and sometimes the equipment used in manufacture. “Porton Down will certainly be trying to look at environmental samples which will provide the best sort of clue,” said Alastair Hay, an environmental toxicologist at Leeds University who investigated the use of chemical weapons against Iraqi Kurds in Halabja in 1988. “They’ll be looking for impurities and inadvertent reaction products and those would give some indication as to the possible method of manufacture.” But the procedure, known as impurity profiling, is far from straightforward. For the analysis to work, scientists need samples of pure nerve agent collected from clothes or the crime scene. Any contamination, for example from soil, saliva, food or drink, may well frustrate any attempt to read the impurity signature. While blood and urine samples can help identify the nerve agent itself, the forensic signature of the impurities is lost once the agent passes through the body. “To do impurity profiling you need the pure agent and not something that’s been contaminated,” a chemical weapons expert told the Guardian. “You might take it from the clothing, but dirt or even exposure to the atmosphere can mean a lot of the signature is lost.” If scientists can collect enough of the pure nerve agent to analyse for impurities, they may be able to work out which chemical route was used to synthesise the agent. And that could be vital. “I’m sure that the scientists at Porton Down will have a reasonable idea of the different routes to manufacture, and who might be using which process and this will obviously help,” said Hay. If they have built up a library of nerve agents made by labs around the world, they can search it for an impurity signature that matches the material used in Salisbury. Another avenue for tracing the nerve agent to its source draws on a forensic method used to track the origins of illegal drugs. To work out whether heroin comes from Afghanistan or South America, scientists have analysed the drug for slightly different isotopes, or atomic forms, of hydrogen. The same approach can, in principle, be used to trace the origins of nerve agents, because hydrogen in different parts of the world have subtly different ratios of isotopes. But chemical forensics may only reveal so much. “They will probably try to do it, every little piece helps, but I would bet on more traditional methods of tracing the source,” the chemical weapons expert said. “I’d say it’s difficult, if not downright impossible to do.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/08/paralympicsgb-kelly-gallagher-special-atmosphere-alpine-skiinin-pyeongchang","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T18:32:35Z","webTitle":"Winter Paralympics: meet the Britons going for gold in Pyeongchang","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/08/paralympicsgb-kelly-gallagher-special-atmosphere-alpine-skiinin-pyeongchang","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/08/paralympicsgb-kelly-gallagher-special-atmosphere-alpine-skiinin-pyeongchang","fields":{"headline":"Winter Paralympics: meet the Britons going for gold in Pyeongchang","bodyText":"In her decade-long career as a ski racer Kelly Gallagher has suffered more than her fair share of injuries. A broken foot, a torn knee, spinal bruising and concussion are on the list. Last year, during training for the World Para Alpine Skiing Championships in Italy, a bad landing left her with a dislocated elbow and three fractured ribs. This week she is in Pyeongchang, part of the ParalympicsGB team once again, and ready to fling herself down yet more mountains at 75mph. “I feel really lucky to be here,” says Gallagher, whose victory in the super-G at Sochi in 2014 is Britain’s only gold medal at the Winter Paralympics, the latest edition of which begins on Friday. “The injury was probably the most significant I’ve had to deal with. Physically I was ready in July, I had full range in my elbow. I was really enjoying the slower disciplines, in slalom and giant slalom. But I had this fear, I suppose. I was carrying around this anxiety and I wasn’t really pushing through it. I’d look at my GPS data and think: ‘Oh, gosh, that’s really slow.’” Gallagher is visually impaired, the result of oculocutaneous albinism, a rare condition which strips melanin from the hair, skin and eyes. That she would ski at all is a mark of her fortitude. To get back on her feet time and time again, to do so and then win, helps make her exceptional. The 32-year-old from Northern Ireland is modest and winning, not shy of interjecting a celebratory “yay” when she hits upon a matter that excites. And when it comes to the mental blocks she had to push through to recover form, she is also strikingly honest. “What I was feeling wasn’t actually fear, it was a worry about what would happen if I injured myself again,” she says. “It was about being a burden on people or disappointing them. It was quite a strange thing to realise. Obviously I’d been so poorly when I was hurt that you don’t want to put yourself in that position again. There’s half of you that wants to keep yourself safe. Then there’s the other half that wants to get back to enjoying the speed. Our process now all depends on how much fun we can have.” The “we” in this instance is Gallagher and her guide Gary Smith, who replaced her long-standing partner Charlotte Evans in 2016, another big change to adapt to. “It’s a different turn-shape and a different size of person to follow,” she says. “He’s not so blond either. There’s less attention from the lads than usual ... No, it’s different but it’s exciting. I think it was hard to get going and you get frustrated because you want to be at the very top immediately. That’s probably been difficult for Gary because there was lots of expectation on us, but actually we’re doing quite well with the relationship we’ve got.” Gallagher initially missed out on the ParalympicsGB squad and confirmed her place only last month. She joins Menna Fitzpatrick and the 19-year-old Millie Knight in the women’s Alpine skiing team, and Gallagher believes the future is bright. “It just shows how Paralympic sport is developing,” she says. “Instead of having blind people who are maybe taking up skiing in their 30s, we’ve got young kids who have been skiing since they were three. In me, Millie and Menna we’ve got three who are pushing for the podium. Hopefully we can inspire and be role models for younger girls out there thathave a visual impairment. It means that they can get out there and whether it’s painting or music or sport, they just know that they can do it.” Since Channel 4 began broadcasting the Paralympics in 2012 the Games have widely been credited with changing perception of disability in the UK. Gallagher, who insists coverage is vital if such progress is to continue, says that Paralympians also have a lot to learn from each other. “This sounds really crazy but until a couple of years ago, I could never plait my hair,” she says. “Then I saw a girl plaiting her hair with one arm. I was like, if she can do her hair with one arm, I can. That’s just a simple example of how you can watch somebody and think: ‘They’re doing something incredible with a lot less than I have.’ “On the chairlift today there was another fella with cerebral palsy and he was saying: ‘I really respect you blind skiers.’ So we all inspire each other. Every athlete at the Paralympics has overcome certain challenges and different challenges. You can respect and understand where they’ve come from, there’s a mutual understanding and that’s across the board. I do think it’s a really special atmosphere to be part of.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/15/killing-season-geoffrey-robinson-army-indonesian-genocide-jess-melvinreviews","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T07:30:30Z","webTitle":"The Killing Season; The Army and the Indonesian Genocide reviews – the truth about one of the 20th century's worst massacres","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/15/killing-season-geoffrey-robinson-army-indonesian-genocide-jess-melvinreviews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/15/killing-season-geoffrey-robinson-army-indonesian-genocide-jess-melvinreviews","fields":{"headline":"The Killing Season; The Army and the Indonesian Genocide reviews – the truth about one of the 20th century's worst massacres","bodyText":"Joshua Oppenheimer’s 2012 documentary The Act of Killing follows a cabal of ageing hoodlums around the city of Medan, in north-west Indonesia. Between 1965 and 66, they had enthusiastically joined militias across the country that garrotted, stabbed and mutilated to death at least half a million suspected leftists. Almost half a century later, they bragged openly about their exploits to Oppenheimer, for state propaganda since the late 60s has lionised the killers as heroes, and demonised the victims as godless communist traitors to the nation. This polemically cinematic film – the first of two he made about the massacres – has transformed awareness of these events in the west and galvanised debate within Indonesia. It has shone a light on acts of exceptional cruelty, and on their intimate connection with the thuggish political culture of Indonesia today. Oppenheimer felt, as he amassed the film’s footage, as if he had “wandered into Germany 40 years after the Holocaust, only to find the Nazis still in power”. As an activist, Oppenheimer has focused his talents on dramatising the horror and toxic contemporary afterlives of the Indonesian mass murders. His films have raised consciousness of the killings, but do not address their historical context. Only a few brief on-screen paragraphs at the start of The Act of Killing sketch some of the key events: the imposition of military dictatorship in late 1965, the crackdown on the Indonesian left, the murder of perhaps as many as a million “communists” by the army and civilian death squads, the killers’ enjoyment of impunity in Indonesia since. Two new books, one by Geoffrey Robinson and the other by Jess Melvin, now fill out this history. Between them, these authors tell us why one of the worst blood-lettings of the 20th century took place, who was responsible, and why, until recently, these events garnered such little international attention. Before he became a history professor, Robinson was Amnesty International’s head of research for Indonesia, and his book skilfully combines a human rights advocate’s anger with academic rigour. His story begins in the twilight of Indonesia’s colonisation by the Dutch and the Japanese, and takes in the turbulent first two decades after its independence in the 1940s. He describes the military saturation of Indonesian society during the war with the Dutch, and explains the country’s instability on the eve of the 1965 massacres, as three political forces (the excitable nationalist first president, Sukarno; the US-trained army; a huge Communist party influenced by the radical, defiant stance of Mao’s China) faced off. Robinson also narrates, in heartbreaking detail, the grotesque, predominantly non-mechanised violence of the killings: death by decapitation, disembowelling, stabbing, genital mutilation, impaling, strangling. He adjudicates carefully between divergent interpretations of one of the most confusing events of the cold war: the alleged coup of 1 October 1965, in which six Indonesian generals were kidnapped and killed under mysterious circumstances. General Suharto – the second president, architect of the military crackdown of 1965-66 and of the dictatorial New Order that ruled Indonesia between 1966 and 1998 – accused the Indonesian Communist party of orchestrating the attempted putsch and used this allegation to justify exterminating the Communists “down to the roots”. It now seems likely that the coup was planned by a small, secretive cell within the Communist party and the army, but there was no widespread planning for state capture among the party’s rank and file. Only one aspect of the coup is clear: it became a pretext for “the killing of half a million people, mass incarceration of more than a million others, and the complete annihilation of the left”. Though the scope of her book – which is focused on the evolution of the massacres in Aceh, a province in north Sumatra – is narrower than Robinson’s, Melvin makes an essential point about the violence. For decades, Suharto’s New Order government taught Indonesians that the killings were a “spontaneous” uprising “by the people”, fuelled by righteous anger at “Communist” treachery. Through hard work, determination and a stroke of archival luck (a boxful of documents that the Indonesian intelligence agency carelessly gave her), Melvin shatters Suharto’s 50-year-old propaganda story. The “Indonesian genocide files”, as she calls the intelligence archive, confirm a narrative of army culpability: the mass murders of 1965-66 could not have taken place without the army’s centralised operation to “carry out non-conventional warfare … [to] succeed in annihilating … together with the people” communists and their supporters. Robinson agrees that “without the army’s logistical and organisational leadership … the mass killings could not have happened”. But he is also concerned with wider culpability for the violence, and points the finger particularly at the US and British governments who – for reasons of cold war realpolitik – facilitated the army’s crackdown. They waged a devious campaign of psychological warfare before, during and after the massacres, in the hope of giving the army a pretext to act against the communists, and to suppress accurate reports of the murders. US diplomats and the CIA’s Indonesia station left little to chance: they gave the army money, mobile radio equipment and lists of Indonesian communists. Robinson and Melvin demolish Indonesian state orthodoxy on the country’s modern history, undermining with cool historical detail the legitimacy of political authoritarianism after 1965. But these two books have an importance far beyond Indonesian studies. They revise our definition of genocide, draw conclusions about the close links between militarism and mass violence, and remind us forcefully of the nefarious interventions of western powers at cold war turning points. • Julia Lovell’s latest book is Splendidly Fantastic: Architecture and Power Games in China (Strelka). • The Killing Season: A History of the Indonesian Massacres by Geoffrey Robinson is published by Princeton.

The script, with the working title of The Many Saints of Newark, has been purchased by New Line and will be set against the backdrop of the Newark riots of the 1960s. It was written by Chase and Lawrence Konner, who has previously written for The Sopranos and Boardwalk Empire. “David is a masterful storyteller and we, along with our colleagues at HBO, are thrilled that he has decided to revisit, and enlarge, the Soprano universe in a feature film,” New Line’s chairman, Toby Emmerich, said. According to Deadline, details are scarce but the script will see some familiar characters from the show appear. The HBO drama ran for six seasons, winning 21 Emmys and making stars of James Gandolfini and Edie Falco. In 2016, Chase spoke about the possibility of a prequel with Deadline. “I’ve said it from the beginning: if I had a really good idea and I thought it could be really entertaining and it wouldn’t upset what was done I might do it,” he said. Last year, when speaking to Entertainment Weekly, he suggested that he was more open to the idea. “I could conceive of maybe a prequel of The Sopranos,” he said. “I could never see [a return of the show] except as a prequel.” Since the end of The Sopranos, Chase wrote and directed music drama Not Fade Away in 2012. It received mainly positive reviews yet was a box office disappointment, making just $600,000 from a $20m budget. The 1967 Newark riots saw four days of looting and violence that led to the deaths of 26 people. They were the result of a long-running feeling of disenfranchisement among black people who had been racially profiled, subjected to violence from the authorities, and denied opportunities. The inciting incident was an act of police brutality against a black taxi driver."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/09/journalists-italian-mafia-jan-kuciak-slovakia","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T12:30:35Z","webTitle":"Journalists are risking all to expose the Italian mafia.

They must be protected","bodyText":"The Italian mafia extended their tentacles into eastern Europe a long time ago. So anyone who was surprised by the death last month of the Slovak journalist Ján Kuciak was not paying attention. Kuciak, the second journalist to be murdered in Europe in recent months, was found shot dead alongside his partner, Martina Kusnirova, at their home on 25 February. Like Daphne Caruana Galizia in Malta, Kuciak appears to have paid the price for his investigative reporting. At the time of his death, he had been working on a story on the influence of the Calabrian mafia, the ‘Ndrangheta, on business and politics in Slovakia. Mafia organisations were the first western businesses to develop long-term relationships with communist regimes and used them to gain a foothold in the east. Although they could not buy property during communist rule, the mafia could rely on two other things: political corruption, to facilitate their illegal traffic, and a near monopoly of the black market in western goods illegally smuggled into eastern bloc countries. This is why, when the Berlin wall came down, Italian crime organisations were perfectly placed to help legitimate Italian companies expand their operations into eastern Europe. They became “business consultants” to these companies, operating like services agencies, helping them to navigate bureaucracy and expediting permits. In addition, crime bosses provided cheap labour and ensured no interference from the unions – a true paradise for business investors. Kuciak was one of the few journalists trying to investigate the murky links between businesses in Slovakia and the ‘Ndrangheta. In a country where there is no crime of mafia association, the issue had been largely ignored by both law enforcement and politicians. Calabrian businesses associated with the powerful Bova Marina clans arrived in Slovakia soon after the fall of the Berlin wall to take over swathes of the country’s agricultural businesses and use them as cover to claim EU farm subsidies, without the government intervening. But the business of most interest to the Italian mafia in eastern Europe is arms. Of all the eastern European countries infiltrated by the mafia, the former Czechoslovakia had an asset that made it especially attractive: the VZ-58, an assault rifle that can fire 30 rounds without being reloaded, a variation on the Soviet-made AK-47, but less expensive. The extensive arsenal of the former Czech army became the Italian mafia’s most lucrative business opportunity. Slovakia was not an isolated case: the mafia’s arms business extended across the whole of eastern Europe. And while the flow of drugs from the east traditionally went through Slovak territory, low-cost tourism opened up Bratislava to a younger, affluent market. Unprepared for the influx of cash-paying tourists, the city’s hotels and restaurants, prostitution and gambling rings – as well as the drugs trade on the streets – were being run by organised crime cartels. If the ‘Ndrangheta, as suspected, executed Kuciak, it would be a first for the Calabrian mafia. They have never been known to attack a journalist before. One theory is that the killing was ordered by Italian mafiosi, but that the hit men were Slavs. The manner of the execution was inconsistent with Italian mafia style: carried out in Kuciak and his partner’s apartment rather than in a public place, to draw as much attention as possible. In recent years the mafia has preferred to destroy journalists’ reputations rather than resort to murder. If this was a mafia execution, it suggests that whatever information Kuciak had uncovered was so big it warranted his being silenced, whatever the cost. A killing like this would carry a high price in terms of police crackdowns and media attention, both of which would make it harder for the mafia to do business. But they will have decided that the sacrifice was necessary to protect more important, perhaps longer-term, interests. The execution of Kuciak also sends a message to others: “none of you is invulnerable”. Killing journalists could be considered a strategic error, because the silencing instantly confirms the thesis the journalist was working on. But this only matters when campaigners and the media manage to keep the spotlight on the issue – and unfortunately, this is hard to sustain. The mafia knows that these days, the murder of a journalist will bring just a few days of indignation and stories in the national news pages. The murder of Kuciak, a courageous young reporter doing his job, caused an outpouring of shock and international coverage. But nothing was done to protect him when he was alive – and this is the real scandal. Journalists are isolated, exposed, dragged through the courts accused of defamation, or sued for libel, like Daphne Caruana Galizia. In Europe, as in Latin America, the only journalist offered unconditional support is a dead one. • This article was amended on 8 March 2018 to correct the reloading capacity of the VZ-58 rifle."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/09/empty-nest-syndrome-young-adults-parents","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T06:00:28Z","webTitle":"Don’t fall for the panic about empty nest syndrome | Gaby Hinsliff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/09/empty-nest-syndrome-young-adults-parents","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/09/empty-nest-syndrome-young-adults-parents","fields":{"headline":"Don’t fall for the panic about empty nest syndrome","bodyText":"No more wet towels on the bathroom floor, and no more empty juice cartons drained, only to be carefully replaced in the fridge. No more doors slamming at 3am, no more coming home to a noisy crowd of strangers around the kitchen table, no more wondering who swiped all the phone chargers. There’s nothing so eerily quiet, says a friend whose youngest has just moved out, as a family house that no longer has children in it. Absence is everywhere, even if all they really did when they were there was disappear mysteriously off to their rooms. But if adjusting to an empty nest can be tough, it seems there is one thing tougher: a formerly empty nest that promptly fills back up again. According to research from the London School of Economics, parents whose grown-up children don’t actually manage to leave – who move out, only to bounce right back again – are actually less happy than those whose fledglings heartlessly fly off without a backwards glance. At the risk of giving poor Generation Z yet another thing to feel guilty about, quality of life for parents of boomerang kids fell on average by about 0.8 points on the LSE researchers’ scale, or roughly the sort of drop you’d expect of someone diagnosed with an age-related disability. Happy Mothering Sunday, everyone! The idea that the end of hands-on parenthood might not actually be the end of the world – that it might, in its way, even be liberating – still feels faintly taboo. For women in particular, it’s only one scary step away from acknowledging that motherhood is not necessarily the defining purpose of our lives; that much as we would die for our children, we are not solely defined by them and might eventually want or need something else for ourselves. It’s still so much more socially acceptable to talk about the heartbreak and the guilt and the hot tears shed on the first day of school than to acknowledge the tiny, thrilling whoosh of liberation that often accompanies that solo walk back across the playground; the mornings when closing the door on the domestic chaos felt like sweet relief. But if parenthood is one long bittersweet process of watching the person you love most walk away and desperately pretending not to mind, then the sweetness as well as the bitterness should be more honestly acknowledged. The unvarnished truth is that there are days, particularly with small children, when bedtime frankly can’t come soon enough; when you’d give your right arm just for two uninterrupted hours with a book, or the ability to walk to the shops without stopping to inspect every single ant on the pavement. To deny these feelings in the name of some soppy, idealised view of parenthood is to deny the thing that actually makes it worth idealising, which is the herculean effort required to stick with it even on days when all you want to do is lock yourself in the loo and scream. The visceral longing to be with your children is equalled in its ferocity only by the longing, at least occasionally, for a break. No wonder so many boomerangers’ parents feel what the LSE researchers rather dramatically called a “violation in the equilibrium” when their overgrown babies come trailing back. For one suspects their resistance isn’t just about the longing to have a spare bedroom again, or take up a hobby, or even spend a bit more time at the office. (The great payback for clinging on to work throughout the frazzled early years of motherhood, an older and wiser colleague once told me, is that at least it’s there for you when you need it later; it was her stay-at-home friends who struggled with a sense of emptiness when their kids left home, while she felt years of guilt lifting from her shoulders now that she no longer had to rush home.) It’s the sense that something fundamental is wrong here. If good parenting is ultimately about making yourself redundant, and giving your squawking fledgling the means to fly off and make its own way in the world, then a grown child who fails to launch feels at some deep level like a failure for all concerned – even when it’s not a failure of their making. Like one of those nagging midlife pains that hints at underlying injury, this niggling parental anxiety hints at a deeper sickness: a society that is holding families back from doing what they were naturally designed to do. A quarter of young British adults now live with their parents, more than at any time since records began in 1966. But more shockingly, this is no longer just about the young. They may carefully avoid mentioning it in the office, but around a quarter of a million people aged between 35 and 44 still live at home with their parents and the idea that that can all be blamed on helicopter parents making it too easy for their pampered little darlings not to grow up is grotesque. Midlife divorce, redundancy, insecure gig-economy work and straightforward poverty all play their part in driving what were once perfectly functioning grownups back to their teenage bedrooms to sleep under their old Take That posters and wonder what happened to their lives. Even among younger boomerangers, it’s not just the lure of getting their washing done that draws them home; it’s the ridiculous cost of housing and the increasingly hand-to-mouth nature of working life that actively contrive to push them back. Boomerang kids are admittedly luckier than those for whom going back home is sadly not an option. But when choosing to live with your mum is the only feasible way of coping with an insecure job, or with the preposterous costs of renting in the city where all the jobs are, then that’s not much of a choice. As the old saying has it, home is still the place where when you have to go there, they have to take you in. But a healthy and successful society shouldn’t be sending quite this many overgrown children scurrying back for refuge, and nor should it leave quite this many parents feeling bad about it. • Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/12/albatross-film-dead-chicks-plastic-saving-birds","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"Saving the albatross: 'The war is against plastic and they are casualties on the frontline'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/12/albatross-film-dead-chicks-plastic-saving-birds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/12/albatross-film-dead-chicks-plastic-saving-birds","fields":{"headline":"Saving the albatross: 'The war is against plastic and they are casualties on the frontline'","bodyText":"We are living in a plastic age and the solutions may seem glaringly obvious, so why aren’t all 7.6 billion of us already doing things differently? Shocking statistics don’t guarantee effective change. So what’s the alternative? American photographer and filmmaker Chris Jordan believes the focus should be on forcing people to have a stronger emotional engagement with the problems plastic causes. His famous photographs of dead albatross chicks and the colourful plastic they have ingested serve as a blunt reminder that the planet is in a state of emergency. While making his feature-length film Albatross, Jordan considered Picasso’s approach: “The role of the artist is to respect you, help you connect more deeply, and then leave it up to you to decide how to behave.” Most nature documentaries devote their final few minutes to hopeful solutions, but Jordan avoids this. He simply shines a light on the crisis facing the huge colonies of Laysan albatrosses on the remote Pacific island of Midway. “There’s something so archetypal about these legendary birds and seeing bright colours of ocean plastic against dead sterility is a powerful symbol for our human culture right now. We’re in a state of emotional bankruptcy,” says Jordan. “This material lasts forever, yet we throw it away after a single use. But it’s not as simple as inspiring individuals to make small changes. We have to acknowledge that individuals cannot make a difference,” Jordan says. “When 100 million people decide to do something differently, THAT is when real change happens.” Jordan first visited Midway in September 2009, when the albatrosses were soaring above the waves, far out to sea – all he saw for two weeks were tens of thousands of dead chicks. “It was devastating and depressing and I questioned how to get to a place of hope from there.” When he acknowledged that this eerily silent scene was part of a much bigger story, he resolved to return to Midway and was greeted by “a deafening cacophony of a million creatures singing and dancing all day and all night”. Jordan is fascinated with these majestic birds. With no natural predators on Midway, Laysan albatrosses show no fear of humans, so his footage provides an authentic bird’s-eye view: “Albatrosses are so mysterious because they haven’t been on our radar. They live in places humans just don’t go – yet when we look closely, they are unbelievably magnificent,” he says. Albatross is slow-paced, poignant and poetic. Lying somewhere between arthouse film and narrative documentary, it was eight years in the making; Jordan spent 94 days on Midway over the course of eight visits. His lens lingers on moments of natural beauty, tuning into their behaviour and losing track of time. Midway is a tiny outpost in the middle of the world’s largest ocean, 2,000 miles from the nearest continent and halfway between North America and Asia. “Midway’s name also describes the place that humanity finds itself, midway to its own destruction. But at the halfway point, everything can change – at half-time, a football coach tells his team that the game is not over yet.” Jordan muses that albatrosses – with a brain the size of a walnut – experience the passage of time more slowly than we do. He films their bonding ritual in slow motion, focusing on the dedication between males and females. These bonds last a lifetime, sometimes more than 60 years. Wisdom, the world’s oldest tagged bird, is 67 and still successfully breeding: an amazing feat, considering that so many chicks die of dehydration and malnourishment, overheating or storm exposure. “They are loving, sensitive and graceful – when you look at any creature this closely, it becomes amazing,” says Jordan, who believes we would fall in love with any animal if we only stopped to look at them with a similar childlike sense of awe. After five months, the fluffball chicks develop into comic, goofy-footed fledglings ready to take flight and begin their first 10,000 mile-long feeding frenzy over the open ocean. But some fail to take to the skies and the resulting deaths are often slow and painful. The odds are clearly stacked against the birds but it’s difficult to assess the exact impacts of such widespread plastic pollution. According to Beth Flint, a biologist at the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the biggest threats to Midway’s albatrosses are rising sea levels, increased storms and temperature changes. Yet plastic is found in every single albatross bolus or regurgitated mass of squid beaks that chicks produce. Scientists working across the north-western Hawaiian islands also found that more than 97% of dead Laysan albatross chicks – and more than 89% dead adult birds – contained plastic in their stomachs, so high incidence is undeniable. Although his film highlights the ubiquity of plastic, Jordan insists Albatross isn’t purely about plastic pollution; it’s about our broken relationship with planet Earth. “This is a grief ritual. My intent is to help viewers reconnect on a universal level with living beings,” says Jordan, whose mother died of pancreatic cancer while he was making the film. “Grief happens when we are losing love and it liberates us to feel it fully and therefore we can arrive home back to our core state of wisdom. Here, nothing stands in our way.” Twelve years ago, ex-BBC wildlife camerawoman Rebecca Hosking filmed the pioneering Message in the Waves, a conservation documentary about surfers and scientists trying to protect Hawaii’s wildlife. In 2007, she campaigned to make Modbury in Devon the UK’s first ever plastic bag-free town after she returned from filming these same albatrosses. The anti-plastics movement has made progress since then but Hosking says there is still a long way to go: “Some might argue that traditional natural history films made since the 1970s haven’t worked – they haven’t triggered a revolution or dramatic change. Perhaps we need something more emotive to shock us into action.” Hosking remembers walking through the albatross colonies, seeing dead chicks on the ground: “Midway was a US naval air station and now it feels like a postwar battlefield, with dead albatrosses juxtaposed against old military buildings. Now, the war is against plastic and albatrosses are the casualties on the frontline.” Hosking doesn’t have a problem with Jordan’s rather anthropomorphic depiction of the birds: “You can’t say these animals aren’t sentient, and Jordan builds up the loving relationship of the mating birds quite beautifully – he refers to couples rather than pairs, and babies not chicks, but it’s not overly sentimental.” She continues: “Any parent wants to provide for their baby, and albatross go to such great lengths to feed their young. But they’re feeding them sharp, toxic plastic because they have mistaken it for multicoloured squid or cuttlefish near the surface of the ocean; it’s horrendous.” Hosking remembers scientists collecting toothbrushes, lighters, toys, bottletops, biros, even the fish-shaped soy sauce bottles that come with takeaway sushi: “It’s all stuff we use every day and it’s unbelievable what these birds can fit in their gullets – one had swallowed a whole inkjet cartridge.” Jordan’s call to action is to love the albatross more: “I want people to watch this film and feel sadness and rage and realise that comes from a place of love. Don’t pull the plug out of the bathtub just yet; don’t let all that raw emotion drain away. Once you feel love, you can be more courageous and make more radical choices.” Albatross is released nationwide on 22 April, albatrossthefilm.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/09/why-isnt-a-working-knowledge-of-opera-a-must-have-for-eno-chief-executive-stuart-murphy","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T10:48:26Z","webTitle":"Why isn't a practical knowledge of opera a 'must-have' for ENO's chief executive?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/09/why-isnt-a-working-knowledge-of-opera-a-must-have-for-eno-chief-executive-stuart-murphy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/09/why-isnt-a-working-knowledge-of-opera-a-must-have-for-eno-chief-executive-stuart-murphy","fields":{"headline":"Why isn't a practical knowledge of opera a 'must-have' for ENO's chief executive?","bodyText":"Running an opera company may be a niche occupation, especially in the UK, where the chances to do so are pretty limited, but there are some basic requirements. A practical knowledge of the art form is always a good start, but that’s something that the board of English National Opera, which is not exactly overloaded with in-depth opera knowledge, seems to think is irrelevant in appointing a new chief executive. In announcing the appointment of Stuart Murphy, former director of Sky Entertainment Channels, to succeed Cressida Pollock, who last autumn announced that she would be stepping down at the end of this season, ENO’s press release makes a point of mentioning Murphy’s teenage experience as a clarinet player. But his only opera experience seems to have been when he was controller of BBC Three, and commissioned Flashmob – the Opera in London’s Paddington station and Flashmob Faust at Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield well over a decade ago. Apparently, ENO’s shortlist for the job included at least two people who have proven track records of running opera companies, either of whom would have been a sensible and positive choice. But instead the board has opted for someone with no first-hand experience of how the business works at all. Pollock, by her own admission, knew nothing about opera when she was appointed to the role either, but she was brought in with a well-defined brief to stabilise a company that was in financial crisis and to make the hard-nosed decisions that would put it on a more even keel. A division of responsibility between administration and artistic planning may be the normal way of running an opera company – it’s the model that’s been successful at the Royal Opera for many years – but usually the chief executive has at least a working knowledge of what’s involved in getting opera on to the stage. The triumvirate that ran ENO during its heyday in the 1980s, the so-called Powerhouse years, had exactly the right mix of talents: Peter Jonas, who was managing director, worked alongside music director Mark Elder and director of productions David Pountney; Jonas spent his whole career in music, and went to become Intendant of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich after he left the Coliseum. ENO is now in a situation where it needs more than a financial quick-fix; its situation has changed markedly since it was threatened with closure when the Arts Council of England removed it from its national funding portfolio in 2015, and effectively placed it in special measures. Yet now, with its portfolio status restored, the future of a company that ought to be moving forward has been put in the hands of a chief executive with virtually no operatic experience; a music director, Martyn Brabbins, who, for all his outstanding qualities as a conductor, has spent the larger proportion of his career in the concert hall; and an artistic director, Daniel Kramer, who hadn’t run an opera company previously, either, but who thinks it might be “fun” to do so. What ENO really needs is the triumph of hope over experience."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2018/mar/10/cash-isa-deals","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T09:00:10Z","webTitle":"Cash Isa rates are on the rise - but there is a catch","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/mar/10/cash-isa-deals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/mar/10/cash-isa-deals","fields":{"headline":"Cash Isa rates are on the rise - but there is a catch","bodyText":"Cash Isa rates are allegedly on the up, though it may not feel like it.

But thanks to peace, investment, regeneration and the tourism generated by Titanic Belfast and Game of Thrones, the city has changed incalculably for the better in the intervening 40 years. Even while traders and residents oppose a proposed £400m redevelopment of its historic Cathedral Quarter (a healthy reminder that not all regeneration is good regeneration), the city grows by the week, while retaining a compact charm and intimate character. It’s at night that you get the full sense of how Belfast has emerged from conflict to become a safe, popular short-break city and one of the world’s top tourist destinations. Though historic watering holes such as the Crown Liquor Saloon help frame the obligatory “first Guinness” Instagram post, visitors should look to discover the city’s more contemporary and exciting venues, clubs and restaurants. Despite licensing laws dictating that most bars kick out around 1.30am, right now, it’s clued-in club promoters and attuned art-space heads who are steering Belfast into exciting waters. Here are 10 must-hit spots for unravelling Belfast’s late-night spirit and dancefloor joie de vivre. The Bear and the Doll Transformed from its previous incarnation as the Titanic Bar, the Bear and the Doll is in a unique, instantly recognisable, triangular-shaped island building, constructed in 1886. It’s a slick bar serving first-rate cocktails and craft beer, with DJs and regular nights including local gallery Framewerk’s ace Late Night Art (first Thursday of every month). Better still, its new-fangled, Berlin-inspired sister space, The Art Department, carries the torch for Belfast’s proud clubbing heritage via some of the city’s most discriminating music heads, including GIRL and the Night Institute every Friday and Saturday until 3am. • 2-14 Little Donegall Street, on Facebook The MAC Since opening in 2012, the Metropolitan Arts Centre has established itself as a world-class tourist attraction. Within its roughly trapezium-shaped site are two theatre spaces and three art galleries that host all manner of exhibitions, performance theatre, live music and experimental works 363 days of the year. The pièce de résistance of St Anne’s Square, a self-contained faux-Georgian development in the Cathedral Quarter, the MAC is just seconds away from several local gems including Italian restaurant Coppi and world class coffee shop Established. Hanging around for a show? Opt for Native, the MAC’s in-house restaurant and bar, which showcases the best products from small producers across Northern Ireland. • 10 Exchange St West, themaclive.com Bullitt Hotel Owned by the Beannchor Group, which is behind the city’s five-star Merchant Hotel, the equally central, 74-room Bullitt is a more hip – and more affordable – proposition than its art deco-inspired sibling. Opened in 2016, and themed around the classic 1968 Steve McQueen film, it has stylish, cleverly designed rooms, each with a kingsize bed. It sidesteps expensive mini-bars and bellboys in favour of reasonably priced comfort. Balearic beats and deep disco cuts courtesy of Bullitt’s resident DJs pack out the courtyard at the weekends. For a change of scenery, its rooftop bar, Babel, offers cocktails, food and clued-in crate-diggers at the weekend, with the added boon of panoramic city views. • Doubles from £110 B&amp;B, 40a Church Lane, bullitthotel.com Limelight Comprising the 850-capacity Limelight 1, the more intimate Limelight 2 and Katy’s Bar, this is one of Northern Ireland’s most iconic live music venues. Opened in 1984, it underwent a multimillion pound revamp in 2012 – a move that underscored its status as Belfast’s unrivalled home for balancing packed-out weekly club nights with international touring bands and local live music showcases. This Ormeau Avenue complex likes to refer to itself as legendary, and many stories from across the years support this description: Noel Gallagher’s oft-recited tale of Oasis discovering that Definitely Maybe had hit the No 1 spot as they prepared to play the venue back in September 1994 is among them. • 17 Ormeau Avenue, limelightbelfast.com The Menagerie In the studenty Holylands area south of the city centre, the Menagerie spent the 2000s as Belfast’s dimly lit party enclave par excellence – heady eclecticism, mismatched furniture and vintage-shop lampshades. Relaunched last year, the latest incarnation of this former paint store marries boho chic with a facelift that hasn’t undone its dive bar cool. Above all, the key to the Menagerie’s draw is the way it backs promoters of every sonic inclination, from rock’n’roll throwdown Sunglasses After Dark to monthly queer disco Ponyhawke. If you could distil the spirit of a truly memorable Belfast night out, it would start at the bottom of the Menagerie’s stairs, sipping a cold beer. • Open Thurs-Sun, 130 University Street, menageriebar.com Sunflower public house A self-proclaimed “simple corner pub, free of gimmicks or themes”, the Sunflower is perfect testament to the pure power of a city moving on. Though its imposing security cage nods to Belfast’s darker days, its interior reveals a different story, all lively conversations, live music sessions and a tilt for Irish craft beers and ciders from breweries such as Yardsman and Hilden. Though pubs such as the ultra-cosy Spaniard or the Bittles are fine for a quick pint or two, the Sunflower is Belfast’s best independently owned pub by some distance. • 65 Union St, sunflowerbelfast.com The Black Box With a calendar consistently brimming with alternative, fringe-style events, the Black Box isn’t merely the crown jewel in the city’s cobblestoned Cathedral Quarter: it reigns supreme as Belfast’s leading performance and arts venue. Its 240-capacity main room puts on a revolving cavalcade of live music, theatre, literature, comedy, film, visual art, circus and cabaret; in the singularly snug Green Room, it’s much the same but on a smaller scale, with the addition of resident DJs, pizzas and a solid selection of crafts and draughts. Sealing the deal, this Hill Street institution is a registered charity run by some of the most involved and art-focused staff in the city. • 18-22 Hill St, blackboxbelfast.com La Taquería Hungry and in a hurry? Asian street food joint Bánh (48 Upper Arthur St) is unlikely to disappoint in the early evening. Otherwise, take some time to enjoy the country’s finest Mexican restaurant, La Taquería. Based in a former oyster bar on Castle Street, this warmly lit first-floor restaurant is the vision of head chef Adam Lynas and his Mexican wife Eliza. Though fast-paced burrito spots such as Boojum (two locations) are hugely popular in Belfast right now, La Taquería is a world apart, offering delicious, authentic Mexican food – not to mention a wide range of tequilas, mezcal cocktails and Mexican lagers – in a relaxed setting. • Mains from £8.50, 53 Castle St, lataqueriabelfast.co.uk Muriel’s Cafe Bar Marrying the warmth of a local with the buzz of a club, Muriel’s Cafe Bar is home to the friendliest, most engaging bar staff in Belfast. But its charm doesn’t end there. With velvet seating, damask drapes and – something of a calling card – women’s underwear dangling from its ground floor ceiling, this city centre bar boasts a mouthwatering food menu, 140 gins (local brand Jawbox being a particular staff favourite, with the perfect swerve of a squeeze of lime and ginger ale) and The Monkey Room, a first-floor hideaway offering cocktails in a casual environment. Peckish on leaving? Don’t pass on recently opened (and highly rated) burger joint Pablos next door. • 12-14 Church Lane, on Facebook Kremlin The Smithfield and Union Quarter area, just off the Cathedral Quarter, is Belfast’s unofficial gay quarter, and its HQ-of-sorts is the Kremlin on Donegall Street, Northern Ireland’s first ever gay-owned and managed venue. Its Soviet-style industrial extravagance permeates “communist chic” rooms including Tsar Cocktail lounge, Red Square and the Long Bar. With clubs including Maverick and Boombox offering alternatives just around the corner, an unending variety of theme nights and the most raring-to-go clubbers in the city has ensured that the Kremlin is widely seen as one of the country’s must-hit nightclubs. • 96 Donegall Street, kremlin-belfast.com Getting there Budget airlines including FlyBe, easyJet and Ryannair fly to Belfast from various airports in England, Scotland and Wales. Best times to visit Now in its 11th year, Belsonic features music from Nile Rogers, Soul II Soul, Liam Gallagher, Richard Ashcroft and Carl Cox over six nights at Ormeau Park, from 15-30 June. The 19th Cathedral Quarter Arts Festival runs a programme of live music, comedy, spoken word, theatre, literature, film and art from 3-13 May. Held on the Causeway Coast and Glens, the North West 200 (15-19 May) is one of the fastest and most spectacular open-road motorbike races in the world, drawing spectators from far and wide.

The relative price of things is an enormously powerful driver of human choices and behaviour. Dumping the economic assumption that nature is a limitless source of materials and services that can be considered to come for free would be the single biggest leap that humanity could make in securing its future. At present we have few monetary incentives to avoid excess greenhouse gas emissions, single-use plastics or even excess animal manure. In fact, the economy encourages us believe it is “cheaper” to do such things. The principle of polluter pays has often been discussed, but implementation has been limited to discrete incidents. It is time to recognise that all of us who participate in the industrial economy (which is pretty much everybody) contribute to the destruction of the future liveability of the planet. It is time the economy was priced to reward activities that nourish our future rather than those that destroy it. Harold Forbes Wareham, Dorset • With consumers opting for petrol over diesel, electric or hybrid vehicles, we need to see clear policy on lowering petrol emissions. Displacing more fossil fuel by increasing the low-carbon renewable bioethanol levels within the petrol blend to 10% (known as E10) is the fastest, easiest and most cost-effective way to tackle transport emissions immediately and represents the equivalent of removing 700,000 cars from UK roads. The government needs to show leadership on a swift, coordinated, and ideally mandated rollout of E10. Without this, transport emissions will continue to present an increasing threat.

Here in Southwark there are just seven fast-charging points and 13 slow-charging points (not all of them accessible for 24 hours) for the whole borough and in Lambeth there are just three charging points.

Her extraordinary production redeems a seldom-seen play by Tennessee Williams. It also irradiates Williams’s gifts: his lyricism and wildness – and his strangeness. It is from the beginning a revelation. No sultriness and sashaying, but intensity, isolation, peculiarity. Patsy Ferran, enclosed in a bubble of golden light, stands at the front of the bare stage with a mic. She is having a panic attack, gulping for air and syllables. Behind her the rest of the cast sit at upright pianos, their backs to her as they play. Angus MacRae’s music rolls through the action, as individual notes and occasional melodies. Tom Scutt’s set and Lee Curran’s lighting design create a surreal landscape. Even the keyboards have an eerie vitality, flashing white to produce the effect of fireworks. Originally called “Chart of Anatomy”, Summer and Smoke features the almost love affair between Alma – neurasthenic singing teacher, prim daughter of a minister – and the lusty son of a local doctor. First staged just after A Streetcar Named Desire, in 1948, it is a source book for Williams’s themes: mental fragility, insistent muscularity, sexual suppression. Williams claimed that Alma – he over-insistently points out this means “soul” in Spanish – was his favourite heroine: like him, a late developer. Not everyone has shared his enthusiasm. The first Broadway production was a failure. Twelve years ago a West End revival closed early. But Frecknall, focusing everything through Alma’s fractured sensibility, makes the play into an intimate triumph. There is more than one marvel. A neat vignette from Nancy Crane as a dippy mother with a passion for jigsaws and ice cream. A beautiful blues number languorously delivered by Anjana Vasan. And a first-rate performance by Matthew Needham as the hot doc: twisting between rawness and confidence, hesitancy and coercion. Still, the evening depends on Ferran. There has been plenty of reason to praise her since her debut only four years ago. Now she moves to a different level. She brings her distinctive restlessness to the part: swivelling features, limbs threatening to shift out of their sockets. That has looked like a comic talent, but here febrility becomes tragic. Her face is constantly tweaked by fear; anxious to impress, she pushes her mouth into a smile with her fingers. Her speech comes in compulsive gushes and staccato phrases, as if every word were weighted with possibilities. As it sometimes seems. Alma deals in fancy locutions – she calls a car “a four-wheel phenomenon” – and woozy inwardness. Brilliantly, Williams shows that sensuality has always been welling up in her, evident in her speech. When drowsy, she feels “like a water-lily on a Chinese lagoon”. And who could resist a play in which the heroine supplies a tranquilliser, explaining: “The prescription number is 96814. I think of it as the telephone number of God!” If only Rufus Norris had savoured his script’s most pungent moments with equal gusto. Instead, he has matched his slasher production of Macbeth with a slashed text that eviscerates the witches’ speeches – no hubble-bubble or eye of newt – and makes the drama blunter, more one-dimensional. The dominant note is anger, barely inflected by fear or despair. At times everyone seems to be head-butting both stage and verse. Soldiers whoop and holler and grunt in unison; the king leads them in a dance like the lord of misrule. Severed heads are dropped so often into plastic bags that you expect a Tesco van to home-deliver them. The pairing of Rory Kinnear and Anne-Marie Duff as the Macbeths looked inspired. But though they hinge together well, neatly showing the point at which strength ebbs from her to him, their performances are flattened by the prevailing wrath. They are an impoverished couple on the make. Kinnear is a martial not a meditative presence, too robust to seem deeply disturbed, though he does something remarkable with this interpretation in the “tomorrow and tomorrow” speech, making it less of a philosophical lament than a practical complaint. Kinnear is not so much mournful as disgusted, a sulky teenager kicking against constraints, addressing himself not to fate but to the dead wife he holds in his arms. Duff is precise, guarding against her own fragility – she delivers her smashing-the-baby speech tearfully – but lacks the fire that usually makes her so memorable. The most blazing performance comes from Patrick O’Kane as Macduff, glowering with tamped-down energy at the start, and under the cosh of tragedy turning into the hell-hound he accuses Macbeth of being. Poverty hovers as an explanation for the couple’s cruelty – Duff’s jeans are very scruffy; their feast is held in a cramped murky space like a disused railway carriage. This brings its own absurdities. Would the king really have put up here? Then the discovery of his death has to take a little time. While Macduff is offstage hoping to wake him up, the audience needs to be given news of dire combustions and bad omens. But Macduff only has to nip around the corner. What can he be doing to take so long? Stuffing the corpse? Rae Smith’s black pleated walls – bin-bag cliffs – engulf the action on the huge Olivier stage. They are dark all right, and of a piece with the large amounts of 21st-century waste sloshing around: Macbeth’s battle tunic is secured with brown sticky tape. Still there is little here to suggest a struggle with doom, though Paul Arditti’s soundscape of foghorn moans suggests a wounded creature trapped in the wings. The witches are decorative and only mildly disconcerting. One does a bit of scuttling; the others are statuesque. At the end they perch on high poles as if they were the sourest fruits of the forest. Or lollipops. Not a weird look.

The Chinese space agency lost control of its Tiangong-1, or Heavenly Palace, spacecraft in 2016, five years after it blasted into orbit to make China only the third nation to operate a space station after the US and Russia. The defunct module is now at an altitude of 150 miles and being tracked by space agencies around the world, with the European Space Agency’s centre in Darmstadt predicting a fiery descent for it between 27 March and 8 April. Hurtling around the Earth at about 18,000mph, the module ranks as one of the larger objects to re-enter the atmosphere without being steered towards the ocean, as is standard for big and broken spacecraft, and cargo vessels that are jettisoned from the International Space Station (ISS), to reduce the risk to life below. The spacecraft’s orbit ranges from 43° north to 43° south, which rules out a descent over the UK but includes vast stretches of North and South America, China, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, parts of Europe – and great swaths of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Western analysts cannot be sure how much of the spacecraft will survive re-entry, because China has not released details of the design and materials used to make Tiangong-1. But the spacecraft may have well-protected titanium fuel tanks containing toxic hydrazine that could pose a danger if they land in populated areas. “To make any sensible statement about what will survive, we’d need to know what’s inside,” said Stijn Lemmens, a space debris analyst at the ESA’s Darmstadt centre. “But the only ones who know what’s onboard Tiangong-1, or even what it’s made of, are the Chinese space agency.” As a prototype space station, Tiangong-1 is far smaller than the ISS. Constructed over decades, the ISS is the size of a football field and has the living space of a five-bedroom house. It weighs more than 400 tonnes. Tiangong-1, by comparison, weighs about 8.5 tonnes and is a mere 10 metres long and 3 metres wide. While it has two sleeping berths, the eating area and toilet appear to be aboard the Shenzhou module that docks with the station when Chinese spacefarers arrive. “When people hear ‘space station’ they tend to think of the International Space Station or the Mir space station, but this is a lot smaller than those,” Lemmens said. “What we can say from size and shape and mass is that it’s in the same category as the cargo vehicles used to provide services to ISS, such as the Progress modules and the European ATV.” In 2015, a 7.5-tonne Russian Progress vessel that broke down en route to the ISS fell back to Earth and burned up over the Pacific, with only a few small pieces thought to have survived. Though bijou by space station standards, Tiangong-1 hosted several taikonauts, including China’s first female astronaut, Liu Yang, in 2012. The interior of the spacecraft has white panelled walls and a dark floor to help visiting spacefarers build up a sense of up and down and so feel less disoriented. Many space agencies perform a risk assessment before spacecraft are launched, in case of malfunctions in orbit. If the chances of someone being injured by debris that survives re-entry are greater than one in 10,000, a “controlled re-entry” is used to steer the spacecraft into a patch of the South Pacific known as the “spacecraft graveyard”. It is not known whether the Chinese space agency performed such a risk assessment. Presented with the uncontrolled re-entry of Tiangong-1, 13 space agencies are using the event to test new tracking models and equipment, including radar, lasers and optical telescopes. Over the coming days and weeks, the agencies will pool their data in a bid to sharpen their predictions of where and when the object will fall. The vagaries of re-entry mean it is impossible to say with much accuracy where Tiangong-1 will hit until its final moments. Only in the final hours will analysts be able to exclude the vast majority of the planet’s surface, but this will leave long, thin tracks that can circle the Earth. “Along one of these tracks, the breakup itself can spread fragments over thousands of kilometres,” Lemmens said. The tracks are narrow, however, reaching tens of kilometres wide at most. With so much of Earth’s surface covered in water, the chances are high that Tiangong-1 will re-enter over an ocean, and it may not even be seen. And while pieces of space debris fall to Earth every day, only one person is known to have been hit by space junk, and she was not injured. Richard Crowther, chief engineer at the UK Space Agency, said: “Given Tiangong-1 has a larger mass and is more robust, as it is pressurised, than many other space objects that return uncontrolled to Earth from space, it is the subject of a number of radar tracking campaigns. The majority of the module can be expected to burn up during re-entry heating, with the greatest probability being that any surviving fragments will fall into the sea.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/09/political-prisoner-spain-pep-guardiola-manchester-city-yellow-ribbon-catalan","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T10:51:32Z","webTitle":"As a political prisoner in Spain, I appreciate Pep Guardiola’s support | Jordi Cuixart","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/09/political-prisoner-spain-pep-guardiola-manchester-city-yellow-ribbon-catalan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/09/political-prisoner-spain-pep-guardiola-manchester-city-yellow-ribbon-catalan","fields":{"headline":"As a political prisoner in Spain, I appreciate Pep Guardiola’s support","bodyText":"As of today, I have now been in prison for 144 days without a trial for defending the rights and freedoms of the people of Catalonia. Since then, my 10-month-old son and my partner have travelled 27,000km, making the 1,200km round trip from Barcelona to Soto del Real prison, close to Madrid, more than 20 times. Despite this, I still believe in justice, the protection of human rights, peace and freedom as the fundamental values that define 21st-century democracy. Therefore, I truly appreciate Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola’s act of solidarity by wearing a yellow ribbon in support of the four Catalan prisoners, despite being charged by the FA for refusing to take it off. “It’s not about politicians, it’s about democracy. Before I am a manager, I am a human being,” Guardiola said. Not just every political prisoner, but every human being around the world should appreciate his moral leadership. He makes us better as a society. Recent statements by Martin Glenn, the chief executive of the FA, are wrongheaded. A yellow ribbon does not represent any political affiliation and is not a symbol of Catalan independence. It is simply a sign of solidarity with people who have been unfairly jailed, like the families of the US hostages held in the 1979 Tehran embassy crisis who prayed for their freedom. To compare the yellow ribbon to symbols such as the swastika shows a clear lack of information about the situation in Spain. The Franco dictatorship banned Òmnium, the organisation of which I am president, from 1963 to 1967. Barcelona’s mayor, Ada Colau, said: “The situation that the prisoners and their families are going through is immoral and unacceptable in democratic terms. This is about human rights and freedoms, the violation of the fundamental rights of a group that could be any other group tomorrow.” Amnesty International has repeatedly stated that the charges of rebellion and sedition against us are excessive, and 109 Spanish jurists have said that they have no legal basis. All our requests for release have been denied by the Spanish judicial system. “There was no rebellion in Catalonia because there was no violence,” said Carmen Tomás Valiente, a professor of criminal law and the daughter of former constitutional court president Francisco Tomás Valiente, who was killed by Eta. We have therefore lodged our case with the UN working group on arbitrary detention, claiming that our imprisonment by the Spanish government is unlawful, and that our detention violates our right to freedom of association and freedom of expression, the right to political opinion and participation in public life, and the right to a fair trial. As human rights lawyer Ben Emmerson said: “This case does not ask the UN to adjudicate on the issue of Catalan independence, but seeks the UN’s reaffirmation that governments cannot repress political dissent through arbitrary detention. The actions of the Spanish government in this case set a dangerous precedent for the right to peaceful protest around the world.” How is it possible that the president of Òmnium, a cultural organisation with more than 100,000 members, is in prison in a democracy for defending the right to vote? This is what the yellow ribbon of solidarity means. We proclaim our innocence and our status as prisoners of conscience, and we eagerly await the day when no yellow ribbon will have to be worn anywhere, by football managers or anyone else. • Jordi Cuixart is the 10th president of Òmnium Cultural, an organisation set up to promote the Catalan language and spread the region’s culture"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/08/labour-suspends-party-members-in-antisemitic-facebook-group","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T17:04:19Z","webTitle":"Labour suspends party members in 'antisemitic' Facebook group","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/08/labour-suspends-party-members-in-antisemitic-facebook-group","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/08/labour-suspends-party-members-in-antisemitic-facebook-group","fields":{"headline":"Labour suspends party members in 'antisemitic' Facebook group","bodyText":"Labour has suspended several party members who posted in a closed Facebook group which featured a number of antisemitic messages. The party’s compliance unit is working through a dossier on the group, of which Jeremy Corbyn was once a member, that was compiled by a campaigner. Some of the posts on Palestine Live appear to include links to Holocaust denial myths, allegations of Israel’s involvement in the 9/11 and 7/7 terror attacks and the training of Islamic State fighters, and conspiracy theories involving the Rothschild family. It is understood that disciplinary procedures, including suspensions, have been initiated against a number of members of Palestine Live where they have been found to be Labour members, though it appears that at least one, who had been presenting as a Labour member, was not. Corbyn posted several times in the group after being tagged in posts. He left the group in 2015, around the time he became Labour leader, although the party has not confirmed whether it was before or after he won the leadership contest, or what motivated his departure. Corbyn said his posts were limited to some replies, including “a suggestion on the vote on recognising Palestine, which I supported, and inviting a doctor to speak at an event”. Corbyn said he had not seen the other antisemitic posts on the group. “Had I seen it, of course, I would have challenged it straight away, but I actually don’t spend all my time reading social media,” he said during a visit to Derbyshire. “I have never trawled through the whole group. I have never read all the messages on it. I have removed myself from it,” he told the Press Association. “Obviously, any antisemitic comment is wrong. Any antisemitism in any form is wrong.” The Palestine Live group was founded in 2013 and was set up in a way that allowed administrators to add people to the group without their consent. It is understood that Corbyn believes he may have been added to the group by an acquaintance, who simultaneously added him as a Facebook friend when he was a backbench MP. The Labour MPs Clive Lewis and Chris Williamson were members of the group, as were two former Liberal Democrat politicians, Baroness Jenny Tonge and the former MP David Ward.Jacqueline Walker, a former Momentum steering group member, is also a member of the Facebook group. Walker has been suspended from the Labour party twice over allegations of antisemitism. In one post, Walker appears to ask: “How safe is this group?”, to which the group’s founder, Elleanne Green, replied: “Very. no one is allowed in who is not trusted. I am very very careful, it is a secret group.” On Wednesday, when Corbyn’s membership of the group was first revealed, his spokesman said Corbyn would “take whatever necessary action to stamp [antisemitism] out in the Labour party.” “I don’t think anyone is suggesting that anything that Jeremy has written in any Facebook group or anywhere else constitutes antisemitic comments,” he said. “As I understand it, there were thousands of members of this group. As anyone knows, in social media all sorts of things are posted which often others participating aren’t even aware of. “It is repugnant if there are antisemitic posts – and I gather there are. If they involve anyone to do with the Labour party then investigation and disciplinary action will be taken.” Palestine Live’s content was first revealed in a 250-page dossier looking at the posts and profiles of members of the group, compiled by the businessman David Collier, who said his blog was dedicated to “researching antisemitism inside anti-Zionist activity”. Joseph Glasman, of the Campaign Against Antisemitism, said the organisation would be filing complaints against Corbyn and Lewis to the Labour party. “There is no conceivable justification for Jeremy Corbyn’s participation in this group. One of Mr Corbyn’s slogans is ‘standing up, not standing by’, but in this case he has not stood up but instead he actively joined in,” Glasman said. • This article was amended on 9 March 2018 to correct a reference to past suspension of Jacqueline Walker over allegations of antisemitism."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/mar/16/parking-fines-number-plate-recognition-0-o","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T13:53:11Z","webTitle":"Stick to the letter of car-parking rules – or get a fine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/mar/16/parking-fines-number-plate-recognition-0-o","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/mar/16/parking-fines-number-plate-recognition-0-o","fields":{"headline":"Stick to the letter of car-parking rules – or get a fine","bodyText":"I received a fine at a hospital car park in October despite having paid £10 for a week’s parking. I appealed to POPLA (the parking on private land appeals process), which found against me because it was claimed I had entered my car number plate with a K instead of a J. My number plate does, in fact, include a K. The J is a figment of their imagination. When I pointed out their statement was factually incorrect they refused to reconsider. MR, Tyne &amp; Wear POPLA, in its reply, stated that you cannot appeal against its decision even though, in your case, its decision appears to have been founded on an error. I notice, from the parking permit you bought, that the number plate you entered included a zero at the end when, given the format of UK licence plates, it should presumably be a letter O. When I contacted POPLA it discovered it had made an error when it accused you of entering a K instead of a J. It had, instead, meant to explain you had confused an O with an 0. It justified this by pointing out the J and K are beside each other on the keyboard. You had a better excuse – Os and 0s are indistinguishable on licence plates and thousands of motorists are caught. However, POPLA, while also guilty of butter fingers, is unyielding. In the world of private parking enforcement, it matters not that you can prove you paid, only whether you abided, quite literally, to the letter of the rules on car-park signs. And those stipulate registration plates must be correctly entered so that the automatic number plate recognition cameras, which monitor comings and goings, can match the payment to the vehicle. “While POPLA’s typo has caused confusion for the motorist, it doesn’t materially alter the outcome of the case,” POPLA says. “As the driver did not make a payment against the correct vehicle registration, it is correct that his vehicle remained at the car park for longer than permitted. “The fact that he did make a payment, alone, is not enough reason to cancel the parking charge notice.” If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
