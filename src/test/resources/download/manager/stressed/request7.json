The brief statement came after Johnson met Rouhani for an hour to discuss regional and bilateral issues including US and UK banking restrictions and UK concerns “about the consular cases of dual nationals”. The Foreign Office spokesman said both men “spoke forthrightly about the obstacles in the relationship and agreed on the need to make progress in all areas”. “It has been a worthwhile visit and we leave with a sense that both sides want to keep up the momentum to resolve the difficult issues in the bilateral relationship and preserve the nuclear deal,” he added. During his visit, Johnson met most of the senior figures in Iranian politics, including the foreign minister, Javad Zarif, as well as Dr Salehi, the head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Association. Iranian news media accounts of the meetings did not focus on the Zagahari-Ratcliffe issue, but instead on what the UK could do to ease British banking restrictions that are holding back Iranian-UK trade in the wake of the lifting of sanctions made possible by the Iranian nuclear deal in 2015. The nuclear deal is under threat in America, but the UK, in common with other EU countries, has been a staunch defender of the deal, insisting Iran is in compliance with its terms. Zaghhari-Ratcliffe has been in jail for nearly two years charged with seeking to undermine the Iranian state, and she could appear in court again on Sunday on fresh charges that could extend her sentence by as much as 10 years. There had been some suggestion that the Iranians might postpone the hearing that had by chance coincided with the foreign secretary’s visit. Tehran does not recognise Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s dual UK-Iranian nationality, and refuses her access to representatives of the British authorities. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, expressed concern at the prospect of his wife going to court again. He told the Press Association: “I am obviously watching closely with hope, fingers crossed.” Ratcliffe said he hoped the foreign secretary’s visit would do some good. “Hopefully, he will be persuasive and charming, and build a good relationship. It is definitely good that he is there, but let’s wait and see what happens,” he said. Although the meeting with Rouhani was regarded as a significant sign of Iranian willingness to engage with the UK, Iranian media accounts highlighted the problems standing in a way of improved relations, especially the belief that the UK could do more both to rein in US-led banking sanctions, and President Donald Trump’s criticisms of the nuclear deal. The Mehr news agency reported Iran’s parliamentary speaker, Ali Larijani, telling Johnson that US and UK military campaigns since 2000 had plunged the world into chaos, and were the major reason for the spread of terrorism. Larijani said: ”Instead of voicing anti-Iran sentiments, it would be more rewarding to pay attention to the reality of what is going on in regional countries.” He also questioned British support for Bahrain’s monarchy, saying: “All Bahraini people want is democracy. They want equal voting rights. Why do you aid their oppression? You claim to be the upholders of human rights, yet you support those who violate Bahraini people’s rights.”Larijani also suggested that the all aspects of the Iran nuclear deal, also known as the JCPOA, had not been fully implemented by the UK. He was quoted as saying: “After JCPOA agreement was reached, unlike certain other European countries that did their best to engage in economic cooperation with Iran, the UK did not take appropriate measures to promote economic cooperation with Iran. You did not even solve the banking obstacles of Iranian embassy in London.” Johnson was reported as saying the UK would welcome more Iranian tourists to London, and acknowledged that some UK interventions had failed, a theme he set out as length in a speech on fighting terrorism in a speech in London last week. Mehr reported him as saying certain inappropriate measures adopted by the UK had resulted in the dissolution of regional regimes. Iranian news sites also claimed Johnson had bene relatively even-handed in discussing the disputes between Saudi and Iran that have spread across the Middle East. “Iran, Saudi tensions are not beneficial to any countries and will only result in unstable conditions. The problems between the two countries need to be solved and we intend to help Iran’s attempts to establish stability in the region”. Johnson also met similar critcisms from Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran’s supreme national security council. Shamkhani was reported as saying since the JCPOA went into effect, economic relations between the UK and Iran have not developed sufficiently, emphasising that developing banking relations could be a first step for expansion of cooperation in other fields. He claimed the US attitude to the nuclear deal has been “a full-scale catastrophe”, adding that such misconduct would cast doubt on all international agreements. The official said the other parties to the JCPOA were only passive observers of Washington’s inappropriate behaviour, adding that Iran would take necessary measures based on its national interests. The foreign secretary has travelled to the United Arab Emirates for further talks that are likely to focus on the crisis in Yemen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/10/chancellor-faces-attempt-by-mps-to-vote-down-autumn-budget","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T18:06:20Z","webTitle":"Chancellor faces attempt by MPs to vote down budget","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/10/chancellor-faces-attempt-by-mps-to-vote-down-autumn-budget","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/10/chancellor-faces-attempt-by-mps-to-vote-down-autumn-budget","fields":{"headline":"Chancellor faces attempt by MPs to vote down budget","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Philip Hammond will face attempts to vote down his budget at the first hurdle on Monday on the grounds that tax cuts for big banks must be stopped and all policies should be subject to a gender audit to show how it affects women. Labour will object to the finance bill at second reading mainly on the grounds that cuts to the bank levy costing £4.7bn should be reversed to finance children’s services. Separately, Labour’s Stella Creasy is leading a cross-party effort backed by more than 70 Labour, SNP, Liberal Democrat, Plaid Cymru and Green MPs, to force the chancellor to release data on how the budget policies affect women and men. She has launched an online campaign, under the hashtag #LadyData, to encourage social media support for the move to “make the government do an independent gender impact assessment on their tax and benefit changes, with the women’s budget group showing how differently these policies affect women and ethnic minorities”. The Labour frontbench and Creasy have tabled “reasoned amendments” to decline to give the finance bill a second reading, but only one will be picked for debate on Monday. The Labour frontbench amendment rejects the finance bill for several reasons, including the continuing cuts to the bank levy and new measures to reduce the scope of the tax so that it applies to fewer banks. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said Hammond had made a political choice to carry on cutting the bank levy instead of ending the crisis in funding of children’s services. “But the chancellor made his decision. The bank levy, introduced shortly after the global financial crisis, is to be cut further, continuing the giveaways made by his predecessor, George Osborne, that will see billions handed back to the major banks by 2020,” he said. “The banking surcharge, supposedly introduced to compensate the taxpayer for this loss, won’t come close to making good the difference.” The Labour frontbench amendment also highlights warnings by the Institute for Fiscal Studies that the UK is facing two decades of lost pay growth, fears by experts that the stamp duty cut will push up house prices, the lack of an equalities impact assessment and failure to relieve the funding crisis in the NHS and social care. Creasy’s amendment declines to give a second reading because it “gives effect to measures in a budget which has not been produced with the benefit of an independent gender impact assessment conducted by the Office for Budget Responsibility to enable the government to understand and address the consequences for the advancement of equality in Britain and in particular to women and ethnic minorities”. A financial model developed by Yvette Cooper, the senior Labour backbencher, and House of Commons library statisticians found that 86% of savings to the Treasury from tax and benefit changes since 2010 had come from women. An analysis by Labour has found that men received 46% more spending in Hammond’s autumn budget. The government insists that the Treasury considered the equality impacts of individual policies on those with protected characteristics – including gender, race and disability – in line with its legal obligations and “its strong commitment to equality”. At the time of the budget, a spokesman said: “We are fully committed to equality and carefully consider how those with protected characteristics are impacted by government policy. About 1.4 million more women are in work since 2010 and the full-time gender pay gap is at a record low. We publish comprehensive distributional analysis at every budget, which shows that the state continues to be highly redistributive.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/dec/11/californias-hellish-fires-a-visit-from-the-ghost-of-christmas-future","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T11:00:03Z","webTitle":"California's hellish fires: a visit from the Ghost of Christmas Future | Dana Nuccitelli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/dec/11/californias-hellish-fires-a-visit-from-the-ghost-of-christmas-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/dec/11/californias-hellish-fires-a-visit-from-the-ghost-of-christmas-future","fields":{"headline":"California's hellish fires: a visit from the Ghost of Christmas Future","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In Charles Dicken’s ‘A Christmas Carol,’ the Ghost of Christmas Future appears to Ebenezer Scrooge to show what will happen if he doesn’t change his greedy, selfish life. California’s record wildfires are similarly giving us a glimpse of our future hellish climate if we continue with our current behavior. California’s textbook example of weather whiplash This year, California experienced its worst and most expensive wildfire season on record. This surprised many, because while the state recently had its worst drought in over 1,200 years, the 5-year drought ended in 2016. However, California was hit by the opposite extreme in 2017, with its wettest rainy season on record. Though it seems counter-intuitive, the wet season contributed to the state’s wildfires. The resulting vegetation growth created fuel for the 2017 fire season, particularly after being dried out by high temperatures. 2017 was the hottest summer in record on California, breaking the previous record set just last year by a full degree Fahrenheit. As Stephen Pyne put it, “Whether it’s exceptionally wet or exceptionally dry, you’ve got the material for a fire in California.” California’s wildfire season normally ends in October – big wildfires are relatively rare in November and December. But fires are raging in Southern California two weeks shy of Christmas, impossible to contain due to intense Santa Ana winds, creating hellish scenes. This was predicted by climate scientists A 2006 study published in Geophysical Research Letters found that global warming would push the Southern California fire season associated with Santa Ana winds into the winter months. As a 2015 study published in Environmental Research Letters found, Santa Ana fires are especially costly because of the speed at which they spread due to the winds and their proximity to urban areas. That study concluded that the area burned by Southern California wildfires will increase by about 70% by mid-century due to the drier, hotter, windier conditions caused by global warming. A 2010 study published in Forest Ecology and Management found that global warming may extend the fire season year-round in California and the southwestern USA. These December fires will become more commonplace in a hotter world. We’re literally getting a glimpse at Christmas future, and though there are other factors at play, human-caused global warming is largely to blame. A 2015 special report in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society found that “An increase in fire risk in California is attributable to human-induced climate change.” A 2016 study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that human-caused global warming doubled the area burned by wildfires in the western USA over just the past 30 years. Add to that a new study just published in Nature Communications finding a connection between Arctic sea ice and high pressure ridges of California’s coast that can block storms from passing over the state. These results suggest that as Arctic sea ice continues to disappear due to global warming, California may see less rainfall and thus even worse droughts, which along with higher temperatures would lead to worse wildfire seasons. Scrooge changed - will Trump and Republicans? Of course, climate-intensified extreme weather isn’t limited to California. In 2017, intense heat waves, droughts, wildfires, hurricanes, and floods impacted virtually every state in the country. America was absolutely pummeled by climate change this year. When the Ghost of Christmas Future showed Ebenezer Scrooge how miserable his life would become, Scrooge changed his behavior to avoid that outcome. So far, although Americans are more concerned about climate change than ever, their president and the party in power of government aren’t even willing to talk about the problem. In the midst of hurricanes Harvey and Irma, Trump’s EPA administrator Scott Pruitt said: ...to discuss the cause and effect of these storms, there’s the... place (and time) to do that, it’s not now. Three months later, the administration has yet to discuss the cause and effect of those storms, although climate scientists have concluded that climate change made the impacts of the hurricanes worse. In fact, a recent study by MIT climate scientist Kerry Emanuel found that global warming made the extreme precipitation associated with Hurricane Harvey six times more likely. One wonders how much worse climate-intensified extreme weather must become to convince America’s leaders behave as rationally as Ebenezer Scrooge. Will they change their greedy, selfish behavior before these fiery Christmases become commonplace?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/10/james-degale-caleb-truax-fight-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T00:01:44Z","webTitle":"James DeGale shocked by Caleb Truax in IBF super-middleweight title upset","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/10/james-degale-caleb-truax-fight-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/10/james-degale-caleb-truax-fight-report","fields":{"headline":"James DeGale shocked by Caleb Truax in IBF super-middleweight title upset","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Even in his worst nightmares, James DeGale could not have imagined his first fight on British soil in three years playing out like this. In front of a near sell-out crowd in east London, the 31-year-old was meant to retain his IBF super middleweight title with something to spare against the American Caleb Truax. Instead he ended the evening defeated via a majority points decision and ultimately dethroned and dejected, his face red from a beating. He has to contemplate where his career goes now. Certainly talk of unifying the division can be shelved; that contest against the WBC champion, David Benavidez, next spring is a practical non-starter and the hope of then going on to face the WBA champion and bitter rival George Groves is a distant dream. DeGale has made no secret of his desire to get in a ring again with Groves after his points defeat to the 29-year-old in May 2011, but as he admitted himself he must first “go back to the drawing board” and figure out how he was undone here. Certainly Groves has no desire for a rematch judging by his tweet after the judges’ scores of 114-114, 115-112 and 116-112 in Truax’s favour had been announced. “Call it a day mate, you ain’t got no more,” he wrote, no doubt with a grin spread across his face. DeGale looked severely out of sorts here, consistently pushed back by his more aggressive opponent, and when given the opportunity to attack he rarely threw a jab, let alone anything that was going to seriously hurt Truax. Ring rust may have been an issue given this was DeGale’s first bout since his draw with Badou Jack in Brooklyn 11 months ago. The long absence was largely down to the fact that the 2008 Olympic champion tore his right shoulder in the contest, an injury that required surgery and months of rehabilitation, and left DeGale “doubting myself”. Those doubts appeared to still be haunting him at this 2012 Olympic venue, as did the physical effects, given his lack of willingness to throw the right arm in particular. “Perhaps I rushed back too soon,” conceded DeGale, whose last domestic bout was the knockout win over the Mexican Marco Antonio Peribán at the Echo Arena, Liverpool, in November 2014. Credit should be given to Truax. The man from Minnesota arrived on these shores with a 28-3-2 record, never having beaten anyone of note. But he was on the front foot from the outset, setting the pace and leaving DeGale with nowhere to go. The champion’s nose was cut open during an explosive fifth round, when his head was also rocked back by a straight right and sharp uppercut from the challenger. Truax scented blood and continued to force DeGale back. He pinned the 31-year-old on to the ropes with his jab in the 10th and also landed on the bottom of his jaw with a close-range uppercut. DeGale did come back in the 11th, changing angles and connecting with an uppercut of his own, before exerting more pressure in the final round, but ultimately it was not enough. DeGale’s record now stands at 23-2-1, he is no longer a world champion and his future looks decidedly uncertain. Earlier, the IBF world featherweight champion Lee Selby overcame the Mexican Eduardo Ramirez via a unanimous points decision to extend his record to 26-1 and put a positive end to what has been a miserable year for the Welshman. Selby has had to endure the deaths of his mother and grandfather in 2017, as well as seeing his dream of fighting in Las Vegas ruined when Jonathan Victor Barros failed a blood test before their contest in January, although Selby did come out on top when they eventually met at Wembley Arena in the summer. The build-up to this fight had also been difficult, with Ramirez going missing before Thursday’s press conference and then coming in eight pounds over the 126lb limit prior to Friday’s weigh-in, making him ineligible for Selby’s belt even with a win here. If the 24-year-old’s pre-fight behaviour was unprofessional, in the ring he proved a serious test for Selby, relentlessly coming at the champion and pinning him on to the ropes in the 11th round with a barrage of punches. But Selby was always on top, outclassing Ramirez with his movement off the back foot and regularly stopping the man from Sinaloa, who was taking part in his first world title fight, with the cleaner, harder shots. That’s how the judges at ringside saw it, too, scoring the fight 118-110, 119-109, 116-112 in Selby’s favour. Prior to Selby’s triumph, there were also impressive, knockout victories for two rising domestic talents, heavyweight Daniel Dubois (6-0) and light heavyweight Anthony Yarde (14-0)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/09/police-crystal-palace-fans-false-stories-knuckle-dusters-knives-brighton","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-09T21:50:00Z","webTitle":"Police must get to bottom of false stories about Crystal Palace fans | Daniel Taylor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/09/police-crystal-palace-fans-false-stories-knuckle-dusters-knives-brighton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/09/police-crystal-palace-fans-false-stories-knuckle-dusters-knives-brighton","fields":{"headline":"Police must get to bottom of false stories about Crystal Palace fans","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"There is an old episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm in which Larry David is sitting in traffic when the lights change to green and the car in front does not move. The only issue is that it happens to be a police car and, in those circumstances, what is the etiquette? Who beeps a police car? Larry, is the answer. “No one’s above the beep,” he explains when the police officer gets out of his car. OK, it is not to be taken too seriously (Larry is also wearing a wig and a false moustache after a fatwa for planning to make a Broadway musical, coincidentally named Fatwa!, about Salman Rushdie). Yet it is easy to sympathise and, ultimately, beeping doesn’t do Larry any good. Officer Jenkins doesn’t take kindly to being asked if he was daydreaming and is not prepared to accept Larry’s get-out clause that, driving a new car, he wasn’t attuned to the subtleties of the horn and had meant it to be a pip rather than a beep. Larry gets a ticket. He takes it to an appeal and the judge accepts the officer was on “important police business”. The case is dismissed and Larry is reminded it doesn’t always make sense to take on the police. Sometimes, though, it is too important to let go and, back in the real world, that was certainly some victory for Crystal Palace’s supporters, in the face of some wildly inaccurate allegations, when Sussex police performed their volte-face and issued an apology for their cock‑and‑bull story about what happened at their game at Brighton. This one is about something more serious than whether a police officer might have been daydreaming at traffic lights, too, bearing in mind the official version of events for the previous week and a half was that Palace’s away fans had armed themselves with knives and knuckle‑dusters. It turned out – well, whaddya know? – there were actually no weapons found and the whole thing was made up. Yet we still cannot be sure by whom. Press statements from the police don’t tend to include those details and a few hours before the public confession from Sussex HQ it also became clear that the officer who had spread this misinformation to the media was going off-radar. “Please excuse some Twitter silence while I’m off and abroad for a few days. Keep safe,” Ch Insp Simon Nelson wrote on his social-media account. His 50th birthday, apparently. Fair enough. One imagines he has found it difficult to switch off, though, after the events of the past few days and it is certainly fair to say that a high‑ranking officer with his experience probably ought to realise he needs to be absolutely sure of the facts before sharing these non-facts with the world’s media and talking about it as “a return to the dark days of football”. Ch Insp Nelson was certainly a lot more talkative after the game and – suitably proud, it appeared, of the publicity that his comments generated – he also took to Twitter to post one of the many newspaper articles where he was quoted. Every newspaper carried the story, all of them concentrating on the knives and knuckle‑dusters angle. It was on television, the radio, the news wires – and genuinely shocking bearing in mind the damage these weapons can inflict. He was “extremely grateful”, he let us know the following day, for so many kind messages about the bravery of his officers. And, despite everything, that still stands. A mate of mine used to be in the Metropolitan police football unit and it was dangerous work. Palace were never the worst offenders but it would be naive not to think they have some old faces who, if you know your hooligan films, see these category-A fixtures as a chance to re-enact the role of Yeti, of the South London Buccaneers. Or, indeed, that there might be a few younger ones who think a Stone Island badge and a nice pair of trainers qualifies them for bravery points. Two stewards needed hospital treatment and there are clips of fans storming one of the turnstiles to force their way in. Flares were set off during the match and there were other incidents at the railway station. Brighton have a few headbangers themselves. It clearly wasn’t a pleasant night for the police. Yet it becomes a lot more sinister when there are stories of people taking knives and knuckle‑dusters to the stadium. That’s a very different level of violence – unprecedented, almost certainly, inside our shiny grounds in the Premier League era – and there are still a number of unanswered questions for Sussex police about the precise sequence of events that led to the original 543-word statement on 29 November, as opposed to the 87-word correction accepting the original release was untrue. Shortly before the apology was issued, Ch Insp Nelson stated on Thursday that the Palace fans should take it up with Brighton because “it was their staff who found those items in the away end”. That assertion, his police force admitted a few hours later, was also untrue and, to give him his due, he did reappear with an apology of his own the following day: “The information regarding discarded weapons and pyros in the away end of the stadium was passed to us and believed to be true – this was clearly not the case.” So, how about being transparent and letting everyone know what did actually go wrong? Who set the ball rolling? Did a senior police officer release that information as fact without bothering to check it out? These are important questions when one takes into account the potential damage to the reputation of Palace, the club’s supporters and also football fans in general, not to mention the heightened tensions now the sides have been brought together again in the FA Cup third round. That tie has been scheduled, with almost zero common sense, for a 7.45pm kick-off and is not going to be a great deal of fun for the officers on the frontline. I also doubt very much that we would even have had a follow-up statement, let alone an apology, from the police had it not been for the diligence of the Five Year Plan fanzine, whose editorial team immediately suspected that something didn’t ring true. A freedom-of-information request has gone in via the fanzine’s online editor, Robert Sutherland, and the police might have to understand why some supporters are wondering whether it was all a bit convenient that the headlines were manipulated that way on a night when Ch Insp Nelson and his colleagues might otherwise have faced some awkward questions about their handling of the game. Don’t overlook the fact that a significant number of Palace fans, having paid for their tickets and travel, didn’t even get in, held outside the ground by several lines of police before being escorted to the railway station without seeing a single minute of football. Yet there has been very little about that in the media over the last couple of weeks. The story changed dramatically once it was alleged that Palace fans were tooled-up and dangerous. A return to the dark days of football? Well, yes, if we are reminiscing about the times when it was all the rage to spread misinformation about football fans and not be held accountable. Mourinho’s touch of Drogba amnesia José Mourinho’s accusations of diving from Manchester City players strikes me as a bit rich bearing in mind he has previously managed Didier Drogba, Arjen Robben, Pepe and an extensive list of some of the sport’s other great thespians. Mourinho presumably had Raheem Sterling in mind – or, more likely, Michael Oliver, the referee of Sunday’s derby – when he noted how “a little bit of wind and they fall”. Yet it hasn’t been a common allegation this season, bar some extraordinary sour grapes from Arsène Wenger, and let’s not forget it needed only the mildest of breezes to knock down Drogba in his Chelsea days, often with the effect of a man who had just been shot with an imaginary Taser. In fairness to Mourinho, he is far from the only manager in the history of Manchester’s football enmity to lapse into this hypocrisy and my mind goes back to the days when Roberto Mancini was in charge at the place Sir Alex Ferguson used to call the Temple of Doom. The most regular complaint from Old Trafford at that time was the number of penalties the team in blue were awarded. “Twenty-one in the last year, isn’t it?” Ferguson wanted to know. “If we were to get that number of penalty kicks there would be an inquiry in the House of Commons. There would be a protest.” Mancini’s press conference was next and what a great response it was, too. City’s manager leant forward in his chair, put his hands together and stooped his head in the manner of someone diving off the top board. “But I remember very well last year,” he said. “[Ashley] Young, when he went swimming … I think it was four or five times in the last 10 games and he [Ferguson] didn’t say nothing.” That is the beauty of holding your press conference straight after the other guy: you always get the chance to have the final word. These days it is all choreographed between the two clubs so the questions are asked at exactly the same time, thereby eliminating the potential for one manager to respond to the comments of the other. It was much more fun the other way – and I still wouldn’t bet against Mourinho going back to the old system. Sullivan does his bit for team spirit A penny for José Fonte’s thoughts after reading David Sullivan’s interview in the Guardian and learning the West Ham co-owner wished he had listened to his teenage children when it came to some of Slaven Bilic’s signings. Sullivan had just explained that he regretted not sacking the Croat in the summer and went on to identify some of the mistakes that had been made in the transfer market. “The manager said he wanted Fonte from Southampton and [Robert] Snodgrass from Hull. My kids begged me not to sign them.” At least Snodgrass (left), on loan at Aston Villa, does not have to worry too much about such a resounding vote of confidence. Not until he returns to West Ham at the end of the season, anyway. Fonte, however, is still there, recovering from an injury and brilliantly motivated, one assumes, by such generous words from the man at the top. It all feels rather typical of Sullivan, unfortunately – and just another reason why so many West Ham fans wish it could be another way."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/09/human-rights-commission-to-launch-own-grenfell-fire-inquiry","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-09T20:30:16Z","webTitle":"Human rights commission to launch its own Grenfell fire inquiry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/09/human-rights-commission-to-launch-own-grenfell-fire-inquiry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/09/human-rights-commission-to-launch-own-grenfell-fire-inquiry","fields":{"headline":"Human rights commission to launch its own Grenfell fire inquiry","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Britain’s human rights watchdog is to launch an inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire that will examine whether the government and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea failed in their duties to protect life and provide safe housing. The dramatic intervention by the independent Equality and Human Rights Commission, which has the potential to draw damning conclusions about the role of the state, could foreshadow the official inquiry, ordered by Theresa May and chaired by retired judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick, which has been criticised for excluding social housing policy from its remit. The commission’s recommendations are due to be published in April, considerably earlier than the official inquiry’s full findings. The commission’s chair, David Isaac, said the EHRC, whose application to become a core participant in the official inquiry was rejected, had decided to launch its own inquiry amid concerns that key questions – including the extent to which the state has “a duty to protect its citizens”– were being neglected. While acknowledging that the move might be seen as “controversial” in some quarters, he defended the commission’s decision to become involved. “We are the UK’s national human rights body and we have a statutory duty to promote equality and human rights,” Isaac said in an interview with the Observer. “We think the human rights dimension to Grenfell Tower is absolutely fundamental and is currently overlooked. Grenfell for most people in this country, particularly in the way the government has reacted, is a pretty defining moment in terms of how inequality is perceived.” He recalled his reaction to the tragic events of 14 June. “Like everybody else, it was shock, horror, distress. I think it was a national moment that defined how certain parts of society experience the state’s public provision of housing and also how the state responds. We need to learn from what’s happened with Grenfell, look at it in the context of our human rights obligations, and think about how we can improve. There are loads of lessons to be learned.” Last week it emerged that four out of every five families who were made homeless in the fire are still looking for new housing, with almost half of them likely to spend Christmas in emergency accommodation. The EHRC inquiry, which will involve a panel of legal experts, will pay particular attention to the UK’s obligations to the tower’s residents under the Human Rights Act and international law. At a time when some want the act scrapped, the inquiry’s actions could be viewed as provocative. “Human rights are for everybody,” Isaac said. “This is political and I know there is a view among some politicians, but also among society more generally, that human rights only protect extremists and terrorists but that isn’t the case at all. I always talk about Hillsborough as a really good example of where the Human Rights Act and the human rights lens has been used effectively to ensure justice prevailed.” In a statement to be published on its website tomorrow, explaining its decision to launch what it refers to as its “project”, the EHRC will say: “The Grenfell Tower fire caused catastrophic loss of life for which the state may have been responsible. More than 70 people died in homes managed by the state. They should have been safe and they were not. The people who died and others affected by the fire come from diverse backgrounds. They include children, elderly people, disabled people and migrants.” Isaac rejected suggestions that it would undermine the official inquiry. He expressed the wish that it would be a “lens through which the official inquiry wishes to see things”. “It’s to be complementary to it. We will be calling on experts, particularly legal experts, looking at the international human rights obligations, asking for submissions from a whole variety of stakeholders. It’s not a parallel inquiry. It’s to look at what we think is important and what’s missing from the official inquiry, which is the human rights and equalities perspective.” The move threatens to put the commission on a collision course with the government over a range of contentious issues. Its inquiry will examine how the state discharges its investigative obligations following an event such as the Grenfell fire and whether the current arrangements, including the public inquiry, are satisfactory. It will look at the extent to which various state bodies discharged their duty to protect life and whether the survivors of the fire and those who witnessed it, or were otherwise affected by it, may have suffered harm that constitutes “inhuman and degrading treatment”. It will also examine whether the housing provided for the tower’s residents by the state was adequate and safe as defined by human rights law; whether adequate legal advice was provided before and after the fire and whether certain groups – disabled people, children and migrants who experienced the fire – were subject to discrimination. The commission’s decision to examine the Grenfell Tower fire reflects a more muscular approach to addressing human rights and equality issues. Recently it has brought a number of high-profile legal actions and launched several major inquiries, such as that into the gender pay gap. Isaac said: “We are a more confident organisation and this is a good example of us being that – holding the government to account by doing what only we can do. It might be perceived to be controversial but I believe that’s our role.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/10/labor-mps-dont-see-katy-gallagher-as-citizenship-test-case-dreyfus-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-09T23:47:13Z","webTitle":"Labor MPs don't see Katy Gallagher as citizenship test case, Dreyfus says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/10/labor-mps-dont-see-katy-gallagher-as-citizenship-test-case-dreyfus-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/10/labor-mps-dont-see-katy-gallagher-as-citizenship-test-case-dreyfus-says","fields":{"headline":"Labor MPs don't see Katy Gallagher as citizenship test case, Dreyfus says","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Mark Dreyfus has denied that Katy Gallagher’s citizenship case provides a precedent for other Labor MPs whose eligibility is in doubt, rejecting the government’s view if Gallagher loses the others should fall on their swords. The comments from the shadow attorney general suggest that even if the high court finds Gallagher ineligible Labor will insist on further high court hearings to determine the cases of Josh Wilson, Justine Keay, and Susan Lamb. The cases could stretch the crisis of eligibility hanging over Australia’s parliamentarians well into 2018 and stave off byelections in Labor-held seats for months if they are found ineligible. Gallagher, who is a senator, and lower house MPs Keay, and Wilson were all British citizens at the nomination date for the 2016 election, but Labor has refused to refer the MPs to the high court because they took “all steps reasonably required” to renounce in time. On Friday Malcolm Turnbull said Keay and Wilson’s fate “will be determined by the Gallagher case because the facts are essentially the same”. “If Katy Gallagher is successful then they will rest easy. If she is unsuccessful then they will have to resign.” On Sunday Dreyfus told ABC’s Insiders that Labor believed Gallagher was eligible since she had taken “reasonable steps” to renounce but had agreed to refer her because “we want this cleared up”. “[Gallagher], like the rest of us in Labor, cares about the constitutional legitimacy of the Australian parliament … and the high court will clear this up.” Asked if Gallagher’s case would provide a precedent for the other Labor MPs, Dreyfus replied: “Not really. “Each case has to be determined on the particular circumstances of the candidate or member concerned and Josh Wilson is a different case again,” he said. Citizenship declarations this week revealed that Wilson sent his renunciation to the UK Home Office on 13 May, 2016, immediately after Labor dumped its previous candidate for Fremantle. He received his document stamped on 29 June confirming his renunciation, after the nomination date of 9 June. Dreyfus incorrectly claimed that Wilson was “pre-selected the day before nominations closed”. Wilson knew he was a dual citizen but “hadn’t thought he was going to be a candidate”, Dreyfus explained. “He did everything possible as quickly as he possibly could, but he only had 24 hours.” A spokeswoman for Dreyfus clarified that Wilson had sent forms off within 24 hours of being preselected, rather than 24 hours before the nomination deadline. Keay applied to renounce in May 2016 but did not receive confirmation of her renunciation until 11 July. Keay, who was preselected 12 months out from the election, has since admitted she waited three months after receiving advice to renounce before sending off her form. Dreyfus said Keay’s case demonstrated the point “that each person’s circumstances are a lot different” and added that he doesn’t believe that fact made her case more difficult. Gallagher and Labor MP David Feeney were referred to the high court this week, but the government narrowly defeated a Labor and crossbench motion to send others including Lamb, Keay and Wilson; Liberals Julia Banks, Alex Hawke, Nola Marino and Jason Falinski; and the Nick Xenophon Team MP Rebekha Sharkie. Dreyfus accused Turnbull of turning a “disclosure system” into a “concealment system”, citing the fact Marino released a document clearing her of having Italian citizenship after the disclosure process. He said she still had questions to answer about whether she had US citizenship. Asked why Labor had queried Josh Frydenberg, whose citizenship status is caught up in the fact his mother fled Hungary to escape the Holocaust, Dreyfus said Labor had not singled him out but rather complained that a group of Liberal MPs had not made “adequate disclosure”. Dreyfus said he was sympathetic to Frydenberg’s situation but it was “not for me to say … that the constitution shouldn’t apply to him”. “I’m very much hoping that he can demonstrate, by just giving some of the material facts, or releasing the legal advice, that he’s got nothing to be concerned about. “But at the moment, his disclosure statements says nothing. It says that his mother, who escaped the Holocaust, was born in 1943 in Hungary and that’s all it says. It says that he’s got legal advice but he doesn’t say what it says.” The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, told Sky News on Sunday the government had already referred its MPs where they had issues and complained Labor had “picked at random” four Coalition MPs to attempt to refer in a bid to protect four of its own. “Where it’s clear now that people do have a problem in the Labor party, they should have been referred by Bill Shorten,” he said. After filling a Senate vacancy in 2015, Gallagher submitted forms to renounce her British citizenship on 20 April, 2016 but the renunciation was not confirmed until 16 August. Sharkie is in the same situation of having renounced British citizenship before nominating but it was not effective until after the deadline. Lamb disclosed that she sent her renunciation form to the UK Home Office on 25 May 2016. The Home Office sought further information on 7 July and on 10 August it responded that it “cannot be satisfied from the documents available” that Lamb held British citizenship, and therefore refused her application to renounce."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/dec/10/nureyev-premiere-moscow-bolshoi-kirill-serebrennikov-house-arrest","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T14:13:09Z","webTitle":"Nureyev premieres in Moscow with director under house arrest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/dec/10/nureyev-premiere-moscow-bolshoi-kirill-serebrennikov-house-arrest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/dec/10/nureyev-premiere-moscow-bolshoi-kirill-serebrennikov-house-arrest","fields":{"headline":"Nureyev premieres in Moscow with director under house arrest","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The most hotly anticipated and controversial Russian ballet in years has been premiered as Moscow’s Bolshoi Theatre finally staged Nureyev, which tells the life story of the dancer. The theatre’s best dancers took to the stage on Saturday night with much of the Russian elite in the audience. But the ballet’s director, Kirill Serebrennikov, was conspicuously absent, having spent the past few months under house arrest. Nureyev’s summer premiere was cancelled at the last minute, with speculation that gay themes in the ballet may have angered some government figures. Rudolf Nureyev, who began his career at St Petersburg’s Mariinsky Theatre – known as the Kirov in Soviet times – is widely regarded as ballet’s most gifted male dancer. He defected to the west in 1961, had gay relationships and died from an Aids-related illness in 1993 aged 54. In Putin’s Russia, where “homosexual propaganda” is illegal and distrust of the west is again high, such themes were always going to be controversial. In August, Serebrennikov was placed under house arrest as authorities investigated supposed misappropriation of cultural funds in a case that has shocked the theatre world, which many have suggested could be retribution for pushing artistic boundaries. Serebrennikov’s lawyers had asked for permission for the director to be given leave to attend the final rehearsals of the production, but this was denied. Bolshoi management said they had secured the director’s agreement to go ahead. Only a few hundred tickets were put on general sale for the rescheduled run of two performances, with ballet fans having to queue for hours to get them. The rest were distributed among the Bolshoi’s powerful donors and patrons. The hall for the premiere was a who’s who of Moscow high society, from billionaires and government officials to models and celebrities. The Bolshoi has long had a reputation for scandal on and off stage. In 2013, Pavel Dmitrichenko, a dancer, ordered an acid attack on Sergei Filin, the artistic director of the ballet troupe, and was jailed. But even by the Bolshoi’s standards, the Moscow beau monde giving a standing ovation to a play with its director under arrest was a surreal sight. The ballet, composed by Ilya Demutsky and choreographed by Yuri Possokhov, is based on an auction of Nureyev’s possessions after the dancer’s death, with each possession a way into a story from his life. Unusually for a ballet, it features an on-stage narrator in the form of the auctioneer, explaining the significance of each item. Serebrennikov is one of Russia’s leading directors, having worked in theatre, film, opera and ballet and staged a number of productions abroad. He is the artistic director of Gogol Centre, a Moscow theatre that often stages politically edgy productions, and has been an outspoken critic of artistic censorship in the Russian theatre scene. “Everyone is scared of offending the officials, who you have to go to and beg for money from,” he told the Guardian last year. The director has many powerful fans, but also many detractors. Nikita Mikhalkov, one of Russia’s best-known film directors, showed little sympathy for Serebrennikov and said the production of Nureyev was inappropriate for the hallowed Bolshoi stage. “If you want to hang Nureyev’s cock on the back of the stage, do it at your Gogol Centre. Why do it in the Bolshoi Theatre?” he said. In the end, the nude photograph of Nureyev, which had featured in footage from summer rehearsals, had been cropped in this version so as not to show genitalia. Nevertheless, the production made no secret of the dancer’s sexuality, with gay themes present throughout. There was much in the production that seemed to take on an extra meaning given the unusual context of the performance, including sections that mused on Nureyev’s defection and the Soviet Union’s attitudes to its artistic talents. “It is a real shame when a country does not value its heroes,” was one line from a letter to Nureyev read out during the production. It is possible that the success of the premiere will increase calls for Serebrennikov’s release. Alexei Kudrin, a former finance minister and longstanding confidant of Vladimir Putin tweeted: “It is unfair that Kirill Serebrennikov was not at his own premiere.” At the final curtain call, the audience gave a lengthy standing ovation as the production team came on to the stage wearing T-shirts featuring Serebrennikov’s face and the slogan “Free the director”. In the second row of the stalls, Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, and his ice dancer wife, Tatyana Navka, were among those applauding enthusiastically. Putin has publicly denied that there are any political undertones to the Serebrennikov case, saying in September that it was a legal matter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/10/said-and-done-football-diary-fifa-russia-doping-vitaly-mutko","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T09:40:32Z","webTitle":"Said & Done: ‘There's zero tolerance on doping.

As Claude Puel’s quietly effective “velvet” Leicester revolution continued with a third straight win and the home side’s 125th birthday party was ruined, Rafa Benítez had every right to look worried. Newcastle’s manager knows that simply holding their own requires his players to perform at maximum capacity. At times his team resembled the driver of a modest city run-about pressing their foot flat to the floor as they struggle to overtake lorries on a motorway. Togetherness and tenacity can only take a squad now hovering just above the relegation zone so far. “I’m really disappointed,” said Benítez. “The players, they put in an effort, but still we have to improve if we want to get points in these kind of games. We’ve paid for easy mistakes. We have to learn quickly.” After a highly evocative preamble, which saw the 125th anniversary of Newcastle’s formation marked by home supporters waving a multitude of flags, raising numerous banners and generally turning the stands into a sea of black and white, Joselu opened the scoring. Newcastle’s fifth-minute goal began with Dwight Gayle pulling wide, dodging Danny Simpson and haring down the left. He then cut the ball back for the onrushing, and unmarked, Joselu to beat Kasper Schmeichel with a first-time, right-foot shot. When Gayle subsequently fired fractionally wide, Benítez’s tactical gamble in fielding two strikers in a 4-4-2 formation seemed vindicated. The downside was that it left Leicester with an extra man in midfield, along with additional counterattacking scope. Sure enough Puel was soon celebrating a stunning, crowd-silencing equaliser from Riyad Mahrez. It originated in central midfield where Mikel Merino, once again preferred to Jonjo Shelvey, forfeited possession to the influential Wilfred Ndidi. That slapdash loss of concentration liberated Mahrez to run at the heart of Newcastle’s defence before eluding Karl Darlow’s grasp courtesy of a left-footed, 25-yard shot which the goalkeeper touched but could not hold as it arrowed into the top corner. It was an eye-catching finish from a rejuvenated playmaker but Darlow, preferred to Rob Elliot, looked disappointed not to have held it. Tellingly, Benítez was left deeply frustrated when Newcastle’s owner, Mike Ashley, thwarted his attempts to sign an experienced keeper last summer. Merino’s recruitment was sanctioned and, overall, he looks a very good buy but, unusually, the Basque midfielder struggled here, looking ruffled whenever the thoroughly menacing Demarai Gray entered his sphere. By half-time the increasingly elusive Gray had, tantalisingly, curled a couple of shots inches wide. With Matt Ritchie’s own travails suggesting Newcastle’s right winger has hit a bit of a wall and needs a rest, Benítez could do with making a couple of signings next month with a Gray-esque capacity for making things happen. Unfortunately, with negotiations progressing slowly as Ashley and Amanda Staveley haggle over the terms of the latter’s mooted takeover, he remains unsure if he will be equipped with the funds needed to avert a relegation skirmish. Although Schmeichel saved smartly from Jacob Murphy, the trio of Gray, Mahrez and Ndidi were all in such impressive form that Leicester – who had a penalty appeal rejected when Jamie Vardy crumpled under DeAndre Yedlin’s challenge – appeared comfortably in control. An intensifying Arctic chill ensured spectators lost feeling in their fingers and toes, and early evening Geordie optimism ebbed away. Such fears were realised in the 60th minute. Granted, Gray deserved a goal but after meeting Marc Albrighton’s adroit pass, a little luck entered the equation when his shot swerved past a wrong-footed Darlow after deflecting off Florian Lejeune. That said, Mahrez’s glorious crossfield pass which prefaced Albrighton’s assist merited proper reward. Hearteningly for Benítez, Newcastle refused to fold and, in the fallout from Merino’s panic-provoking header following a corner, Gayle’s left-footed shot deflected off Harry Maguire before whizzing past Schmeichel. With the game thrillingly open, Gayle shot marginally wide but Leicester’s counterattacking skill won it. Their decisive break concluded with Vardy riding Lejeune’s tackle before crossing, Shinji Okazaki shaping to shoot and Pérez’s desperate attempt to clear diverting the ball into his own net. The Japan striker was duly rewarded for playing on despite a head wound leaving him swathed in bandages. “Shinji’s kamikaze,” said the often inscrutable Puel. “He’s fantastic, he gives his body for the team.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/09/grenfell-tower-disaster-six-months-on-survivors-winter-london","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-09T20:30:16Z","webTitle":"Six months on, Grenfell Tower fire survivors are left demanding answers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/09/grenfell-tower-disaster-six-months-on-survivors-winter-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/09/grenfell-tower-disaster-six-months-on-survivors-winter-london","fields":{"headline":"Six months on, Grenfell Tower fire survivors are left demanding answers","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"“Nobody understands how angry we are yet, and they don’t understand the resolve that we’ve shown to not lose the anger. People don’t understand we watched 71 people die,” says Ishmael Francis-Murray, who lives next to Grenfell Tower. “[The council is] not helping nobody, they don’t care about my mum, they don’t care about my kids, they don’t care about my estate or my community,” says the 35-year-old father, who was born in the tower. “The community response is the only thing that saved everything from burning down. And they know this, and they still don’t want to give the community no credit. They still want to call us immigrants or whatnot. But without us, nothing would’ve happened.” Six months on from the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 71 people, the urgency, desperation and pain that followed from those horrific early hours of 14 June is still raw. There is a growing sense of anger and betrayal at the local authority’s response. As Christmas approaches, many families will spend the holiday period in a hotel room. Four out of five families made homeless by the fire are still looking for homes, and 118 households will still be in emergency accommodation or with friends over the holiday period, according to the support group Grenfell United. “Christmas isn’t really Christmas this year,” Francis-Murray says. The public inquiry into the disaster was launched in September, led by the retired judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick. It has left many locals disillusioned and lacking trust in the process. “I have zero per cent faith in anything. We’ve lost already. He [Moore-Bick] is not for us,” Francis-Murray adds. “British justice to me is, do the crime, you go to court, you get found guilty, you go to jail. I want to see it on them.” On Saturday, the victim-supporting organisation Inquest called for bereaved relatives and survivors to be put more squarely at the heart of the inquiry. Survivors had previously demanded that Moore-Bick be assisted by a panel made up of people with a “real understanding of the issues facing those affected”. The erosion of trust has left many worried that they will never see justice. “If someone doesn’t get found guilty and go to jail for this, I’m telling you this city is going to burn. I’m not saying I’m going to burn it – I’ve got kids, I want to be here,” Francis-Murray says. In the shadow of the burnt-out tower on Bramley Road, the streets are still filled with memorials. Every lamppost, tree and railing is wrapped in flowers, teddy bears, ribbons, poems and candles. Every wall and pillar is covered with messages of love, anger, dedication and prayer. In a statement issued after the official inquiry’s terms of reference were announced, Elizabeth Campbell, the leader of Kensington and Chelsea council, said: “I echo the wishes of the local community – we must find out what went wrong and make sure it never happens again, not only in this borough but anywhere in the UK.” But the bitter sense of betrayal in the area is palpable. In the freezing wind, a 77-year-old Catholic nun is tending to a shrine on the side of the street. “I’ve seen a lot of natural disasters. This is evil, human disaster. Deliberate. I’m furious. I want the world to know,” says Sister Ruth, who lives opposite the tower and lost two of her carers in the fire. “I think TMO [Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation] and the council are revolting. They tell lies and cover up. They’re vile,” she says. “They’re criminals, murderers, liars and pigs.” She too worries for those spending Christmas in hotels: “It’s disgusting. They [the council] should be ashamed of themselves.” She has no faith in the public inquiry, but says she is confident that Michael Mansfield QC, who is representing some of the survivors, will bring them justice: “We’ve got all the proof, all the evidence, all of it. They can’t keep telling lies. We know the truth. We won’t forget, and we’re going to fight for justice and we will get justice. I know.” Further down the road is Latymer community church, which served as a hub in the wake of the fire. Outside, the church has been wrapped in plastic to preserve the hundreds of messages written on the walls. Simon Blanchflower, part of the church leadership team, says that the loss of confidence in the housing management organisation and the council must be addressed: “What does that new reality look like? How is the council housing in this borough going to be managed going forward? For a lot of people that’s a really important aspect to try to work out what the future looks like. “People are at very different stages of dealing with all of this. For those [living in temporary accommodation] it’s still quite raw, in the sense of living in quite cramped space, in hotel rooms. People can’t continue to rebuild their lives.” The monthly march of commemoration, in which members of the community silently walk around the estate, serves as an important mark of reflection and defiance. “It’s a silent shout for justice, that we won’t be forgotten,” Blanchflower says. As the forensic teams wrap up their work, there will eventually be a time when the tower will be demolished. “Then it’ll be about, what’s the right memorial? The community needs a memorial, needs a point of reference, a point of reflection,” he adds. “It’s a community still trying to shape what its future looks like.” The local Labour MP, Emma Dent Coad, says there is a feeling of “utter frustration” towards the council. “[Those affected by the fire] are having to bid for everything, they’re having to ask for everything. They shouldn’t have to apply for every stick of furniture, every home, every meal. They’re bidding for homes against the neighbours. They’re bidding for homes against the people who either they saved or who saved their lives. It’s horrible.” She says that while the council is organising Christmas activities for children, that won’t fix the sense of loss: “It’s still Christmas, there’s a huge emotional investment in seeing family and doing lovely things and cooking for people, and all of that. How’s that going to happen for people stuck in hotels?” Art has played a big role in the shaping and reflecting the community in the past six months. A local artist who goes by the name of Livingstone has created a huge outdoor community arts centre in the underpass beneath the tube station. He lives near the tower and lost friends in the fire. “Me and my crew are just fighting to get some spare housing. Empty houses, so we can get in there, fix them up, and give them back to the community,” he says. “My trust is with the community. They tell the truth. “Christmas should be something like a warm and moving place. Christmas is going to be sad. For me, it’s going to be really sad because I’m going to be missing my friends,” he continues. Midway through this sentence he stops to take two bin bags full of warm clothes off an elderly lady. “We’re going to try our best to heal,” he says. Livingstone and his friends are, he says, organising space over Christmas for everyone to come together with music and food. “[Justice] has to be done. It’s unthinkable. What they’ve done is very bad. Normal people can’t really get on with their lives.” His next project is to paint the ceiling of the underpass: “They’re saying to me, they need angels up there. Something to keep them calm. The survivors, they need that up there, so that’s what I’m going to do.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/09/donald-trump-cnn-story-email-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-09T18:07:05Z","webTitle":"Trump attacks 'vicious, fake news CNN' after correction to WikiLeaks email story","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/09/donald-trump-cnn-story-email-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/09/donald-trump-cnn-story-email-russia","fields":{"headline":"Trump attacks 'vicious, fake news CNN' after correction to WikiLeaks email story","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump on Saturday fired more shots in his offensive against CNN, after the network was forced to correct an exclusive report that had seemed to implicate his administration in a scandal involving the release of leaked documents. “Fake News CNN made a vicious and purposeful mistake yesterday,” the president tweeted. “They were caught red handed.” He added: “CNN’S slogan is CNN, THE MOST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS. Everyone knows this is not true, that this could, in fact, be a fraud on the American Public. There are many outlets that are far more trusted than Fake News CNN. Their slogan should be CNN, THE LEAST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS!” The CNN report said Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr, received an email offering him access to hacked Democratic party emails from WikiLeaks before the documents had been made publicly available. But in fact, the email was sent on 14 September 2016, after the material was made publicly available – and not 4 September as CNN first reported. In a statement, CNN said its “initial reporting of the date on an email sent to members of the Trump campaign about WikiLeaks documents, which was confirmed by two sources to CNN, was incorrect. We have updated our story to include the correct date, and present the proper context for the timing of email.” It was the second major correction in a CNN story involving Trump and Russia. Russia is believed to have been behind the original hacking of the documents. In June, three CNN journalists resigned after the network retracted a report on alleged ties between Trump officials and a Russian investment fund. “What about all the other phony stories they do? FAKE NEWS,” Trump tweeted then. The network said the three journalists who reported that story failed to follow editorial procedures. In his first tweet on Saturday, Trump added: “Watch to see if CNN fires those responsible, or was it just gross incompetence?” CNN said it would not fire the reporters behind the Friday story, as editorial procedures had been followed. The president also attacked “fake news” on Friday night in Florida, at a rally endorsing Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore. In particular, Trump zeroed in on an error made last week by ABC News correspondent Brian Ross, over the prosecution of Mike Flynn in the special counsel’s investigation into Russian meddling in the US election. ABC suspended Ross but did not fire him. The president suggested that attendees at his rally should sue the news outlet for the stock market losses that resulted from the original story. “Did you see all the corrections the media’s been making?” Trump said. “They’ve been apologizing left and right.” Trump also said CNN had “apologised” for its corrected story. It has not. Also on Friday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders used Twitter to highlight CNN’s use of a picture of the wrong Raj Shah in a report on her deputy. “CNN this is definitely not @RajShah45 but it is #FakeNews,” she wrote. Donald Jr added his thoughts in a tweet Saturday morning, writing: “Strange that the #fakenews media never gets stories wrong in favor of Trump. It’s almost like they do it on purpose.” There is no evidence that reporting errors and corrections have become any more frequent during the Trump presidency. Trump’s embrace of the concept of “fake news”, though, has allowed him to make substantial political hay from every corrected story. According to an October Politico poll, 46% of Americans said they believed the media was guilty of wholesale fabrications about the Trump administration. More than three-quarters of Republican voters thought so. David Frum, a former George W Bush speech writer who is now senior editor at the Atlantic, has become one of Trump’s most vociferous critics. He addressed the issue on Saturday morning on Twitter. While reporters “slip in their work”, Frum wrote, “the work itself is trying to inform the public about the doings of the most systematical untruthful administration in American history”. Frum continued: “Never forget, though, that the media are not the protagonist in the drama. The protagonists are the officials engaged in the deception, headed by the president himself.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/09/crystal-palace-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-09T17:13:23Z","webTitle":"Christian Benteke misses late penalty as Crystal Palace and Bournemouth draw","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/09/crystal-palace-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/09/crystal-palace-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Christian Benteke misses late penalty as Crystal Palace and Bournemouth draw","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Crystal Palace may come to rue this as the moment their bid for Premier League survival stalled. The game was deep into stoppage time at the end when Charlie Daniels was penalised for tripping Wilfried Zaha, the referee awarding his second spot-kick of the game, with Christian Benteke wresting the ball from his team-mates and placing it on the spot while Bournemouth players protested the original decision. The striker, Palace’s record signing, was without a goal since May. He clearly sensed his time had come. Plenty of his team-mates seemed unsure. Luka Milivojevic, the team’s regular penalty-taker, had initially grabbed the ball but Benteke was having none of it. Scott Dann and James Tomkins both appeared to query why the side would swap spot-kick duties mid-match, even if the former later insisted he had been oblivious to the switch. Zaha, never one to hide his emotions, seemed perplexed. Given the buildup, and the Belgian’s fragile form, there was a certain inevitability as to what ensued. The shot was scuffed and pushed away by Asmir Begovic. The final whistle, slicing through the locals’ disappointment moments later, confirmed Palace had slipped back to the foot of the division. It was the kind of harebrained thinking, and horribly weak attempt, that can see teams relegated. Benteke has now missed three of his five penalties for the club and departed with boos from the home support ringing in his ears. Roy Hodgson ended up speaking, amicably enough, to a fan at the front of the main stand. “It wasn’t an altercation, the guy was only asking why Benteke had been told to take the penalty,” he explained. “I was telling him he hadn’t. Benteke got hold of the ball. It was a unilateral decision. No one on our team was able to wrest the ball from him. We, the management, don’t expect players to change those decisions. We tried to shout out our instructions. They obviously didn’t reach the penalty spot. “The reason he was booed off was because the fans, having seen us swarm around their penalty area, thought we’d won it when the referee pointed to the spot. When the guy misses it, he has to accept he’ll be booed off the field. He’s been told already [that he won’t be taking the next penalty]. After missing the one which has deprived us of two valuable points, I can’t imagine him rushing to pick up the ball next time. He’s stunned, shocked, disappointed.” It should be noted that Bournemouth vehemently disputed the penalty award, insisting Daniels had played the ball. They felt justice had been done. The irony is that, up to that point, this had been Benteke’s most effective performance of the campaign, though quite how he recovers some poise in time for Tuesday’s visit of Watford remains to be seen. Palace had missed him for seven weeks, their team denied a focal point while he recovered from knee ligament damage sustained in September. Now he is back but diminished, his confidence fractured. Belief must be rebuilt amid a cluttered schedule. He could do well to look at his opposite number, Jermain Defoe, and the emphatic manner in which he emerged from his own relatively wretched sequence of one goal in 13 games to plunder twice. This was actually a tale of two strikers, not least because Defoe’s second goal, thumped home in first-half stoppage time, almost defied belief in its accuracy and execution. A hopeful punt forward by Lewis Cook liberated Defoe beyond Dann, though there still seemed little danger with the angle unkind on the right of the box. Yet the striker’s volleyed finish arced gloriously over Julián Speroni and nestled in the far corner, his matter-of-fact celebration betraying the confidence of a player whose belief is omnipresent. That was his 201st league goal, and ninth in 10 appearances against Palace, with his double century having been brought up early on courtesy of a corner routine perfected on the training ground. Andrew Surman rolled the ball in to Junior Stanislas, darting forward almost unnoticed from the near-post, with the midfielder able to collect again and square a pass to the penalty spot. There loitered Defoe, unmarked with Josh King having slyly pulled back the striker’s marker, Jeffrey Schlupp, to side‑foot accurately into the corner. For a while, Palace had quivered in arrears, but at least there is fight in their ranks these days. Their rally just before the break had briefly earned them a lead. First Milivojevic slammed home his penalty after Begovic’s trip on Zaha – the forward dragged his leg and was clipped by the on-rushing goalkeeper – before Dann prodded into an empty net from Yohan Cabaye’s fine centre. Both goals had owed much to Benteke’s contribution though, in the end, that had been forgotten. “If you miss penalties at home,” added Hodgson, “then you’ve only got yourself to blame.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/09/swansea-city-west-bromwich-albion-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-09T17:13:38Z","webTitle":"Wilfried Bony hits late winner for Swansea in vital win over West Brom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/09/swansea-city-west-bromwich-albion-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/09/swansea-city-west-bromwich-albion-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Wilfried Bony hits late winner for Swansea in vital win over West Brom","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Wilfried Bony sent the Swansea head coach, Paul Clement, dancing down the touchline with relief as his late winner sealed a vital 1-0 victory over West Brom. In the final stages of what had been a woeful encounter lacking in real Premier League quality, Bony, the captain, lashed the ball home after Albion failed to clear Ki Sung-yueng’s corner. The goal sent the Liberty Stadium wild and sealed what could yet be a huge three points for the hosts, who moved off the bottom of the table. “It’s a nice feeling to get the win and it was one we really needed,” said Clement. “It was a scrappy game, but we just about deserved to come out on top. We deserved it and I was really pleased with the impact of the substitutions. They made a real difference. “We got over the line in a narrow, scrappy game and it’s a great feeling. My celebrations were a mixture of frustration with some of our previous results and a feeling of delight that we’d got the win. The players stood up in a big game and really put the effort in.” For West Brom, this was a poor result and means Alan Pardew’s men stay firmly in relegation trouble. Clement, rightly, did not care one jot as his team emerged victorious. “I felt we had to go for it and we got all three points. I thought we struggled to get Wilfried into the game in the first half, but his winner was a big moment for everybody,” he said. “The most important thing was a positive result and we move on to Manchester City on Wednesday now with a bit of momentum behind us.” Clement had insisted in the run-up to this game that any pressure on him was from external sources. Denying any claims he was one game from the sack, the former Bayern Munich assistant was not helped by fellow strugglers West Ham picking up a surprise 1-0 win at home to Chelsea in the day’s early kick-off. Clement certainly rolled the dice with his selection, making four changes to his side and giving shock starts to Nathan Dyer and Wayne Routledge either side of Bony in attack. Renato Sanches was dropped from the squad altogether. Alfie Mawson headed an early Ki corner over for Swansea but it was the visitors who dominated the early possession. Salomón Rondón had their first chance and, given their poor league position, it was no surprise to see Clement’s men lacking confidence. In truth, it was a poor-quality affair. Just before the break, Tom Carroll’s set piece was headed against his own post by Jake Livermore as he attempted to clear. The result was the first period ending scoreless. West Brom introduced James McClean for Sam Field in an attacking half-time change but the second period followed a similar theme to the first. Bony shot wide after a neat turn and in Swansea’s first substitution Clement replaced Routledge with Jordan Ayew. Almost immediately Ayew curled an effort over the bar as the game turned into a tense affair. Carroll put a free-kick into the wall when he should have done better and then Robson-Kanu wasted a glorious opportunity when he crossed wildly out of play on a West Brom counterattack. There was still time for more one more attacking change from Clement and he went for broke, Tammy Abraham joining Bony in attack. The gamble paid off. Ki’s second corner in quick succession found its way to Bony and he made no mistake, lashing the ball past Foster. Albion pushed for an equaliser but it failed to arrive as Swansea edged home despite Abraham missing a sitter to make it 2-0 late on when clean through on goal. Pardew said: “I wasn’t disappointed with the effort and endeavour we showed. It was a close game, you could always sense that, and there wasn’t much between the two sides. “There were defensive errors and we lacked a little bit of conviction in the final moment. We didn’t really create enough either, but having said that, midway through the second half we had some crucial chances and we let those moments pass us by. “Robson-Kanu had the best moment in the game. It would have been a tap-in for either Jake or Rondón, but he overcooked it. “As a new manager you want to win your first couple of games, but looking at the group, they are suffering from this poor run. We need a win any way it comes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/10/the-more-they-say-they-are-all-happy-the-more-sceptical-you-should-be","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T00:05:21Z","webTitle":"The more they say they are all happy the more sceptical you should be | Andrew Rawnsley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/10/the-more-they-say-they-are-all-happy-the-more-sceptical-you-should-be","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/10/the-more-they-say-they-are-all-happy-the-more-sceptical-you-should-be","fields":{"headline":"The more they say they are all happy the more sceptical you should be","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Everyone is happy. Well, everyone except Nigel Farage with his shouts of “betrayal”. The EU says it is happy with the deal struck with Theresa May on Friday morning. Mrs May says she is happy. Truth to tell, the prime minister and her aides are gasping with stunned relief. Even more remarkably, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, standard bearers of the hard Brexiters in the cabinet, claim to be happy. When he is in sycophancy mode rather than treachery mode, Mr Gove could give tutorials in how to be oleaginous to Uriah Heep. “The prime minister has won,” he oiled during his tour of the studios to sell the settlement to Tory Brexiters as “a significant achievement”. Cabinet members who want a soft Brexit say they are, yes, happy. Nicky Morgan, speaking for pro-European Tory backbenchers, acclaims “great progress”. Business groups are happy. Even the Labour party says it is sort of happy. The Irish government is happy. Northern Ireland’s Unionists are not exactly happy – they don’t do smiley faces – but at least they are not as snarly as they were earlier, when their objections threatened to derail the deal. A chorus of Tory commentators are now singing hallelujahs to the prime minister. They applaud Mrs May for the apparently remarkable feat of aligning her riven cabinet, her divided party, the island of Ireland and the EU behind the same deal. Can this be the same Mrs May whom the Tory choir had previously been bewailing as a maladroit incompetent who could be out of her job by Christmas? The very same. This outbreak of delirium ought to make us extremely suspicious. Everyone cannot be happy. Someone is deluding themselves about what has been agreed – or they are trying to fool us. The prime minister says that getting to an agreement involved “give and take on both sides”. She didn’t say that Britain has given and the EU has taken. The EU has made some concessions that are quite important, but most of the more significant compromises have come from the British side. This is not surprising – indeed, it was utterly predictable – because that has been the pattern of the Brexit talks since the very beginning. The government huffs that it will stand firm on this and puffs that it will not compromise on that. Then it gets mugged by reality. That reality is that the bulk of the conceding was always going to come from Britain because of the asymmetrical bargaining strengths of the two sides. As Sir John Kerr, the British diplomat who constructed Article 50 has pointed out, the process was designed to disadvantage a withdrawing country. While the EU has quite a lot to lose from this hazard-strewn enterprise ending in a disaster, the risks to Britain’s economy have always been very much higher. When the talks – and Mrs May’s job – looked to be in jeopardy earlier in the week, companies weren’t saying that they would be pulling investment from Italy or Flanders or Slovakia if there wasn’t an agreement to progress the Brexit process to the next phase. Companies were saying they’d be making business decisions that would leave Britain the poorer. This structural weakness in Britain’s bargaining position has been compounded by the acute personal pressure on Mrs May. To some extent, the very precariousness of her premiership worked to her paradoxical advantage at the last gasp. When the talks ran into trouble over the Irish border issues, the EU could have told Britain to go away and come back with some fresh ideas in January. European capitals pressed their negotiators to help get Mrs May safely to the end of this particular rollercoaster for fear that she might be toppled. They may find her a tricky customer, but at least she is a known one and they can think of worse people to find on the other side of the table. Their despair at the thought of having to deal with Boris Johnson was the foreign secretary’s most important contribution to the week. It is worth stepping back from the frenzy to gain a longer and cooler perspective on what has unfolded since the negotiations in Brussels commenced in June. At that point, leading Brexiters were still peddling their fantasy that March 2019 was a feasible date to achieve both a new trade deal and a “clean-break” Brexit that sets Britain free of every EU rule and regulation. The government slowly realised that this was simply delusional and conceded that formal departure would have to be followed by a “transition period”, during which Britain will continue to trade as if it is still a member of the EU at least until 2021. With the important difference that Britain will continue to be subject to EU law without having any say about what those laws are. Britain will go from being a rule-maker to a rule-taker. This will include an continuing role for the European court of justice in Britain’s affairs which will endure deep into the next decade, another of Mrs May’s “red lines” that have faded to a blush pink. The other very obvious area where the British government has had to concede is over the money. The claim made during the referendum that quitting the EU would produce a massive windfall, including a fantasy £350m extra a week for the NHS, was long ago exposed for the lie it always was. The hardline Brexiters then fell back on a position of saying that Britain shouldn’t pay a red cent by way of a divorce payment. Some of their number even contended that the EU ought to be paying Britain for access to our markets. Those with a better grasp of where these talks would end up reckoned that a net payment of around €40bn was the likely cost of the divorce settlement. That figure was first mentioned in this column back in July. David Davis jeered that this number was “made up”. Mr Johnson scoffed that the EU could “go whistle”. Now the government says it expects Britain to be paying something of that order, possibly rather more, as “a fair settlement of our obligations”. In the end, even the cabinet’s most fanatical Brexit zealots have been forced to bow to the raw truth that this sum, large as it may be, is relatively small compared with the calamity that would be inflicted on the British economy by a car-crash Brexit. So how can anyone really be happy? Those who hope for one of the softer versions of departure – a group that includes the pragmatists in the cabinet, the majority of MPs and most businesses and trade unions – are relieved because they think this agreement reduces the danger of a catastrophic “no-deal” Brexit. Mrs May is happy because she has bought herself some more time at Number 10. When it looked as though the talks would fail, some serious players in the Tory party were predicting that it really could be curtains for her. For her, any deal was better than no deal. The most intriguing question is why the hard Brexiters in the cabinet are now acclaiming Mrs May for making concessions that they would have previously denounced as a betrayal. I think the answer to that comes in three parts. One of the only things to be said for this tortuous and perilous experiment is that it has served as an education for some of the Brexiters, as their illusions have been forced into contact with reality. I also strongly suspect that the likes of Mr Johnson and Mr Gove have become petrified by what will happen to their reputations if Britain crashes out of the EU and into a nasty recession. In the darker stretches of the night, they must ask themselves how Tory chroniclers will rate them if they are recorded by history as the men who guaranteed a seat in Number 10 to Jeremy Corbyn. We ought also to remember that, beneath all their blustery bravado, the Brexiters are haunted by the fear that Britain might choose to change its mind. Their overarching goal is to be sure that Britain is formally out of the EU by March 2019. They will swallow anything – principles, pride, groaning plates of their earlier promises – to secure that. They also think, and about this they are right, that the next and more important battle will be about precisely what end state Britain seeks for its future relationship with EU, a subject that, incredibly, the cabinet has yet to debate. What about the voters? They’ve been rather overlooked while everyone at Westminster has been obsessing over the drama of the negotiations and the intricacies of the deal. To most members of the public, the divorce payment will be the most easily comprehensible element and very likely the most inflammatory – €40bn merely to get permission to talk about a possible future trade agreement? That will sound like a hell of a lot of nurses, schools and marines at a time when the country’s essential services and defences have been squeezed by austerity. A hearty chunk of Brexit voters will surely feel that they have been had. As for everyone else, the question to keep asking is why our country is spending so much time, energy and money trying to negotiate a deal with the EU that will be inferior to the one Britain currently enjoys as a member. Who can be happy about that?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/10/observer-killer-sudoku","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T00:01:21Z","webTitle":"Observer Killer Sudoku","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/10/observer-killer-sudoku","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/10/observer-killer-sudoku","fields":{"headline":"Observer Killer Sudoku","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Normal Sudoku rules apply, except the numbers in the cells contained within grey lines add up to the figures in the corner.

The foreign secretary’s visit comes as concerns grow about US president Donald Trump’s hostility to the landmark nuclear deal with Tehran, and deepening regional tensions, including over the Syrian war and Iran’s role in the conflict and humanitarian crisis in Yemen. But Johnson is under closest scrutiny over efforts to secure the freedom of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, arrested during a family visit with her infant daughter in 2016 and held in Tehran’s notorious Evin jail. Her fate has become entwined with Johnson’s own political career, after erroneous comments he made about her case were cited by Iranian officials pressing new charges that could double her prison sentence. Zaghari-Ratcliffe is due back in court on Sunday, the same day Johnson will meet Rouhani. He is likely to make a personal plea to the Iranian president for her freedom, following up on a recent vow to leave “no stone unturned” in his efforts to secure her release. Richard Ratcliffe, Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s husband, has not seen his wife since 2016 because he cannot get an Iranian visa. He said he was glad to hear initial talks described as “constructive”, and hoped his family might be reunited for Christmas. “I am obviously watching closely with hope, fingers crossed and excitement – I couldn’t sleep at all last night,” Ratcliffe told the Press Association. Johnson himself has tried to downplay expectations of what the trip might achieve. Johnson’s visit is only the third by a British foreign minister to Iran in the past 14 years, and the first since diplomatic ties were re-established in 2015. It began with two hours of talks with the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, which the Foreign Office said marked a “useful” start to the trip. The two men “spoke frankly about the obstacles in [their countries’] relationship, including the foreign secretary’s concerns about the consular cases of British-Iranian dual nationals,” a spokesman said. The statement did not mention Zaghari-Ratcliffe by name, but she is the most prominent of several British-Iranians jailed in Iran. Johnson also met Ali Larijani, speaker of the parliament, and Ali Shamkhani, secretary of a powerful council that makes decisions on key national security issues and could potentially intervene in the case. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was initially accused of attempting to orchestrate a “soft overthrow” of the Islamic republic and sentenced to five years in jail. She has always maintained her innocence and her employer, Thomson Reuters Foundation, has said she was not there to work and was on holiday. Then in November Johnson told the foreign affairs select committee that she had been in Iran to train journalists. Those comments were cited in a further Iranian court hearing as proof that she was engaged in “propaganda against the regime”. After widespread outrage, he corrected his statement and apologised to the family, but insists that his remarks are not the reason Zaghari-Ratcliffe now faces a decade in jail. Hopes for a possible early release on humanitarian grounds grew last week when it was revealed that the Iranian government had ordered a health check. Her supporters say she has suffered panic attacks, insomnia, bouts of depression and suicidal thoughts, particularly after reports on her case on Iranian TV. She is taking antidepressants and other medication. Johnson is expected to try to visit Zaghari-Ratcliffe in jail, and meet the head of the judiciary who is handling her case. Conversations about her sentence are expected to be part of a wider discussion, including resolving banking restrictions that Iran says have made it hard for the country’s economy to benefit from the lifting of EU sanctions. Johnson may be planning to use a disputed £300m payment that Britain owes Tehran to boost his negotiating position. The money was paid up front for a large order of tanks in 1976, but the fall of the Shah and subsequent embargo on arms sales to Tehran meant that only a few tanks were ever delivered. There is a strong case for a settlement now, as both sides have already given ground over the amount involved, and sanctions were lifted as part of the 2015 nuclear deal. Downing Street insists there is no link between the money and Johnson’s efforts to secure Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s release. However, the US has admitted using a similar contested payout as leverage to secure the release last year of five American citizens held in Iran, in a prisoner exchange."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/10/sars-virus-bats-china-severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T00:05:21Z","webTitle":"Scientists trace 2002 Sars virus to colony of cave-dwelling bats in China","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/10/sars-virus-bats-china-severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/10/sars-virus-bats-china-severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome","fields":{"headline":"Scientists trace 2002 Sars virus to colony of cave-dwelling bats in China","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Scientists have pinpointed a population of virus-infected bats, which they have linked to the mysterious outbreak of Sars disease 15 years ago. Hundreds died as the virus spread around the globe but its source was never traced. Now, after years of searching across China, where the disease first emerged, researchers reported a few days ago that they had found a remote cave in Yunnan province, which is home to horseshoe bats that carry a strain of a particular virus known as a coronavirus. This strain has all the genetic building blocks of the type that triggered the global outbreak of Sars in 2002. “This will certainly not be the only cave that contains bats infected with these strains of virus, but it is really important that we have found the first one,” said Sars expert Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust. “Samples from these bats will make it much easier to develop a vaccine for the disease and help us be prepared for another outbreak.” Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) first appeared in November 2002 in southern China and spread around the world – often carried by airline travellers – and eventually killed more than 750 people in 37 countries. It was contained by placing patients in quarantine. The outbreak ended in 2004 and the disease has never resurfaced. But scientists have always feared that Sars could reappear. Hence the efforts of Chinese scientists – led by Shi Zheng-Li and Cui Jie of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, China – to trace the source of the outbreak. Scientists initially suspected that civet cats, sold in markets in China, were the source of the virus but later turned their attention to bats, which they realised were the prime source of the virus. Civets were merely an intermediary. In their study – published in the journal Public Library of Science Pathogens – the Wuhan team reveals that by sequencing the genomes of the different strains of the virus found in horseshoe bats in the cave they found these contained all the genetic pieces that make up the version of Sars virus that caused the 2002 outbreak. These strains often mix and could have produced a strain that caused the Sars outbreak. “This was a really heroic effort by the team of scientists involved,” said Farrar. “Finding these caves and getting sample from bats inside them would have been very hard and dangerous work. However it was definitely worth it. Sars is a horrible disease and extremely dangerous. “There is no effective treatment and no vaccine. It was only contained the last time because it was possible to quarantine people while they were still infectious. Now we have a chance to create vaccines and treatments.” In their paper, the Chinese team warn that another deadly outbreak of Sars could emerge at any time. As they point out, the cave where they discovered their strain is only a kilometre from the nearest village. The risk of people becoming infected is a definite possibility, they stress. “However, this is good news overall,” saidd Farrar. “We now have something concrete to work on, and I applaud the openness of these Chinese scientists in sharing their work and – I hope – these virus strains.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/2017/dec/10/azed-crossword-2374","type":"article","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T00:01:21Z","webTitle":"Azed crossword 2,374","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2017/dec/10/azed-crossword-2374","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/2017/dec/10/azed-crossword-2374","fields":{"headline":"Azed crossword 2,374","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Special Instructions The Chambers Dictionary (2014) is recommended.

Though the seats are sun-bleached, the paint peels off in many places and the slightly ramshackle facilities are a throwback to the past, this outgoing Ashes venue still feels mighty special. Before arriving, the first thing you spot while walking down Hay Street or Adelaide Terrace, perhaps with a detour through the pretty Queens Gardens, are the six imposing floodlights. Each one becomes more and more like a giant Iron Man (Ted Hughes, not Marvel) staring down on the crisp, green outfield as you pitch up and enter through the gates. Up on the rickety old scoreboard, on non-match days, sit the names of Western Australia’s team of the 20th century (plus a 12th man) from down the years: G Marsh, Wood, Langer, Inverarity, K Hughes, Shepherd, Moody, Yardley, McKenzie, Lillee, R Marsh (wk) and Alderman – these are the giants upon whose shoulders modern local players stand. Park up on one of the exposed grassed banks that have roasted many a supporter over the years and past deeds of derring-do come to mind. It is a stage of many highlights, from Adam Gilchrist’s 57-ball hundred to Curtly Ambrose’s spell of seven for one, Doug Walters hooking the final ball from Bob Willis for six to complete a century in a session, Dennis Lillee’s many bravura bowling performances (or his aluminium bat) through to Ryan Harris trimming Alastair Cook’s off bail with a pearler four years ago. Cricket has been played on this reclaimed swamp land since 1890 but Western Australia needed first rail and then air links to truly enter the fold. And thus Perth is in fact relatively young when it comes to hosting men’s Test matches, with its first in 1970 (although the women, as ever, were slightly ahead with Australia and England meeting here in 1958). From there it gained a reputation as the fastest pitch in the world, with the button-down shirt machismo of Lillee and Jeff Thomson terrorising touring batsman – just ask David Lloyd, he of the split box in 1974-75 – and the lineage of Australian quicks to enjoy it continued through to Merv Hughes, Glenn McGrath, Brett Lee and Mitchell Johnson to name but a few. A relaid square in the late 1980s may have seen some of the pace lost but try telling that to batsmen since, with Justin Langer – one of the Waca greats – recalling the experience of facing Pakistan’s Shoaib Akhtar on a flyer in 2004. “Ricky Ponting and I were just laughing our heads off, because we could have got a single every ball given how far Moin Khan, the wicketkeeper, was standing back. I was very happy letting the captain take the strike. When you’re batting at the end with the sea breeze behind the bowler, you feel alive.” Swing bowlers such as Terry Alderman and Damien Fleming prospered, too, and while spinners have not always come to the fore – it was the one Australian ground upon which Shane Warne did not claim a five-for – batsmen have still been able to tuck in, with the Waca the scene of Matthew Hayden’s then world record 380 against Zimbabwe in 2003 and David Warner now heading to a ground where he averages 89, including three Test centuries. But this week the Waca plays host to its final Ashes Test. Sitting to the east, across the Swan River and visible from the Lillee-Marsh Stand, is the new Aus$1.5bn Optus Stadium. It is a hulking 60,000-capacity arena that will soon take over hosting the highest-profile cricket matches and, provided funds arrive, the Waca (23,000 at best) will be revamped, but downsized, to become a boutique venue for less marketable opposition. “It’s evolution,” John Inverarity, the former WA captain and Australian selector, whose name sits on that scoreboard, says. “There’s a new stadium and why wouldn’t you play big audience matches there? I feel less concerned than some. The Waca was my life for many years but I think the stadium will be right for the comfort of fans.” Thursday’s third Test will be an Ashes swansong that almost wasn’t, too. Had the snazzy new bowl in Burswood met its deadline, and not seen its curtain-raiser put back to January for the fifth one-day international of this tour, the Waca would have simply drifted out of Ashes cricket without a chance for one last visit from the Fremantle Doctor, the afternoon wind that provides respite for fielding sides or those frazzling in the old stands that offer little shade. Though England Lions will take on Perth Scorchers in two Twenty20 friendlies at the Optus this week, the senior team instead get one final Test at a venue that, with nine defeats and just one win from 13 visits, represents their least productive of those in double figures. Sitting 2-0 down with three to play, it has been already heavily noted that history is not on the side of Joe Root’s tourists. But whatever the result, they can say they were part of it this week as Ashes cricket says farewell to the Waca."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/live/2017/dec/10/liverpool-v-everton-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T16:30:11Z","webTitle":"Liverpool 1-1 Everton: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/dec/10/liverpool-v-everton-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/dec/10/liverpool-v-everton-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Liverpool 1-1 Everton: Premier League – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Read Andy Hunter’s match report from Anfield: Klopp severely prickly post-match. “Can we please stop this? I am not in the mood,” he says in an interview. “I only want to talk to people with some understanding of football.” Hmm, to Wayne Rooney then, who lashed home his penalty to earn Everton the unlikeliest of points. “It is great to play the derby. It is great for the city and there are bragging rights,” Rooney says. “The Evertonians will be more pleased. It is always nice to score against Liverpool, no matter who you play for.” That’s all from me. Thanks a lot for your company, emails, tweets. That was jolly good fun. Now attention moves to Manchester, where it’s five minutes until kick-off: “Well this being the weekend for the chasing pack to catch up isn’t exactly going to plan, is it?” emails Nick Wood. “Spurs aside.” Indeed, Manchester City could move 16 points clear of Liverpool if they can get the better of Manchester United in the derby. Minute-by-minute coverage of that one is waiting for you here: For Liverpool, they have paid a heavy price for failing to put the game to bed. They were all over Everton like a rash but careless when it mattered most. As for the penalty, Lovren’s naive challenge probably typifies their day. Frustration for Liverpool, who remain fourth, ahead of Arsenal. And as the whistle goes, Dejan Lovren heads straight for the referee, to protest about that penalty decision. It was soft, Calvert-Lewin undoubtedly maximised contact, but it was equally clumsy by the Liverpool defender. Somehow, Everton have got a point out of that. They were woeful. Everton return to the top 10 in the Premier League. Liverpool have been Big Sam’d. Rooney’s penalty cancels out Salah’s stunning first-half opener. 90+3 min: Klopp’s going beserk as Liverpool pour forward again through Robertson. Coutinho looks to magic something before Henderson blazes over. That must be it. 90+1 min: Robertson’s ball from the left is lethal but Firmino is always stretching to latch onto it at the back stick. It evades him and it’s another half-chance squandered. Seconds, essentially, left to play. 90+1 min: Into the first of four added minutes ... the ball almost breaks for Henderson in the box but Williams gets his big toe to it. A crucial intervention. 90 min: Sigurdsson sweeps the ball in but Liverpool do well enough to clear. Milner and then Firmino look to rebuild. Into the very closing stages of this one then. 89 min: Lovren climbs to meet Coutinho’s corner but he mis-times his jump. He could do with redeeming himself. Now it’s Everton’s turn to win a foul, with Klavan flying into the back of Calvert-Lewin 35 yards from goal. 88 min: Can either side find the most priceless of winners? Liverpool have a corner ... 86 min: Coutinho’s free-kick gets up over the Everton wall but in truth its fairly straightforward for Pickford. Earlier, Schneiderlin went into the book for a crunching challenge on Milner. 85 min: The two benches paint a brilliant picture. Allardyce chewing away, Rooney’s all smiles. Klopp, meanwhile, is a face of fury. 83 min: A couple of quickfire changes. Solanke is replaced by Danny Ings, whose last goal came at Goodison Park. Rooney is sacrificed for none other than Mr Phil Jagielka. 82 min: Liverpool are pressing for a winner, but suddenly it’s all a bit rushed. Passes are overhit. Shots are wayward. And up at Old Trafford, there are shouts of “Rooney, Rooney” too, around concourses from those tuned into the events over on Merseyside. 81 min: Phillipe Coutinho is on for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Despite the performance here, those six changes by Klopp don’t look so clever now do they? 80 min: “Rooney! Rooney! Rooney!” is the chant from the pocket of delirious Everton fans at Anfield. 78 min: Wowee. The celebrations behind Mignolet’s goal are inevitably wild. Everton have been dire, but they’ve found an equaliser, somehow. Only Dejan Lovren knows how. That was a silly, clumsy challenge. They’re level. A stupid challenge by Lovren on Calvert-Lewin sees the striker fall in the box. And that’s that. Penalty given. It was a great ball by Rooney to locate the England youngster. And, right on cue. 75 min: Liverpool are still in pursuit of a second. This sounds extremely daft, but is that a dangerous game? They won’t, will they? After all, Everton have been woeful. 72 min: Everton win a corner, after decent work by Jonjoe Kenny. Mignolet punches the first clear before claiming another long ball into the box. That was a glimmer of hope at least for the visitors. Liverpool promptly go up the other end and win a corner, after Solanke’s effort is deflected wide. 71 min: Firmino almost finds an opening but there’s a roadblock in the shape of Idrissa Gueye. They go again. “The more you talk about how one sided this is the more I’m expecting to read of an 88th minute headed equaliser from Ashley Williams,” emails Roman. “It is Liverpool after all, let’s not underestimate their potential to Liverpool it up.” Indeed ... 70 min: This is not as bad as Everton at Southampton a few weeks ago, mainly because Phil Jagielka’s not playing, but they have been utterly dismal this afternoon. This can’t finish 1-0, can it? 68 min: Is there anybody more relieved in Liverpool right now than Cuco Martina? Salah’s had him on toast, again and again. 67 min: And the superb Salah is replaced by Firmino. 66 min: Chance after chance for Liverpool. Gomez has just flicked a header over Pickford’s goal. Lookman is warming up on the touchline, and while they still only trail by one goal, surely it’s time for Everton to have a go. 65 min: Roberto Firmino is coming on for the hosts. 64 min: Everton have been so wishy-washy. Liverpool are looking so comfortable it’s untrue. If this was a bout, the referee would have already called time. Pickford has just done brilliantly to steer the ball away from Mane from Oxlade-Chamberlain’s daring cross. 62 min: Liverpool 77-23 Everton. Alas, that’s only the possession numbers. 60 min: Solanke seizes on another Martina error in the box. He slices the ball straight to the striker from Robertson’s fairly harmless cross. Martina may as well come off. He’s not helping Everton out there, only hindering things. But Solanke’s effort is wayward. Ooosh, via email. “Though I suppose this game could be entertaining to some people (in the way a cat playing with a mouse is entertaining) I can’t be the only neutral who finds the one-sidedness of this derby kind of sad, can I?” asks JR. “I have to keep reminding myself it’s only 1-0 right now. Feels like 10-0.” 59 min: Mane has a volley on goal from distance but Pickford collects. It would have been a tasty finish. 58 min: Kenny’s long ball downfield is hit and hope and Klavan soon snuffs that out. That’s all Everton have mustered in truth and that’s not good enough really. It’s been totally one-way traffic. 57 min: Cuco Martina is having a difficult afternoon on his 50th Premier League appearance, I think it’s fair to say. 55 min: The next corner is played short, but it’s all too easy for Salah to then dance around the box before unleashing an effort goalwards. This time he gets it all wrong. He’s not perfect. 54 min: More schoolboy defending by Martina allows Salah to win Liverpool another corner. Klavan attacks but it falls wide, via a deflection. 53 min: Holgate flicks the ball clear with Lovren ready to convert. Then comes the second wind of Liverpool, with another corner. Then Martina clears. It’s becoming quite the onslaught at Anfield. 51 min: Brilliant clearance by Kenny denies Liverpool another! He slides in to clear after the ball is fizzed across the box. Any hopes of an Everton fightback look rather slim. Oxlade-Chamberlain then wriggles away from Williams before Gueye tidies things up. Salah will take the corner ... 50 min: Rooney plays in Calvert-Lewin, who breaks forward. It looks promising but the Everton forward overhits his pass for the onrushing Sigurdsson by about a mile. Chance gone. “Allardyce fiddling with his earpiece is the new Wenger struggling with his coat zip,” emails Marie. I like it, I like it. 49 min: Salah just wide! Milner’s deep cross swings its way to Salah at the back stick, lurking behind Jonjoe Kenny. But he nods his header just wide of Pickford’s goal. A big chance. Big Sam’s not a happy bunny. 48 min: A neat interchange between Salah and Oxlade-Chamberlain results in a corner. Williams duly clears the danger, for now at least. 47 min: Everton start the second half as they did the first, by gifting possession to Liverpool. 46 min: A slow and steady start by Liverpool. That Salah goal has relieved the pressure in some ways. Will they go for Everton’s jugular as such? Milner strikes wide to suggest so. And we’re back under way at Anfield. Half-time changes for Everton: Schneiderlin and Lennon coming on, replacing Tom Davies and Oumar Niasse. And here’s David Hytner’s match report from Southampton 1-1 Arsenal earlier on this afternoon: Some half-time emails. “Coutinho, Can and Firmino warming the bench,” muses Gary Byrne. “In the age of millionaire snood-wearing superstars, surely the bench warms them?” “Team news, no news,” says Mike Greville. “No-one could seriously think the ‘fab four’ would play today (it’s only Everton, at home). Liverpool suffered Christmas+ in the last 2 years, so Klopp has been planning ahead this time - for several weeks, resting players - especially the F4. Will it pay off? We’ll see. [I thought it’d be Sturridge from the start, tight game ‘n’ all].” And best of all, we have an early Christmas carol XI, courtesy of Mac Millings: Davide Zappafrosty the Snowman Bixente Lizarazu They Know It’s Christmas? God Rest Steve Perry(gentle)man Good King Junior Stanislas I Saw Mommy Kissing Roque Santa Cruz It’s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmassimo Maccarone Santi Cazorla Want for Christmas is You Deck Fitz Hall with Boughs of Holly, Fa-la-la-la-la, la la la la Matt Le Tiss the Season to be Jollyvier Giroud Fa-la-la-la-la, la la la Lars Bohinen Mohamed Salah’s stunner is the difference at the break. 45+1 min: Mane skips away from Williams but drags his effort horribly wide. He had company too in the box. Perhaps he needed to lend on some of that unselfishness we have already seen this season, many a time too in fairness. 45 min: Salah curls another goalwards but Williams heads clear. That was an almost identical left-footed strike. His goal was wondrous, a real peach. And now Oxlade-Chamberlain thrashes an effort wide from 30 yards. Can Liverpool add a second before the interval? 44 min: Well, Liverpool have more than deserved that. Everton were on the ropes for the previous 40-odd minutes. Now they go again, with Robertson and Mane linking down the left. Martina can’t cope with Salah, and the Liverpool winger then wriggles away from Gueye, before bending his effort around Ashley Williams’s torso and into the top corner. Sterling stuff from Salah. What were we saying earlier? That’s his 13th goal of the season. The red corner land the first blow. A magical strike. 41 min: Gomez does really well, bursting down the right flank to get the better of Martina. His ball in is then shepherded away by Pickford. It’s wave after wave for that Everton back line. And now Gueye is booked, for a lunge on Mane. 39 min: It’s all very nicey nicey from Liverpool, but they need to conjure up something a little bit different. Everton have seen all of this before. Pickford gathers another crashing ball into the box. 36 min: Gylfi Sigurdsson becomes the first player to be cautioned this afternoon, for a bruising challenge on Henderson. He is unlikely to be the last either. It was a matter of time before that first booking. “If Jose is looking for a bus later I think big Sam has hijacked the entire fleet,” emails Rick McGahey. Very nice, very nice. 34 min: And now Andrew Robertson shoots over from distance. As much as Liverpool are having it all their own way, they haven’t managed to get too close to Pickford’s goal just yet. That was more good work by Salah, though. Signing of the season? 32 min: James Milner is held off the ball by Rooney and slides off on the snowy, icy turf before clattering into the advertising boards. Not to worry , though, as the Everton fans have a few nice words for him. “Liverpool’s selection is kind of disrespectful to Everton,” emails Ian Copestake. “Like inviting someone to hit you while one hand is tied behind your back.” 29 min: It’s surely just a matter of time, isn’t it? 27 min: Everton are all over the shop. Joe Gomez bends in a superb cross from the right which comes through to Mane beyond the far post, he has many bodies in his way but finds Dominic Solanke – he tries to lay it off to find another red shirt but he can’t locate one. 22 min: Big Sam continues to brave the snowy conditions at Anfield to communicate with Craig Shakespeare up in the Gods at Anfield. 21 min: A silly push by Oxlade-Chamberlain on Sigurdsson earns Everton a much-needed free-kick, 25 yards in front of Pickford’s goal. At least that may give them a chance to get their house in order, and gives them a moment’s respite if nothing else. 20 min: Everton just cannot get out of their own half. And when they do, Calvert-Lewin loses out again to the robust Klavan in the challenge. How long can the visitors go on like this? 18 min: Everton continue to retreat. They are being penned in by Liverpool, who remember are Fab Four-less. 17 min: For a moment, Calvert-Lewin thinks he has outwitted Dejan Lovren just inside the Liverpool half but a foul is awarded. Liverpool go again. 16 min: Things have calmed down – for now. Klavan and Lovren knock the ball around at the back. Liverpool are prying for another opening. They’ve been much the better team so far. 14 min: Niasse slides in on the advancing Joe Gomez, who had latched on to a neat Mane through ball, but no foul is given. It’s adjudged the Everton man took the ball. It looked like a bit of both. Then Kenny loses out to Mane in a dangerous area before Salah wins a corner. Everton have been painful in possession. 11 min: Everton, and Wayne Rooney in particular, get a little fortunate. Salah and Robertson play a neat one-two which allows the Liverpool full-back to drive inside towards goal. Rooney, who keeps drifting wide to the right flank, totally lost his man. Eventually Everton ride the wave but they are under the cosh here. Big Sam looks livid. His blood pressure doubtless soaring. 10 min: And now Mignolet rushes out of goal to stop Niasse in his tracks. A mammoth ball over the top saw the Everton striker played in but the Liverpool goalkeeper hoovers it up nicely. A minority of Liverpool supporters are already angry at some Everton timewasting. 8 min: Mane finds some space in between Williams and Holgate inside the box but he slips over. The pace of Mane and Salah is beginning to threaten the Everton defence. Poor Cuco Martina. Just before Rooney looked for Niasse but his overhit pass was a little ambitious. 6 min: Now Salah looks to free Solanke over the top. For a moment it looks dangerous but the Liverpool striker cannot connect. Then theres’s another wild Everton pass, straight out play. 5 min: Mane feeds an overlapping Robertson down the left flank but it’s tame and Pickford easily gathers. Klopp is going through the gears on the touchline. 3 min: Tom Davies intercepts and then is fouled by Milner 35 yards or so from goal. Everton use the free-kick to launch a deep ball in towards Calvert-Lewin but it’s just a little overcooked from Kenny. Nice idea. 2 min: Williams comes under pressure from Solanke after Martina plays a hospital pass. Liverpool work it wide to Salah before Milner drives over. Allardyce is barking instructions down on the touchline, with snow yet to trouble his earpiece. 1 min: Mason Holgate hoofs the ball straight out of play for a Liverpool goal-kick. If that doesn’t warm the cockles, nothing will. Liverpool take hold centrally, but Salah can’t latch on to a through ball wide on the right. Dominic Calvert-Lewin kickstarts the 229th Merseyside derby. The players are out on the pitch at Anfield. And here comes a a truly rousing rendition of You’ll Never Walk Alone. We are just the usual pre-match rigamarole away from kick-off. It’s going to be a good one. Strap yourselves in. A gentle reminder that this fixture has seen a record 21 red cards issued across the 50 Premier League meetings, with 14 for Everton and seven for Liverpool. Big Sam has already reiterated the importance of his players “using their intelligence” to stay cool-headed at Anfield this afternoon. Ashley Williams is the bookies favourite to see red, for what it’s worth. A heartwarming Merseyside derby tale, courtesy of Elliot Wilson. “I went on a guided tour of Anfield two months ago and the same night I had a dream where Mike Gatting scored a shanked winner for Liverpool, while eating a pie,” he says via email. “Or at least, the newspaper reports afterward (in my dream) indicated that a pie was involved. I do not know what flavour it was or against which team we were playing.” And I like the sound of this kind of red-hot action. “Whatever happens, I want to see some Klopp spittle,” tweets William Hargreaves. “That’s when you know you have a match.” Indeed. Let’s be having you. Sam Allardyce, the Everton manager (it still feels funny typing that), speaks. “We have tried to install a bit of a game-plan to deal with Liverpool today because we know how good they are going forward,” he says, looking quietly confident. “We need to use the ball in the correct manner. In and out of possession, we have to be on top of our game.” Salah and co look relaxed as they wrap up their warm-ups as well as their fingertips at Anfield. There are snoods galore. This may not be Liverpool’s best team but they are no mugs. With Moreno missing, it’s another good opportunity for the likeable Andrew Robertson to express his claim for a regular spot. Captain Jordan Henderson is back after putting his feet up in midweek, while Sadio Mané has been unplayable at times this season too. And to think this is just the pre-cursor for that pesky Manchester derby in a bit. Keep them coming. “Ben – I had a dream Everton won 1-0 today,” emails Gareth Wilson. “OK, Lukaku got the winner, but I think Klopp may be doing his best to make at least part of my dream come true.” Any more for any more? Olivier Giroud has a dug out an equaliser for Arsenal at Southampton. There’s only a handful of minutes left to play at St Mary’s: Dominic Solanke is among those six changes for Liverpool. The 20-year-old has clearly won the trust of Klopp since joining the club from Chelsea over the summer. He has not scored in 12 appearances to date this season. Today would be the perfect day to do so, wouldn’t it? Must admit, am not totally convinced by Solanke but Liverpool need him to bully what is still – other than Ashley Williams – a defence lacking big-game knowhow. While we’re just going through the motions here, and slowly coming to terms with that bold Liverpool team news, down on the south coast Southampton are en route to upsetting Arsenal. Niall McVeigh is at the helm for that one: Hands up then, who expected to see Coutinho, Can and Firmino warming the bench this afternoon at Anfield? It is just the one change for Everton from the side that started the 2-0 win over Huddersfield last weekend, with Niasse replacing Lennon. The biggest boost for Everton is surely those Liverpool changes. Liverpool: Mignolet; Gomez, Lovren, Klavan, Robertson; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Henderson, Milner; Mane, Solanke, Salah Subs: Karius, Wijnaldum, Firmino, Coutinho, Can, Ings, Alexander-Arnold Everton: Pickford; Kenny, Holgate, Williams, Martina; Gueye; Calvert-Lewin, Davies, Rooney, Sigurdsson; Niasse Subs: Robles, Schneiderlin, Keane, Jagielka, Lennon, Vlasic, Lookman Six surprise changes for Liverpool, with Phillipe Coutinho and Roberto Firmino dropping out. As does Emre Can. And just look, Danny Ings is back amongst it, in a matchday squad for the first time since September. Well, well, well. “It is part of the season where you have to make the changes when you can make the changes,” Klopp says. “I know people are saying Liverpool are flying and that, but today we need to be ready for a proper fight. It’s our stadium, it’s our home ground and I really want to see that.” So here we are, for the 229th Merseyside derby. Even a light dusting of snow in and around Anfield can not put pay to this scrumptious battle between two teams with a spring in their step. All of the doom and gloom that surrounded Everton has, in fairness to Sam Allardyce, evaporated since Big Sam’s appointment and three straight wins later, the most recent of which came in Limassol on Thursday evening, the new manager bounce lives on. This is different, though; the challenge of trying to secure victory over Liverpool, at their place, for the first time since 1999. A win would move Everton to within eight points of Liverpool. The last visiting manager to win a league game at Anfield? Allardyce, of course, while in charge of Crystal Palace in April. He sat out Everton’s win in Cyprus so he could put in the hard yards at their Finch Farm training ground. But that still wasn’t enough. “I haven’t had the time to go the lengths and depths I’ve gone to with the other teams I’ve had,” he said. “And of course I’ve got a completely different set of players here.” He’s got Wayne Rooney, though, and he’s due a goal in this fixture having not scored in his previous four league derbies. Allardyce has bigged up Liverpool’s wealth of attacking options, pointing towards the forward-thinking foursome that are now being painfully termed as Jürgen Klopp’s Fab Four. Liverpool have rattled in 40 goals in 11 matches (seven of which came against Spartak Moscow on Wednesday evening) and are unbeaten in six league matches. “I don’t like the name Fab Four but it’s not important whether I like it or not,” Klopp said at his pre-match press conference. “Am I privileged to manage them? Yes, of course.” At the other end, Liverpool’s defence has been impressive of late, especially at Anfield, but everybody knows they have a tendency to self implode. Will it be another rip-roaring display from Liverpool’s frightening front line or might Big Sam have a Big Sam masterclass up his sleeve on this swashbuckling champagne Super Sunday?

Stunning goals by Kamil Grosicki and then Seb Larsson, who rolled back the years with a fine free-kick, nudged Hull in front after a David Meyler own goal had put the Bees ahead. Jackson Irvine sealed victory before John Egan popped up with a second three minutes from time. “I’ve loved the last two days, I’ve utilised my time well and tomorrow I’m going to take a bit of time to reflect because it has been a whirlwind,” Adkins said. That victory hoists Hull to 18th, and above QPR, who suffered a home defeat by Leeds United. Kemar Roofe helped himself to a hat-trick for Leeds who rise to seventh. • Wolves failed to break down 10-man Sunderland as the two teams played out a stalemate at Molineux, where the hosts had captain Lee Cattermole sent off. Nuno Espírito Santo’s side remain five points clear of Cardiff City, who do not play until Monday night, and eight above in-form Bristol City. It was a good afternoon for Derby County to assert their authority on the top six by breezing past Barnsley at Oakwell, with Andreas Weimann capping their 3-0 win. Meanwhile, Middlesbrough got back to winning ways with a 2-0 win over Ipswich Town, who they leapfrog in the table to move eighth. “Boro look a bloody good side,” Mick McCarthy, the Ipswich manager, said. Nottingham Forest also returned to form, bouncing back from successive defeats to get the better of Bolton Wanderers at the City Ground. • Elsewhere, on-loan Chelsea forward Jérémie Boga missed a penalty for Birmingham City to leave them entrenched in the bottom three after going down to a Sheyi Ojo goal against Fulham at Craven Cottage, while their Midlands rivals Aston Villa were frustrated at home to Millwall. And Norwich City moved level on points with Sheffield Wednesday after the Owls’ second-half capitulation at Carrow Road saw the hosts come away with a 3-1 win, while Burton Albion slumped to a seventh straight defeat at home to Preston North End. Results: Aston Villa 0-0 Millwall, Barnsley 0-3 Derby County, Burton Albion 1-2 Preston North End, Fulham 1-0 Birmingham City, Hull City 3-2 Brentford, Middlesbrough 2-0 Ipswich, Nottingham Forest 3-2 Bolton, Queens Park Rangers 1-3 Leeds United, Wolves 0-0 Sunderland, Norwich City 3-1 Sheffield Wednesday League One • Bradford City came out victorious in a topsy-turvy seven-goal thriller at home to Rochdale, with Tyrell Robinson striking what proved to be the winner in front of almost 20,000 at Valley Parade to lift the Bantams up to fourth. Five straight wins for Blackburn Rovers moves them up to third in the table, a point behind second-placed Shrewsbury Town who secured a late point at MK Dons. Meanwhile, Wigan Athletic beat Fleetwood Town to extend their lead at the top to four points. Paul Cook’s table-toppers have lost once in their last 10 matches. “I thought it was a good, strong, competent performance,” Cook said. • Elsewhere, play-off chasing Scunthorpe United and Charlton Athletic both came undone, to Walsall and Portsmouth – who shoot up to seventh – respectively, while Oxford United eked closer to the top six with the sweetest of victories, with Josh Ruffels netting a 96th-minute winner over Doncaster Rovers. With the division’s top scorer Kieffer Moore suspended, his team-mate David Ball filled his boots and the void with a double as Rotherham United won 2-1 at Blackpool. • A brilliant gesture by Darius Charles ensured it was not a totally wasted 460-mile round trip to Bury for AFC Wimbledon supporters. The Dons defender put £150 behind the bar at a Manchester pub for travelling fans after snow forced the game to be called off just after midday. Charles and the rest of the squad made the most of the postponement, heading to a nearby playing field for an impromptu training session. At Oldham Athletic, staff and supporters mucked in to shovel snow off the pitch amid three pitch inspections. It really was worth it too, as they demolished Northampton Town in style, with a 5-1 victory. Bristol Rovers remain 15th despite back-to-back wins, with Billy Bodin bagging his 10th goal of the season. “I think there’s a bit of realism around the place now,” said manager Darrell Clarke. • It was very nearly a nightmare debut for Kelle Roos, Plymouth Argyle’s seventh goalkeeper of the season, but Toumani Diagouraga fired home from close range to snatch a stoppage-time victory over Gillingham at Home Park. Roos appeared to fumble Tom Eaves’s 16th-minute volley over the line but to bemusement from both dugouts, no goal was given. Eaves eventually struck six minutes from time, with what must have felt like the equaliser, until conceding an agonising late winner. Results: Blackpool 1-2 Rotherham United, Bradford City 4-3 Rochdale, Bristol Rovers 3-0 Southend United, Charlton 0-1 Portsmouth, MK Dons 1-1 Shrewsbury Town, Oldham Athletic 5-1 Northampton Town, Oxford United 1-0 Doncaster Rovers, Peterborough United 2-3 Blackburn Rovers, Plymouth Argyle 2-1 Gillingham, Walsall 1-0 Scunthorpe United, Wigan Athletic 2-0 Fleetwood Town, Bury P-P AFC Wimbledon League Two • Can Lincoln City do it again? They climbed into the play-off places after a 2-0 victory over Yeovil Town at Huish Park. The signs were ominous for Darren Way’s side when new signing Oscar Gobern limped off with an ankle injury after four minutes before second-half goals by Matt Green and Matt Rhead for the Imps. At the summit, Shola Ameobi rescued a 1-1 draw for Notts County at Luton Town as the top two went head to head, while Accrington Stanley’s game against Swindon Town was postponed. • Accrington chairman Andy Holt lambasted David Webb after the referee decided to postpone their match, insisting there was “not enough snow to make a snowball”. Holt, who said he accepted Swindon supporters’ “pissed offness”, tweeted: “In future EFL if there is a dusting of snow forecast in games should be called off a day in advance. Backbone transplants needed. No matter where you look they are out to destroy life as we know it. Health and safety, judges, politicans, refs.” • Exeter City missed the chance to jump into the top three at Stanley’s expense. Paul Tisdale’s side conceded three goals inside seven first-half minutes to leave them too big a mountain to climb at Colchester United, although Jayden Stockley did register a consolation strike, his 10th goal of the season. “It was really wishy-washy first half from us,” said Paul Tisdale, the Exeter manager. Coventry City also squandered the opportunity to gain ground in the race for promotion. Goals by Vadaine Oliver and Callum Lang shocked Mark Robins’s side to give Morecambe an impressive victory to move them away from danger. • Six goals could not separate Newport County and Carlisle United. On-loan Bristol City striker Shawn McCoulsky gave Newport the lead with his ninth goal of the season before Matty Dolan scored two free-kicks to twice pull level in a frenetic 3-3 draw at Rodney Parade. And Chesterfield have lift off. Robbie Weir’s 93rd-minute winner over Barnet ensured the Spireites are off the foot of the Football League at the expense of Mark McGhee’s side, who now prop up the division.

Cipriani, who returned from injury last weekend to inspire Wasps to victory over Leicester, is attracting interest from French clubs who have the means to make him an offer that the Ricoh Arena club would be unable to match because of the salary cap. “Danny is one of the best attacking outside-halves I have worked with,” says the Wasps director of rugby, Dai Young, “and it is good for us that he is back in time for what is a crucial double-header in the Champions Cup against La Rochelle. We have had talks with him and it will be sorted out after Christmas. “I think he is undecided about his future. He does not want to give up on England, but if he concludes that ship has sailed, he may look to see where the biggest offer is and you could not blame him. I think it will come down to whether he thinks he has a chance of playing for England again. “We know Danny is looking at his options and he is aware that we our considering ours. We will not be rushing off and signing anyone until we have spoken to him after Christmas. Danny is part of a 9, 10, 12 axis with Dan Robson and Jimmy Gopperth: the three complement each other and with Jimmy is top quality outside-half in his own right, if Danny went it may be that we replaced with a playmaking centre.” Queensland Reds last week told the Australia fly-half Quade Cooper that he was not in the plans of their head coach, Brad Thorn, next season and was free to leave. Wasps did not make a marquee signing after another Wallaby, Kurtley Beale, left at the end of last season but Young plans to recruit one for the 2018-19 campaign. Wasps’ former captain James Haskell is another player out of contract at the end of the season and his future may also be tied up with whether he still has an international future after being omitted from the England squad in the autumn. “Hask is a fantastic guy you would go to war with,” says Young. “I have told him to just concentrate on showing he is the leading back-rower at this club and prove he is still good enough to be playing for England. Joe Launchbury and Elliot Daly have signed new deals and I am confident we will keep most of our players.” Wasps will need all their experienced hands on Sunday when they travel to the Top 14 leaders, La Rochelle, in a meeting between two clubs who finished at the top of their leagues last season only to miss out on silverware through the play-off system. La Rochelle had not played in the Champions Cup before this season but entered the competition at a sprint with impressive victories over Harlequins and Ulster while Wasps started with defeat in Belfast when they were in the middle of a losing run. “Matches like this are why you work hard for 10 months of the year to get into the top six,” says Young. “We know it is going to be a massive challenge and it is about us going there and playing. We cannot sit back and be conservative, hoping to hit them with a sucker punch, and we are pretty much at full strength behind. “They are a momentum team, big and strong. If they get on a roll, you can forget it. If we keep hold of the ball and up the tempo, there will be holes in their defence; if it is a slow arm wrestle, we will not win. We cannot give them too much possession. We know we are going to have to play our best rugby and we have to get something out of the game ahead of the return.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/10/record-demand-vinyl-sales-exceed-supply-lps","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T15:45:59Z","webTitle":"Indies feel pushed out of vinyl boom as 'dad rock' sells in record numbers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/10/record-demand-vinyl-sales-exceed-supply-lps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/10/record-demand-vinyl-sales-exceed-supply-lps","fields":{"headline":"Indies feel pushed out of vinyl boom as 'dad rock' sells in record numbers","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"A surge in demand for records by “dad rock” bands and blockbuster acts such as Ed Sheeran is delaying new releases by independent labels, as vinyl sales hit a 25-year high. Indie labels say it is now taking several months, rather than weeks, to bring out a new record as the small number of surviving vinyl factories struggle to cope with orders. “We’ve been making records continuously for 20 years and the lead time has gone up from three weeks to three months,” says Gerald Short, founder of Jazzman Records. “The major labels have the leverage with the pressing plants due to the volume of business they can offer, which I can understand. Most record companies in the UK use plants in Europe these days, and at the moment the pressing plants just cannot cope with the demand. They’re working 24/7.” Jonny Trunk, founder of Trunk Records, agrees: “I’ve never seen anything like it: it’s a gold rush, and that is leading to delays. If a busy pressing plant gets an order from a major label saying, for example, ‘We have 20,000 Dire Straits LPs to press’, then the plant tends to drop production for smaller labels and press the big order.” As music fans fall back in love with owning a record player, vinyl is enjoying a renaissance with sales jumping 37.6% in the first half of 2017 to £37.3m. The BPI, the music industry’s trade body, predicts more than 4 million records will be sold this year, the highest since it began collecting data in the early 1990s. More than a million will be sold this month alone as records and record players once again feature heavily on Christmas lists. Based on an analysis of its historical sales data, high street music retailer HMV believes 2017 will see its biggest sales figures for vinyl music since the late 1980s, when chart-topping acts included Kylie Minogue, Michael Jackson and Simply Red. HMV rings up a third of all vinyl LP sales in the UK but supermarkets have been keen to take a slice of the action, with Sainsbury’s recently releasing compilation albums under its new Own Label imprint, featuring 1970s hits including an excerpt from Mike Oldfield’s Tubular Bells and 10cc’s I’m Not In Love. Sainsbury’s says it has shifted 300,000 vinyl albums since re-entering the market in March 2016 with Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours – the grocer’s best-selling album to date, with more than 12,000 copies sold. “A lot of old fellas are buying reissues of the records they had in their youth before replacing them with CDs, which they’re now getting rid of so they can buy the vinyl again,” says Short. “We’re talking Led Zep, Pink Floyd, etc – the usual suspects. But the main problem is an inability to plan releases properly. To promote a record you need to have a release date and a certain amount of time before that date to promote it. If you don’t know when your stock will arrive, it’s hard to set a release date ... and if the record sells out fast, you need a re-press now, not several months later.” There is a shortage of pressing plants because many closed during the 1990s and 2000s when vinyl looked doomed – sales reached a nadir in 2007 when only 200,000 records were sold. In Europe, most records for major and independent labels are pressed by just two plants, in the Czech Republic and the Netherlands. However, even with a combined capacity of more than 100,000 units per day, their output is not enough to satisfy a newly hungry global market. Amid the growing confidence that vinyl is here to stay as CD sales fall away, businesses are now pouring money into new plants. The Japanese arm of Sony Music will restart the manufacture of its own records next year to cope with huge domestic demand. Closer to home, Dublin Vinyl will produce 100,000 records per month when a new Irish factory is at full speed. BPI chief executive Geoff Taylor suggests there is evidence that the vinyl demographic is starting to shift away from “baby boomer” males reliving their youth through reissued albums. The bestselling LP of the year now tends to be the overall bestseller – an accolade expected to go to Ed Sheeran’s Divide this year – while recent research found a quarter of vinyl buyers are aged under 35 and one in four are female. “Typically, vinyl sales are dominated by heritage rock acts, but in 2015, Adele’s 25 was not only the bestselling album title overall – it also topped the year’s official vinyl chart,” says Taylor. “Last year, Amy Winehouse’s classic Back to Black was the biggest selling vinyl title in December and the second-highest seller for the year overall.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/09/north-west-derbies-go-global-manchester-united-city-liverpool-everton-football","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-09T15:06:00Z","webTitle":"From Oslo and Brisbane to Manchester and Merseyside: the north-west derbies go global","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/09/north-west-derbies-go-global-manchester-united-city-liverpool-everton-football","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/09/north-west-derbies-go-global-manchester-united-city-liverpool-everton-football","fields":{"headline":"From Oslo and Brisbane to Manchester and Merseyside: the north-west derbies go global","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It is, as Dag Langerød says, “a massive day” – Manchester United versus Manchester City, with Liverpool against Everton as an aperitif. Two derbies, major events in a footballing calendar, have fallen on the same day, throwing an unusually intense spotlight on the north-west of England. This corner of the British Isles has the Lake District, Antony Gormley’s statues in the sea and, in Coronation Street, perhaps the most famous soap opera in the world. But in the era of a globalised TV audience for sport, this is a weekend to illustrate the depth and reach of England’s most successful footballing region. The world is descending on Manchester and Merseyside to watch Britain’s biggest tourism export live. Langerød has made the journey from Oslo to Manchester with about 2,000 others – and those are just the United supporters. “It’s the game of the season,” he said. “Ten years ago when Liverpool were our biggest rivals I wouldn’t have said that. But now City are the best team and it’s the hugest game it’s possible to get. They are eight points ahead of us – this could make all the difference.” Football is a bigger driver of tourism to the north-west than almost anything else. Nearly 11% of visits to north-west England include a live match, according to Visit Britain – nearly twice as many as the next nearest region, the north-east, and 10 times as many as London. The UK’s official tourism body conducted a study in 2015 that showed more than 800,000 international visitors went to a Premier League match, spending £684m. Of these, 109,000 went to Old Trafford and 99,000 to Anfield. Most tourists arrive from Ireland, Norway, Sweden, US and the Netherlands. “The supporters’ club has 500 season tickets,” Langerød said, “so we have about 10,000 people coming through the season.” He has been five or six times since the season began in August. People travelling with him paid about £700 for flights, tickets and accommodation, while the thousands of others travelling independently probably spent at least £1,000. City fan Jesse Brown and his brother-in-law Mikka have spent a lot more than that. The pair have travelled from Brisbane for a City-themed holiday of a lifetime, taking in five games, including a trip to Ukraine for a Champions League match earlier in the week. “Watching a Manchester derby in the away fans’ section is something we have dreamed about,” Brown said. “For a Blues fan, watching City thrash United in a derby at 3am in a pub is what dreams are made of. But actually being at the game, that’s a whole new level.” The trip has set them back at least £2,500 each, Brown said. “After watching United beat us for years, the quality of football that City are playing now convinced us that witnessing a derby was worth the thousands of dollars.” The same calculation was made by a group of 20 Chinese supporters,who are making a 10,000-mile round trip from Beijing to Old Trafford, according to Thomas Cook Sport, which says it has also seen a 1,000% increase in bookings from Scandinavian countries. Heavy snow is predicted across the north-west on Sunday, but the matches are expected to go ahead. However, others say there are signs that numbers may be falling, according to James Cuttica, the managing director of Interopa, a specialist company that creates packages for foreign tourists. “Even though the pound has been weaker, we have started to notice a decline in overseas visitors,” he said, adding that other official resellers had told him they were also seeing a downturn. “Matches such as the north-west derbies this weekend used to always sell out well in advance. I know of agents with stock remaining and offering at greatly reduced rates by comparison to what these matches would normally command.” Part of the reason is that fans can get tickets from unofficial resellers online, Cuttica said, but also because Interopa can only buy seats as part of very expensive hospitality packages, meaning the company has made a loss on some deals. “We will need to review sales at the end of the season,” he said. The high cost is not the only factor that deters international fans. Vigan Hoxha has been hoping for years to travel from his home in the Kosovan capital, Pristina, to watch Everton play live. But Kosovo is one of 111 countries whose residents are required to obtain visitors’ visas to enter the UK. “The whole process lasts up to two months – if they give the visa,” Hoxha said. “The trip could turn into a €600 weekend. The average wage here is less than €300. It’s not fair that we cannot travel freely to see our club play, considering that all neighbouring countries can travel freely to the EU and UK.” In the meantime, Hoxha demonstrates his enthusiasm by helping organise the local Everton supporters’ club and watching games on TV. The Premier League airs in 212 countries, with 80 broadcast deals. An average game is watched by about 12 million people – this weekend is likely to be much higher, although breathless estimates of 900 million people are probably wide of the mark, judging by Premier League figures that state the 1.8 million UK viewers per game account for about 16% of the total audience. But while fewer people in the UK are watching football on Sky and BT Sport, the big clubs have been fighting to take a bigger share of international TV rights, particularly due to deals in Asia and the US. “Since NBC bought the rights a few years ago, I’ve seen a lot more interest,” said Tom McCarthy, owner of Smithfield Hall, a sports bar in New York. “I see more and more soccer jerseys.” Smithfield Hall is the home bar for United fans – “I’m a Manchester United fan myself, so it makes sense.” And how does he think the game will go? “I would hope they can pull back Manchester City a bit to make the race a bit tighter. But I wouldn’t say I’m confident.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2017/dec/09/west-ham-united-v-chelsea-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-09T14:27:47Z","webTitle":"West Ham United 1-0 Chelsea: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/dec/09/west-ham-united-v-chelsea-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/dec/09/west-ham-united-v-chelsea-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"West Ham United 1-0 Chelsea: Premier League – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Reaction from the London Stadium West Ham win their first Premier League game under David Moyes! They deserve it for an admirable, some might say obscene, level of effort, and a beautiful early goal from Marko Arnautovic. Chelsea had so much of the ball but created hardly anything. West Ham are still in the bottom three but this win should give them so much impetus in their relegation battle. It might also be the day David Moyes’ managerial career got going again. Thanks for your company. You can follow the 3pm games with Simon Burnton, and a freshly baked match report will appear here shortly. Bye! 90+3 min Fabregas swishes a half-volley high over the bar from long range. i think this is over. 90+2 min West Ham have taken the wheels off the bus, which is parked right on the edge of their own area. 90 min There will be five minutes of added time. 89 min This, as Tom Jordan points out, is the kind of dirty, tough game Diego Costa would have loved. Chelsea have lacked a bit of mongrel. 87 min Obiang, on a yellow card, fouls Moses. The referee plays to advantage and doesn’t go back to book Obiang. That could have been a second yellow. Stuart Pearce, part of the West Ham support staff, hoofs the ball away to waste time and is sent to the dugout; then Masuaku is booked for timewasting. 86 min “Hi Rob,” says Ross Jennings. “I seem to remember Chelsea time-wasting from a throw-in against Liverpool less than 1 minute in to the worst game of my footballing life (better remembered by Steven Gerrard’s trip) in 2014. Was a masterclass in winding up from José, and ultimately led to the tactical blindness that was having Gerrard as our last man at the back in the last minute of the first half. Bad times.” The twisted thing about that game was that both Chelsea’s goals came in time that was added on because of their timewasting. 84 min Another Chelsea chance, this time for Hazard. He took Morata’s touch in his stride, moved into the D and blazed a left-footed shot high over the bar. It wasn’t as good a chance as Morata’s, though he should probably have worked Adrian. 83 min Morata misses a great chance! Kante, surrounded on the edge of the area, managed to force a through ball into Morata, who was played onside by Masuaku on the other side of the area. He turned smoothly but lashed a first-time shot wide of the near post. 82 min The West Ham fans are cheering every clearance now. Quite right too: this would be an immense victory, and probably a season-changing one. 80 min Antonio Conte looks resigned to defeat. It just hasn’t happened for Chelsea today. 78 min Antonio, who has put in a monstrous shift, is so shattered that when the ball goes out of play he takes the opportunity for a lie-down. Andre Ayew replaces him. 76 min “Hi Rob,” says Steven Hughes. “I’ve seen plenty of first half time-wasting at Ashton Gate this season. It’s the groovy new thing. Teams realise that that’s the half in which to add on time is deemed churlish when there’s a whole 45+ minutes to go: it tends to be two minutes at the very most so there’s free rein to time waste and break up play. Want a law change? Make all first halves end on exactly 45.00 and add everything on at the end. Not only would it be fair but it would inject most games with a new lease of life if there was the thick end of 10 minutes added on with 90 minutes on the clock.” What about Robbie Savage’s blood-pressure levels though? 75 min Chelsea don’t look like scoring at the moment, although fatigue is likely to be an issue for West Ham because they have worked so hard. Hazard teases his way past Obiang and whacks a cross-shot that goes behind for a corner. 72 min West Ham are emplying a variation on Two Banks of Four. They have a Bank of Five and then a Bank of Three in front, and Chelsea can’t find an eye in the needle. Neither side has had a shot on target in the second half. 71 min “West Bromwich started to time waste in their match against Spurs at Wembley in the 15th minute,” says John Tumbridge. “That’s the fifteenth minute of the first half.” 70 min Obiang clatters Kante and is booked. Meanwhile, my colleague James Dart has pointed out this sensational display of early timewasting. 69 min West Ham make their first change, with Diafra Sakho replacing the goalscorer Arnautovic. He’s had a terrific game. 68 min Fabregas’s free-kick from the right falls to Christensen, whose volley is brilliantly blocked by Reid. 68 min And now Cresswell is booked for a deliberate foul on Willian, just outside the area on the Chelsea right. 67 min Reid is booked for a cynical foul on Morata. 64 min Chelsea make their final change: Willian replaces Davide Zappacosta. 63 min The impressive Masuaku charges forward to win a corner. West Ham’s attitude and controlled aggression have been outstanding in this game. 62 min Azpilicueta’s long-range shot deflects dangerously in the area, and Adrian reacts smartly to get there before Morata. For all Chelsea’s possession, they haven’t created much at all. West Ham’s narrow defence have given them very little space to work with. 60 min “Hello Rob,” says Andrew Benton. “What do you think about sponsorship by betting companies - I see one sponsors West Ham. Clearly bad for your health if it gets out of hand, and not much good even if it doesn’t, is it likely to go the same way as cigarette sponsorship? Seems inappropriate to me, however much the companies promote responsible betting.” Yes, I know what you mean. It doesn’t really bother me but I’m surprised, in the current climate, that more questions haven’t been asked about it. 59 min I wonder what’s the earliest bit of timewasting in a football match. Has anybody ever had a jaunty saunter to the corner flag in the first half? 58 min Adrian is booked for timewasting. In the 58th minute. 58 min Zappacosta cuts in from the left and whips a curling cross-shot that bounces just wide of the far post. I think Adrian had it covered. 57 min Chelsea try a training-ground free kick: Fabregas slides it into the area for Moses, whose attempted cross is blocked. That was a bit of a waste. 56 min Obiang fouls Morata 30 yards from goal, and then Cresswell boots the ball against Morata as he rolls over. Chelsea are getting more and more frustrated. 55 min Another Chelsea change: Victor Moses replaces Marcos Alonso. Zappacosta moves to left wing-back. 54 min Arnatutovic’s touch hits the outstretched hand of Christensen just inside the box, prompting huge appeals for a penalty that are turned down by Anthony Taylor. I’m not sure Christensen knew much about that, though they have been given in the past. His arm was away from his body. 52 min Fabregas stoops to head Zappacosta’s cross towards goal, and Ogbonna makes another vital block. Chelsea are all over West Ham like a cheap cliche. 51 min West Ham break through Arnautovic and Antonio, who delays his through pass a fraction too long. Arnautovic is flagged offside, and Courtois saves his shot anyway. 50 min Fabregas manufactures a clever cutback on the turn that is crucially cleared by Cresswell. 49 min After a long spell of Chelsea possession, Pedro volleys a dropping ball well wide from long range. This is going to be a never-ending second half for West Ham. 48 min “Hi Rob,” says Kevin Ryan. “Hope all good with you. Why on earth are Chelsea wearing that kit? Is it because the light blue sleeves of the Hammers are deemed to clash with Chelsea’s normal Royal blue? In which case don’t their white shorts clash with West Ham’s. Or is it just down to having to wear the second/third choice strips for the kit manufacturer’s filthy lucre? Strange.. However it does at least give me the chance to cackle and say ‘The whites, Dude.’” 46 min Peep peep! West Ham begin the second half. Chelsea have made a half-time substitution: Pedro is replacing the subdued Tiemoue Bakayoko. A bit of half-time reading Peep peep! West Ham end a stirring half with a passing move that is accompanied by olés from the home crowd. They lead through Marko Arnautovic’s high-class early goal - and though Chelsea have had an intimidating amount of possession, Adrian has had only one really difficult save to make. See you in 10 minutes for the second half. 45 min Masuaku, who has put a serious shift in at left wing-back, wins another corner for West Ham. Morata clears at the near post. 43 min West Ham have restored a bit of calm after a torrid 20-minute spell. They still won’t say no to half time, though. 40 min The tireless Antonio harasses Courtois into a panicked clearance that goes behind for a West Ham corner. Nothing comes of it, but Masuaku wins a second corner moments later. 39 min Look, West Ham, you can’t go on like this. They are under constant pressure from Chelsea. 37 min Masuaku does well to nick a square pass towards Zappacosta. And then he goes and spoils it all by doing something stupid like dragging a low shot well wide from 20 yards. 37 min Chelsea have parked West Ham’s bus for them, pinning them back with some probing football. I don’t think West Ham planned to be quite this defensive. 36 min Fabregas lofts a pass into the area towards Hazard, with the covering Masuaku denying him a shooting chance. Eventually Morata, on the stretch, pokes the bouncing ball over the bar. It wasn’t much of a chance. 34 min “It’s clear now this Chelsea set up struggle against the high press,” says Nate Elliott. “You’d think a simple ball over the top to Hazard or Morata would defeat this tactic. But what odds Antonio Conte endorses some punt-and-chase football? Also, you’re being generous to Winston Reid. He’s a lucky boy to get away with that fairly meaty shirt tug.” Not for me Clive. We need a shirttugometer for these penalty appeals, like the light meter in cricket. 33 min Morata plays the ball wide to Zappacosta and moves into the area. Zappacosta dumps a cross back towards the six-yard line, and Morata, under a lot of pressure from Ogbonna and Reid, heads wide. He couldn’t get a clear jump at the ball. 32 min “There’s something I find stubbornly likeable about Arnautovic,” says Matt Dony. “I have zero reason to have any emotional investment in him, but there’s something about his combination of bullishness and occasionally surprising deftness of touch that cheers me, and I like seeing him do well. I always get the feeling he’s a very, very good footballer who (for a great number of reasons) often doesn’t play very, very well. I’m glad to see him get a goal. He’ll never win too many individual awards, he’ll never play for a top, top team (more cliches!) and he probably won’t be featured in too many ‘I Remember 2016’ talking head nonsense compilations. But I like him. Go on, son.” 30 min It’s all Chelsea now. The good news for West Ham is that Hazard and Morata have been very quiet. The bad news for West Ham is that Hazard and Morata have been very quiet. 29 min Chelsea take a short corner and work the ball to Zappacosta, who hits a fierce low shot from 17 yards with his left foot. Adrian gets down smartly to his left to make an excellent save. 28 min Alonso dummies Zabaleta and plays the ball back infield to Kante, who shapes a nice long-range curler towards the bottom corner that is palmed round by Adrian, diving to his left. 27 min Arnautovic makes something out of a nothing ball forward from Cresswell, muscling Christensen aside on the right corner of the box before hitting a speculative left-footed shot that is blocked. 25 min This is Chelsea’s best spell of the match, with West Ham having to work increasingly hard defensively. 23 min Fabregas slides a really cute pass into the area for Bakayoko, whose left-footed shot is blocked by a combination of Cresswell and Ogbonna. 22 min “Did Morata get a card for his attempt at acting on 14 mins?” says Bruce Jackson. “The ref seems fairly keen on handing them out.” Nope. 20 min Azpilicueta’s right-wing cross is headed up in the air by Ogbonna, and Hazard hits a left-footed volley that bobbles a few yards wide of the far post. It was a very difficult ball to hit as it dropped out of the sky. Chelsea are starting to look a bit more dangerous. 18 min Alonso is booked for fouling the keeper Adrian. That’s a bit harsh I think. 17 min West Ham have been much the better team so far, though you can never really relax or take anything for granted against a team that includes Hazard, Morata and Fabregas. 14 min Morata turns Reid superbly on the edge of the area, feels Reid’s hand on his shoulder and goes over. No penalty. 11 min Chelsea have started sluggishly in quite a few games this season, and this is another. That said, I think it’s been more a case of West Ham excellence than Chelsea ennui. 9 min West Ham have started excellently, with confidence and vigour in attack. It was such a good goal - both the one-two in a really tight space, and the decisive, classy finish. 7 min Arnautovic was booked for demonstrating joy in the aftermath of scoring. West Ham take the lead with a fine goal! Arnautovic, surrounded by defenders just outside the box, plays a crisp one-two with Lanzini, shifts the ball away from Azpilicueta and places a fine left-footed shot into the far corner. That’s a brilliant goal. 3 min It’s been a positive start from West Ham. Lanzini scoots excitingly down the left and is tripped by Zappacosta. The free-kick is headed away at the near post by Christensen. 2 min West Ham are indeed playing three at the back. 1 min Peep peep! Chelsea, in white, kick off. They are playing from right to left on the television screen, if you’re into the whole visualisation thing. West Ham are in claret and blue. Pre-match pluggery 1.

Anyway, enough about that mate, where’s my effing whatever service your company provides? Pre-match reading As expected, Joe Hart is omitted. In a World Cup year. There’s a suggestion that West Ham may match Chelsea by playing three at the back, though they could also play 4-2-3-1 with this XI. West Ham (3-4-2-1) Adrian; Ogbonna, Reid, Cresswell; Zabaleta, Noble, Obiang; Masuaku; Lanzini, Arnautovic; Antonio. Substitutes: Hart, Rice, Chicharito, Ayew, Sakho, Fernandes, Carroll. Chelsea (3-5-1-1) Courtois; Azpilicueta, Christensen, Cahill; Zappacosta, Fabregas, Kante, Bakayoko, Alonso; Hazard; Morata. Substitutes: Caballero, Rudiger, Ampadu, Willian, Moses, Batshuayi, Pedro. Referee Anthony Taylor. Hello. It’s pretty unusual for a football team to turn a corner by losing a match, but West Ham may have done so at the Etihad Stadium last Sunday. The ten-ton tome of football cliches tells me that, if they play all season as they did in losing 2-1 to Manchester City, there is precisely 0.00 per cent chance they will be relegated. That said, the fixture list has not exactly done them a solid. It would have been nice to follow that City match with a gentle, winnable home game. Instead West Ham host the champions Chelsea, who have been in blistering form since the sporting bromance between Eden Hazard and Alvaro Morata started to blossom. (That’s a bloody cliche as well, isn’t it? There’s no escape. We’re all doomed to be sick as parrots.) Whether West Ham can turn their home ground into something resembling a fortress – a strength of West Hams past and also David Moyes’s Everton - will probably decide whether they stay up or not. That won’t be easy. But if they win today, even the biggest sceptics might think they’ve turned a corner.

On Friday, West Midlands fire service said they would not charge 22-year-old Jay Swingler the £650 service fee for the callout as his life was in danger, but the prankster has since offered to make a voluntary contribution. Hundreds of people have taken to social media to criticise the vlogger for wasting the time and resources of the emergency services, calling him “stupid” and “immature”. Speaking to BBC News about the incident, the prankster said: “The idea behind this video was to create this reaction. And, mission success, man. There is no such thing as bad publicity in my opinion.” The video of Swingler cementing his head inside the microwave has been viewed more than 1m times and has attracted more than 14,000 comments on the platform. Despite having gone viral, the recording has been demonetised by YouTube, meaning Swingler will not earn any direct revenue from it. Fire service station commander Simon Woodward said: “We pride ourselves on our five minutes’ attendance standard. That means that if we have an instant where there’s life at risk, our appliances will be there within five minutes, and that gives us our best chance to save that life. “If we are attending incidents that are YouTube videos where we have people who have been irresponsible … the service charge for that would be £650. We are not going to charge because his life was in danger. What I’d like to do is remind everybody not to put their lives at risk for the sake of other people’s entertainment.” Swingler has not responded to the Guardian’s request for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2017/dec/09/mls-cup-final-toronto-fc-v-seattle-sounders-","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-09T23:27:27Z","webTitle":"Toronto FC defeat Seattle Sounders to win the MLS Cup – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/dec/09/mls-cup-final-toronto-fc-v-seattle-sounders-","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/dec/09/mls-cup-final-toronto-fc-v-seattle-sounders-","fields":{"headline":"Toronto FC defeat Seattle Sounders to win the MLS Cup – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ecstasy for Toronto, agony for Seattle. That’s it from me. Thanks for following. Bedlam at BMO Field as Toronto FC cap an incredible season, sealing the third trophy of a domestic treble. Redemption for Altidore, Bradley, Giovinco et al. And that’s the icing on the cake for Toronto as the fans go bananas. Victor Vazquez seals the MLS Cup for the Canadians. 90 min (+2): Some substitutions. For Seattle, Nouhou is on for Joevin Jones; for Toronto, Cheyrou is on for Delgado. Two more minutes of added time. 90 min: Giovinco goes through and goes down in the area but the referee waves play on. 86 min: Toronto’s goalscorer Altidore is off and Nick Hagglund is on. 80 min: MLS has the use of VAR technology. So why was it not used on Altidore’s goal? It turns out it was. Thanks to reader Dennis Verweij, watching the Canadian broadcast, for the email. 79 min: The game has died down a little – Seattle need something and quick. A video of Altidore’s goal. Some suggestions he may have been offside as the ball was played through. 71 min: Seattle make their first change. Jordan Morris, the USA forward, comes on for Victor Rodriguez. And the dam is finally broken. Toronto finally get their breakthrough and it is through Jozy Altidore, who took so much heat after USA’s failure to make the 2018 World Cup, who comes up with the goods. 64 min: Frei yet again comes to Seattle’s rescue with a brilliant diving save to deny Giovinco. How long can Frei keep this up? He is playing out of his skin. 63 min: Toronto win their ninth corner but nothing comes of it. 60 min: Michael Bradley pounces on a loose ball with a long-range volley that Frei keeps out with his body. 57 min: Some controversy as Altidore is held back outside the area before Leerdam slides in on Morrow inside the area. No foul, no penalty. 53min: Seattle have done nothing up front thus far. If they are relying on Frei once again in a penalty shoot-out they really need to make a switch soon. 52min: Giovinco is fouled and he takes the free-kick but it’s way, way over the bar. 48 min: And the second half begins as the first half ends, with Toronto in charge. Steven Beitashour hits a long effort over the bar. “Good day Bob,” writes Travis Giblin. “Just to clarify, the weather doesn’t suck everywhere in North America right now. I’m a Canadian currently in Mexico where it’s 30 Celsius.” Very happy for you Travis. I’m in NYC where it is freezing. 46 min: The second half begins... Here’s a picture of Stefan Frei making one of his many saves in this game. Can he win the MLS Cup MVP trophy again? ESPN’s Taylor Twellman interviewed MLS Commissioner Don Garber earlier this week. Garber says the prospect of the Columbus Crew moving to Austin, Texas, is a “unique situation”, possibly allaying the fears of many MLS fans that their team could move, too. Two words: Stefan Frei. 44 min: Nearly an own-goal for Seattle after Joevin Jones puts a wild boot on Justin Morrrow’s cross from the left. It could have gone anywhere and, fortunately for the Sounders, it flies to safety. 41 min: It’s Groundhog Day and deja vu all over again. Frei with another big save for Seattle, denying Victor Vasquez. Keep your emails coming as this game is not living up to billing thus far... One for our British viewers. “What I want to know is whether we’ll see Dempsey Make Peace with Bono,” emails one reader. (There was a British TV crime drama called Dempsey and Makepeace in the Eighties). 35 min: Stefan Frei keeps Seattle in the game again after a fizzing effort from Marco Delgado. 30 min: A shot on target from Seattle in the MLS Cup final, a momentous occasion. Why, you ask. Joevin Jones’s effort was the Sounders’ first in 150 minutes of the last two MLS Cup finals (they did not have any last year in regulation). Daniel Stauss emails again, latching onto the Bono U2 puns. “It’ll be a Beautiful Day in Seattle if, by the whistle, Bono Still Hasn’t Found What He’s Looking For (an MLS Cup). Of course, keepers are known for their Mysterious Ways...” It goes on but I’ll leave it there. The Toronto keeper is called Alex Bono if you were wondering. 26 min: A nice chip there from Jozy Altidore, just outside the area, but it comes to nothing, the running theme of this game: Toronto dominance but a struggle with the end product. 23 min: Another shot from Giovinco... another save from Frei, who tips the ball over the bar. 20 min: A free-kick for Sebastian Giovinco, his speciality. But it’s too far out and his effort goes straight into the wall. Toronto remain on top though. Another weather email, this time from Mike MacKenzie in London, Canada. “Most Canadians understand both Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures although Celsius has been used in Canada for a few decades. Of course, we get US weather reports with temps in Fahrenheit. “All Canadians understand the wind chill factor which was invented by a Canadian. Regardless, it is still rather cold to be playing a final in December in Canada (or the northern US for that matter).” Why are talking so much about the weather and not the game? Well it is scoreless... 16 min: Toronto keep pushing and Morrow is given offside when a replay indicates he is not. Frei saves his effort anyway. “Will Bono in goal give Toronto the Edge on the big stage?” asks Justin Kavanagh. “Sorry! I’d get my coat but as it’s freezing here in North America, I already have it on. I agree with Rob O: December is not a month for soccer in Canada or the US.” 10 min: Huge save by Seattle keeper Stefan Frei to deny Jonathan Osorio... and then Giovinco hits the ball just wide from right of the area. 8 min: Sebastian Giovinco did not have a shot on target in last year’s MLS Cup final. He’s had his first one here. But it was weak and straight at the keeper. “What is this 34F/20F you speak of?” asks Kevin Smith. “The spacing between games in the play-offs makes as much sense as the Fahrenheit system.” 2 min: Early pressure from Toronto and Drew Moor goes close for the home side with a clear header over the bar following a corner. He was unmarked. Should have done better. The Seattle Sounders get us under way. Will it be revenge (for Toronto) or repeat (for Seattle)? Will VAR come into play? Let’s find out... Two national anthems today: the Star Spangled Banner followed by O Canada. No protests whatsoever here. Another email. “I have always wondered why the MLS drags its play-offs and plays the final in December. It loses all momentum,” writes Rob O. Do you agree? It’s currently 34F at BMO Field but it feels more like 20F due to the wind chill, apparently. Brrr! Bit of a laboured on-field bit there from the usually excellent Taylor Twellman on ESPN. Not sure that really worked. Toronto have switched from a back three, which has proved so successful this season, to a back four. “It’s a big gamble from Greg Vanney,” says ESPN’s Kasey Keller. Here is the prize that Toronto FC and Seattle Sounders are playing for. An email from one Daniel Stauss: “Loving the Sounders lineup. I’m sad (but not surprised) to see El Corazon out of the central midfield, but in Schmetzer we trust. Bruin was a monster in the series against Houston, and Rodriguez was the best under the radar pickup in the league this year. “My biggest question going into this match, what will Dempsey, Bradley and Altidore have to say to each other after the epic choke that was the WCQ? Will they just do that shrug-and-avert-your-eyes thing? Will the BMO crowd give Clint a hard time? Prepare the popcorn!” If Harry Shipp scores the winner for Seattle Sounders, it will begin a week of serious festivities for the player. The players are on the field and getting ready for kick-off. Toronto FC Bono; Beitashour, Moor, Mavinga, Morrow; Bradley, Vazquez, Delgado, Osorio; Giovinco, Altidore. Seattle Sounders Frei; Jones, Marshall, Torres, Leerdam; Svensson, Roldan; Rodriguez, Dempsey, Lodeiro; Bruin. On to today’s MLS Cup final (kick-off is scheduled to be 4.30pm ET), victory over Toronto would make Seattle just the fourth team in league history to become back-to-back MLS Cup champions. DC United won the first two titles in league history (1996 and 1997), Houston Dynamo won consecutive titles in 2006-07 and LA Galaxy went back-to-back in 2011-12. Earlier today, meanwhile, incumbent Sunil Gulati – in Toronto for a 2026 World Cup bid press conference – said he has officially withdrawn from the US Soccer presidential race, days after announcing he would not seek re-election. “I haven’t endorsed anybody, and I haven’t said I have a preferred candidate,” Gulati told reporters. “I’ll certainly think about [endorsing a candidate], but I haven’t made a decision yet. I don’t think there will be [nine] candidates come February, and I don’t think all the candidates will get the requisite nominations.” There are nine candidates in the race, including controversial former US women’s goalkeeper Hope Solo. In a twist, former USWNT player Julie Foudy tweeted earlier today of Solo: “I am hearing from multiple sources that Hope Solo does not have even one official nomination. She has until Tuesday to secure three.” How about that. MLS Commissioner Don Garber gave his traditional “State of the League” press conference on Friday in Toronto. Most notably, Garber said it was “conceivable” that David Beckham’s beleaguered Miami franchise, which is still to be finalized despite being announced in February 2014, could fall down in the pecking order of expansion teams to be invited into the league. Two new franchises, from finalists Sacramento, Nashville, Cincinnati and Detroit, are due to be announced next week. “It is the most complicated in any market that we’ve experienced, at least in my 18 years,” Garber said. “We’ve been working hard on trying to find a local owner for David Beckham. I feel confident that that will come together, so I continue to say that we want Miami in the league. It’s a large market, a gateway city. There are a lot of values to us having a team down there and I’m very confident that we’ll get something done.” Hello and welcome to the 2017 MLS Cup final between heavy favourites Toronto FC and defending champions, the Seattle Sounders. Today’s game in frosty Toronto is a rematch of last year’s final which the Sounders won on penalties after a goalless 120 minutes. Toronto, for their part, are excited to have “another crack” at Seattle, according to midfielder Michael Bradley. “This was all we wanted,” he added. Toronto foward Jozy Altidore is fit to play despite nursing a hurt right ankle while Jordan Morris is likely to make the Sounders squad after returning from a hamstring injury in the Western Conference final against Houston Dynamo. Seattle midfielder and captain Osvaldo Alonso is out, though. The biggest factor could be the weather: temperatures are expected around the freezing mark around kick-off, with a 40% chance of snow flurries. The orange ball awaits. Bob will be here soon. In the meantime, read why Toronto FC are confident of finally fulfilling their promise after last year’s heartache against today’s opponents, the Seattle Sounders."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/09/jozy-altidore-mls-cup-glory-toronto-fc-seattle-sounders","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T00:07:00Z","webTitle":"Jozy Altidore has last laugh to seal MLS Cup glory for Toronto FC","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/09/jozy-altidore-mls-cup-glory-toronto-fc-seattle-sounders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/09/jozy-altidore-mls-cup-glory-toronto-fc-seattle-sounders","fields":{"headline":"Jozy Altidore has last laugh to seal MLS Cup glory for Toronto FC","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"For long stretches of this final it looked as if Stefan Frei was about to singlehandedly thwart Toronto yet again. But this time Jozy Altidore proved to be his nemesis. Having produced one of the iconic saves in Major League Soccer history to deny Altidore during the smash-and-grab Seattle win here in the 2016 final, Frei resumed where he left off, with a string of acrobatic and reflex saves to keep a rampant Toronto team at bay until the 67th minute of the 2017 repeat edition. This time, though, Altidore would have the last laugh by running through to score the breakthrough goal. Having hobbled to his feet to score the key strike against Columbus Crew that put Toronto in this final, Altidore again proved decisive. After looking like he would remember these play-offs for all the wrong reasons following his red card against the New York Red Bulls, Altidore – the MLS Cup MVP – flipped the script again when it mattered. By the time Victor Vazquez bundled in a second in injury time, it just confirmed what had looked apparent from that momentous opening goal: Toronto would be champions. “This has been the dream for four years,” Michael Bradley told ESPN afterwards. “Since the day I got here. And for the last year, the dream has become an obsession. And for this group of guys to work every single day, having to remember last year, to get back here, to play that game, in this atmosphere, with that on the line, it’s unbelievable.” Somewhere amid the Toronto onslaught Seattle registered a shot — their first in 150 minutes of MLS Cup play against Toronto — when Joevin Jones hit an aimless ball across the box that was technically on target when Alex Bono made a routine catch. They would barely trouble the Toronto goal again. Toronto’s MLS coach of the year, Greg Vanney, can be obsessive to a fault in the way he thinks his way through games, and when the line-ups came out and it became clear he had switched his team to a 4-4-2 diamond, the first impression was that this was an unexpectedly reactive move for a home coach to make — the type that comes back to vindicate or haunt a coach depending on the outcome. In last season’s final Vanney’s wide men in the 3-5-2 formation had pinned Seattle back and kept their full-backs out of the game; this narrow configuration seemed to rob him of that option and invite Seattle into the game. That, it seems, was the plan. With Jones duly emboldened to push up on the left in the early open exchanges, there was space for Toronto to exploit behind him. Vazquez was switching play at will, Altidore was holding up the ball and Sebastian Giovinco was consistently sniffing around goal. Behind them the energetic Marky Delgado and the calm presence of Bradley were shutting off most glimpses of goal Seattle had and unsettling their midfield on the ball. Cristian Roldan in particular was utterly anonymous in the first half. No goals for Toronto, though. Stretched as they looked at times in chasing Toronto shadows, Seattle had conceded just 12 in their last 20 games, and none in these play-offs. When Chad Marshall and Roman Torres play together at the heart of defense they rarely concede easily, but in this game they had Frei to thank for keeping the contest close. The Swiss goalkeeper had barely palmed a Jonathan Osorio shot round the post in the 10th minute when he was off his line seconds later to thwart Giovinco, with the Italian put clean through on goal by another raking Vazquez pass. The pattern was set. A stinging Delgado shot was palmed over by an off-balance Frei on 35 minutes. And two minutes before half-time, the keeper sprawled full-length to his right to push away a Vazquez drive. The second half brought more of the same. If anything, Toronto looked to have closed down the few options for quick counters up the middle that the Sounders had managed to identify in the opening 45 minutes. And the Red team kept coming forward. Bradley smashed a shot that ricocheted off Frei’s chest to safety, on the hour, then four minutes later, Altidore found himself in space on the edge of the box and touched the ball inside to Giovinco. The Italian checked and placed a shot low to Frei’s left. But not past him. Again Frei scrambled the ball to safety. A lesser team might have second-guessed themselves at this stage — but Toronto were still playing like men possessed to recover the ball on the rare occasions they lost it, and they got their reward with a breakthrough on the counter in the 67th minute. Working the ball quickly up the middle, their midfield found Giovinco in the perfect spot inside Toronto’s half to flick the ball on and split the defense for the marauding Altidore. He duly charged into the box, took the ball to his left for the angle, and hammered the ball emphatically past Frei. Seattle immediately brought on Jordan Morris for the disappointing Victor Rodriguez, but there was little to suggest they had another gear to find. Clint Dempsey had been touted as the potential difference this year, having missed last year’s play-offs with his heart ailment, but like most of his team-mates he had few opportunities to stall the Toronto momentum. He has now lost three MLS Cup finals. Toronto came into MLS Cup as perhaps the most underwhelming overwhelming favorites in recent league history. Through a long and grinding play-off campaign, the free-flowing attack that had taken them to an MLS record points haul, a Supporters’ Shield and a Canadian Championship, was nowhere to be seen. Their forced march towards an unprecedented MLS treble had seemed to run contrary to the lightness with which Seattle wore their own status as defending MLS Cup holders. But on Saturday, Toronto found their swagger again, and this year fortune favored the brave."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/16/family-life-my-mother-in-law-who-bravely-left-india-something-wonderful-from-the-king-and-i-my-mothers-putsch","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-16T06:45:55Z","webTitle":"Family life: My mother-in-law, who bravely left India; Something Wonderful from The King and I; My mother’s putsch","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/16/family-life-my-mother-in-law-who-bravely-left-india-something-wonderful-from-the-king-and-i-my-mothers-putsch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/16/family-life-my-mother-in-law-who-bravely-left-india-something-wonderful-from-the-king-and-i-my-mothers-putsch","fields":{"headline":"Family life: My mother-in-law, who bravely left India; Something Wonderful from The King and I; My mother’s putsch","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Snapshot: My mother-in-law, who bravely left India This wedding photograph was taken in Bombay in February 1960. My mother-in-law Sumathi (garlanded, front row, third from the right) had met her husband Vamanrao (next to her) just a few days earlier in her home village of Hejmadi, Karnataka. Vamanrao had recently started work as an engineer with Air India in the early days of its operations at Heathrow. Less than two weeks later, Sumathi found herself living in a bedsit in west London. She had never before been further from home than the nearby city of Mangalore. Fifty-seven years later, a mother of four grown-up children, with five grandchildren, she still lives in the London borough of Hounslow. Vamanrao died in 1996. As I gaze at this picture, which sits on a shelf at home, I wonder what can possibly have been in her mind that day in Bombay in 1960, and whether she can have had any inkling of the life that lay ahead of her in London. I have heard her talk over the years of how Vamanrao soon after arrival purchased a motorbike and how she rode side-saddle in her sari. Indian cooking ingredients were hard to find in London in those days, a small shop in Southall the favoured supplier. For an occasional treat with family and friends, the India Club on the Strand, now threatened with closure, was a rare source of near-authentic Indian cuisine. Since I married Sumathi’s eldest daughter, Poornima, in 1988 I have made several trips to India. In 2008, we took our only daughter, Izzy, there for the first time. Sumathi came with us. We visited Hejmadi, saw her family home (long since sold) and the river she used to cross each day to travel to school by small boat. We visited Vamanrao’s nearby village, too. It is just a stone’s throw from the Arabian Sea. His ancestral home, now vacant but still in family hands, has his picture in the communal hall. Every year the extended family of up to 200 people meet to honour their dead with a puja (or prayer service). On the day we visited, the fierce red ants, of which Vamanrao often spoke, swarmed on the baked clay outside the house. The elderly widow of his brother, Rama, who drowned while fishing off the coast, laid out small fish to dry on a patch of sand in front. This picture puts me in mind, too, of my own wedding day and of the intricacies of marrying Liverpool Irish-Catholic expectations with Hindu sensibilities. It reminds me of the shared immigrant experience of both our families, different in time and place. It causes me to reflect on the different worlds brought together in the person of my own daughter, and on her possible future in a newly defined UK and in a still evolving global community. Above all, it makes me grateful for the courage and daring of Sumathi when she embarked on her life-defining adventure in 1960. Nick O’Brien Playlist: My wonderful but not always wise dad Something Wonderful from The King and I “You’ll always go along / Defend him when he’s wrong / And tell him, when he’s strong / He is wonderful.” Let me tell you a bit about my dad. He was a sweet, loving man. He adored us, his three children, and all but worshipped our mother. When she agreed to marry him, after four years of wooing, he felt he had won the grand prize. I can still see him, sitting at the dinner table, reaching for her hand and – right in front of us – gazing into her eyes and saying without the slightest embarrassment: “I love you. I’m so glad I married you.” But it was not all champagne and roses. My dad could never find the right career. His brothers, definitely alpha males, were great achievers and money earners. Not so my dad. He tried many things, but success eluded him. As soon as we were all at school, Mum returned to work and that made a big difference. He was always proud of her. His strong and unfailing love for her sustained her and their marriage. She knew that even if he failed, he always tried his best. When my sister and I first heard the song Something Wonderful, from the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical The King and I, we felt as if the lyricist Oscar Hammerstein knew our parents personally. I recall when we played the song for our mother. She listened in silence, her eyes brimming with tears. “This is a man who thinks with his heart / His heart is not always wise. / This is a man who stumbles and falls, / But this is a man who tries.” To my sister and me, this was our parents’ song. And to this day, whenever we reminisce about our childhood and about our parents, we sing this song as a tribute. Mari Zipes Wallace We love to eat: My mother’s putsch Ingredients Sugar Water Plums, halved Apples, peeled and chopped Pears, peeled and chopped (Spices to your liking) This is not a recipe as such. You put sugar into your pot and a drop of water, then add the halved plums and the peeled, chopped apples and pears and cook them until they are soft. I cook them over a low temperature so that the apples are cooked but not mushy. My mother has just died, nearly six years after my father. It is too late now to ask questions. The people in the photos – we will never know who they are. Maybe her cousin or colleague. The handwriting underneath states the year and place. But that is all. You take everything for granted. You can ask everything tomorrow, until there is no tomorrow left. I was sitting at home looking out of the window and thinking about it all. About autumn and family. And this dish came into my mind. Some people would call it comfort food. But if you have those trees in your garden, it is simply the sum of what you have. My mother did this quite a few times for me. But when my older sister visited and I asked if she wanted putsch, she didn’t know what it was. So it might be something my mother did in my time. My father came up with the name. He is from a place 30km away from where we were living. It is probably slang for compote. His mother may have made something similar. As for the spices, cinnamon is OK, ginger and cardamom are too exotic, vanilla is OK but a bit pricey, orange peel would work out, and anis can’t be used, as Ma hated it. It is best enjoyed on its own or with custard or yoghurt. The trees are not in the garden any more. And we might sell the house. I don’t know, it would break my heart. But the recipe remains and so does the memory. It is not comfort food at all, but in a way it is.

It’s been a blast. Bye! Asmir Begovic talks about Bournemouth’s draw at Palace. Considering he saved a stoppage-time penalty, he seems remarkably downbeat. Obviously a big moment. Thankfully I made a save and helped the team get a point. It was a difficult day. We played well and it would have been a travesty if we hadn’t come away with anything. It was a clean tackle, got the ball, one of those things. I couldn’t care a less who took it. Further adventures in match reportage: And the match reports start rolling in: If you’ve not yet had your fill of footballing livebloggery, Rob Smyth’s your man: No second-half goals, but from the looks of things I missed Real hitting the woodwork a couple of times. The final whistle sounds at Chesterfield. What a conclusion! Meanwhile there have been no goals to tell you about in the second half in Madrid, where it remains 5-0. And finally, I believe that both Randal Smathers and Hubert O’Hearn are both real people. You’ll be telling me Santa doesn’t exist next. Chesterfield have won it! Weir has scored in the 93rd minute to put his side 2-1 up against Barnet, who are about to be left stranded on the bottom of the League Two table! “So Morecambe thrashing the new City of Culture 2-0 isn’t one of the ‘League Two Megamatches’?!” sniffs Bruce Jackson. Sorry. That, surely, is the game of the day. Controversial refereeing decisions, glorious goals, terrible misses, it’s had the lot. And it ends in a draw. In the fifth of four minutes of stoppage time Watford win a free kick. Everyone goes forward. Gomes is in the penalty area. Holebas takes it – and he overhits it straight into the palms of Pope! And that’s it! Milivojevic took their first penalty, and scored with aplomb. Benteke though takes their second, and his effort is low, soft and nowhere near the corner, and Begovic saves! Spot-kick machine Wilfried Zaha has won yet another spot-kick, and a brilliant chance to win this game! Those are important points for Huddersfield, and it was all too easy from Brighton’s perspective. Well, Stoke didn’t lose 4-0. So that’s something. Son played brilliantly, Stoke defended hopelessly (and on occasion unluckily) and Spurs romp to a comfortable victory. I take my eye off Burnley v Watford for a moment, and something has caused Marco Silva to get so excited the referee has to come over to calm him down. Presumably he thought Burnley should have had a man sent off, in the process of conceding a free kick on their right flank. They didn’t, though, but Holebas sends in a lovely free kick that could have been converted (but wasn’t). At some point there have been equalisers in both the League Two megamatches, so it’s now Luton 1-1 Notts County, and also Chesterfield 1-1 Barnet. “As a Canadian expat (17 years of married bliss &amp; counting) I have news for Hubert O’Hearn,” writes Randal Smathers. “Once people hear you’re Canadian all they’ll want to do is have dull and endless conversations about the sizes of snowfalls. And ice hockey. And how freaking nice Canadians are, so you might need to adjust your expectations.” Another goal from a corner! The ball comes in from the left, hits someone in the head at the far post, hits Nyom in the shin, drops invitingly into open space inside the penalty area and Bony reacts first, runs onto it and lashes it home. Hard. The comeback starts here! A corner from the left, and Lloris hares off his line to collect it but gets nowhere near, and all Shawcross has to do is get his header on target. Which he does. “That was a good decision,” writes Roy Allen of Burnley’s latest disallowed goal. “Barnes was marginally offside when the pass was played. The pass deflected off defenders but the initial offside is what mattered.” Some team news from the Premier League’s late game: Newcastle: Darlow, Yedlin, Lejeune, Clark, Manquillo, Hayden, Merino, Ritchie, Murphy, Joselu, Gayle. Subs: Elliot, Lascelles, Shelvey, Diame, Perez, Atsu, Mitrovic. Leicester: Schmeichel, Simpson, Morgan, Maguire, Chilwell, Mahrez, Ndidi, Iborra, Albrighton, Gray, Vardy. Subs: Iheanacho, King, Hamer, Dragovic, Okazaki, Ulloa, Fuchs. Referee: Neil Swarbrick. Well it won’t finish 4-0 this time. Son picks the ball up well inside his own half; Eriksen runs ahead of him and holds the line of the last defender, but some way away from him and all on his own. Both run another 30 yards towards the Stoke goal and then Son plays a perfect, if not exactly difficult, defence-splitting pass and the Dane does the rest. Burnley have had another goal disallowed. Ashley Barnes has put the ball in the net, but the flag is up. There’s some confusion, though, as the referee goes to talk to his assistant, but after a pause, he confirms there will be no goal. It’s not really clear why. At Turf Moor Carillo runs into the penalty area, takes on Tarkowski and goes down. It looked to me like the defender might have stood on a toe there, but then again maybe he didn’t. Hard to tell. Watford want a penalty, but the referee gives a goal kick. A great chance for Burnley to score a second, as a cross from the right reaches the far post, but when Long sticks out a leg to turn it in it hits his shin and flies high. “I emigrated from Canada to the UK five years less three days ago,” writes Hubert O’Hearn. “Know why I moved? I got really tired of dull and endless conversations about the sizes of snowfalls. And don’t get me started on ice hockey.” The last three matches between Stoke and Spurs have finished 4-0 to Tottenham, and they’ve done it again! They attack down the right, a lovely curling cross is touched into Kane’s path by Son – lovely awareness there – and from the edge of the area the Englishman scores with a fine low shot. Burnley have had the ball in the Watford net again, but it’s disallowed for offside. I think Cork, who had the shot, wasn’t offside but that Wood then tapped it in from the goal-line, and he was. Though of course the linesman might have just given Cork offside. “Obviously Arfield would be the one to score in the snow, seeing as he’s Canadian,” notes Kevin Smith. “Although I agree with Mike about your definition of blizzard. Can you see across the field? Not a blizzard.” OK, I give up. It’s not a blizzard. It’s just common-or-garden snowfall, of a medium-heavy variety. Hull have equalised against Brentford, Kamil Grosicki scoring what by all accounts is a bit of a cracker. This all starts with Butland being caught in possession by Kane. That leads to a corner, which is half-cleared, worked back to the left and the resulting long, high cross drops on the forehead of Kane at the far post, and he heads low into goal! Son, who has by all accounts played splendidly, sprints down the inside left channel and no defender spots him. Dele Alli does, though, plays him clean through and Son takes a touch and shoots low inside the near post. “Haven’t seen the Zeegalaar replay but of course everyone knows (right, UK fans?) that you don’t actually have to make contact to be sent off,” notes Rick McGahey. “A dangerous studs-up challenge, an attempted kick or punch, etc fit the definition for a red card. And refs have a necessary penumbra (hey, it’s the Guardian!) of discretion so another ref might only have cautioned there, but both of the decisions would be correct within the laws of the game.” I think you’re precisely right, though I don’t know what a penumbra is. Minor Championship update: It’s still 0-0 between Wolves and Sunderland. Hull, meanwhile, are a goal down at home to Brentford, David Meyler scoring a 47th-minute own goal. “By Montreal standards the image of the snow in Burnley barely makes it up to what one might expect in a snow globe paper weight on sale in a tourist show or at a grand mother’s house,” sniffs Bill Bukowski. There’s no let-up here: the 3 o’clock kick-offs have kicked back off again. Sevilla are going to struggle to come back from this now. I’ve seen another replay of the Zeegelaar challenge. He does fly in, he probably isn’t in control, but it’s one-footed and there’s pretty much no actual contact with Defour. I appear to have missed a goal in Madrid. Kroos scores a fourth, though, carrying the ball forward from the halfway line, playing it to his right, taking it back again and hitting a low, first-time shot from 16 yards. Some photographic evidence of snowfall: The replay was inconclusive. It certainly wasn’t a fantastic tackle, and Defour’s reaction was certainly exaggerated. It could have gone either way, but I’d be surprised if they appeal. That’s a wondergoal from Jermain Defoe! A long ball is pumped forwards, Defoe runs onto it, it bounces over his shoulder and as it drops, from an acute angle out to the right of goal, he volleys it over the keeper and in! Scott Dann certainly likes playing Bournemouth. Watford won’t be happy about that. Like last week, they might have had a penalty for a foul on Richarlison, get nothing from the referee and their opponents run up the other end and score! Arfield receives a low pass from the right and scores with a fine finish. Palace take the lead! It’s another corner from the right, which isn’t properly cleared, is eventually re-centred and Dann thumps in at the far post! A long cross from the left is headed back onto the middle of the area, and Mounie’s header should have been easily saved but the goalkeeper flops slowly down, the ball bounces beneath him and Huddersfield go two up! That’s the equaliser for Palace, Milivojevic crashing the ball into the top right corner! Crystal Palace have a penalty! Zaha goes past Ake too easily and goes down over Begovic’s challenge, also too easily, and the referee points to the spot. Not a lot in that, I think. Zeegelaar flies in on Defour, who rolls around dramatically, and Lee Probert’s card is out instantly! Real take control! Ronaldo is played through on the right of the area and his first touch is lovely, he opens up his body and then shoots right-footed, low inside the near post! Incredible miss! Harry Kane is clean through on goal, the keeper comes out, Kane prods it past him … and past the post! “I’m watching Burnley &amp; Watford intermittently while focusing on Huddersfield &amp; BHA,” writes Mike MacKenzie. “I’d call it snow flurries by Canadian standards.” Yeah, but a blizzard by Canadian standards involves actual polar bears and stuff. I think the lad’s overdecorated a little here. “After 25 minutes I think we’re looking at the worst game of the season at Swansea,” writes JR. “It is absolutely wretched. Both teams are shocking. It’s so bad that it’s good, though. Really remarkable. Seriously, you should be watching this before it gets any better. It sure couldn’t get worse.” You sell it so well, but I’m a bit busy at the moment. There’s a blizzard at Burnley, where the snow is falling in great big fluffy clumps. I can’t find any photographs to prove it yet, for some reason, but I’ll keep an eye out. Still no goals, mind. Meanwhile at Wembley, Butland makes a decent save from Eriksen’s free kick. And now a first goal in the League Two top-of-the-table enormogame: John Mullins has put Luton 1-0 up against Notts County. Sakho, whose injury stopped him pushing up with the rest of the Palace defence and thus allowed Defoe to skip through without being offside, is unable to continue. Scott Dann comes on. Chance for Bournemouth! Defoe is played in on the left side of the penalty area, but instead of shifting the ball onto his right foot and smashing it goalwards he keeps carrying it forward, giving the defence time to catch up and snaffle the ball. That is the toughest of luck. Son crosses from the left and the ball flies up off Zouma’s boot, smacks Shawcross in the face and flies in! And another chance at Turf Moor, this to the home side, who are right on top at the moment. They win a free kick, 25 yards out, and Defour’s low shot is heading towards the corner of goal until Gomes sticks out a hand to save. Another corner from the right, and another goal! This one flies to the back post, where there are two defenders and no attackers. Sadly defender one jumps into the line of defender two’s vision, misses it, it hits defender two on the shoulder, goes back towards goal, and Nacho chests it down and smashes it in! The first big goal in a big game in League Two, and Barnet have taken the lead at Chesterfield. John Akinde is the scorer. Another corner, and another goal! This one is swung in from the right, flicked on at the near post and Mounie runs in all alone at the back stick to tummy it in! And Bournemouth go down the other end and take the lead! A low corner is played back to the taker, sent in low again, only harder and a few yards further back, and Defoe tucks it away from the penalty spot! Andros Townsend goes on a nice run down the right for Palace, and Daniels takes him out unceremoniously. That surely should have been a booking, but the referee keeps his book in his pocket. What a chance for Watford! Carillo crosses from the right and Richarlison meets it at the near post. He stretches out his left leg and needs only to turn the ball towards goal and surely the away side would take the lead, but if anything he hits it too well Jeff, and the ball flies over the bar. Our own Paul Doyle is at Villa Park, and it sounds like he’s having fun: Watford have the first top-flight chance, but their cunning corner-kick routine ends with Troy Deeney heading wide. BONG! It’s 3pm, and they’re off! Teams are emerging from dressing rooms. Action is but a few minutes away. “Hi Simon,” writes Woolie Madden. Hello! “Could you provide team sheets for Litherland REMYCA Reserves v Poulton Royal, and tomorrow’s game between SAI-Kolkata U18 v Mohammedan U18? Cheers.” Um, no. But since you mention Litherland REMYCA, let’s enjoy some more excellent footage of snowy football pitches – their match against Whitchurch Alport is unsurprisingly off. Here’s some evidence of snowfall: Quite the start to our Premier League weekend: the final whistle blows at West Ham, and Chelsea have been beaten 1-0! Paul Clement, who makes four changes for the visit of West Brom today, has a pre-match chat: Clearly after the game last weekend it wasn’t particularly good, but we’ve had apositive week’s training. The players have worked in a good manner, focused, concentrated, and that can give you belief and confidence going into a game. We’re trying to find that thing that just clicks. I’ve freshened it up a little bit. The players coming in, they’re fresh, they’re motivated, they want to help the team. We need to start well, give the fans something to cheer about, and I’m sure they’ll follow us from there. Here’s the team news from all five Premier League games. If you’d like any other team news, do drop me a line. Burnley v Watford Burnley: Pope, Bardsley, Tarkowski, Long, Ward, Arfield, Cork, Hendrick, Defour, Gudmundsson, Wood.

Here’s a man who knows how to make himself popular: So another Saturday dawns, and it’s packed with potential. There are five 3 o’clock kick-offs in the Premier League, plus some Spanish interest as the game between Real Madrid and Sevilla, tied on 28 points in La Liga and with third place (at least until Atlético play tomorrow) the reward for whoever wins, gets under way at 3.15pm. As an added bonus there are two absolutely massive matches in League Two, where the teams separated only by goal difference at the top, and the sides similarly divided at the bottom, play each other. Weather news: it’s a bit chilly in England at the minute, and two referees have decided that it’s far too cold to play football – news of the postponements, and indeed details of every fixture in the English leagues, follows. For now, though, hello, welcome, let’s have some fun! Burnley v Watford Crystal Palace v Bournemouth Huddersfield v Brighton Swansea v West Brom Tottenham Hotspur v Stoke Championship A weekend without any more significant top-of-the-table clashes but there is a top-against-bottom encounter as Sunderland, ahead of Burton on goal difference, travel to Wolves. Second-placed Cardiff play against Reading on Monday and Bristol City, in third, beat Sheffield United, in fourth, last night. Both Aston Villa or Derby could go fourth today, though not at the same time. Meanwhile Nigel Adkins makes his debut in the Hull dugout, at home to Brentford. Aston Villa v Millwall Barnsley v Derby Burton Albion v Preston North End Fulham v Birmingham Hull v Brentford Middlesbrough v Ipswich Norwich v Sheff Wed (5.30) Nottm Forest v Bolton QPR v Leeds Wolverhampton v Sunderland League One There is already a six-point cushion between the play-offs and the teams chasing them, and it could increase today if Peterborough, in seventh, and Portsmouth, in eighth, falter against Blackburn (fourth) and Charlton (sixth). Meanwhile six of the bottom seven play each other: Plymouth could conceivably leapfrog Gillingham if – and it’s a long shot, but still – they win by four goals at Home Park. Blackpool v Rotherham Bradford v Rochdale Bristol Rovers v Southend Bury v AFC Wimbledon POSTPONED Charlton v Portsmouth Milton Keynes Dons v Shrewsbury Oldham v Northampton Oxford Utd v Doncaster Peterborough v Blackburn Plymouth v Gillingham Walsall v Scunthorpe Wigan v Fleetwood Town Sky Bet League Two Now this is where the action is. The outstanding game of the Football League weekend takes place at Kenilworth Road, where first-placed Luton host second-placed (on goal difference) Notts County. And there’s a six-pointer at the bottom as well, with 24th-placed Chesterfield hosting 23rd-placed (on goal difference) Barnet. The other games might very well be extremely exciting, but they can’t really match those two for significance, particularly with third-placed Accrington Stanley’s game against Swindon postponed because of a frozen pitch.

A safety advisory group, comprising representatives from Albion, Sussex police, other emergency services, transport providers and other partners had sought a lunchtime kick-off, only for planned engineering works on the Brighton mainline to prompt them to opt for Monday evening. Although that has allowed BT Sport to televise the game, Palace have insisted they could have provided their fans with free coach travel to negate the impact of the rail issues. The south London club expressed concerns upon the publication of the Premier League fixtures over the plan to play the clubs’ first derby in more than four years on a Tuesday night. There were flashpoints outside the Amex Stadium last week as away supporters – some, according to Brighton and Sussex police, without tickets – attempted to gain entry, causing the gates to be closed with up to 300 fans locked out and eventually marched back to Falmer station and on to trains to London. “We’re surprised and disappointed that our FA Cup match against Brighton has been scheduled for a Monday evening,” said Palace in a statement on Friday. “We raised concerns about playing the league match between the two clubs at night, as there have been previous issues when we played evening games in the Championship, but felt we were presented with a no-option scenario. Given the events that occurred, we assumed that this time what we considered to be good sense would prevail and the game would be scheduled as an early daytime kick-off. “We are also disappointed that our ticket allocation for the FA Cup match has again been restricted to 2,000 when we should be entitled to more than 4,600 tickets under normal FA Cup rules. We completely understand the security concerns around this match and the safety of all supporters must be paramount. It’s for that very reason that we felt the best and most obvious solution, as is the case with most other big, highly charged derby games, would have been a lunchtime kick-off, combined with a bigger ticket allocation to cater for the overwhelming demand from our supporters, many of whom will again be left disappointed. “We were told that the incidents which took place at last month’s league match were caused, in part, by fans with tickets colluding with un-ticketed fans to force entry into the stadium. While we understand there are issues with trains on the Sunday of the FA Cup third-round weekend we have offered to provide free coaches to negate this issue, also allowing supporters to be dropped and picked up from designated drop-off and pick-up points. “We strongly believe that the very small minority who misbehave and create disorder should be punished to the full extent of the law, thereby deterring others. Instead, it’s our view that the many decent and law-abiding supporters are being punished by being deprived of the opportunity to enjoy supporting their team.” Sussex police, who apologised on Thursday for initially suggesting away fans had attempted to enter the ground with “knives and knuckledusters”, were the subject of a second Freedom of Information request from the Palace fanzine Five Year Plan on Friday as the group seek to ascertain whether ticketless supporters had, indeed, attempted to gain entry into the stadium at last week’s fixture. The police referred back to its meetings with the safety advisory group “that guides such decisions throughout the season” when determining the kick-off time. “The preference for this fixture was a lunchtime kick-off over the weekend, but planned rail engineering works on the Brighton mainline would affect travel and prevent Palace fans from taking advantage of the special train service, which worked well before and helps with the smooth access and egress of supporters to and from the stadium,” said a spokesman. “With regard to the ticket allocation, this again was a decision made with the support of the safety advisory group. The timing of the match has created an opportunity for TV coverage, which means fans unable to obtain tickets will be still be able to see the game live on television. We are now working with everyone involved to focus on a safe and enjoyable match for everybody attending.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/08/the-antidote-to-brexit-a-santa-with-a-real-beard","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T19:05:10Z","webTitle":"The antidote to Brexit: a Santa with a real beard | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/08/the-antidote-to-brexit-a-santa-with-a-real-beard","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/08/the-antidote-to-brexit-a-santa-with-a-real-beard","fields":{"headline":"The antidote to Brexit: a Santa with a real beard","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Does Dawn Foster (May’s Brexit blinkers are preventing her seeing anything else, 7 December) really believe that this government would be implementing the kind of policies needed to reduce poverty and inequality if it weren’t for its preoccupation with Brexit?

This year it is on behalf of charities that support destitute people who are seeking asylum, and the young homeless. The reasons for their plight are often complex but the headline explanation is simple: social housing is scarce and getting scarcer; rents in the private sector are rising; and housing benefit is falling. On Friday the specialist journal Inside Housing published research that showed a new and significant factor behind the sharp rise in the numbers relying on emergency support. The right to buy, first introduced in 1980, already abandoned in Scotland and soon in Wales, was successfully reinvigorated in England by David Cameron five years ago. It has been a boon to the buy-to-let market and a curse on councils that find themselves renting them back at hugely inflated cost. Soaring house values have turned what should be a place to live into a golden asset. Former council properties have been snapped up by private landlords. In the most prosperous areas, up to 70% of former council homes are now privately let. Private rents out of London average over £200 a week while council rents are nearer £90 a week. Councils in England have been sending up emergency flares for more than a year, trying to alert the government to their inability to build enough new homes to replace the ones they have been forced to sell, with predictable consequences. In the last five years, since right-to-buy discounts were nearly doubled, 54,581 homes were sold and only 12,472 homes were started. Some are built in one authority from receipts of sales in another, compounding local shortages. Councils have to use part of the receipts from sales to pay off housing debt, and can only keep a third for replacement. They are still banned from borrowing to make up the full cost of buying or building new ones. Between now and 2020, councils also face having to sell off higher-value council homes in order to fund discounts on housing association homes that are due to come in under right-to-buy provisions. Like so much else that has happened since 2010, social housing policy has not just been damaging but contradictory, fostering the chimera of a property-owning democracy in an age of shrinking social housing stock and rapidly growing demand. The government makes bold promises on new affordable homes to buy. But what’s needed is homes that people can afford to rent."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/10/mince-pies-taste-test-seasonal-sensation-or-festive-flop","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T14:00:02Z","webTitle":"Mince pies taste test: seasonal sensation or festive flop?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/10/mince-pies-taste-test-seasonal-sensation-or-festive-flop","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/10/mince-pies-taste-test-seasonal-sensation-or-festive-flop","fields":{"headline":"Mince pies taste test: seasonal sensation or festive flop?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"There is a Premier Foods factory in Barnsley that, in the runup to Christmas, fires out 2.3m mince pies a day. That’s 180m each season. A staggering figure, yet it accounts for less than half of the 370m mince pies sold in the UK each year. These days unrecognisable from its medieval origins as a spiced ox tongue and beef suet pastry, the mince pie, clearly, still occupies a very special place in Britain’s affections. This, despite 17th-century Puritan purges (mince pies were condemned as a sign of Catholic gluttony), and the old, mass-produced supermarket versions, which for decades – their shrunken fillings a chaos of sugar, dank fruits and shrill spices – threatened to do what Cromwell failed to, and destroy our love of mince pies for ever. Chef Jeremy Lee told the Independent in 2011 that commercial mince pies are “generally unspeakable”. There has been a marked improvement in many supermarket foods in recent years. Have mince pies – a product that most people buy in, in a time-versus-taste trade-off – kept pace? Do any of the own-brands or exclusive supermarket lines come close to the best homemade mince pies (a notional 10/10 for this test)? When the blurb says plump fruits and deep-filled, does it mean it? Or are the supermarkets still skimping on fillings and using cheap spices? You will note that the most shocking statistic about mince pies is that, after that initial buying frenzy, we throw 74m of them away each Christmas. All of the pies were tested warm; each box contained six Ocado Daylesford organic mince pies 300g, £7.99 You check the price. You check it again. You sit down to absorb the shock, phone a friend to share the news, and, finally, take a bite expecting choirs of angels. What you get is unusually soft, unsalted butter pastry around a loose filling that, for all its articulated ginger, apple and citrus flavours, lacks intoxicating spice or depth. Overly earnest, and ultimately dull. Verdict: Christmas turkey 4/10 Co-op Irresistible mince pies 396g, £2 A 1cm “air gap” (the space between the lid and the filling; which can be as little as 3mm) tells you everything about these apologetic pies. The uneven pastry-to-filling ratio means the mincemeat struggles to assert itself over the buttery, but somewhat claggy pastry and, but for its faintly boozy port and brandy edge, it has little charisma. It is tediously sweet and sharp, thick with apple puree and vine fruits. Verdict: Ho ho hum 4/10 Waitrose All butter mince pies 365g, £2.50 That “air gap” and shortcrust cases make mince pies incredibly fragile. They frequently implode at first bite. However, Waitrose’s shortbready pastry is unusually resilient. In concert with the pies’ thick filling, it produces an authentically rich and (mimicking the historic use of suet) almost gluey mouthful. The mincemeat is too sweet, but nuts and citrus keep it sassy. Verdict: Christmas cheer 6/10 Marks &amp; Spencer The Collection mince pies 323g, £2.50 A touch of class from M&amp;S, these stout pucks (2cm deep but full to their brims) contain the first filling that, rather than a mush, is mined with plump, vibrant fruits, including prized, EU-protected Greek Vostizza currants. The balance of spices and citrus is well-judged, the brandy adding depth rather than acrid alcohol, and all this is housed in crisp, yielding pastry. Verdict: Seasons eatings! 7.5/10 Asda Extra Special luxury all butter mince pies 420g, £1.85 Like a Victorian London gentleman’s club, these pies are suffused in a dark, thick fug of booze and baked fruit. Sharp interruptions of citrus are like the barked orders of some colonial colonel. The pie’s port and brandy maceration aside, its unnecessarily sugar-topped, buttery pastry collapses at first contact. In part because, yet again, these pies have a 1cm “air gap”. Verdict: Dickensian Christmas 4/10 Tesco Finest* mince pies 390g, £2 Hot out of the oven, these pies fall apart as readily as NHS funding promises printed on the side of a bus. The pastry’s buttery flavour, however, is fine, and these pies are a pleasure. The mincement delivers clearly differentiated, structured flavours: apple puree, sultanas, lemon zest, hints of cognac and tiny walnut shrapnel. Despite the sprinkled sugar on top, they are not excessively sweet, either. Verdict: Christmas crackers 8/10 Morrisons The Best all butter mince pies 360g, £2 In terms of sugar-per-100g, there were sweeter pies in this test, but with more sugar dusted on top, the sludgy, jammy filling and an emphasis on saccharine vine fruits, these pies taste outrageously sweet. A little citrus peel but only peripheral evidence of spicing creates a flavour closer to Christmas cake than mince pies. The pastry is dry, too. Verdict: Christmas is cancelled 4/10 Aldi Specially Selected Mince Pies 390g, £1.49 Every Christmas, there is always one guest who hits the booze too hard and leaves a trail of misery in their wake. Infused with Aldi’s “award winning” cognac, these pies are most notable for some very harsh, almost cough medicine-like aromas and flavours, which jar with equally inelegant bursts of citrus. The filling is an otherwise blandly sticky mush. The thick, sugary pastry is also poor. Verdict: Less Christmas, more Halloween 2/10 Sainsbury’s All butter mince pies 370g, £2 While others include the requisite ingredients (palm oil, rice flour, sunflower oil), Sainsbury’s is the rare mince pie that announces its use of vegetable suet. And that is, pretty much, the most interesting thing about them. The crumbly pastry has a strong buttery flavour, but the boring filling – heavy on the apple puree and vine fruits – needs more in the way of zest and spice to leaven its relentless sweetness.

However, some places, including eastern Australia, will see winds pick up. The research is the first global study to project the impact of temperature rises on wind energy and found big changes by the end of the century in many of the places hosting large numbers of turbines. Wind farms have grown more than fivefold in the last decade and plunging costs have made them a key way of reducing carbon emissions from fossil fuel burning. But in the central US, for example, the power of the wind could fall by nearly a fifth. “We found some substantial changes in wind energy,” said Kristopher Karnauskas at the University of Colorado Boulder, US. “But it does not mean we should not invest in wind power.” It does mean such changes need to be taken into account in planning future wind farms, he said, and also in assessing how much wind farms overall can cut global emissions. The research, published in the journal Nature Geoscience, used the same climate models and projected future emissions as the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Losses of wind energy stretched from the central US to the UK, Russia and Japan for both medium and high emissions scenarios. If emissions remain high in the future, wind energy increases were also seen a smaller number of regions. The biggest fall was in Japan, where wind farm building is just beginning to accelerate, with wind energy projected to fall by 58kW, or about 10%. The central US was second with 49kW but because the average current winds are generally weaker than in Japan, this represents a larger 17% drop. The UK is anticipated to fall by 36kW, or 5%. However, the wind energy in eastern Australia would jump if there is strong global warming in future. “That is the biggest increase on the whole map,” said Karnauskas. Here, wind energy would rise by 48kW, or 23%. Eastern Brazil and west Africa would also see big rises, 35% and 40% respectively. The reason these coastal areas would see increased wind energy is that the world’s land is warming faster than the ocean and that difference is the energy source for those winds. “The more it warms, ironically, the more it increases the wind power there,” said Karnauskas. In the northern mid-latitudes, however, the major driver of wind is the temperature difference between the Arctic and the tropics, and the Arctic is warming very rapidly, reducing that difference. The scientists had to convert the wind speeds predicted by the climate models into wind energy, because temperature, pressure and humidity all affect the power of the wind. “More dense air is going to blow harder on a wind turbine,” said Karnauskas. Prof Brian Hoskins, at Imperial College London, UK, and not involved in the study, said: “It is important to try to estimate how climate change is likely to influence all our activities. This is a good example.” The new study analysed average monthly wind over broad areas and Hoskins said smaller scale changes could be more important for particular wind farms. Dave MacLeod, at the University of Oxford, said other higher resolution work had found different results in the US. Karnauskas acknowledges the uncertainties and said the work provides a starting point for more focused work: “It points to places that need detailed studies. Until now, we were really missing a consistent global view of the issue.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/10/katie-molly-summerhayes-uk-winter-olympics-sisters-slopestyle","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T08:00:31Z","webTitle":"Katie Summerhayes: ‘It can be dangerous racing Molly down a mountain’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/10/katie-molly-summerhayes-uk-winter-olympics-sisters-slopestyle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/10/katie-molly-summerhayes-uk-winter-olympics-sisters-slopestyle","fields":{"headline":"Katie Summerhayes: ‘It can be dangerous racing Molly down a mountain’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"One sister is a bona fide medal contender, feted and funded by UK Sport and with sponsorship deals coming out of her ears. The other gets no lottery money at all and works full-time at McDonald’s while chasing her sporting dream. Yet if all goes to plan, Katie Summerhayes and her sister Molly will make history in 60 days’ time when they become only the fourth set of sisters to represent Great Britain at the same Winter Olympics. The 22-year-old Katie reinforced her impeccable credentials for Pyeongchang by finishing second in a major World Cup event in Stubai, Austria, last month. She specialises in slopestyle, which involves skiing off jumps, rails and on half-pipes and performing as many tricks as possible. Four years ago she finished seventh at the Sochi games, despite having recently recovered from a serious knee injury, and the British team are quietly confident she can make the podium this time round. But her younger sister Molly, 20, has a very different story. She has to combine her time flipping on the half-pipe with flipping burgers on a zero-hours contract to help her fund trips to competitions that will determine whether she makes it to the Games. “I couldn’t ask for a better job,” Molly insists. “If I ever need time off I can have it, if there is a shift I need to be covered for, they help. Sometimes I will be away for a while to train or compete, like when I went to New Zealand for a month, and there will be new faces when I come back. They will be like: ‘How long have you been here?’ and I’ll say two years. And then they will usually reply: ‘Where have you been?!’ “Most of my colleagues think what I do is amazing,” she adds. “But not everyone understands. I was sat having my break with another lad and when I told him I was going to New Zealand to ski he said: ‘Oh really. Wouldn’t you just like to go to Amsterdam with your mates for three days?’” Katie has long been recognised as a rare talent. In February 2013 she became the first British skier to win a medal in a World Cup event in 19 years when she finished second in slopestyle competition in Silvaplana when she was just 17. But Molly is no slouch on the slopes either. She was good enough to be crowned world junior freestyle ski half-pipe champion in 2015, but having had to spend nearly a year in rehab after rupturing a ligament in her right knee in January 2016, she is not yet considered good enough for lottery funding. It means that despite the money she makes from her job, and a grant from SportsAid, she has to rely on her parents to help fund the yearly cost of getting to competitions and training, which she estimates comes in “at a minimum £15,000”. “A lot of the time it is my mum and dad forking out to help me, which I do feel quite bad about,” she admits. She has tried other ways to raise money, including a crowdfunding campaign. So far, however, it has raised only £595. But while Molly is grafting away at work, Katie can rest up and recover when she is not training. “I always tell her she just needs to do a week’s work to see how hard it is,” says Molly. Katie, who is sitting alongside her, admits she has never had a proper job. “Molly always takes the mick out of me for not working, but I have been very lucky that I can focus on what I do,” she adds. Yet despite their very different roads to Pyeongchang, the prospect of the Summerhayes’s becoming the first set of sisters to represent Britain in the same Winter Games since the curlers Katie and Edith Loudon in Nagano in 1998 is an increasingly live one. (Sheena and Vora Mackintosh were the first in 1948 and 1952, while Serena and Valentina Iliffe did so in 1976, all in Alpine skiing.) Katie is a shoo-in, while Molly – who has finished 17th and 22nd in the first two events this season – has to stay in the top 24 in the overall standings in the next two competitions to make it. If they were to succeed, it would be the culmination of 16 years in the sport, which began when their father – who could see the dry slope from his workplace canteen – took them for a lesson at the Sheffield Ski Village when they were six and four. As Katie puts it: “Pretty soon we were obsessed, so they learned too. Our mum and dad had to drag us off the slope at 11pm on a Friday night.” The pair, who still live with their parents, constantly tried to get one over each other on the slopes. In truth, not much has changed in the intervening years. “Whether it is racing or moguls we have always tried to beat each other,” admits Katie. “Even now we try to do so on silly things. It can be a bit dangerous because we can be on a day off, just on the mountain, and then we are trying to race down, back and forth.” Molly, smiling, adds: “She has always been better than me and I have known it but we still try to outdo each other every time.” The arguments happen off the slopes too. “It’s every day,” concedes Katie. “We fell out yesterday. We had to leave Sheffield at 5am and we just couldn’t fit all our stuff in Molly’s car, a Peugeot 107. We tried to have a silent argument outside the house and it didn’t go down well with Mum and Dad. But we always make up and move on and we spend every day together.” Katie says nothing would make her prouder than to see Molly, who watched with her parents in Sochi, joining her for the full 360-degree panoramic Olympic experience. “It would be so cool,” she says. And with that both sisters break into massive smiles."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/08/swansea-city-west-bromwich-albion-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T16:49:28Z","webTitle":"Swansea City v West Bromwich Albion: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/08/swansea-city-west-bromwich-albion-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/08/swansea-city-west-bromwich-albion-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Swansea City v West Bromwich Albion: match preview","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Having gone bottom of the table Paul Clement will be desperate for a result against a West Brom side that have already pulled the trigger on their under-fire manager Tony Pulis.

Conservative figures who campaigned to remain during the EU referendum said the prime minister’s commitment to a soft Irish border was the “nail in the hard-Brexit coffin”. Meanwhile, Tory Brexiters insisted that the deal simply allowed the battle over the eventual trade relationship to commence, with some of them arguing that the UK should opt for the hardest break – the adoption of World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. The comments came as sources suggested that key cabinet figures would soon meet for their first formal discussion over what the government should be aiming for at the end of Brexit discussions, after the chancellor, Philip Hammond, revealed that the conversation was yet to be had. Sources said May would update her cabinet on Monday about the latest breakthrough, but admitted a wider meeting would be held within a fortnight. That could pitch the demands of Boris Johnson and Michael Gove – who could be wary of too much regulatory alignment with the EU – against remainers such as Hammond and the home secretary, Amber Rudd. May has another potential Brexit headache in the Commons next week. She is facing the possibility of the first defeat of the EU withdrawal bill, as Tory MPs prepare to swing behind the former attorney general, Dominic Grieve, who is calling for MPs to have a binding vote on the final Brexit deal before ministers can formally enact Britain’s departure from the EU. A compromise motion expected on Friday was not laid by ministers by the 3pm deadline. However, the prime minister has goodwill within the party after her early hours trip to Brussels to secure an agreement on the divorce talks, with Tory politicians saying that praise was being poured on her via WhatsApp channels. Anna Soubry, who was a passionate remainer and wants the UK to remain as close as possible to the EU, said: “This is an important moment because it is a move in the right direction to a much more sensible, softer Brexit.” She said it was not about the words that were used, but about Britain replicating the “benefits of the customs union and single market” to support British business. She argued that a bespoke trade deal would be difficult to achieve, with the final outcome likely to be closer to either the European Free Trade Association (Efta), of which Norway and Switzerland are a part, or crashing out on WTO rules. She claimed that May’s promises to the EU made the former more likely now. Former Tory MP Ben Howlett, who is vice-chair of the Conservative Europe Group, said he was pleased the prime minister had secured progress towards trade talks. “It’s a nail in the hard-Brexit coffin that some were hoping for earlier in the week,” he said. Next week, remainers on the Tory backbenches could try to improve their position in the battle over amendment 7, laid by Grieve. It would prevent the government from using so-called Henry VIII powers to implement the EU withdrawal bill without parliament’s approval through a binding vote. The MP said he was hopeful that the government would offer some compromise to prevent a rebellion, but insisted he was prepared to push the issue if necessary. “The government has conceded the principle that there must be a statute approving and implementing the withdrawal agreement before we leave the EU. Amendment 7 guarantees that will happen,” Grieve told the Guardian. Meanwhile, Friday’s outcome was also welcomed by Brexiters – who see the next stage of discussions as key to the battle of securing their preferred form of Brexit. Gove and Johnson led Brexit supporters in congratulating the prime minister. The environment secretary said the prime minister had won and hailed it as a “significant personal achievement”, as he toured the broadcasters in support of the deal. Johnson said the aim was now to forge a deep relationship while “taking back control of our laws, money and borders for the whole of the UK”. However, there was a lukewarm response from some MPs on their side of the argument, who expressed their reservations but also noted that “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed”. Owen Paterson, a Conservative former cabinet minister and member of the Leave Means Leave group, said it was a big improvement on the earlier text, but there were “still problematic areas including clause 49 [on full alignment], the role of the European court of justice and money”. John Redwood, another former cabinet minister, welcomed the fact that the EU had agreed to talk about trade, but added: “Everyone needs to remember that today’s agreement is not the agreement on the UK leaving the EU. It is an agreement to talk about all matters, and is still governed by the crucial principle that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.” Other Conservative voices stressed that the majority took a view that was in between the two flanks of the party. MP James Cartlidge said that Friday was a massive victory for the prime minister, after a tough week in which there had even been revelations about an alleged terror plot aimed at her and the difficulties with the Democratic Unionist party. “To get a breakthrough in early hours is commendable,” he said. “There are many people in the Conservative parliamentary party who are moderate on the issue of Europe and have not expressed anything publicly – but the reason is that they support the prime minister’s approach.” He argued that the best outcome would be a bespoke trade deal. However, Cartlidge has argued that a fall-back could be the Efta model, suggesting there could be space to have some immigration changes within such a deal. “The best deal is not Efta or anything else. The best approach is a bespoke arrangement. But if there is no deal, and we are facing WTO rules, then Efta should be plan B. But plan A is back on track and we have to get behind the prime minister. I think there is a chance now to get a real sense of momentum, and achieve a deal that suits both sides,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/13/if-i-seek-help-the-police-might-deport-me-if-i-dont-he-might-kill-me","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T11:00:00Z","webTitle":"'If I seek help, the police might deport me.

If I don’t, he might kill me'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"For as long as she’d lived in the United States, Maria was in hiding. She was hiding from immigration officials, because she was undocumented. And she was hiding from the father of her children, a drug-addled, cruel career criminal she’d left Mexico to escape. “If I seek for help they might deport me,” she said, “but if I don’t he might kill me.” Like so many other undocumented women in the US, Maria – who asked that a pseudonym be used in this story – would eventually have to choose between these two dangers. Many women fleeing across borders from abusive partners are having to make that same deadly calculation. “Domestic violence is one of the main motivations for women fleeing Central America,” Amarela Varela, a migration and gender scholar at the Autonomous University of Mexico City, told the Guardian earlier this year. Yet at the same time, once they reach the US, undocumented women are uniquely at risk. After the Trump administration issued an executive order prioritizing even law-abiding undocumented immigrants for deportation, going to the police became much more dangerous for them. As early as February, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) arrested a woman in El Paso at a courthouse, where she had gone to obtain a protective order against her partner. An Ice agent sat through the proceeding, and arrested her after the order was granted. In Denver, the city attorney reported that her office might have to drop four domestic violence cases after victims refused to testify, for fear of being arrested by Ice agents. By a month later, some police chiefs in cities with high undocumented populations noticed that reports of domestic violence had dropped sharply. Charlie Beck, the Los Angeles chief of police, said that reports of sexual assault had dropped 25% among Latinos, while domestic violence reports had dropped by 10%. The rates remained steady in other ethnic groups, he said. Maria may not have known these statistics, but she knew the dangers. To be deported would be a disaster, but remaining hidden became harder and harder. “I was at my wits’ end,” she said through an interpreter, on the phone from a safe house in Minnesota. “I really didn’t know what was going to happen.” • • • In Mexico, when the father of her children beat her, Maria first went to the police. “But police and the authorities are afraid,” she said, “so nothing came of it.” Her former partner was a member of a criminal organization; when the same local police who refused to help her started extorting her for money, she knew she had to leave the country. “I decided to come to the United States to hide,” she said. With her mother, her sister and her two children, she crossed the border in 2015. Life in the US brought a mixture of relief and exhaustion. To survive she was working two jobs, at a fast food restaurant and a cleaning company. At the same time, though, she thought she’d gotten away clean. “I saw that nobody knew me here and nobody was going to find me,” she said. That peace ended abruptly. She dropped off her son at the bus stop one morning and walked back to the house she was renting. As she opened the door, she felt someone pull the door open from the other side. She had been seeing a man recently, and for a second she thought it must be him, waiting in her house to surprise her. “But it was the father of my children,” she said. He threw her to the floor. He beat her, and he pulled her by her hair to the bedroom. Then he shoved his wallet into her mouth to gag her, and he raped her. “I felt so stupid,” she said, her voice breaking. “I was just so frozen. I couldn’t do anything.” He took money from her purse, and then he left. For hours, she sat locked in the house, in shock, until she had to pull herself together: it was time to pick up her son from school. “To this day, I don’t know how he found us,” she said. She didn’t want to go to the police. Police in Mexico had preyed on her; police in the US might turn her over to immigration authorities. The risk seemed too great. This dilemma was the impetus behind the U visa, created in 2000 to give undocumented victims of crime – victims of domestic violence in particular – a safe way to report perpetrators. Ten of thousands U visas are issued each year, granting holders legal residency and authorization to work. Maria would have been a perfect candidate for a U visa, had she known about it. But immigration advocates have been wary about counseling women to apply ever since Trump’s executive order directed police departments to cooperate with Ice. “How do we do safety planning with victims when we don’t know if just having interaction with law enforcement will put them in danger before they can even get a U visa?” one advocate asked a Slate reporter in March. • • • Instead of going to the police, Maria went to her landlord and explained what had happened; she was able to break the lease and move her family to a new address. But her former partner found her again. This time, when he showed up, her boyfriend was home. He managed to wrestle the other man outside, and the two of them screamed at each other while she and her mother tried to keep the children from coming out of their rooms to see what was happening. It was important that they not see their father, she said, because she had told them he was dead. This was around the time of Trump’s inauguration, and the news seemed to back up what her former partner said. She plummeted into a deep depression. “With Trump becoming president and all the persecution that there’s been of undocumented people, I just became ill,” she said. Overwhelmed with anxiety, she stopped leaving the house. “I thought I was really going crazy,” she said. Her hair began to fall out. “I remember that many nights I couldn’t sleep,” she said. “I would wake up and wake up my partner and ask him to please if anything happens to me make sure my children are taken care of. He cried with me, and he told me nothing was going to happened to me.” But she wasn’t reassured. They moved again. This time, when he found her again, she was alone. He beat her, hitting and kicking her in the face. Again, he took money from her purse. She told him she’d call the police. “He laughed,” she said. “He told me I was stupid and that I was going to get deported.” In the midst of that despair, she made a hard, logical calculation. There were only a few possible outcomes for her, she determined: she could be deported, he could kill her or she could seek help. “I thought, ‘Ok, I have these three options,’” she said. “If I don’t ask for help, the only two options left are either I’ll be deported or he’s going to kill me. I might as well find out what happens if I seek for help.” She reasoned it out soberly, but in a way the decision had also crystalised while her former partner was beating her. “In that moment, the only thing I wanted to do was to survive.” • • • Making the choice was hard. Acting on it was even harder. A few friends – girlfriends from work – told her to go to the police. But they were American citizens; they didn’t understand her dilemma. One told her about a local Latino justice organization, though, and she called the number. It was hard to get an appointment – they were only open at certain times – and when she finally met with an advocate there, she said, that person simply referred her to the Mexican consulate. When she called the consulate, they referred her to yet another organization – Casa de Esperanza. They also gave her the name of a local Latino police officer who often worked with the consulate. She met with the police officer. “When I got there he started asking me questions and started drawing his own conclusions,” she said. “It seemed he had decided I had made up the whole story to get benefits from the US government.” She burst into tears. “So what is it that you want me to do?” she asked. “And he said, ‘Well I can’t help you right now, you need to wait until it happens again and then maybe something can be done.” She didn’t want to wait until her former partner came to beat her again. She didn’t know what to do. But she’d already made an appointment with Casa de Esperanza. The advocate she met with there, Adriana Tizcareno-Zamudio, said she’d help the woman file a protective order. “I told her what had happened with this other police officer, and she said, ‘That’s not right.’ She gave me a lot of support. She said whatever happens, she was going to go with me.” Tizcareno-Zamudio said later that she was dismayed to hear how the officer had behaved, but not surprised. “So many officers aren’t trained to talk to victims,” she said. She wasn’t sure how it would go when they went to file a complaint together, but this time, they found a police officer who listened. As the Tizcareno-Zamudio translated, Maria explained what had happened. “That police person was so kind to me,” she said. “We sat down and he told me that he promised me whatever happened I could rest assured I could call the police, and they were not going to call immigration, they were there to help. I felt liberated to realize that there was someone who would back me up if something happened.” • • • Maria knows she, in some perverse ways, was lucky. Contact with the police and legal system remains fraught for undocumented US residents; last week, lawyers picketed outside a courthouse in New York after Ice agents arrested a man there. It was at least the 40th such arrest in New York City alone, according to state officials. But she’s feeling better than she did about the world. She has a protective order now, and she is attending group therapy with other survivors of sexual abuse, and she has a therapist. She’s looking into getting therapy for her children and her mother as well. She is still in hiding. But she feels, she said, “mas segura” – more safe. “If he ever comes to bother me again,” she said, “maybe he’s the one who’s going to be deported.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/dec/08/hamilton-west-end-london-musical-tale-of-immigrant-success","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T17:29:18Z","webTitle":"Hamilton wows West End audiences after Broadway transfer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/dec/08/hamilton-west-end-london-musical-tale-of-immigrant-success","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/dec/08/hamilton-west-end-london-musical-tale-of-immigrant-success","fields":{"headline":"Hamilton wows West End audiences after Broadway transfer","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This week, the West End of London was abuzz with an unlikely name: Alexander Hamilton. While you would be forgiven for thinking a hip-hop musical tracing the life of a founding father of the United States would be a tough sell for British audiences, it was clear as the crowds poured out of the preview shows that Hamilton fever had already gone transatlantic. Abby Feltis, 20, was one of the many still wiping away tears as she left the theatre. “To be here tonight is everything,” she said. “I’ve listened to the soundtrack so many times I know every word to every song, but I couldn’t have imagined what it would be like to see it performed. It defied every expectation.” Her praise was echoed by Sarah White. “It met the hype and more,” she said. “We’ve been waiting for a year to come and see it and it absolutely blew me away. The casting was perfect, the staging was flawless, the choreography and the musicians were insane. Just incredible really.” Since it first opened in New York in 2015, Hamilton has become a great theatrical success story. First conceived by the writer Lin-Manuel Miranda as a hip-hop mixtape based on the life of Alexander Hamilton, a man known to most simply as the face on the $10 bill, it grew into one of the most ambitious and record-breaking productions ever staged on Broadway, subsequently winning 11 Tony awards and the 2016 Pulitzer prize for drama. Yet while it has been sold out on Broadway since it opened, the big question was whether a show about the American revolution, the drafting of the American constitution and subsequent quarrels over policy and ideology – often told through the medium of the rap battle – would be quite as well received by British audiences. The show was brought to the West End with an entirely new British cast, fronted by the relative unknown 25-year-old Jamael Westman in the title role. However, while the history of Hamilton, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr might be little known in the UK, London audiences this week insisted nothing had been lost on them. “It doesn’t matter that it’s a quintessentially American story, it’s also a universal, democratic story and with all the songs about immigration, it’s also a really relevant story today,” said Natalie Braid, 25. “We need way more shows like that – an intersection of the entire theatre community on one stage. It really felt like the future.” The show’s emphasis on Hamilton’s immigrant status – “a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a Scotsman”, as the opening song states, who went on to be a founding father of the United States – has been seen by many as particularly important in the current political climate in both the US and UK. The greatest cheer of the night came after the line: “Immigrants, they get the job done.” At a time when a lack of diversity in the arts is an ongoing issue in the UK, the pointedly diverse casting of Hamilton – with black, Asian and mixed-race actors filling almost all the roles – ensured that it felt as groundbreaking on the West End stage as it did when it made its Broadway debut in 2015. Kirsty Lafferty, 28, pointed out that Hamilton could be seen as British history as much as American, for it was against British rule that Hamilton and his revolutionaries were fighting. One of the most popular characters in the Broadway original was King George III, written as a pompous pantomime figure with some of the funniest lines. Miranda said he was intrigued to see how British audiences would respond to their former monarch being portrayed as a “cartoonish villain.” However, he need not have worried, as George III’s appearance is already being cited as a highlight of the West End version. “British people are really good at laughing at ourselves, so obviously everyone loved King George being ridiculous,” said Lafferty. “And it’s even funnier because I think that’s still the impression some Americans have of English people to this day, as these camp, pompous royals.” Hannah Gregory, 29, agreed. “Yes, it’s American history but it’s just a really good, juicy story and British audiences will probably take different things from it. I thought the King George element was hysterical – probably funnier for us than an American audience – so tonight obviously proved you don’t have to be American to get everything out of Hamilton.” The show’s profile was underlined by the big names who turned out for the early previews, among them the former US secretary of state John Kerry, the Mad Men actor Jon Hamm and the comedy writer Stephen Merchant. For Feltis, an American studying in the UK, the show was an antidote to the “closed-minded”, anti-immigrant sentiment of Donald Trump’s America. “Hamilton is the history of America we should be telling,” she said. “It’s a show that came at the right time. Watching it really gave me hope. Being in the audience tonight felt like being part of history.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/08/irish-view-border-brexit-dispute-difficult-discussions-ahead","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T16:24:58Z","webTitle":"What’s the Irish view on the Brexit border dispute?

Difficult discussions lie ahead","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The question of the Irish border brought the Brexit talks to a halt on Monday when the DUP stymied an emerging deal. The unfolding drama this week was no surprise to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the island of Ireland and the delicate balances that has kept Northern Ireland in an uneasy peace over the last 20 years. The question of Ireland was always going to be one of the most difficult to resolve, and remains so. The agreement reached in Brussels is just a staging post, with many twists and turns ahead. That said, the joint statement is a significant achievement that meets the needs of the Irish government and the DUP for now. The DUP will be content that it had London’s full attention and managed to muscle its way into the Brexit negotiations. The emphasis on the constitutional status of Northern Ireland as part of the UK, the principle of consent and the unfettered access of Northern Ireland to the UK market meets its demands. Ironically the DUP, a party that campaigned against the Good Friday agreement (GFA), has now consented to its insertion into an international treaty backed by the EU. By supporting Brexit, the DUP has put the Irish border back on the political agenda – something that may, in time, undermine their union. The Irish government, seized of the Brexit issue from the beginning, has devoted all of its political and diplomatic resources to ensuring that Ireland was a core part of the EU27 agenda and that any agreement with the UK would protect the GFA. The issue is existential for Ireland, something that has not always been fully understood in London. For Dublin, the agreement secures all of its key objectives for now. The UK commits to the protection of the GFA in all of its parts and crucially commits to the avoidance of a hard border, including any physical infrastructure. Moreover, all future arrangements must be compatible with this overarching commitment. Thus the principle of no hard border on the island of Ireland is a core commitment governing the UK-EU relations. It will be integral to the withdrawal agreement, which takes the form of an international treaty between the EU and UK. The commitment to no hard border is one thing, but how is it to be kept? Here the agreement suggests that the UK’s first preference is to achieve this within the overall context of EU-UK relations and to offer bespoke solutions for the island of Ireland only if this proves impossible. If this is insufficient, the UK further commits to full alignment with the rules of the customs union and the single market. A commitment to full alignment is very strong as the EU interprets this as convergence with EU rules. Significantly, it has been agreed that there will be a separate strand of work on Ireland in phase two of the talks. This ensures that Ireland will be central to all discussions until the end game and will not be overwhelmed by other issues. The feeling in Dublin will be one of quiet satisfaction but the government knows that far more difficult discussions lie ahead. The heart of the problem still lies in London. The prime minister, Theresa May, has got her cabinet to the end of the first phase by essentially meeting all EU requirements but without resolving the glaring divisions in her cabinet about the final destination. When that discussion takes place as now it must, addressing the incompatibility of leaving the customs union and single market with no hard border in Ireland cannot be avoided. It could well be that the Irish question has already forced the UK towards a softer Brexit – or, if this proves too much to swallow for the hard Brexiteers, the consequence might be a political crisis in the early part of next year. Regardless of what happens, London should understand that the Irish government, backed by a deep consensus in Irish society and supported by the unwavering solidarity of EU27, will hold them to the commitments made in this agreement and will not sign up to any future trade agreement that violates it. • Brigid Laffan is director of the global governance programme at the European University Institute, Florence"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/08/tottenham-stoke-city-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T15:46:31Z","webTitle":"Tottenham Hotspur v Stoke City: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/08/tottenham-stoke-city-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/08/tottenham-stoke-city-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Tottenham Hotspur v Stoke City: match preview","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Spurs are looking to end a run of four without a win in the Premier League as they welcome Stoke City to Wembley.

After the New York Times reported that Trump privately denies it is his voice on the tape, Bush, who has already failed in one comeback attempt, found himself chuckling opposite Stephen Colbert on the Late Show on Monday night. “How can you resist an armoire?” Bush said. Colbert had just recounted how Trump hit on a married woman – or “moved on her like a bitch”, in his words – while the two were furniture shopping. The audience was laughing gamely. Colbert’s questions were direct. He played a damning clip of the audio tape, assured Bush he wouldn’t be on the show if Trump hadn’t cast doubt on the tape, and tightened the screws when Bush claimed he thought Trump was just performing “some kind of crass standup act”. Bush came bearing talking points. Women must be believed. The nation must have a dialogue. And Bush? Well, that guy had it rough. “It was a difficult time, I think, it was very hot emotionally in the country,” he said, when asked if he thought his firing from NBC’s Today Show was warranted. “A lot of things happened quickly. [My boss] may have moved a little quickly.” At an unprecedented moment of accountability for abusive men and their enablers, it was hard not to see Bush’s interview as a preview of many apology tours to come. “We can’t always live in a state of crisis,” said Regina Luttrell, an assistant professor of public relations at the SI Newhouse School of Public Communications in Syracuse, New York. So what will happen – and how many of the accused will return to power – when the current crisis is over? Luttrell and Anthony D’Angelo, a fellow Newhouse professor, predicted the coming years would see many famous men follow a similar script to Bush. Some, they said, would take ownership of their offenses, as Bush attempted to do in a New York Times op-ed titled: “Yes, Donald Trump, You Said That.” There will be authentic-seeming apologies. There will be acts of contrition. Some reputations will never recover. “I think that the bar is higher for men now,” D’Angelo said. “I’m not a soothsayer, but I highly doubt that we’ll ever go back to a point where we say, ‘Boys will be boys.’” Luttrell added that the days of waiting for the press to move on to another story have gone, since social media allows anyone at any time to draw attention to any story. But some of the accused will “return to a new normal”, Luttrell said, adding that a combination of factors will count: how severe was the accusation, and how weird; how much of a break from a public persona was it; how much public attention was gained. “Who can go on to rebuild their career goes back to, ‘What did you do and how much can we as the American public say is OK?’” she said. ‘Part of the strategy’ Public tolerance for sexual misconduct – and those who enable it – is at an unprecedented low. Who amplifies an apology and how will therefore matter, D’Angelo said. When Bill Clinton was forced to defend himself against multiple claims of sexual harassment or assault, D’Angelo said, many mainstream feminists rallied to the president’s side. As a result, a significant portion of the public does not recall the scope and severity of those accusations. Someone like Colbert, D’Angelo continued, has “enormous credibility” and influence. The very act of appearing on his show – or in the Times op-ed pages – can signal that someone is entitled to be taken seriously. “That’s part of the strategy,” Luttrell said. Of course, any strategy can backfire. The same night Bush appeared on the Late Show, HBO’s John Oliver confronted Dustin Hoffman at a 20th-anniversary panel for the comedy Wag the Dog, over accusations the actor groped or harassed women on movie sets. “It feels like a cop-out to say, ‘Well this isn’t me,’” Oliver said. “If you’ve given no evidence to show it didn’t [happen], there was a period of time for a while when you were a creeper around women.” Hoffman has maintained that his accusers are not telling the truth. Before Oliver confronted him, he seemed to have suffered little damage. Hoffman’s situation shows that plenty of people have returned to or continued in public life after allegations of sexual misconduct without apologizing or even acknowledging any wrongdoing. Bush eventually swerved into self-pity and unintentional revelations. Asked by Colbert if he was surprised Trump was elected but he was fired, he said that on the day of the inauguration he was checking into a nine-day retreat in Napa County, California. He also freely disclosed that he asked then NBC host Matt Lauer – whose name is now closely associated with allegations of sexual assault – to protect his job. Bush also said he had not really read the accounts of Trump’s many accusers until the Access Hollywood tape was in the news again. “[Trump], last week, for some reason came out with, ‘That’s not my voice on the tape,’” Bush said. “When he said this it infuriated me on a personal front and then I ended up Googling, and I read an article with all of these women’s accounts. When that article first came out it was 13 days after I’d been fired so I was in my own personal shock: fight or flight. So I never really read it all the way. “As I read this, I thought, 20 women don’t get together and say, ‘Hey you know what would be really fun? Let’s take down a really powerful guy together, ha ha.’” He added: “You’ve got 20 women – I don’t know what the exact number is, there’s more.” Colbert’s audience seemed game. Bush’s attacks on Trump – “Enough’s enough, stop playing around with people’s lives” – received unbridled applause. And this being a comedy show, Colbert ended on a comparatively lighthearted note: an Instagram post. It was a photo of Bush in the hospital after a golf ball hit him in the head. “The doctor said if it was half an inch higher, I might have died,” Bush laughed, pointing to his temple. “I thought to myself, ‘Wow. I’m finally lucky.’”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/dec/06/uk-banks-have-2m-customers-stuck-in-permanent-overdraft","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T07:01:10Z","webTitle":"UK banks have 2m customers stuck in permanent overdraft","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/dec/06/uk-banks-have-2m-customers-stuck-in-permanent-overdraft","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/dec/06/uk-banks-have-2m-customers-stuck-in-permanent-overdraft","fields":{"headline":"UK banks have 2m customers stuck in permanent overdraft","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"More than 2 million people in the UK are stuck with permanent overdrafts, with many trapped in a “vicious cycle” of borrowing, according to a debt charity. StepChange said it had also uncovered evidence of unaffordable lending in the overdraft market, and cases where banks had failed to offer customers a means to deal with their debt, even when they had made it clear they were in financial difficulty. The charity’s new report follows changes to overdrafts by some of Britain’s biggest banks, and a highly critical report published by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in July which suggested that unauthorised overdrafts could end up being banned. The StepChange report, entitled Stuck in the Red and based on a survey of the charity’s clients and an analysis of FCA data, found that about 2.1 million people were constantly overdrawn, going into the red in every month of 2016. Around half of the charity’s clients have overdraft debt, with the average amount owed put at £1,722. Overdrafts are one of the most widely used credit products – the regulator found that nearly 13 million people have been overdrawn in the last 12 months – though they are designed for short-term borrowing. Critics have claimed they are a cash cow for banks: £1.2bn of the banks’ annual revenues come from unauthorised overdraft charges, the Competition and Markets Authority said last year. People who were frequently overdrawn and regularly went over their limit could find themselves in a cycle of borrowing that was very difficult to escape from, said StepChange. Some of StepChange’s clients described how wages and income paid into their current account would pay off their overdraft and associated interest and charges, but then in order to cover essential household bills, they would have to go back into the red. This often resulted in people repeatedly incurring interest and charges, meaning that each month their financial difficulties deepened. A number of clients described being given significant overdraft limits relative to their income, which made it very difficult to escape from their debts once they had fallen behind. One was given an overdraft of £2,250 despite working part-time and only receiving £200 income per month, plus universal credit payments. The charity has recommended that banks and the FCA should work together to more better identify customers in, or at risk of, persistent debt. And it said banks that had not yet done so should scrap charges for unauthorised overdrafts and ensure their charging structures were clear and transparent. A shake-up of overdraft fees that took effect last month means that most Lloyds Bank and Halifax customers have reportedly seen their costs shrink, but some are paying more. The banks have brought in a new flat fee of 1p a day for every £7 that someone borrows over their fee-free limit. Someone who has a £1,000 overdraft limit and uses it for 10 days a month will now pay £14.20 in fees, against £10.88 before, and if they are permanently overdrawn it will cost even more. In July, Andrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, said: “The nature and extent of the problems we have found with unarranged overdrafts mean that maintaining the status quo is not an option.” • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"technology/2017/dec/05/jeremy-hunt-attacks-facebook-over-app-aimed-at-children","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T18:05:07Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Hunt attacks Facebook over app aimed at children","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/05/jeremy-hunt-attacks-facebook-over-app-aimed-at-children","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/dec/05/jeremy-hunt-attacks-facebook-over-app-aimed-at-children","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Hunt attacks Facebook over app aimed at children","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Jeremy Hunt has publicly attacked Facebook for releasing a version of its Messenger app aimed at children, and called on the social media company to “stay away from my kids”. The health secretary accused the company of “targeting younger children” after Facebook announced on Monday that it was conducting trials of an app called Messenger Kids in the US, which is designed to be used by pre-teens. He said the company was failing to act responsibly despite having assured the government that it would not target its service at children, who can only use the main social media website if they are over 13. “Not sure this is the right direction at all,” he tweeted. “Facebook told me they would come back with ideas to PREVENT underage use of their product, but instead they are actively targeting younger children. Stay away from my kids please Facebook and act responsibly!” Asked if Theresa May agreed, a No 10 spokesman said Hunt was leading for the government on the health effects of social media on children. Launching the app, Facebook said it had consulted widely and would require a responsible adult to set up an account for their child with all contacts added and approved by parents from their main Facebook account. The child would not be given their own Facebook account, which is prohibited for those under 13. Instead, the app operates as an extension of the parent’s account. Facebook also said it would block children from sharing nudity, sexual or violent content, and have a dedicated moderation team to respond to flagged content. Facebook had no immediate response to a request for comment on Hunt’s intervention. But in a blogpost for the launch, Facebook’s Loren Cheng said: “Today, parents are increasingly allowing their children to use tablets and smartphones, but often have questions and concerns about how their kids use them and which apps are appropriate. “So when we heard about the need for better apps directly from parents during research and conversations with parents, we knew we needed to develop it alongside the people who were going to use it, as well as experts who could help guide our thinking. “In addition to our research with thousands of parents, we’ve engaged with over a dozen expert advisers in the areas of child development, online safety and children’s media and technology who’ve helped inform our approach to building our first app for kids.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/10/lully-rameau-gluck-an-opera-for-three-kings-review-orfeo-orchestra-vashegyi","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T07:20:29Z","webTitle":"Lully, Rameau, Gluck et al: An Opera for Three Kings CD review – what the Louis liked","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/10/lully-rameau-gluck-an-opera-for-three-kings-review-orfeo-orchestra-vashegyi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/10/lully-rameau-gluck-an-opera-for-three-kings-review-orfeo-orchestra-vashegyi","fields":{"headline":"Lully, Rameau, Gluck et al: An Opera for Three Kings CD review – what the Louis liked","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"French music with a Hungarian twist as György Vashegyi and his Budapest band join forces with the Versailles Baroque Music Centre, conjuring up the splendour of 18th-century court celebrations for Louis XIV, XV and XVI.

The Brexit secretary, David Davis, is due on Wednesday to appear before the exiting the EU select committee, to which he has handed over 850 pages of analysis after being forced to do so by a parliamentary vote. Parliamentarians are now allowed to view the papers in a restricted-access reading room organised by Davis’s Department for Exiting the EU (DexEU), which one called “ridiculous amounts of security just to ensure that as few people see this stuff as possible”. Another described the collection of documents as “two lever-arch files for 80% of the economy”. It is understood that the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, and the shadow Brexit ministers Paul Blomfield and Matthew Pennycook saw the papers on Thursday, as did senior Liberal Democrats, and other MPs and peers are due to see them over the coming days. “It references materials already in the public domain, but they have been heavily, heavily edited to provide information which is uncontroversial and doesn’t add much to the substance,” a senior Labour source said. “It will raise real questions about what on earth the government is doing to prepare, if this is all there is.” Dick Newby, the Lib Dem leader in the House of Lords, who was one of the first in the reading room, described the tight security as “a complete farce” and said it was incorrect to call the papers impact assessments. “They make no assessment of the impact. They describe the current situation, they explain how the EU operates as well as how other countries work and then a section on what stakeholders think – that’s it,” he said. “There is zero assessment of the economic impact. Nothing is redacted because there is nothing to redact.” Lord Newby said the information provided to the government by trade bodies quoted in the reports was contained in statements they had made in public. “There is no reason whatsoever why they shouldn’t be published,” he said. Some MPs on the committee view Davis’s failure to allow them to see unedited economic impact assessments, which they claim they were led to believe existed, leaves him in contempt of parliament. That is because the humble address – an arcane parliamentary request rarely used since the 19th century – deployed by Labour to unearth the papers is binding. Speaker John Bercow made clear that he would consider a letter from the Scottish National party’s Pete Wishart in relation to the issue. “I have written once again to the Speaker saying that in my view the government are in contempt of the House and proceedings must be initiated,” Wishart told the Guardian. “This government are refusing to accept scrutiny, belittling the means to hold them to account and refusing to accept their minority status. Patience is now running thin and the government must comply or face contempt.” The drive to open the papers to scrutiny has been spearheaded by a Labour MP on the committee, Seema Malhotra. She has repeatedly quoted Davis himself referring to his department drawing up more than 50 impact assessments. She is likely to grill the minister on Wednesday over why he made the claim if it was not true, but also to ask why – if the papers do not exist in the form that was originally promised – why not? “Shouldn’t understanding the impact be part of what forms government policy?” she asked. The papers include information about future international trade, including a survey of the retail sector naming its preferred new import sources including Mexico, Morocco, Peru and South Africa. “This is pootling around in the undergrowth, nothing to do with major markets,” Newby said. “There are very, very few things of any interest at all.” In order to view the papers, members must leave parliament and sign in to a reading room for pre-booked one-hour slots. They may book multiple hours back to back, and only eight politicians can be there at any one time, with their staff barred from entry, according to a letter sent to all members of both houses by Brexit minister Robin Walker. Two officials monitor the room while MPs read the paper documents. No mobile phones or recording devices are allowed, though MPs can take notes – a situation that is understood to have caused cross-party irritation. In his letter, Walker said the security would allow MPs to “conduct their scrutiny while respecting the need to keep certain information confidential”. Davis will appear before the exiting the EU committee on Wednesday when the committee could decide to publish the papers. Departmental sources have insisted the information handed to the committee covered all industries and was ongoing work by civil servants that had been pulled together and edited in a way that officials believed would satisfy parliament’s demands. Davis had previously claimed the government was “in the midst of carrying out about 57 sets of analyses, each of which has implications for individual parts of 85% of the economy. Some of those are still to be concluded.” The Brexit committee chair, Hilary Benn, has said the editing of the documents was “not in keeping with the resolution that was passed by the House of Commons”. A spokesperson from the Department for Exiting the EU said: “Our analysis is not, nor has it ever been, a series of impact assessments. ”We have always been clear that our analysis does not exist in the form parliament requested. We have taken time to bring together information in a way that meets parliament’s specific ask. ”Our overall programme of work is comprehensive, thorough and is continuously updated. This sectoral analysis is simply one part of it. It is not exhaustive and it is not the final say on any of these issues.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/05/manchester-city-david-silva-derby-injury-doubt","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T22:30:00Z","webTitle":"Manchester City did not offer €100m to Lionel Messi, says Pep Guardiola","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/05/manchester-city-david-silva-derby-injury-doubt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/05/manchester-city-david-silva-derby-injury-doubt","fields":{"headline":"Manchester City did not offer €100m to Lionel Messi, says Pep Guardiola","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Pep Guardiola has denied Manchester City offered Lionel Messi a €100m signing-on fee to leave Barcelona last summer. Messi agreed fresh terms last week to extend his stay until 2021. A report in Spain on Tuesday claimed City tried to lure the 30-year-old with the €100m fee plus a €50m a-year salary. Guardiola, asked about the reputed offer, said: “Lionel Messi has signed a contract one week ago. This was never going to happen; Messi started his career there and he’s going to finish it there. If he wanted to leave he wouldn’t have signed the contract.” Pressed that the report claimed the offer came before Messi agreed new terms, City’s manager said: “It’s not true.” City play Shakhtar Donetsk in Kharkiv on Wednesday night in the final Group F game already through as winners. If they win Guardiola will be the club’s first manager to win all six group games. Yaya Touré, who won the Champions League with Barcelona under Guardiola in 2009, believes City are playing the best football in the competition. “We think we practise the best football in Europe when we go forward, though we find it difficult against some opponents,” Touré said. “We need to play against a big opponent to see where we are. To repeat what I did in 2009 with a different club, in a different club, would be something special. “Teams respect us more now. They feel the way we play and attack. We are in a good moment, full of confidence. If you ask all my team-mates they are all enjoying it.” Guardiola, though, was less emphatic. “We are doing well but that doesn’t mean you will achieve the title,” he said. “In this competition one bad 45 minutes and you are out. That means you can win the title but go out if you are doing well. I’m not concerned if we are playing the best football.” Guardiola said David Silva may miss Sunday’s derby at Manchester United. “David had a little bit of a problem in the last minutes [against West Ham United on Sunday],” he said. “We made a test after the game and I don’t know if he is able to play on Sunday so that’s why he stayed there, to recover in Manchester.” Asked what the problem was, Guardiola laughed off the question. He confirmed Bernardo Silva would start and said City, winners of their past 20 games, would go for victory against Ukraine’s champions, who are second in the group. “We play for our prestige and to keep our winning mentality,” he said. “We are so happy to be in the last 16 but it will be tough. I saw them play Napoli, their midfield is good, their buildup is perfect. It is a tough game, a tough team.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"social-care-network/2017/dec/12/film-young-parents-child-taken-into-care","type":"article","sectionId":"social-care-network","sectionName":"Social Care Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T09:50:30Z","webTitle":"Film depicts reality for young parents at risk of having a child taken into care","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2017/dec/12/film-young-parents-child-taken-into-care","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/social-care-network/2017/dec/12/film-young-parents-child-taken-into-care","fields":{"headline":"Film depicts reality for young parents at risk of having a child taken into care","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“When you’re in care, having a baby is like walking through a door. On the other side, you’re not a kid who can ask for help any more; you’re an unfit mum getting ready to do what’s expected of you – fail.” For Elise and Jocasta*, this line in a new animated film by children’s advocacy charity Just for Kids Law sets out the reality for young people who become pregnant while in foster care and discover their baby is at risk of being removed. Both women advised on the storyline and scripting of the film, drawing on the frustrations and fears they experienced while going through care proceedings themselves. Elise’s eldest daughter, who she gave birth to aged 16, was adopted after she had cared for her for nine months. Her two subsequent children are being looked after by a family member. Her fourth child, still a baby, is living with her, thanks, she says, to support from her Just for Kids Law advocate Sophie Conway, who accompanied her to every meeting and court hearing. The narrative of the film, says Conway, was directed by care-experienced young parents who were asked for their input. “They said, ‘Look, you can talk to us until you’re black and blue about the law, but you need to prepare people for how care proceedings make you feel’,” she says. The animation shows a woman trying to advise her younger self what to expect when social workers express concerns that her baby is at risk. The action moves fast, echoing the dizzying progression of meetings, arrival of paperwork and succession of court hearings that young parents must cope with. “The film shows that you’re going to be confused and that you should ask questions,” says Elise. “I didn’t really understand at first that children are taken away. I thought it only happened if they were abused.” Elise had not hurt her baby; social workers were worried about future harm. “They use [legal jargon] that you don’t understand,” she says. “I didn’t understand the process at all.” For social workers, it may be harsh to hear the unvarnished opinions of young people who feel strongly that they were failed by the local authority. Jocasta, whose baby was not adopted in the end, says several times that she felt “bullied” and “backed into a corner” by children’s services staff who, she says, coerced her into signing a “voluntary” agreement for her son to be placed in temporary foster care. Elise also feels that her initial consent to temporary foster care was secured through misinformation. This is why both women are adamant that any young parent facing the prospect of having their child removed should have an independent advocate; someone who can attend meetings with them, take notes, explain the efforts being made by the young parent to improve their parenting skills, and clarify any misunderstandings before negative attitudes become entrenched on either side. Social workers, Elise says, “treat me better” when Conway is by her side. Conway believes that for any young parent plunged into a complex legal situation in which irrevocable decisions might be made about the future of their child, objective and independent support from someone who knows the law can make a critical difference. “Until it [becomes] official care proceedings you won’t get a lawyer, and if you’ve been in care you won’t have family around. The social work input is all for the child,” says Conway. “Young people told us about their sense of being so alone in a room with 15 people at a table. They usually go into these meetings with no one and are entirely ill-prepared for what’s ahead.” Just for Kids Law hopes the film will be used to prompt social workers to consider the experience of care proceedings from the perspective of the young parent rather than focusing their attention on the child. Social workers in Camden, who were invited to read the draft film scripts, felt they were “powerful and impactful”, says Tim Fisher, family group conference manager for Camden council. “The feedback was that the more they could understand the subjective experience of a young parent the better they’d be able to help them,” he says. “That’s where [the film] has real value, in how it communicates the intensity of the experience.” Elise hopes the film will make a difference to how other young parents approach the difficult days if children’s services become involved when their baby is born. “They made me feel that I wasn’t good enough, that I had failed and that I couldn’t do anything right,” she says. “I’ve lost a child to it, and I don’t feel I needed to – I just needed some support.” *Names have been changed Join the Social Care Network for comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

One sip sent my head spinning. But then this particular vintage was more potent than your usual Californian red. The grenache, from Know Label wines in Arroyo Grande on the central coast, is infused with cannabis flowers. Plastic cups of wine were passed around along with joints as our party bus chugged over the Golden Gate bridge. Tupac’s California Love oozed from the speakers into an atmosphere as foggy as a San Francisco morning. It was the first tour combining wine and weed in California, and the brainchild of Heidi Keyes and Michael Eymer, who run Colorado-based Cannabis Tours. This tour will officially launch in early 2018, when recreational cannabis use becomes legal in many areas of the state. Until then, a medical marijuana card is needed. But the new law means even international visitors will be able to buy cannabis, opening up a new world of tourism possibilities. “There are so many other ways to use cannabis than to smoke it,” said Keyes, marijuana-leaf earrings jangling. “I think wine and weed can be a great combination in the right quantities.” Others are following suit. Jordan Lichman, co-founder of Sea of Green Tours, is planning winemaker dinners in Sonoma, with “California cuisine, top wines and cannabis brands”. Lisa Rogovin, who founded Edible Excursions food tours, has just launched a Curious Cannabis Salon, showcasing various high-end edible cannabis products in San Francisco. Our tour began at the Oakland Cannabis Creative with a “mocktail” demonstration. Looking like a hipster let loose in a laboratory, bow-tied Andrew Mieure expertly sprinkled and pipetted various doses and strains into spiced apple drinks. His Denver-based company, Top Shelf Budtending, caters for private events, promoting “classy cannabis” and responsible use. “You should ideally smoke before you drink,” said Mieure. He was on hand throughout the trip with tinctures and sniffing oils “to bring people back” if they got too high. “Alcohol acts as a muscle relaxant, so the cannabis absorbs quicker into your bloodstream.” The tour dropped in at the Betty Project, a San Francisco grow facility. Clutching glasses of sparkling (non-infused) wine, we peeped at plants bathing in chartreuse-green lights. Aromas of sage, eucalyptus and lemon verbena wafted from the drying room. Our last stop was Donkey &amp; Goat Winery in Berkeley, north of San Francisco. They don’t serve “green” wine – as cannabis-infused varieties are known – only red, white and orange. Gloria, on the tour with her husband, sipped contentedly from a glass of pinot gris and nibbled on a breadstick: “Wine, cheese and weed. How can you complain?” Visitors shouldn’t get the impression that from 1 January cannabis sales will be legal throughout the state: many city authorities have not yet agreed to issue licences, and Fresno and various counties have banned sales. As we got back on the bus, Keyes surveyed the sea of serene faces. Some slumped in their seats, half dozing. Others mainlined Doritos or stared, button-eyed, as San Francisco’s skyline soared past the windows. “If this was just a drinking tour, people would be wasted and throwing up or fighting by now,” said Keyes. Eyes shining, she added: “I mean, I love wine – and I love weed. It’s perfect.” • The Wine and Weed tour costs $99pp, cannabistours.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/05/donald-trump-jerusalem-capital-israel-catastrophe-us-embassy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T15:41:49Z","webTitle":"Why Trump’s assertion of Jerusalem as capital of Israel would be a catastrophe | Nicholas Blincoe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/05/donald-trump-jerusalem-capital-israel-catastrophe-us-embassy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/05/donald-trump-jerusalem-capital-israel-catastrophe-us-embassy","fields":{"headline":"Why Trump’s assertion of Jerusalem as capital of Israel would be a catastrophe","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It is harder than it ought to be, explaining why recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital is a bad idea. The city has been Israel’s centre of government since 1948. While most countries have held off, the US Congress passed a Jerusalem Embassy Act in 1995, which included a line recognising the city as Israel’s capital. President Trump campaigned on a promise to implement the act, and though he has previously followed other presidents in signing waivers suspending it, this week he has missed two deadlines, suggesting that he is strongly tempted to give it the go-ahead. If he does, it will derail the last hope of peace, according to the Palestinian Authority, and degrade US influence in the world, as countries including Turkey have warned. These may not seem like persuasive arguments. The US has willingly surrendered much of its standing; there is no peace process; and the reputation of both Turkey and the Palestinian Authority is low. But recognising Israel’s current version of Jerusalem would create enormous and new insoluble problems without addressing the real issues that beset the city. Israel only captured the old city and adjoining Palestinian suburbs such as Silwan in 1967. A hastily written law was pushed through the Knesset declaring the territory had been annexed to Israel, and the city of Jerusalem had been “reunited”. According to the Geneva Conventions, territory acquired through war is under “hostile military occupation” in a formula that has endured since the defeat of fascism. Successive Israeli governments have argued the terms of the conventions do not apply to Jerusalem. However, in December 2016, the UN took a vote reaffirming that the Palestinian territories were under hostile occupation. Israel’s attempt to pressure Trump’s transition team in the runup to the vote has now come within the scope of the Mueller investigation. When the organisers of the 2018 Giro d’Italia declared last week that the cycle race, its opening leg in Israel, would start in “west Jerusalem”, they received a sharp rebuke from Israeli minister Miri Regev. “In Israel’s capital,” she declared, “there is no east and west.” Anyone visiting Jerusalem would quickly see how wrong she is. The presence of both the army and border police, a militarised gendarmerie, underline that much of the city is under military control. When I was researching in the archives of St George cathedral school, the secretary told me how frightened she was when the school bell rang because she did not know if the children would get home safely, or be picked up and beaten or arrested. Border police recruits are little more than teenagers themselves. Their behaviour, and their treatment of arrested children, was the subject of a bill presented to the US Congress last month. But it is not simply the treatment of people in Jerusalem that is the problem. The city has twice been enlarged in the 50 years since its annexation, a decision taken each time through acts of parliament. Israel’s mutant version of Jerusalem is far larger than any historical iteration of the city. It contains Palestinian towns, villages and refugee camps, as well as Israeli settlements. The Geneva Conventions exist in parallel with human rights legislation, making Israel responsible for the welfare of many hundreds of thousands of people. Within these city limits, Israel presides over deeply deprived and lawless communities, where substance abuse is endemic and health services are poor or non-existent. These zones have no proper sewage provisions, and neither do the adjoining Jewish zones. The effluent has turned the Kidron stream into an open sewer, polluting the desert and the Dead Sea. Jerusalem is not divided, impoverished and ungoverned because international law makes it so: it is a situation that flows from the territorial ambitions unleashed by war. Successive Israeli governments have been unable to cope with problems they have created, and lacked the political will to make a peace that will see Palestinians controlling their own lives. Rather than honestly own the situation, Israel’s leaders have tried to muddy the legal framework that defines the state of the city. We live in a climate where international law is under threat. Human rights are attacked as a UN-sponsored industry that enriches the corrupt and lazy, while tying the hands of dynamic wealth creators. Serial attempts to degrade the international order have made Israeli politicians the darlings of the political right, and won over businessmen who despise legal restraints. Trump is a creature of the right and a friend of toxic financiers. One can see why he would argue for appeasement, and legitimise Israel’s acquisitions. But it would be a sordid retreat into chaos and murder that would fuel the political and moral catastrophe in a city beloved by the world. • Nicholas Blincoe is the author of Bethlehem: Biography of a Town (Nation Books)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/10/best-classical-music-2017-fiona-maddocks-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T08:00:31Z","webTitle":"Fiona Maddocks’s best classical music of 2017","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/10/best-classical-music-2017-fiona-maddocks-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/10/best-classical-music-2017-fiona-maddocks-review","fields":{"headline":"Fiona Maddocks’s best classical music of 2017","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Whichever way you shake 2017, it was the year of Rattle. Simon Rattle. Appointed music director of the London Symphony Orchestra two years ago, galloping in ever louder and quicker like a Rossini crescendo, he finally arrived. The first official concerts began in September. This Is Rattle, blasted the series title. It looked like hype but was spot on. Who else would launch their tenure with an uncompromising programme of 20th- and 21st-century music? Rattle’s advent gave a new boost to plans for a London concert hall, which advanced rapidly with the appointment of an innovative firm of New York architects and the launch of the City’s “culture mile” project around the Barbican, where the hall will be. Not everyone is convinced, but the success of the admired Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg and the Pierre Boulez Saal in Berlin, both new this year, have set examples. Life for female musicians made more strides towards normality, if not yet equality. St Paul’s Cathedral appointed its first full-time female chorister – south Londoner Carris Jones – and the Vatican’s Sistine Chapel choir broke a 500-year gender taboo when mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli sang solo with the 50-strong choir of men and boys. Sofi Jeannin became the first female director of the BBC Singers. Composer Roxanna Panufnik and librettist Jessica Duchen made a mark with their Silver Birch opera for Garsington. With inexhaustible determination, slashing through red tape, Wasfi Kani “built” a new opera house for Grange Park Opera at West Horsley Place, Surrey, in less than a year. Two women won Cardiff Singer of the World 2017: mezzo-soprano Catriona Morison and, in the audience prize, soprano Louise Alder. But there were end-of-year troubles. Mariss Jansons, a much-loved but old-school maestro, admitted that women on the podium – now at last breaking through to take senior jobs – were not his “cup of tea”. After the clamour, he issued an apology. The Metropolitan Opera, New York, suspended its long-term music director James Levine pending an inquiry on sexual misconduct allegations. Andris Nelsons raised hackles by claiming there were no sexual harassment problems in classical music. Perhaps not for heterosexual men on the podium. A survey by the Incorporated Society of Musicians found that 60% of respondents had experienced sexual harassment. The Brexit effect hit hard. The Oxford-based European Union Baroque Orchestra announced it would move to Antwerp, while the London-based European Union Youth Orchestra will relocate to Italy. Anti-Brexit protesters got into trouble for waving EU flags at the BBC Proms. Daniel Barenboim, at a Prom with his Berlin Staatskapelle Orchestra, gave an impromptu speech calling for European unity (not mentioning Brexit) and warned Britain against “isolationist tendencies”. The nation’s opera houses settled in with new conductors: Czech-born Tomáš Hanus triumphed with a Russian season at Welsh National Opera. Stuart Stratford’s successes at Scottish Opera included a mesmerising Pelléas et Mélisande (in David McVicar’s new production). Opera North was less lucky; the promising Aleksandar Marković left without explanation almost as soon as he arrived. Martyn Brabbins made his music directorial debut at ENO with an expertly directed and performed Marnie. Nico Muhly’s new work, together with Ryan Wigglesworth’s The Winter’s Tale (ENO), Brett Dean’s Hamlet (Glyndebourne) and Thomas Adès’s The Exterminating Angel (ROH), all had fans and detractors. In December, Glyndebourne announced the immediate departure of the admired Sebastian F Schwarz after two years as general director (more Brexit fallout?). Conductors Jeffrey Tate, 74, and Jiří Bělohlávek, 71, were mourned. Peter Hall’s contribution to opera should be remembered. The untimely death of the Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky, 55 – silver-haired, handsome, above all a wonderful singer/actor – caused widespread sorrow. And the unsung: Deborah Lamprell, 45, worked front of house at Opera Holland Park. She died in the Grenfell Tower fire on 14 June. An all-star performance of Verdi’s Requiem was given in her memory. She’d have been astonished. 10 best performances Pelléas et Mélisande/BambinO Scottish Opera, Glasgow Hauntingly staged, beautifully performed. Equal praise for the touring BambinO for babies (seen in Rochdale). Hamlet Glyndebourne Brett Dean’s new opera, strong in the festival, took flight on tour. Little Shorts Opera North Brilliant programming of short, often unfamiliar operas (Osud, Trouble in Tahiti etc). Peter Grimes Bergen Opera at Usher Hall, Edinburgh Storm-tossed performance conducted by Edward Gardner, with tenor Stuart Skelton and a chorus to drown for.

Silver-sprayed sparse branches were until recently a winning festive look – minimalist-Narnia vibes, a bit abstract, perfect for the Cos-wearer who doesn’t do tinsel – but this year’s Miss Havisham’s attic-themed White House corridor has seen to that. A tunnel of spiky white twigs with all the cosiness of that camping trip from the Blair Witch Project, complete with a lighting concept seemingly based on holding a torch under your chin to freak your little sister out, the Trump twigs went viral as the most joyless decor the White House has ever seen. On the other hand, hygge is very last year. Curling up in a pair of cable-knit socks, with a spice-scented candle and an earthenware mug of herbal tea prettily arranged on your mid-century sideboard – just next to the bell jars full of shells collected on meditative winter walks – is unspeakably basic in 2017. Does this really matter? Of course not. You know it, I know it. We’re not fools. But do we care about how our Christmas looks? Of course we do. It’s part of the fun. Keeping up with the Joneses is as much a festive tradition as a Christmas tree. (The Christmas tree itself, in fact, caught on in this country when aspirational Britons copied the fir trees that German-born Prince Albert imported to Windsor Castle in the 1840s.) The fashionable Christmas starts promptly on 1 December. Hard to believe that Advent calendars were once about poking a finger into a cardboard box for the thrill of looking at a badly printed picture of an angel – how easily pleased we once were! – for such innocent days are long gone. Children, frankly, are the least spoilt catchment area here. A chocolate snowman a day is positively restrained in comparison with the adult versions of luxury Advent calendar, in which each day starts with a tiny bottle of designer fragrance or a miniature of single malt whisky. If you haven’t figured out how to hang your tree upside down, as per Karl Lagerfeld’s topsy-turvy Claridge’s tree, don’t panic. Focus on your front-door wreath instead, which for festive overachievers is now almost as important as the tree itself. The wreath-making workshop is the new homemade biscuits as charming edible gifts, which was itself the new making your own Christmas pudding. The wreath on the front door can be conceptual if you like – sprout wreath, anyone? – but a route-one, Home Alone-house-style wreath, complete with lurid green foliage and tartan ribbon, holds a nostalgic appeal to children of the 90s. In an age when every man and woman is their own personal brand, it makes sense that we have graduated from getting the bus into town to look at Christmas windows to curating our own Christmas shop window at home, and putting it on Instagram. Fairy lights outside, which used to be for the neighbourhood oddball, are now de rigueur. (Just don’t get flashing ones, unless you want your entire street to hate you.) Indoors, this year’s update on the cinema-style lightbox that was under every tree last year is the make-your-own neon-sign kit, which can be crafted into whatever phrase your inner Tracey Emin desires. Christmas used to mean just a few days around the 25th, which for many people were spent in a hermetically sealed family bubble. Now the holiday season has spilled over the edges of our holiday allowance and taken over the entire month of December; the modern Christmas has rituals and traditions around social and office life, as well as family. The “Friendsmas” WhatsApp chat on your phone (Christmas tree icon, jazz hands) pings away relentlessly. By time-honoured tradition someone will suggest ice skating, then everyone will debate the merits of rival Nordic popup eggnog bars for so long that all the eggnog bars will be booked up (possibly a blessing in disguise since no one knows what eggnog is) and you agree to go to the pub. The office Secret Santa is as much a part of the modern Christmas countdown as the last date for sending cards second-class was in the late 20th century. (This year: do not buy anything with “Keep calm and carry on” written on it. This is over. Consider a witty Christmas bauble, although in the current climate the aubergine-emoji bauble could be risky.) We probably spend more money on turkey-and-cranberry sandwiches and overpriced takeaway cups of cinnamon-themed hot beverages than on the actual turkey. Not that even the turkey is sacred. The pendulum has swung the opposite direction from the days of the three-bird-roast, and the most fashionable Christmas dinners are vegetarian or vegan. (The hashtag #tofurkey was briefly trending on Thanksgiving.) Instead of breakfasting on chocolate coins and clementines, all the better to fetishise the turkey and roast potatoes, the modern Christmas Day has evolved under hipster influence to feature – you guessed it – brunch. Marks &amp; Spencer are suggesting smoked salmon steeped in beetroot (millennial pink?) while Jamie Oliver has recipes for cinnamon swirls (the one element of hygge that everyone agrees is a keeper being the baked goods). Christmas dinner that doesn’t involve one person sweating over six pans while everyone else periodically walks into the kitchen, vaguely offering help before giving themselves a generous refill of prosecco and exiting? This is a new tradition we can get behind."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2017/dec/06/grant-ron-chernow-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T12:00:16Z","webTitle":"Grant by Ron Chernow review – booze, slavery and an argument for greatness\r\n","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/06/grant-ron-chernow-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/dec/06/grant-ron-chernow-review","fields":{"headline":"Grant by Ron Chernow review – booze, slavery and an argument for greatness\r\n","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In 1885, Ulysses S Grant died a hero. Revered in the north for his victories against the Confederacy in the American civil war, he was respected in the south for his generosity towards disbanded rebels, whom he permitted to return home in peace after their commanders’ surrender. Following the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, Grant became the face of the Republican party, and was twice elected president, serving from 1869 to 1877. His administration was mired in financial scandal, but out of office Grant restored his reputation, travelling the world as an unofficial ambassador. At the end of his life, bankrupt after a bad investment and dying in agony of throat cancer, he recaptured people’s imagination, finishing the manuscript of his memoirs just before his death. Since then, however, as Ron Chernow argues in his new biography, Grant has suffered in public memory. His drinking – notorious in his lifetime – dominates his legacy, while his achievements as a soldier and as a politician have been dismissed. A generation of white southerners cast General Grant as a dullard and a butcher, victorious only because of overwhelming material advantage. In this “Lost Cause” myth, President Grant is carpetbagger-in-chief, imposing brutal military government on “innocent” southern whites. To historians of the Gilded Age, Grant as president was the creature of robber barons. And historians of Reconstruction, Chernow complains, have assailed Grant from every angle: he was too harsh with the south or too lenient; too quick to send in the army or too quick to withdraw it. This is biography by attrition. Across nearly 1,000 pages, Chernow argues for his subject’s greatness. Where contemporaries considered Grant’s drinking a moral failing, Chernow paints his struggle with alcoholism as heroic. The book closes with a sketch of Mark Twain and William T Sherman reminiscing (over drinks) after Grant’s funeral in New York City. Twain, who published Grant’s memoirs, regretted not pushing him to include his binges, vows of abstinence and falls from the wagon in the finished book. “Put the drunkenness in,” Twain said, “ – &amp; the repentance &amp; reform. Trust the people.” Chernow takes Twain’s regret to heart, offering a sensitive and nuanced account of a talented man struggling with addiction, at a time when American society was awash with alcohol, but pitiless towards alcoholics. Against the claim that Grant was a mediocre general, Chernow portrays him as a talented administrator. He may have enjoyed a material advantage over the rebels, but he used it decisively and skilfully, preventing Confederate forces from prolonging the war. In contrast to claims about Grant’s corruption in office, Chernow casts him when president as a simple soldier, loyal to his supporters and naive in trusting the wealthy civilians who showered him with gifts. And during Reconstruction, Chernow insists, Grant faced an impossible dilemma. He could either pull federal troops from the south and abandon African American citizens to well-armed white supremacists, or keep his troops in place, and risk losing control of the national government to the Democrats, who would then take federal troops from the south. Chernow, the author of acclaimed biographies of George Washington and Alexander Hamilton (the latter inspired Lin-Manuel Miranda’s musical), is expert at explaining the friendships and antipathies of elite American politics. He is less nuanced when explaining the wider social and economic forces at work in American life in the 19th century. Grant was born in Point Pleasant, Ohio, across the Ohio River from slave-holding Kentucky. A Methodist and abolitionist, he nonetheless married into a slaveholding family from Missouri. Chernow describes antebellum America as “two incompatible worlds … the enterprising free labour economy of the North and the regressive world of southern slavery”. Grant’s father, Jesse Root Grant, is portrayed as a colourful, boasting hustler, as against his father-in-law, “Colonel” Dent, an unrepentant slaveholder and Dixie buffoon, to symbolise the division between north and south. And yet the Ohio Grants and the Missouri Dents were connected by an economic and political system with a common interest in slave labour. Jesse Grant was a successful tanner. Northern leather (along with many other manufactured goods) was in high demand in the south; southern cotton fuelled the textile mills of the north. The worlds of slavery and freedom overlapped in more than personal relationships. Like Lincoln, Grant came to understand that the civil war was a war of liberation. After Grant’s early victory at Fort Donelson, more than 200 enslaved people seized in the attack were declared “contraband” – effectively seized “goods” in the hands of the Union. Grant admired the tens of thousands of black soldiers who enlisted in the US Army as it marched through the south, and vigorously defended the rights of black veterans. But even the most enlightened white Americans laboured under the weight of more than two centuries of slavery in the American colonies and the US. “Contrabands” lived under a system that presumed freed people required white guidance. Grant’s respect for black soldiers reflected a conviction that freedom had been “earned” through military service. He was on the side of the angels; he put steel and lead behind abolitionist rhetoric. But Chernow’s focus on finding a happy ending for his subject leads him to look past the ways racism shaped not only slavery, but also white anti-slavery. After Robert E Lee’s surrender at Appomattox, wealthy Americans lavished Grant with cash and homes in Philadelphia and Washington DC. As president, Grant rewarded his patrons with access, appointments and policies friendly to big business. But somewhere in the midst of the war, he became a politician. In war, his nickname was “Unconditional Surrender Grant”. As general, he answered only to Lincoln. As president, he answered to Congress and a growing electorate. New immigrants and settlers were an important Republican voting bloc. Grant served their interests as he presided over the final violent push to consolidate American colonial power over Native American land in the west. Although he loathed the Democrats for their racism and lingering taste for secession, he feared their power in the south, and their influence over white northerners growing tired of calls for African American civil rights. In the deep south during Reconstruction, African Americans were elected in numbers to state and local offices, in a dramatic repudiation of white supremacy. The Ku Klux Klan and other white paramilitaries emerged in violent reaction. Grant sent federal troops and agents of the new department of justice south to protect civil rights and root out terrorist conspiracies. But in 1875, he reversed this policy when he declined to order troops into Mississippi as the state prepared to write a new constitution. Grant feared that the Republicans might lose the governorship of Ohio to the Democrats if he sent in the army. In Mississippi, white politicians claimed they had recovered “home rule”, and set to work disenfranchising black voters and building the scaffolding of legal segregation and a racist police state. Chernow argues that Grant had “no safe middle ground” on the south or for Native Americans. He might be right – but if he is, then, for all of Grant’s personal redemption, he played a role in an American tragedy. As a politician, he was caught between a growing white electorate that had little interest in civil rights for black Americans and black citizens who needed the support of Unconditional Surrender Grant. If drinking was Grant’s private struggle, the fight for the emancipation of 4 million enslaved African Americans was his struggle on the political and military stage. Comparisons between booze and slavery were common in the temperance movement. As one teetotal pamphlet put it, “alcohol binds … in a bondage from which … there is no hope of enfranchisement in this world”. Chernow has an instinct for redemption. He picks out Grant’s efforts for enslaved people during the war, and for newly enfranchised people afterwards. But individual sobriety and mass emancipation are not moral equivalents. Grant’s personal redemption did not equate to the redemption of the American republic. • Grant is published by Head of Zeus.

So it’s a thrill to see a really outstanding film which provides it, as well as being itself about sensual pleasure – about the desire that precedes it, about an ecstatic submission to love, about the intelligent cultivation of all these things. It is a story of a passionate affair between an older and younger man and reaches out to anyone with a pulse. James Ivory has adapted André Aciman’s novel and it is directed by Luca Guadagnino. This film constitutes a distinct advance from his previous (excellent) film, A Bigger Splash, which in turn developed the promise of the one before that, I Am Love. The setting is the early 1980s and Armie Hammer plays Oliver, a handsome, brilliant young scholar who has been invited to the Italian lakeside villa of a distinguished professor of antiquities, Mr Perlman, played by Michael Stuhlbarg, to assist him in his research. It is not, in fact, an onerous task, more a privilege for a favoured grad student. An idyllic, leisured summer is in prospect, with a little cataloguing and venturing out with Perlman to view those classical statues that have been recovered from the lake. But all that’s really required is good conversation and companionship. Oliver doesn’t have to do much more than hang out with Perlman’s charming family, neighbours and friends; swimming, bicycling, lunching, dining, dancing, drinking, sunbathing in various states of alluring undress. The local women admire the beautiful Oliver and so does Perlman’s delicate, moody, highly strung son Elio, played by Timothée Chalamet. There are some heterosexual encounters for them, but these are each just prototypical foreplay for the main event: the hookup between Elio and Oliver. Since this film has come out, a lot has been made critically of Elio and Oliver’s scene with the peach, and that is a sensationally erotic and candid moment, with hints of TS Eliot’s Prufrock, or even Philip Roth’s Portnoy’s Complaint. But it isn’t why I value the movie, whose moments of passion and yearning are more diffuse, less showy, though no less explicit. Oliver and Elio’s love is exciting and sexy and moving because of the sophistication and emotional intelligence with which it is framed: a physical liaison in which a great deal is a stake, but intriguingly, homophobia as such does not seem to be the major issue or crucial plot point that it would be in almost any other drama. Oliver says that his father would be disgusted, but Elio’s father very much is not, and his understanding and moral wisdom is part of what makes this film such a thing of wonder, particularly in his final speech to Elio, reproduced closely from Aciman’s original book. Intriguingly, Guadagnino has now announced his Linklateresque intention to develop a sequel, based on later parts of the novel, which this film does not touch on. Call Me By Your Name reminded me of the extravagant passion of early Alan Hollinghurst novels like The Folding Star or The Spell, and I can easily imagine Guadagnino bringing those to the screen. Hammer himself gives an excellent performance: sensitive and authoritative, though perhaps he is rather obviously older than his character’s age, and so the difference in age and worldly knowledge is greater than is theoretically intended in the drama. Stuhlbarg is always such a great performer – a leading player in the Coens’ A Serious Man – but often confined to supporting roles. Yet rarely are they are wonderfully written as this. And Chalamet is piercingly honest as Elio. It is the kind of performance that isn’t just down to actorly technique but openness and emotional purity. It’s an unmissable film.

Last year’s follow-up, The Muse, about a painting that connects 1930s southern Spain to a Trinidadian immigrant in 60s London, was another bestseller. The 35-year-old Londoner’s first novel for children, The Restless Girls, a feminist retelling of the Grimms’ fairytale The Twelve Dancing Princesses, will be published next September. A two-part TV adaptation of The Miniaturist, starring Romola Garai and Anya Taylor-Joy, is on BBC1 at 9pm on 26 and 27 December. The novel is published by Picador (£7.99). 1 | TV Alias Grace This is the Netflix adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s novel, based on the true story of servant Grace Marks, who was arrested aged 16 for her role in two murders at the house near Toronto where she worked. It examines not only whether she did it but sexual hypocrisy and class divisions. With this and The Handmaid’s Tale, it’s as if Atwood’s suddenly become our top TV screenwriter. She’s always been a huge hero of mine: I studied Cat’s Eye at A-level, have read The Blind Assassin three times and have a signed copy of Alias Grace from when it was first published in 1996. And she called her daughter Jessie, so she’s clearly got great taste. 2 | Instagram Mari Andrew @bymariandrew and Lucy Knisley @lucyknisley These are two American graphic artists whose Instagram feeds I absolutely love. They’re just a joy and both have phenomenally huge followings. I work alone and social media can prove too much of a distraction but it also provides some cheering little moments of connectivity. I left Twitter for five months and didn’t miss it. For me, Instagram is a friendlier, more generous, supportive place. 3 | Play Beginning This deserved its rave reviews at the National Theatre and has just been given a West End run, starting in January. Written by David Eldridge and directed by Polly Findlay, it’s an absolutely beautiful and very funny two-hander between Sam Troughton and Justine Mitchell, who is one of my favourite stage actresses. It’s one long scene of will-they-won’t-they dialogue between a couple at the end of a housewarming party, but Eldridge manages to vacuum-pack all manner of existential dilemmas into 100 minutes – about social class, potential parenthood and the mess of modern life. 4 | Documentary Joan Didion: The Centre Will Not Hold It’s surprising that this Netflix documentary, directed by her nephew Griffin Dunne, is the first film anyone’s made about Didion, given her advanced years and extraordinary life – from her presence as a reporter at major events in the 60s, through to her accounts of the deaths in quick succession of her husband and daughter. She’s a very singular person with a pervasive influence on other writers. 5 | Hotel Mama Ruisa, Rio de Janeiro This boutique hotel in the Santa Teresa barrio is the most beautiful little place. You feel instantly more stylish and classy just by being there. The swimming pool is surrounded by palm trees and hummingbirds. The balconies have views of Sugarloaf Mountain. The decor is understated and tasteful with little splashes of kitsch. It’s run by Jean Michel Ruis, who’s impossibly handsome and reminds me of the dashing, debonair Brazilian millionaire [José da Silva Pereira] in Breakfast at Tiffany’s. His fluffy cat, Colette, comes into your room if you leave the window open. The seven rooms are each themed around a historical figure; we stayed in the Carmen Miranda suite. Great passionfruit caipirinhas too. 6 | Book 13 Ways of Looking at the Novel by Jane Smiley This is brilliant for anyone who’s a reader or a writer or both. I saw Jane Smiley at Adelaide Literary festival and it was one of those shy audiences where nobody had any questions at the end of her reading, so she sang instead - she just launched into an unaccompanied protest song from the 60s. She was a hoot – sharp as a nail and so candid about her four marriages. This book was written in response to 9/11 when she was feeling “What use is all this art? What good is literature?”, and set herself a task to read 100 novels. It’s literary criticism from a writer’s craft point of view. The only drawback is that it makes your to-read list even longer than it already is. 7 | Exhibition Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams, Paris Celebrating 70 years of the fashion house, this is a bit like the Alexander McQueen exhibition at the V&amp;A - and it’s mind-blowing. It’s at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs and so rammed with original couture, there’s an embarrassment of riches. It’s chronological but also arranged by colour, which is stunning. And at the end, just when you’re thinking it can’t carry on, it opens out into this huge atrium with stars projected on to the ceiling and there are the famous gowns worn by Elizabeth Taylor, Marion Cotillard, Emma Watson, the one Jennifer Lawrence fell over in at the Oscars and Natalie Portman’s from the Miss Dior ads. It’s actually quite shocking because you don’t realise how tiny these people are. If you’re in Paris, also make sure you go to Du Pain et Des Idées bakery. For €1.40, you can get one of their little doughy pillows called pavés, filled with reblochon cheese and lardons, or goat’s cheese and honey. I always get one of each, obviously, and they’re so bloody good. This article contains affiliate links to products.

The rights associated with EU citizenship were core to my decision to accept the offer of teaching at the University of Oxford. However, after having contributed to UK higher education for more than a decade, I increasingly felt less welcome as the political discourse on “benefit tourism” developed over the years. The decision by the British electorate to vote for Brexit was the final tipping point for our decision to leave. Having spent only very little of my professional life in Germany, working at one of Germany’s leading universities is a new and exciting experience. The University of Tübingen has been more than welcoming and not only recruited me, but also two further members of my team, both EU citizens, from Oxford. Here we continue our work on the social rights of EU citizens. ‘I didn’t like the prospect of having to queue for hours to cross the border’: Una, Irish Returned in 2016 After studying and working in the NHS, I moved back home. The original motivation behind my move was saving to buy a house. However during the time I was moving, the junior doctors’ strike, Brexit, increasing anti-European sentiment and chronic, dangerous underfunding of the NHS derailed my plans. The final nail in the coffin was the comments of the health secretary, which implied European doctors would no longer be welcome in the NHS. And, of course, the prospect of having to queue for hours to cross the border. The Irish health service is not without its problems but the essentials of good-quality public service healthcare remain the same. Tax is slightly higher here, but then again so is my salary. The training I am getting in my chosen specialty is superior to that offered in the UK. It’s good to be home. ‘Brexit felt like a massive spit in the face’: Krzysztof, 25, Polish Returned in 2017 I worked as an aerospace engineer in the UK but there ended up being too much propaganda against the Polish, and Brexit felt like a massive spit in the face to all who are not British. It was a shame that after 10 years of living in a country I thought was my home, I’ve been so brutally asked to get out. The UK is growing inward, but the government, instead of educating people about the benefits of migration (both to them and to the migrants), has decided to use us as scapegoats to cover their incompetence. Poland is considerably better since I left as a teenager 10 years ago, so I decided to try it here. There’s better weather, I have more money left over after expenses and I can actually afford to buy a house. Most important of all nobody tells me to ‘go home’. What’s not to like? ‘The UK has gone backwards in its attitude towards non-English’: Rolph, Dutch In the process of returning I have lived in the UK for more than 50 years and I am disgusted with the way England feels like it has turned its back on the UK. The government has misled its citizens by only concentrating on the money we would be getting back and the way the UK can control immigration once we leave the EU. It is not possible to make a direct comparison between the two countries, but during my time in the UK I feel it has gone backwards in its attitude towards non-English. ‘I couldn’t look people in the eye after Brexit’: Cat, Swedish Moved to Italy There were many factors that made us leave: the pollution and the way the English school system is stuck in Victorian times to name but a few. Then came Brexit. This turned everything upside down. I couldn’t look people in the eye anymore. Even those who voted remain were being flippant about it. I wasn’t allowed to be angry. Italy has got plenty of problems but the Italians are kinder and a bit more straightforward. We live in a house that we bought for less than the cost of a one-bed in London. We are surrounded by green and amazing views, have a pool and 1,000 olive trees. We want to live differently and try to give our children a different perspective on life. ‘I can plan my life as a person – not as a bargaining chip’: Miguel Lopes, 24, Portuguese Returned in 2017 Since the Brexit vote I have felt very unwelcome. Seeing things such as landlords refusing to rent to EU citizens, permanent residency cards not having any effect after Brexit and the limbo we are being subjected to has made me decide to leave. Real wages have dropped too, especially for people who have to send money abroad to pay their expenses back home. It is not worth being away from your loved ones in exchange for hatred and low standards of living. I am currently living with less money in my pocket but I can finally plan my life and know what is ahead of me as a person – not as a bargaining chip. I had a partner when I was in the UK who unfortunately was not in a position to return with me, but who understood the reasons behind my decision. After being back I’m finally being able to find myself again. I would never go back to the UK unless things changed radically and it became the country it once was."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/06/a-civilised-society-supports-people-in-need-but-our-brutal-system-shatters-lives","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T05:59:08Z","webTitle":"A civilised society supports people in need, but our brutal system shatters lives | Aditya Chakrabortty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/06/a-civilised-society-supports-people-in-need-but-our-brutal-system-shatters-lives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/06/a-civilised-society-supports-people-in-need-but-our-brutal-system-shatters-lives","fields":{"headline":"A civilised society supports people in need, but our brutal system shatters lives","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Simon’s death certificate tidies away his life in a few terse official phrases. Date of death: 12 November 2017. Causes: “a) Fatty liver” and “b) Alcohol misuse”. No bureaucratic curiosity about how a 51-year-old’s life came to be cut so short. Which leaves his only brother, Dave, dealing with the grief and asking all the whys. Why did Simon die so young? Why did no one else try to help? No obituaries will be written for Simon, no plaques mounted, no tributes passed by politicians. But if you want to understand how Britain fails so many people in so many places, it’s stories like his you need to study. Some people’s lives are like arrows, flying straight to their destinations. Not Simon’s. The Rhymney Valley, in south Wales, is where he was born and died, but it wasn’t where he spent most of his adult years, and it was never where he meant to land up. Bright boys, he and Dave had one notion drummed into them: get an education, and get out. On TV, Dave remembers, “We’d see the yuppie revolution going on in London – the Porsches and the red braces. It may as well have been another country.” For them, Thatcher meant mines closing, factories shutting, men being laid off in their thousands, and families going under. Both sons flew away. Simon was the high-flyer, leaving Wales to do a science degree, going to Cambridge for postgraduate study, and becoming a software engineer with a giant defence firm. He married and settled far away, in Bushey, on the outskirts of London. He had got on his bike; he had looked for work. Now he was earning three times what his younger brother was making, and raring to join the yuppies. Just as he was starting to live the dream, the dream fell to bits. He got divorced. He got laid off. Then their mother’s breast cancer returned – this time for good. The prodigal son moved back, moved in, and became her carer. Dave doesn’t remember him complaining once during the years their mother spent deteriorating and then dying. Such setbacks await all of us, but one test of any civilised society is how well it supports us through them. In Simon’s case, Britain botched this test – over and over again. By the time his mother died, he had spent seven years outside the job market. It was 2007, the start of the credit crunch, and the economy was slowing. Even in boomtown London such a gap on the CV would have raised recruiters’ eyebrows. Here in south Wales, where jobs were already scarce, it was the kiss of death. Besides, it simply did not have positions for Si, with his Cambridge postgrad and software engineering background. Simon “spent 25 years building up to be somebody”, says Dave. A quarter-century observing the social mobility rules laid down by Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair. He had aspired, he’d grafted, he’d kept his side of the bargain. But while social mobility trumpets opportunity for individuals, it ignores the communities where those people live. The result was that Simon’s ambitions had outgrown his home, and now he was trapped. Dave showed me the small terrace house their mother passed on to Simon, where he spent the last years of his life. No one was about as we walked through the speck of a village – just two long rows of cars parked outside the train station. This is the new Welsh commuter class that economists such as Cardiff University’s Calvin Jones talk about, the people who travel from the valleys to staff the call centres, shops and other minimum-wage employers in Cardiff or Newport. Governments in Westminster and Cardiff Bay have spent decades promising to rebuild the shattered economy of south Wales. Serious money has been spent on shopping malls, new motorways and sweeteners for big business. Each time, the firms come, take the cash and – at best – leave a few poverty-paying jobs. You see the same cycle in so many deindustrialised parts of Britain. And each time, the politicians learn no lessons, and try the same thing again. A few minutes from Simon’s old home is the town of Bargoed, where the greatest excitement in recent years was the opening of a Morrisons. Much of the rest of the high street is just memories: a huge statue to commemorate dead miners, the chapel turned into a library, and shop after shop with its shutters pulled down for good. Simon signed on at the jobcentre, which told him to apply for 35 jobs a week. He sent off to become a teaching assistant, a warehouse operative, all the minimum wage jobs going. Barely an application led to an interview. Sometimes, “angry and very down”, he’d miss his targets or appointments. He would get sanctioned, go broke, and have to call on Dave to tide him over. After years of knockbacks, Simon declared he’d never be able to work again. It came almost as a relief. “It meant he didn’t have to think of himself as such a failure. Now he could be a victim.” Simon had always been a pub man. But now he’d get up in the morning and start on a glass of watered-down scotch and a sci-fi DVD. By the end of a day, he’d have finished the DVDs, his fags and an entire bottle of Scotch. Why does Dave think no employer wanted him? His answer comes back in a small, tight voice. “No one wants a 50-year-old, unemployed, overweight, drinking guy on the books, do they?” Yet there are so many of them, all surplus to the requirements of this shrunken economy. A GP in Bargoed estimates that up to one in 10 of her patients have some kind of drink or drug addiction. Up to one in three suffer depression or anxiety. In these parts, a newborn boy can expect to live just over 61 years in good health; in the richest parts of London, it’s 75 years. Having been one of Blair’s strivers, Simon was now one of George Osborne’s skivers. He was moved on to disability benefits, before the Department for Work and Pensions assessors declared him fit for work. His money would periodically stop until his GP contested the verdict. This spring, he was moved on to universal credit, which meant six weeks with barely a penny. Again and again, it was Dave who had to bail him out. It was Dave who suggested jobs Simon could apply for, small businesses he might start. The younger brother was filling in for the state, while Si lived in ripped clothes and ate junk. “The government was abusing a vulnerable man.” Alcoholic Simon would go to the local NHS drink service once every few weeks – and every few months, he’d end up in such a bad state he would be admitted to hospital. They’d “dry him out, then spit him out”, says Dave. According to the thinktank the Nuffield Trust, the Welsh health system is underfunded by £500m a year. Simon died in his small house, waiting to go back into hospital to dry out. He grew up in a town with men who’d had to dig out children from the Aberfan mining disaster; he died the year Grenfell Tower burned down. When such obvious tragedies strike, the politicians and the press vow to tackle the social injustices that caused them. But Simon was just one man dying in plain sight of his neighbours, his family and state officials. Far easier to chalk up his death to a fatty liver and booze, rather than inequality and austerity and the false promises peddled by politicians from Thatcher to May. A dead man, a dying town: he spent his last days being told he’s fit for work in an economy that has next to no work. What’s left is a younger brother beating himself up about what he should have done and angry at others for letting them both down. Before we part, Dave asks: “Why wasn’t there someone who could step in and help? Is that naive of me? To think that a modern, 21st-century society could do that for people who need it?” The names in this piece have been changed and details obscured in order to protect the identity of Simon’s family"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"global/2017/dec/12/weekly-notes-queries-infatuation-love","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T11:59:33Z","webTitle":"Is it romance or is it just infatuation?

He left his home at 16 to chase his dream of becoming a professional in the United States. Born and raised in London, the full-back has travelled extensively, from Sweden to Iran, via Sporting Kansas City, Finland, Germany and Switzerland, to ply his trade and last season joined Shakhter Karagandy, becoming the first Englishman to play club football in Kazakhstan. According to Amnesty International “the rights to freedom of expression, of peaceful assembly and of association remain restricted” in Kazakhstan, so it is not somewhere to go without knowing what you are getting into. Its most famous export is a fictional character, Borat, from whom Kazakhs distance themselves. The key for the 29-year-old Aiyegbusi was the money on offer, allowing him to earn wages unattainable in the countries in which he had previously found employment, while his season in Iran is proof he has few reservations about where he plays. On the pitch Aiyegbusi is adept at adjusting to situations but during his time in Karaganda he became the centre of attention in the city, not for his sporting capabilities, but the colour of his skin. “It’s very rare for them to see someone with black skin. In Astana and Almaty they see it but not so often and even then they’ll give you a good look,” Aiyegbusi says. “They only see black people in movies. Karaganda is the fourth or fifth biggest city in Kazakhstan, so it’s quite small so when they see a black person, all eyes are on you. They would want a photo or a selfie as it’s something they think they won’t see for the rest of their life. It’s not because you’re playing football, it’s because you’re a black guy. It intrigues them.” Aiyegbusi’s family run a successful business, so he knows the value of money and the realisation that a year in Kazakhstan would be better for his long-term ambitions. “I’ve played in Finland and Sweden where you get a good salary but it’s on the other end of the spectrum of what someone would expect for a footballer’s wage. I’ve always had a business mind about life after football, so going to Kazakhstan was an opportunity to get a much better salary than in second leagues over here [in England] and in Europe. I could make some money and get good savings so I could set up my own thing when I’m done with football.” Understandably, there are worries for someone moving into the unknown, but Aiyegbusi was open to anything his new home could confront him with. “My biggest concern, especially from my experience in Iran, was maybe not receiving all I was meant to receive. I’ve travelled around the world, in football and outside of football, and I’m always up for seeing new cultures, how people live, whether it be higher class or lower class, being in all different environments, so there was nothing fearful in my mind. It was just a matter of making sure I got the money they said they’d pay me. When you leave mainland Europe it gets like that, there’s a deal on the table and sometimes you don’t get all your money and that becomes a problem.” The closest Aiyegbusi came to playing in his homeland was being offered a four-month contract by the Brentford manager Uwe Rösler, but he turned it down in favour of moving to Finland, a rare regret in a nomadic career. Since then he has moved around a year at a time in order to find a new place to play. The weather and culture in Kazakhstan made him take a step back after spending his first six weeks with the club in pre-season training in the warmth of Turkey. “I was hit by cold and winter blizzard weather, which I had experienced in Sweden but I hadn’t lived so long through those moments, as in Sweden you would get the last two weeks of winter. In Kazakhstan it was weather like I’d never experienced before, it was a shock. “It was an eye-opener, in terms of the infrastructure and town planning of the city, but in the first three or four weeks we stayed in Astana, the capital, which is a fairly new city. It’s basically a cold Dubai; the buildings are new, they have westernised structures. It was only two hours or so away from where I was, so it was good to know I had an escape if I wanted to go and feel like I was in Europe.” Shakhter Karagandy qualified for the Champions League as recently as 2013 when they lost in dramatic fashion to Celtic in a qualifying play-off but their facilities cannot compare with what is on offer at other leading sides. They still reside in the Kazakh top flight, finishing seventh out of 12 last season. Aiyegbusi scored the winner in the fourth minute of injury time – his only goal in 20 appearances – against Akzhayik to ensure survival. “The club itself and the professionalism is not like I’ve experienced. It’s not bad but it’s not top notch, it’s not what you expect coming from Europe or MLS. It wasn’t a shock, as I’m up for anything, but it was nowhere near the standard of what I’ve experienced before. Most teams would train where they play, so for the first few months of the season we played on synthetic grass in another city and trained there as well, which caused a lot of problems as players get injured as the grounds which we played on are not beneficial for the longevity of players, and I experienced that a little bit myself.” In a 10-month period in Kazakhstan, Aiyegbusi had a lot to take in – from the slaughtering of a lamb before each game to the attitude of the club’s hierarchy towards its staff. He became a spokesman for the dressing room, refusing to suffer at the hands of those above him. “I come from a different culture and I don’t understand their culture, so when I’m there it’s about adapting and understanding. They do things I don’t agree with and I think it’s their culture that whoever is at the top, they can say what they want and treat you how they want and it’s a type of bullying. “They do it so easily that they do it with foreign players and some foreign players can brush it off, but sometimes you need to put them back in check, let them know you’re not a kid, you’re a man and if I speak to you with respect then you better do the same to me.

Anderson studied the reviews into MI5 and counter-terror policing’s handling of intelligence before four terror attacks in Westminster in March, Manchester in May and London Bridge and Finsbury Park in June. Here are some of Anderson’s key findings: The attack by Salman Abedi on Manchester Arena in May, which claimed the lives of 23 people including Abedi, with hindsight may have been preventable. Anderson says: “It is conceivable that the Manchester attacks in particular might have been averted had the cards fallen differently.” Intelligence about Abedi was misinterpreted. Anderson reports that on two occasions in the months before the attack, intelligence was received by MI5, the significance of which was not fully appreciated at the time. “It was assessed at the time not to be terrorism but to possible non-nefarious activity or to criminality on the part of Salman Abedi. In retrospect, the intelligence can be seen to have been highly relevant to the planned attack,” he says. In the weeks before the Manchester attack in May, an exercise to examine which of 20,000 former terror suspects were worth further inquiry identified Abedi as “one of a small number of individuals … who merited further examination”. A meeting to discuss Abedi’s case after intelligence suggested he may be worth more attention was scheduled by MI5 for 31 May, nine days after the bombing. MI5 denies that any further investigation into Abedi would have thwarted the attack. “It is unknowable whether such an investigation would have allowed Abedi’s plans to be pre-empted and thwarted: MI5 assesses that it would not,” Anderson reports. Three of the six attackers were on MI5’s radar. Abedi and the Westminster Bridge attacker, Khalid Masood, who killed five people in March including a police officer, were one-time suspects but reprioritised. Only the London Bridge attacker Khuram Butt was under active MI5 investigation when he, along with two other men, launched an attack in June, killing eight people. He was suspected of potential involvement in attack planning. Investigative actions by MI5 and police were “for the most part sound” but “many learning points have emerged”, Anderson says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/dec/07/the-50-best-tv-shows-of-2017-no-9-the-vietnam-war","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"The 50 best TV shows of 2017: No 9 The Vietnam War","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/07/the-50-best-tv-shows-of-2017-no-9-the-vietnam-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/07/the-50-best-tv-shows-of-2017-no-9-the-vietnam-war","fields":{"headline":"The 50 best TV shows of 2017: No 9 The Vietnam War","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"If television were a war, drama would be the current superpower, with reality and talent shows providing supporting firepower. Helpless against this advance, the forces of documentary huddle on a last thin strip of unsurrendered territory, starved of funding and troops, with the British fort defended by a 91-year-old general, David Attenborough. Given this battlefield, it is heartening that this year should have seen one of the highest achievements of factual programme-making – although chastening to UK viewers that it came not from our own huge public service infrastructures, but America’s PBS. With The Vietnam War, producers Ken Burns and Lynn Novick reached the summit of a remarkable project about America’s three defining military conflicts, following The War (2007), which told the story of 1939-45, and Burns’ The Civil War (1990). Historical documentary has three essential elements – speakers, archive and stance – which Burns and Novick executed perfectly. They interviewed 100 living witnesses (from, crucially, both sides of the conflict), and their researchers found vivid video and stills spanning the White House (President Nixon’s reception for returned POWs) to a local TV station that invited families to record Christmas messages for troops in Vietnam. The latter footage illustrated the story of Denton W Crocker Jr, an eager American patriot killed in 1966, a fable of futile sacrifice that lies like a landmine under episodes three and four. And, although there have been twitterings of dispute from some interested parties, impartial viewers would surely struggle to find a greater model of journalistic objectivity. The US involvement in Vietnam has often been regarded as an inexplicable folly, but Burns and Novick methodically show how it arose from American anti-communism and military-imperial arrogance, and the crossing of the bloodline beyond which it seems that losses can only be justified by risking even more. Testimony to the directors’ thoroughness is that, while America’s direct involvement in Vietnam lasted from 1965-75, the series spans over a century and a half: from 1858, when French colonialism seeded poisons in the region, to today, when the lessons of the misadventure remain contested in US culture. While the whole series should be required viewing for any president or prime minister tempted by a foreign conquest, the final episode, The Weight of Memory, is an especially important lesson about consequence. The BBC should be given credit for bringing this masterpiece to a British network audience, although it deserves censure for relegating it to the niche BBC Four rather than placing it in peak-time on Two, or even One. Broadcasters in the UK should also reflect hard on whether the industry here could ever now provide the production time and money necessary to make a historical series as magisterial as this. An editorial scruple of Burns and Novick is that interviewees are captioned with the position they held during the period they are speaking about. This means that Tim O’Brien, Karl Marlantes and Bảo Ninh are identified in early episodes only as fighters on either side, and Neil Sheehan as a journalist. Only later are they credited with four of the greatest books on Vietnam: respectively the novels The Things They Carried, Matterhorn, The Sorrow of War, and A Bright Shining Lie. Those books would stand on the prime shelf in any library of Vietnam history, but The Vietnam War must grace alone the video section. By modern convention, the series is categorised online as “season one” but, in the histories of Vietnam and TV, it is hard to see how this could be followed.

There has been a new entry to the long list of time-wasting sensations taking the internet by storm. Forget planking, cinnamon eating, ice-bucket pouring, mannequin standing and bottle flipping: December 2017 is all about pretending to step on to an invisible box. The invisible-box challenge got huge this week when a clip of a Texan high school cheerleader scored millions of views after it was posted on Saturday. In the six-second video, Ariel Olivar pats a phantom box with her hand, then puts her right foot on it before stepping over it. It’s basic mime, but it’s impressive enough to have inspired thousands of less agile challengers to share their own attempts (warning: you may fall on your face). Of course, nothing is original online; Olivar is only the most successful proponent of the challenge. Dontez Hines, a college football player, did it in August – and there are older efforts than his. But a thing isn’t a thing until it’s a thing. In any case, Olivar should be congratulated for popularising a challenge that requires more physical activity than, say, submitting to an ice bucket – even if that did have a charitable aim. How far will it go? Celebrities have been slow to take up the challenge. Will Phil and Holly giggle while trying it in the This Morning studio? Will Ellen have a bash? I refused to be filmed, but I made my own attempt, in a locked room. I can report that it’s not as easy as Olivar makes it look. Managing to keep my upper foot high and still while lifting the other leg and transferring my bodyweight up and forwards requires core strength that I don’t have. I’m pretty sure my glutes were failing me, too, although it’s hard to say – it’s all over rather quickly. But if this challenge dries out on the vine of digital content and is succeeded by the “tripping on a kerb while drunk” mime test, I’ll be ready."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jan/01/art-shows-2018-preview-picasso-punk-tacita-dean-monet","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-01T16:00:03Z","webTitle":"From Picasso at his mightiest to gods of American cool: the hottest art shows of 2018","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/01/art-shows-2018-preview-picasso-punk-tacita-dean-monet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/01/art-shows-2018-preview-picasso-punk-tacita-dean-monet","fields":{"headline":"From Picasso at his mightiest to gods of American cool: the hottest art shows of 2018","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Revolt and Revolution Get the new year off to an angry start with this exhibition about art, popular culture and protest. Peter Kennard’s classic CND photomontages of the 1980s and a raw, intimate recording of The Internationale by Susan Philipsz are among the political artworks in a survey of how art is inspired by dissent, resistance and rebellion. Yet can protest art really change anything? The most pungent political art of modern times includes Picasso’s Guernica and John Heartfield’s anti-Nazi photomontages, but neither stopped Hitler. • 6 January-15 April, Yorkshire Sculpture Park. William Blake Britain’s most political and most mystical artist saw himself as a radical prophet crying out against war, poverty and enslavement. Blake’s passion for liberty and human fulfilment blazes in his illuminated books. He spent some of his most introspective years at a cottage in Felpham, Sussex, and this exhibition explores how that part of England infuses his vision of Albion, in which the whole of history plays itself out amid stone circles and village greens. • 13 January-25 March, Petworth House, West Sussex. The Enchanted Room Italy at the start of the 20th century was an old country desperately seeking a future. This made it one of the most fascinating laboratories of modernist art, and this exhibition lent from the Emilio and Maria Jesi collection at Milan’s Brera Art Gallery is packed with works by such giants as Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà and Giorgio de Chirico. The energy and aggression of futurism collides with the melancholy of De Chirico’s empty piazzas. • 24 January-8 April, Estorick Collection, London. Charles I: King and Collector The only British king to provoke a revolution and get his head chopped off was also our only truly imaginative royal art collector. This exhibition sets out to reunite art treasures that were sold by the Commonwealth after the execution of Charles I in 1649. If it works, it should be stupendous, for Charles owned Leonardo da Vinci’s John the Baptist and Caravaggio’s Death of the Virgin among other drop-dead masterpieces that are today spread through Europe’s museums. • 27 January-15 April, Royal Academy, London. Ragnar Kjartansson The 1959 Italian pop hit Il Cielo in Una Stanza is the raw material for this Icelandic artist’s latest surreal experiment on the borders of theatre and art. Originally performed by Mina, The Sky in a Room – as it translates into English – is a fragile, nostalgic gem that is here played continually for five hours a day, by a team of alternating musicians, on an 18th-century organ made for the wealthy Welsh arts patron Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn. A music lost in time. • 3 February-11 March, National Museum, Cardiff. Journeys with The Waste Land TS Eliot did crucial work on his great poem The Waste Land while staying in Margate. Some might say partially inspiring the bleakest literary work of the 20th century is nothing to boast about, but it’s a good excuse for this intriguing survey of Eliot and art. The fractured aesthetic of The Waste Land owes something to Wyndham Lewis and the vorticists with whom Eliot was familiar, yet it also anticipates surrealism. When you read it, the images that come to mind can range from Magritte’s painting The Menaced Assassin to the dusty landscapes of Salvador Dalí and Yves Tanguy. • 3 February-7 May, Turner Contemporary, Margate. Virginia Woolf British writing in the early 20th century was a lot more inspired than British art. Virginia Woolf is clearly one of the great pioneers of modernist fiction, while artists of her Bloomsbury circle pale beside the European revolutionaries of their time. Perhaps that is why it is Woolf, rather than her painter sister Vanessa Bell, is the subject of this Tate show promising ambitious feminist perspectives on literature, art and modern history. You can also see the lighthouse that inspired To the Lighthouse off nearby Godrevy Beach. • 10 February-29 April, Tate St Ives. Mark Dion This retrospective of Dion’s archeological and environmentalist installations showcases a tasteful and intellectual answer to Damien Hirst’s art of collecting. Dion explores rainforests and organises digs to gather arrays of objects that he displays in cases or rooms that pay homage to the cabinets of curiosity created by Renaissance princes. The results of a mudlarking experiment on the bank of the Thames and an enquiry into the idea of the surrealist object are among the wonders here. • 14 February-13 May, Whitechapel Gallery, London. Emil Nolde Many pioneers of modernism were banned by National Socialism as makers of “degenerate art”, but not many were themselves Nazis. Nolde was the exception. He had to endure Hitler’s condemnation of expressionist art like his, even though he had supported the Nazi party since the 1920s and saw his style as Aryan. His paintings are rightly admired now in spite of his vicious beliefs. Fierce and lurid, they see the sky, sea and sunflowers through delirious eyes drugged by a vision of the north. • 14 February-10 June, National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin. All Too Human: Bacon, Freud and a Century of Painting Life The frail and suffering human figure was British art’s most powerful theme in the middle of the 20th century. In the wake of Auschwitz and Hiroshima, paintings of people reduced to a fleshy essence of solitude, fear and survival made the art of Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud, Leon Kossoff and Frank Auerbach truly serious. At a time when abstraction ruled elsewhere, the “conservatism” of British painting gave it unique human immediacy. This could be a mighty exhibition. • 28 February-27 August, Tate Britain, London. Murillo: The Self-Portraits The paintings of Bartolomé Esteban Murillo can be hard to take seriously, let alone love. This 17th-century Spanish artist specialised in soft-edged religious tear-jerkers and lachrymose portraits of street children that look, today, sentimental rather than radical. Yet when he looked at himself in the mirror, he suddenly dropped all the greasy-lens stuff and pictured himself with metaphysical gravity. This may be a comeback for an artist who fell out of fashion more than a century ago. • 28 February-21 May, National Gallery, London. Ian Cheng/Sondra Perry Two American artists fascinated by technology hold simultaneous shows at the Serpentine’s two galleries. For Sondra Perry, the digital age offers new ways to see black American lives and history. Her videos and performances show how technology shapes identity and reclaims it as a tool of liberation. Ian Cheng creates gaming scenarios inspired by nature. There’s an optimism about these artists, who look to the science-based future at a time when American politics is governed by backwards-looking irrationality. • 6 March-3 June, Serpentine Gallery, London. Picasso 1932: Love, Fame, Tragedy What a thrill – Picasso at his mightiest and most stunningly imaginative rocks Tate Modern in a dazzling collection of works from just one explosive year. The best way to see Picasso’s creativity is up close and from day to day, which is why this collaboration with the Musée Picasso in Paris is a must. It lets you see Picasso’s changing moods and impulses in works he dated so they can be “read” like a diary. His passion for Marie-Thérèse Walter and unhappy marriage to Olga Picasso dominate. In France, the show is subtitled Année Erotique, so be warned. • 8 March-9 September, Tate Modern, London. Joan Jonas Since the late 1960s this pioneering New Yorker has mixed up media, played with gender and puzzled over identity. Some of her earliest works use mirrors to frame the simple question of who we are. By the early 1970s, she started using a video camera, one of the first artists ever to do so, to capture her performances. Works like her 1976 installation The Juniper Tree, in which a Japanese kimono, silk paintings, mirrors and video come together in a sinister fairytale, create rich, unsettling atmospheres. • 14 March-5 August, Tate Modern, London. Tacita Dean Poetry and soulfulness fill the art of Tacita Dean, whatever form it happens to take. From big bold drawings to even bigger photo-based pictorial works, from filmed portraits to romantic quests for lost sailors, she is one of the most imaginative and intelligent artists around. This remarkable event sees her take on three of art’s oldest genres – the portrait, landscape and still life – across three major institutions in a way that shows how everything changes, yet stays the same. A sublime vision. • 15 March-28 May, National Gallery and National Portrait Gallery, London; dates tbc, Royal Academy, London. Ten Days Six Nights Pioneering performance and video legend Joan Jonas joins Turner winner Mark Leckey in this annual exhibition – or is it a festival? – of live art. Installations by Jonas can be seen all day in the atmospheric subterranean setting of The Tanks, along with a piece by Jumana Emil Abboud based on Palestinian folktales. Evening events, inspired by the work of Jonas, include performances by Sylvia Palacios Whitman and Jason Moran. It’s all happening, here and now. • 16-25 March, Tate Modern, London. America’s Cool Modernism: O’Keeffe to Hopper “I saw the figure 5 in gold,” wrote the poet William Carlos Williams in a vision of a fire engine hurtling through a New York street with its glittering numeral against its red body. Charles Demuth visualised this mighty modernist image in one of the classic American paintings making a rare transatlantic journey for this exciting exhibition. Abstract urban nocturnes by Georgia O’Keeffe, the industrial art of Charles Sheeler, the alienation of Edward Hopper – welcome to the Jazz Age. • 23 March-22 July, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. The House of Fame: Curated by Linder Legendary punk photomontagist Linder Sterling has recently been the first resident artist at Chatsworth House in Derbyshire. It may sound an unlikely combination, but she has been sounding out its spirits and seeking the skeletons in its ornately carved closets. The results inform this exhibition, which is partly a retrospective of her surrealistic images since the 1970s, when they first appeared as record covers for the Buzzcocks and others, and partly a curated show in which she explores her influences. • 24 March-17 June, Nottingham Contemporary. Monet and Architecture When you think of the art of Claude Monet, you may not immediately connect it with architecture – but think again. The great facade of Rouen cathedral with its knobbly carvings and dark glass swims into view like a building in a dream in his series of paintings of this medieval marvel. The skyline of Venice similarly hangs in an ether of light in the paintings he did there. For Monet, these old buildings are ghostly shadows and silhouettes that seem to embody time itself. • 9 April-29 July, National Gallery, London. Rodin and Ancient Greece The human body was reinvented by Rodin as a poetic arrangement of expressive, loosely connected surfaces. He was attacked by contemporaries for the apparent chaos and anatomical emptiness of sculptures like his Monument to Balzac that seem to possess no inner solidity. What had happened to the tradition of anatomical accuracy that went back the nude statues of ancient Greece? Yet this exhibition argues that Rodin was entranced by Greek art and revered the Parthenon sculptures in the British Museum. It is an insight into the ancient soul of the first modern sculptor. • 26 April-29 July, British Museum, London."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/05/jordi-cuixart-prison-catalonia-rights-catalan-spain-eu","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T11:41:55Z","webTitle":"I’m in prison for defending Catalonia’s rights.

My mother emigrated from Murcia, a Spanish province, and my father was born in Badalona, the third most populated city in Catalonia. We spoke both Catalan and Spanish at home, like the large majority of Catalans with Spanish roots. I am 41 years old, I live in Barcelona. I am married with a seven-month-old son and two other children (stepchildren) whom I love as if they were my own. I am the 10th president of Òmnium Cultural – an organisation set up to promote the Catalan language and spread the region’s culture. It’s a position I hold completely voluntarily. I have been in prison for 50 days now, without a trial, accused of sedition, along with Jordi Sànchez, former president of the Catalan National Assembly. We are deprived of our freedom for having made use of our right to free expression and demonstration, for the simple act of publicly and democratically defending the right of Catalonia to decide its future as a people at the polls, like Quebec and Scotland did with the mutual agreement of the governments of Canada and the UK. But we have not committed any crime. The Spanish government has put us in prison for our ideas and opinions, for having organised mass peaceful, festive and family-oriented demonstrations, the images of which have been seen around the world. Today we are in prison not for being dangerous individuals or having committed fraud, theft or murder, but for our political ideas, shared by the 80% of Catalans who are in favour of holding a referendum on self-determination. There were more than 900 victims of Spanish police violence as they exercised their right to vote on 1 October. The repressive spiral of the Spanish government has extended to the members of the government of the Generalitat. Half went into exile in Belgium and the other half were immediately imprisoned. It was an unprecedented event in modern Europe: half of a democratically chosen government was sent to prison. On Sunday, as we draw closer to the Catalan election on 21 December, the former Catalan vice-president Oriol Junqueras, former cabinet member Joaquim Forn, Jordi Sànchez and myself as leaders of civic groups have been refused bail by Spain’s supreme court. The judge ruled that he believed there was a risk of criminal reiteration. Today, Òmnium Cultural has more than 90,000 members and is the main civic-cultural organisation in Catalonia. It was founded in 1961 by five businessmen to defend Catalan language and culture. The Franco dictatorship banned Òmnium from 1963 to 1967. Forty years later, its president has been imprisoned. From its origins until the present day, Òmnium has had a single objective: to guarantee social cohesion in Catalonia. We keep our firm commitment to share, from a perspective of mutual respect, this cultural, ideological, religious and social diversity. And under the protection of the universal declaration of human rights, defend the right to the self-determination of Catalonia, always through democratic and peaceful means. European institutions and leaders cannot continue to look the other way, failing to demand that our rights are respected and restored. The founding fathers of the EU built the project on the principles of dialogue, peace and democracy. Those have been clearly violated. The Catalan problem is a European problem. Failing to stand up for these principles could have dire economic, political and social consequences over the short-, medium- and long-term for millions of European citizens. We proclaim our innocence and our status as prisoners of conscience and insist that the Spanish government free us immediately. We must begin a cooling-off period of dialogue between the parties, in which I promise to dedicate the best efforts of Òmnium Cultural, as we have always done until now. Catalonia and Spain form part of the EU and everything that occurs from now on will affect the entire union. We are convinced that no one should renounce their responsibility. More than ever the EU must return to its roots: dialogue, peace and democracy. Civic society is calling for this, and it is the duty of political leaders to listen to the petitions of their fellow citizens. • Jordi Cuixart is the president of Òmnium Cultural"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2017/dec/05/theresa-may-struggles-to-rescue-brexit-deal-as-dublin-says-it-wont-back-down-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T18:46:31Z","webTitle":"Arlene Foster says draft of UK-EU Brexit deal came as 'big shock' to DUP – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/dec/05/theresa-may-struggles-to-rescue-brexit-deal-as-dublin-says-it-wont-back-down-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2017/dec/05/theresa-may-struggles-to-rescue-brexit-deal-as-dublin-says-it-wont-back-down-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Arlene Foster says draft of UK-EU Brexit deal came as 'big shock' to DUP – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"David Davis has claimed that “regulatory alignment” with the EU is what the government wants for the whole of the UK after Brexit. (See 3.07pm.) He said this was not the same as regulatory convergence, or staying in the single market, and it was not clear from his comments in the Commons whether this means the government is taking a new position on the (as yet unresolved) matter of whether it wants to stick quite closely to the European regulatory model after Brexit. But his words did imply that the government is keen to play down the suggestion that Northern Ireland will be different from the rest of the UK after Brexit. Davis said “regulatory alignment” was something for the whole of the UK. But he did not address one of the specific problems with the draft text of the Brexit deal released yesterday; that, in the event of there being “no deal”, it would commit Northern Ireland to shadowing EU regulation while leaving the rest of the UK to go its own way. (See 2.26pm.) Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has said that the DUP spent five weeks trying to get hold of a draft text of the UK-EU Brexit deal and that, when it finally saw it yesterday, it was “a big shock”. (See 5.17pm.) She told RTE: When we looked at the wording [on regulatory alignment]and had seen the import of all that we knew we couldn’t sign up to anything that was in that text that would allow a border to develop in the Irish Sea. And, in a separate interview with Sky, when it was put to her that the Irish government has said it will not budge on the substance of this point, she replied: The Irish prime minister can be as unequivocal as he likes. We’re also unequivocal in relation to these matters. The Telegraph’s Gordon Rayner says a telephone call between Foster and Theresa May planned for tonight may not take place. David Gauke, the work and pensions secretary, has said the government will release a set of reports on the operation of universal credit to a Commons select committee. He was speaking after Labour arranged for MPs to debate a motion this afernoon saying the papers must be published. If the government had tried opposing the motion, it faced defeat. Damian Green, Theresa May’s close ally, is facing possible legal action after accusing a former senior police officer of lying about pornography on the MP’s personal computer. UK rail fares will rise by 3.4% on January 2 – the largest increase for five years, train companies have announced. Brexit poses huge risks to food standards in the UK and will have “seismic implications” for its food and farming systems, according to a new report. Charlie Mullins, a prominent Conservative party donor has called for ministers to oust Theresa May after failing to strike a Brexit deal. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Ruth Davidson’s demands that any special deal with the EU for Northern Ireland should be extended across the UK has been unanimously endorsed by the Scottish Conservatives’ 13 MPs at Westminster, the party has said. The Scottish Tory group, which jumped from one solitary MP to 13 after June’s snap election, includes Eurosceptic MPs known to have voted leave, in Ross Thomson and Alister Jack, but also David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, who backed the group stance. In a statement, the party said: The Scottish Conservative group met today and unanimously agreed that we fully support the comments from Ruth Davidson MSP that the terms of any Brexit deal with the EU should be UK-wide. Their statement came after David Davis, the Brexit secretary, had told the Commons that any “regulatory alignment” with the single market to help keep the Irish border open would be UK-wide, reducing its immediate significance. But it suggests Davis and Number 10 have faced wider pressure from within the party to scrap yesterday’s mooted deal with the EU and Ireland to make the offer apply solely to Northern Ireland. It is understood that Mundell had earlier endorsed Davidson’s blunt warning on Tuesday morning that nothing could happen to undermine the UK’s internal market and constitutional balance in this morning’s UK cabinet meeting. The DUP leader Arlene Foster has said the text of the Irish border deal came as a “big shock” when she saw it yesterday. In an interview with RTE News about to be broadcast she said her party only saw the text late yesterday morning as British and Irish officials were tying up loose ends ahead of Theresa May’s lunch meeting with Jean Claude Juncker. “Once we saw the text, we knew it was not going to be acceptable,” she told RTE’s Northern Ireland correspondent Tommy Gorman. She told him the DUP had been asking for the text for five weeks. She also said she had a very open conversation with May after the DUP press conference in which she said they could sign not up to anything that would mean a border in the Irish sea. She told her “it could have been dealt with differently”. Foster said she had been told by British negotiators that the Irish government did not want her to see the text ahead of yesterday’s crunch meeting in Brussels. “We are told that the Irish government prevented it coming to us. Gorman asked: “Who told you that?” She replied: “The British negotiating team”. UPDATE: Here is more from the interview. Foster indicated she wanted the detailed negotiations relating to the future governance of the Irish border removed from the negotiating document and revealed that there had been “no contact” with Dublin over the text. She also attacked the “aggressive” campaign by the Irish government on Brexit and said unionists were spooked after the tanaiste Simon Coveney told a Dail committee that one of his aspirations was united Ireland in his political lifetime. This thesis was rejected by the deputy prime minister Coveney last Friday when he said it was difficult not to get drawn into identity politics when discussing northern Ireland but it was not an “green vs orange” issue. “I think the Irish government have insisted on a lot of detail in relation to the border – they don’t need to have detail to move on to phase two, so they can talk about trade, they have listened to the UK government and indeed ourselves around the fact we don’t want a hard border,” Foster told RTE. She went on: We want to move forward together, but instead of accepting that as bona fides, they have decided they want a lot more detail and they are pushing at an agenda which leads a lot of unionists that there is something else. I think it has been very clear that there has been a very aggressive agenda coming from Dublin recently. I regret that of course, when Simon Coveney went to the Dail committee and talked about his aspiration for a united Ireland in his political lifetime, I think a lot of people noted that and then noted his stance in relation to the border. People have jumped to conclusions. I don’t know whether those conclusions are right or wrong we will have to see in the future if that is the case. Nobody wants to see a hard border, but the reality is there is a border. It’s there because we are two different jurisdictions and people need to be reminded of that sometime. I’ve seen some commentary about how awful it is that the DUP are trying to cut off north-south trade, nothing could be further from the truth. We want north -outh trade to continue, but we fundamentally want east-west trade to continue as well because – and the two aren’t mutually exclusive, but they have been presented as thus in this document and that’s not something we can support. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, has told the BBC that he expects to meet Theresa May tomorrow or on Thursday to conclude the Brexit deal, but not on Friday or Saturday, Natalie Higgins reports. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has also been giving an interview to RTE, my colleague Lisa O’Carroll reports. This is from Sky’s David Blevins. This is from my colleague Jessica Elgot. Scotland’s 13 Conservative MPs have backed Ruth Davidson’s comments about how any regulatory alignment deal for Northern Ireland should apply to the whole of the UK. (See 10.08pm.) This is from the BBC’s Nick Eardley. MPs are debating universal credit at the moment. As the Press Association reports, the Conservative MP Heidi Allen was left in tears after hearing the “destitution” faced by people as a result of government welfare reforms. Allen struggled to speak following a speech by the Labour MP Frank Field, in which he described persuading a man not to commit suicide and how an organisation separately helped a child “crying through hunger”. Field, chairman of the Commons work and pensions committee, said the father of the child also said he had had a “lucky week” after neighbours invited him to a funeral “so they could finish off the food” once the other guests had been fed. Rising to speak after Field, Allen said: I don’t know where to start after that. I’m humbled by the words from my honourable, good friend from Birkenhead. No government is perfect, no benefits system is perfect, no debate, no motion is perfect, but by God we work together and make this better. Intervening to give Allen a chance to compose herself, Field said: I’m just amazed for the first time I’ve been able to report those events publicly without weeping. I’m so affected by them, I’m affected as she is. That’s the debate we’re really having - how do we represent here the desperateness of many of our constituents when many of us feel we can’t offer them hope. These are from Sam McBride, from the News Letter in Belfast. RTE’s Europe editor Tony Connelly has hit back at reports in the UK that his report of a leaked draft and amended document was part of “Irish propaganda” and unintentionally led to the collapse of talks. He said “RTE protects its sources” but he was able to confirm the leak did not come from the Irish government. He also pointed out he reported the leak at 11.15am, 15 minutes after Jean Claude Juncker confirmed to Leo Varadkar that the British had agreed the final wording. The Irish prime minister has said he believes there is plenty of time to salvage the Irish border Brexit deal, scuppered by the DUP before it was inked. Speaking for the second time since talks collapsed Leo Varadkar revealed that the controversial wording for the proposal to have “regulatory alignment” between Northern Ireland and the EU post Brexit was British negotiator’s preferred option, not Ireland’s. “There was an exchange of texts – one being regulatory divergence and no regulatory alignment. “We satisfied ourselves on Sunday night that we could accept either of those two lines and ‘regulatory alignment’ was what was accepted by British advisers on Monday morning,” he told the Irish parliament during leader’s questions. In the most detailed official account yet of the contents of the 15-page proposal, Varadkar revealed it provided for three potential outcomes in a final deal. 1) “UK free trade agreement that would allow free trade to continue not just north and south but between Britain and Ireland.” 2) “a bespoke arrangement involving technology and others things.” 3) if neither of this were agreed in the final Brexit deal there would be “ongoing regulatory alignment between north and south” which would have been “a back stop if all else failed”. Varadkar told the Dail that “ball is now in London’s court” and he “very much regretted” that it was not possible to conclude matters yesterday. But he said he was optimistic a deal could still be sealed as the EU council did not meet until 14 December, giving Theresa May enough time to square the proposal with the DUP. The Irish Ambassador to London called for the Democratic Unionists to step back and reflect calmly at the proposal to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland post-Brexit, blaming garbled leaks for leading the DUP to reject a document the Irish government thought the Unionists had accepted. Speaking at the Institute for Government in London, Adrian O’Neill also warned an agreement would have to be hammered out by the end of this week to be ready in time for the EU heads of government summit planned for next week. The summit has been slated to give the go ahead to the start of a second phase of Brexit talks focused on the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU. Urging the DUP to stay calm, he said: There are sometimes days like yesterday when something is about to happen, garbled versions get leaked in the media, people adopt robust positions, everyone gets very worked up, and sometimes it gets very difficult to de-escalate that in a couple of hours, and get people back into deal making. Sometimes what is needed for everyone to step back and to calmly think about it and to focus on the totality of the package on the table. Our hope is that is possible and the British government and the DUP are able to re-engage, and look at this afresh. He urged the DUP through “calm reflection to look at the document holistically”. He insisted the document contained a range of reassurances for unionists, including a recognition that the future constitutional status of Northern Ireland can only be altered by the provisions of the Good Friday agreement . The agreement prevents the unification of the island without referenda on both sides of the border. He did not deny specifically that the Irish government had been responsible for the leak in Brussels that so upset the DUP, saying instead it is never wise to make assumptions about the sources of leaks. And he indicated that aspects of the agreement for Ireland would not be settled until the second stage of the talks. There was a clear commitment to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, but he said the leaked passage in the document about preventing regulatory divergence was a backstop, and alternative routes to securing this goal that were closer to the UK government positions had also been set out as alternatives in the document. The Labour party has issued a statement clarifying its position on the single market and the customs union in the light of Sir Keir Starmer’s comments (see 3.07pm), the Mirror’s Dan Bloom reports. This implies that staying in the customs union for good is an option that the party would consider, but that it would only stay a member of the single market if single market rules were amended. Here are the main points from the David Davis’s urgent question about the Brexit talks. Davis, the Brexit secretary, said that “regulatory alignment” with the EU is what the government wanted for the whole of the UK after Brexit. This was not the same as regulatory convergence, or harmonisation, he claimed. And he made the point repeatedly to counter claims that the UK wanted an outcome that would separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. (See 2.26pm for more, including an explanation about how what is proposed for Northern Ireland does seem to be different.) In response to a question from Labour’s Yvette Cooper, Davis said that what he was saying was just what Theresa May said in her Florence speech. He told her: [May] made a very plain case for the sorts of divergence that we would see after we left. And she made the case that there are areas where we want the same outcome, but by different regulatory methods. We want to maintain safety, we want to maintain food standards, we want to maintain animal welfare, we want to maintain employment rights. We don’t have to do that by exactly the same mechanism as everybody else. That’s what regulatory alignment means. Adam Lent, director of the New Local Government Network, has a good follow up. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, urged the government to put staying in the customs union and the single market for good back on the table as negotiating options. He said: So the question for the government today is this: will the prime minister now rethink her reckless red lines and put options such as a customs union and single market back on the table for negotiation? Because if the price of the prime minister’s approach is the break-up of the union and reopening of bitter divides in Northern Ireland then the price is too high. In a speech in April during the election campaign Starmer suggested the UK would definitely leave the single market under Labour (he said staying in was incompatible with curbing freedom of movement). But during the summer Labour announced it would stay in the single market and the customs union during the transition (a policy subsequently adopted by the government). After the UQ Ben Bradshaw, the pro-European Labour MP, put out this statement on behalf of Open Britain, which is campaigning for a soft Brexit. He said: Today’s shift by the Labour frontbench, and its call for the single market and customs union to be put back on the table by the Government, is extremely welcome. Nearly every Labour MP who spoke in today’s urgent question called for the UK to stay in the single market and customs union. The Labour party is increasingly united around this position. Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Westminster, accused the Irish government of acting in an “aggressive and anti-unionist way” during the Brexit talks. He said: It should come as no surprise that the Dublin and Irish government wishes to advance its interests. The way it has gone about it in such an aggressive and anti-unionist way is disgraceful and has set back Anglo-Irish relations and damaged the relationships built up within Northern Ireland in terms of the devolution settlement - and that is going to take a long time to repair. Davis claimed that when people were voting to leave the EU, they knew they were voting to leave the customs union. The Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, a hardline Brexiter, praised the DUP for opposing the EU deal proposed yesterday. He said: [The DUP] have helped Her Majesty’s government stick to its own policy in these negotiations. Is it not essential that the red lines on maintaining the United Kingdom and on regulatory divergence whence the benefits of leaving come are indelible red lines? My colleague Daniel Boffey has this response from an EU official to what David Davis was saying in his UQ. (See 2.26pm.) Here is the key line from David Davis. Davis, the Brexit secretary, said that the government wanted the whole of the UK to have “regulatory alignment” with the EU after Brexit. Effectively he was conceded something that Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, proposed only this morning. (See 10.08am.) Davis made the point most explicitly in response to a question from the pro-remain Conservative MP Antoinette Sandbach, who asked for the “regulatory alignment” condition in the Brexit deal almost signed yesterday to apply to the whole of the UK. Davis replied: The presumption of the discussion was that everything we talked about applied to the whole United Kingdom. I re-iterate: alignment isn’t harmonisation, it isn’t having exactly the same rules. It is sometimes having mutually recognised rules, mutually recognised inspection, all of that sort of thing as well. And that is what we are aiming for. Davis repeatedly said that regulatory alignment would not involve the UK harmonising its rules with the EU. And he claimed that what he was saying about regulatory alignment had been set out by Theresa May in her Florence speech (see 1pm), although his words today seemed to go further than what she said. Later, in response to a question from Labour’s Stephen Timms (see 1.33pm), Davis said the UK would only be seeking “regulatory alignment” with the UK in the event of a trade deal. He implied that, if there were no trade deal, the UK would consider itself free to diverge. This is an area where there does seem to be a difference between what is proposed for Northern Ireland and for the rest of the UK because the key sentence in the draft that emerged yesterday (see 9.23am) talked about Northern Ireland maintaining regulatory alignment with the EU “in the absence of agreed solutions” - ie, in the event of no trade deal. It was a safety net clause, and that safety net only applied to Northern Ireland. Q: Are you not worried that you are jeopardising the integrity of the UK by your actions? No, says Dodds. He says MPs will not allow the UK to be broken up. It was gratifying to hear Ruth Davidson say that this morning, he says. Dodds says what matters is the text of an agreement. A text must translate the principles of what has been negotiated. Q: Does the DUP have a veto over what the government does? No, says Dodds. He says the Irish government has a veto. It is acting in a reckless and dangerous way. He says the tone has changed since Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney took power. Q: Would you tear up the confidence and supply agreement if the government went too far? Dodds says he does not think the government will propose anything that would separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, so that question won’t apply. He says the text the DUP were shown late yesterday morning was not consistent with what the DUP had been told to expect. It was too vague, he says. He says the “regulatory alignment” proposals were introduced by the Irish government. They are not necessary. There are sensible approaches to the border issue, such as trusted trader schemes. Dodds says the EU has given a veto to the Irish government. It might want to reconsider that, he says. Dodds says the DUP will work for as long as is necessary to get the right outcome. And he says if the Irish government continues its aggressive stance, it will put a deal at risk. He is now taking questions. Q: Do you want the government to walk away? Dodd says the DUP does not want the talks to fail. It wants a sensible Brexit. It wants the government to honour its red lines, which he says are the same as the DUP’s. Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Westminster, is giving an on-camera statement now. He says the government has made clear the constitutional integrity of the UK will not be undermined. He says the DUP only received a written text late of the proposed Brexit deal late yesterday morning. The DUP immediately said it was unacceptable, he says. Despite several briefings over the course of the last few weeks, we only received written text late yesterday morning. We understand this was due in part to delays caused by the Irish government and the EU negotiating team. Upon immediate receipt of that text we indicated to senior government representatives that it was clearly unacceptable in its current form. The David Davis statement is over now. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, is now making a statement on the Anderson report into the terror attacks this year. But I will keep focusing on Brexit, and I will post a summary of the highlights from the Davis statement shortly. It was more revealing than we expected. Davis says the UK would expect a free trade agreement with the EU to have a section covering services. Labour’s Ruth Cadbury asks if the plan is for Northern Ireland to have regulatory alignment with the EU in the 142 areas all deemed to be covered by the Good Friday agreement. Davis says not all those areas are covered by EU law. Labour’s Alex Sobel asks if the government expects the DUP to join the government. Davis says that is a question for the DUP. The DUP’s Ian Paisley tells Davis he is pleased the UK showed that it could say no to the EU. And will the UK tell Ireland that, if there is no free trade deal, that will cost them £1.5bn. Davis says a free trade deal is best for Ireland. Stephen Timms, the Labour MP, says the customs union was not on the ballot paper at the referendum. He says Davis seems to be saying today that the regulatory alignment principle will apply to the whole of the UK. Davis says alignment is not the same as harmonisation. If we get a free trade areas, that will apply to the whole of the UK, he says. Sylvia Hermon, the independent MP for North Down, says the DUP do not speak for everyone on Northern Ireland. Will Davis explain how May’s plans will benefit the whole of the UK. She says she was embarrassed about what happened to May as a result of the DUP’s actions. Davis says the Brexit plan will benefit the whole of the UK. Davis claims it was clear during the referendum that voting to leave the EU meant leaving the customs union. This provokes some jeering from opposition MPs. Labour’s Mike Gapes asks what is the difference between regulatory alignment and regulatory convergence. Davis says one is about harmonisation, and one is not. UPDATE: To clarify - Davis was saying convergence was the same as harmonisation, not that alignment was. Labour’s Chuka Umunna says the Tories put leaving the single market and the customs union to the electorate at the election and lost their majority. Davis says 85% of MPs were elected on manifestos saying leave the EU. Richard Graham, a Conservative, says this UQ is badly timed. John Bercow, intervenes. He is taking this personally. It is not for Graham to question the judgment of the chair, he says. (It was Bercow who authorised the UQ.) Davis says the approach the UK takes will treat the whole of the UK as a constitutional entity and an economic entity. And here is HuffPost’s Paul Waugh on David Davis. The Tory Brexiter Peter Bone asks Davis to confirm that it is government policy to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. Davis says it is not just government policy, it is EU law. Labour’s Pat McFadden asks Davis about Ruth Davidson’s proposal. (See 10.08am.) She’s right, isn’t she? Davis avoids the question, and criticises Labour policy instead. Here is my colleague Dan Roberts, the Guardian’s Brexit editor, on David Davis’s line on regulatory alignment. (See 1.06pm.) The Tory Mark Pritchard asks if it is possible to have regulatory alignment while being out of the single market and the customs union. Davis says that is possible. Labour’s Ben Bradshaw challenges Davis to give MPs a free vote on staying in the single market and the customs union. Davis says the government was elected on a manifesto to leave the single market and the customs union. Sir Desmond Swayne, a Conservative, urges the government to return to the policy of giving no running commentary on the Brexit talks. Antoinette Sandbach, a Conservative, says thousands of jobs in her constituency depend on regulatory alignment. Can we have that for the whole of the UK? Davis says that was the intention. He says alignment is not the same as harmonisation. Davis says ‘regulatory alignment’ condition intended to apply to the whole of the UK, not just Northern Ireland. The DUP’s Nigel Dodds says the Irish government wishes to advance its interests. The way it has gone about it in such an aggressive way is disgraceful. He says that has set back Anglo-Irish relations, and that that “will take a long time to repair”. The DUP would not allow any settlement that allowed economic divergence between Northern Ireland and the UK. He says there is now agreement from everyone that the UK must stay together. Davis says the DUP stands for the UK. So does the Conservative and Unionist party. Davis says yesterday it was not London forecasting an early deal, but Brussels. Labour’s Yvette Cooper asks if the government has now ditched regulatory alignment. Or does it accept that it is of value for the whole of the UK. Davis says May set out her views in the Florence speech. The UK wants to maintain things like safety and food standards. But it does not necessarily want to achieve these using the same means as the EU. That is what regulatory alignment means. The Brexiter Tory Bernard Jenkin says Labour is proposing a “half-in, half-out” Brexit. Labour’s Chris Bryant says the government has chosen a majority reliant on the DUP. But there is another majority in the Commons, for a soft Brexit. Davis says the government is honouring the result of the referendum. The Tory Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg says the DUP has done the government a favour. Labour’s Liz Kendall says the way to protect the border and keep the UK together is to stay in the single market and the customs union. The government has chosen not to, putting the UK at risk. Davis says Kendall was elected on a manifesto saying Labour would respect the referendum result. He says John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said staying in the customs union would not respect that. Anna Soubry, the pro-remain Tory, says if regulatory alignment is good enough for Northern Ireland, it is good enough for the rest of the UK. There is a consensus in the Commons on this, she says. There is a solution - something that conveys the affect of staying in the customs union. Let’s grab that idea, she says. Davis says the UK will not treat any part of the UK differently from any other part. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, says he hopes the government finds a form of words that enables talks to move on to phase two. Ruth Davidson and the mayor of London have both said the “no divergence” principle should apply to the whole of the UK. Shouldn’t the government agree? Davis says Labour has already rejected the idea of keeping the UK in the customs union. Owen Paterson, the Tory former environment secretary, asks Davis to confirm that the integrity of the UK comes first and that “no deal is better than a bad deal”. Davis says he has already confirmed this. He says the border issues are best dealt with in the next phase. He says the Irish prime minister and Keir Starmer have both said that too. From Labour’s Luciana Berger. The SNP’s Peter Grant says Theresa May is today being interviewed for the job of Scotland football manager because of her ability “to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory”. Davis is responding to Starmer. He says the government will not allow different parts of the UK to have different EU rules, as the SNP propose. A Conservative and Unionist government would be especially opposed to this, he says. Starmer seems to have been inspired by the Telegraph’s Europe editor, Peter Foster, who tweeted this line yesterday. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, says this gives a new meaning to the phrase “coalition of chaos”. He says yesterday the government expected a deal. It ended with May giving a 49-second press conference. He says the problem is May used her conference speech in 2016 to propose a hard Brexit, while saying there would be no hard border in Northern Ireland. Yesterday the rubber hit the road. He says May should rethink her overall Brexit strategy. And he says yesterday confirmed that the “DUP tail is wagging the Tory dog”. He asks May to drop the proposed amendment to the EU withdrawal bill fixing the Brexit date. Yesterday showed why that was absurd. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, is responding to a Commons urgent question tabled by Labour about the Brexit talks. He says the negotiations are ongoing as we speak. We are in the middle of a round, he says. Progess has been made, but we have not yet reached a conclusion, he says. He says the government’s aims are as they have always been. It wants to protect the Good Friday agreement, and ensure there is no hard border in Ireland. It also wants to protect the integrity of the UK. He says they expect to convene in Brussels later this week. He or the prime minister will then update parliament. All parties are confident of getting a deal by the end of the week, he says. RTE’s Tony Connelly reports what the European commission spokesperson is saying about the Brexit talks today. This is from Antonio Tajani, president of the European parliament. A useful summary of where we are on the Brexit talks. More from the lobby briefing. Failure to complete the first phase of Brexit negotiations is costing UK pharmaceutical companies “an enormous amount of money”, industry representatives have warned. As the Press Association reports, with less than 18 months to go until the official date of EU withdrawal in March 2019, companies are having to make preparations now, with some setting up facilities and offices abroad at a cost of tens of millions of pounds, MPs were told. Giving evidence to the Commons Business committee, the chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, Mike Thompson, said the sector was in need of “certainty” from the government now on issues like post-Brexit alignment of regulations with the EU and the terms of any transition period. Thompson told the committee: One of the challenges for us is that it is not unusual for politicians to think they don’t need to do a deal until the absolute last minute. But for business people, we have to plan ahead. The fact that we haven’t had the time to plan ahead has meant companies have had to take these contingency decisions, which is costing them an enormous amount of money. He said the industry’s message to the government would be: Can you please get into phase two as quickly as possible, because we need to have some decisions so we can plan to ensure the continuing supply of medicines to patients across Europe? The Number 10 lobby briefing has just finished. Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP chief whip, has used Twitter to back Ruth Davidson’s call for regulatory alignment condition that will apply to Northern Ireland under the proposed deal to cover the whole of the UK too. (See 10.08am.) And Simon Hamilton, a former DUP minister in the Northern Ireland executive, is also retweeting Davidson favourably. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, is not planning to meet Theresa May today, the Telegraph’s Christopher Hope reports. Ruth Davidson called Theresa May in London this morning to alert the prime minister she was openly to challenge UK proposals for a special EU deal for Northern Ireland. (See 10.08am.) In a further sign that the Scottish Tory leader is unhappy with the UK’s negotiating stance and is pressing for a softer form of Brexit, Davidson wanted to give May advance notice she planned to openly break ranks with government policy. In a statement issued via Twitter, Davidson implied she believed May’s draft deal to offer Northern Ireland special terms under the single market and customs union risked bolstering Nicola Sturgeon’s calls for independence. Davidson’s advisers refused to disclose May’s response, but they said Davidson wanted to tell the prime minister “these are my views and this is where I’m going publicly.” Democratic Unionist party sources have insisted today that a deal aimed at cracking the conundrum of the post-Brexit Irish border was possible on Monday. Amid the recriminations over who is to blame regarding the failure to reach a deal on the frontier and free trade across it, DUP sources claim that it was the leak from the Irish government that scuppered the chance of an agreement between unionists in Northern Ireland, Theresa May’s government and Ireland. That critical phrase ‘regulatory alignment’, which was interpreted as a backdoor way of keeping Northern Ireland inside the EU customs union while the rest of the UK left it could have been the basis of agreement, the DUP sources said. They claimed that the original plan was for the regulations to ease the flow of trade in goods and services on the island of Ireland to be drawn up in London with the DUP fully consulted. “Everything was OK until a leak of a draft came out on Monday via RTE which was not part of the negotiations between London and Dublin. This inaccurate version of the deal spooked the horses. The idea was that these measures to ensure a soft border were to be seen to have originated in London but the leak changed everything,” the DUP sources insisted. An intriguing claim which suggests perhaps there could still be a chance for the prime minister to sell some kind of special trading agreement to the DUP which would not be seen as “decoupling” Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Here is a round-up of what papers in Dublin and Belfast are saying about what happened yesterday. The Dublin papers have unanimously rounded on the DUP, including the Irish edition of the Sun, whose British edition recently told Leo Varadkar “Ireland’s naïve prime minister” to “shut your gob”. Today the fork-toothed Sun is unequivocal with the Irish edition warning that the DUP is only one party in the north and it must not be allowed to torpedo the deal on the Irish border. Irish Times Front page: Varadkar says May reneged on Brexit Border deal as Tory MP s back DUP Leader: DUP long ago conceded the principle of regulatory alignment with Dubln The DUP’s opposition to special status is more political stagecraft than principled conviction. The Belfast Agreement enshrines Northern Ireland’s special status. The region already opts out of many British laws the DUP doesn’t like, and, as unionist support for a 12.5% corporate tax rate in the North shows, it has long ago conceded the principle of regulatory alignment with the Republic. Irish Independent Front page headline: Soft border now in sight despite hardline revolt Leader: DUP has veto on Brexit talks. The concern now is that if the DUP has a veto over the British government, it does not bode well for the future of the talks. The party is a minority part of the British governent. If it can apply the hand brake from the back seat, while Mrs May is supposed to be driving the bus, then the outlook is not promising. The Sun (Irish edition) Front page headline: Leo fury as DUP halt soft border Leader: Brexit bungles The DUP are only one party – and one party must not be allowed to torpedo a vital deal which is crucial to the future of the island. Our government must stand firm on Brexit. Belfast Telegraph Leader: Cool heads must prevail There will be much point-scoring for such political bungling, but inevitably a great deal of blame must rest with the British prime minister, who seems to have not understood fully the unionist mindset so clearly represented by the DUP. It is not as if Mrs Foster and her colleagues had a sudden rush of blood to their heads as the developments in Brussels gathered apace. On the contrary, the DUP has made it crystal clear for some time now that they wish to exit from the EU on the same terms and conditions as all other parts of the UK. Irish News Leader: Mrs May is badly damaged. It appears the DUP has flexed its muscles and the prime minister has caved in, a move that will undermine her already weakened position. Mrs May comes out of all this badly damaged. She took a calculated risk on the arrangements contained in the border deal, knowing that failure to get to Phase Two of the negotiations would place her in an impossible position. It was not just the Irish border issue that scuppered a deal yesterday. In Brussels yesterday Theresa May said there were two issues where the UK and the EU could not agree, and in the Sun today Tom Newton Dunn has details of the second dispute, on the role of the European court of justice. The EU wants the ECJ to have an ongoing role in adjudicating on issues affecting the rights of EU nationals. The UK government is opposed to this, but reportedly it is offering a compromise whereby Britain could voluntarily agree to refer some of these cases to the ECJ. Newton Dunn says that May wanted this arrangement to last for less than five years, but that the EU refused. On the Today programme this morning David Jones, the former Brexit minister and a prominent Tory Brexiter, expressed strong reservations about this plan. He said that he might be willing to accept an arrangement like this, but only for a short time. He said: If that were to be implemented, it would have to be very, very tightly time-limited, possibly to coincide with the period that the government has already announced that they will be allowing EU citizens to remain in this country before they get permanent right to reside [around two years]. Asked about the apparent EU demand for the ECJ to carry on having this role indefinitely, Jones said that would be “a huge source of concern”. The speaker has granted an urgent question on Brexit at 12.30pm, my colleague Anushka Asthana reports. MPs may get the chance to vote on protecting the principles of the Good Friday agreement as part of the Brexit deal tomorrow, ITV’s Robert Peston reports. The pound continued to fall in value this morning following Theresa May’s failure to clinch a Brexit deal, Bloomberg reports. My colleague Simon Jenkins has written a First Thoughts column saying Theresa May should face down the DUP. Here’s an excerpt. May must call the DUP’s bluff at once – and incidentally confront her own “rebel 50”. She must insist that it is this deal or the idiocy of the cliff edge. No deal has minimal support in parliament and in the country. Especially on worker migration, it would impose a massive economic burden on Britain, and on Northern Ireland a nightmare. A deal there must be. The backwoodsmen must be driven to the back of the wood. Now May must urgently call a meeting with the leaders of other parties in the Commons, and request assurances on a vote in favour of the Brussels agreement. In return she should form an all-party committee to monitor the ongoing talks. Party politics should be off the table for the duration. If Labour or others are unhappy with the eventual settlement, she can promise – or threaten – another referendum or an election. She might indeed have no option. For the DUP that could well drive them from majority status. And here is the full article. According to the Economist’s Tom Nuttall, Cecilia Malmström, the EU’s trade commissioner, said today that the UK would not be able to roll over the EU’s free trade deals after Brexit. There are currently around 60 non-EU countries covered by EU trade deals, and the British government claims it will be relatively easy to replicate them after Brexit. She was also disobliging about the Guardian. This is from Sky’s Ireland correspondent, David Blevins. The Scottish Tory leader, Ruth Davidson, has called for Theresa May to extend the special EU deal being sought for Northern Ireland across the UK, arguing that it would protect the UK’s internal markets. Davidson said Nicola Sturgeon’s demands for special single market deals for Scotland, and potentially Wales and London, should be rejected since they would undermine the integrity of the UK. But in a departure from the deal being pursued by UK negotiators, Davidson has suggested that if Northern Ireland did win special regulatory deals for specific sectors,, to smooth cross-border trade with Ireland, those deals should apply UK-wide. That implies the Scottish Tories are edging closer to Sturgeon on her calls for a softer form of Brexit, although not so close Davidson would countenance her 13 Scottish Tory MPs backing a rebellion against May’s minority government. In a statement Davidson said: The question on the Brexit ballot paper asked voters whether the UK should stay or leave the European Union - it did not ask if the country should be divided by different deals for different home nations. While I recognise the complexity of the current negotiations, no government of the Conservative and Unionist party should countenance any deal that compromises the political, economic or constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. All sides agree there should be no return to the borders of the past between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Similarly, jeopardising the UK’s own internal market is in no-one’s interest. If regulatory alignment in a number of specific areas is the requirement for a frictionless border, then the prime minister should conclude this must be on a UK-wide basis. Davidson’s intervention is intriguing since in theory she has 13 Scottish Tory votes at Westminster at her disposal, although several new Scottish Tory MPs are far more Euro-sceptic than she is, which may influence May’s thinking. Her formula raises the question of whether it would also win support from the Democratic Unionist party, since May is dependent on DUP votes at Westminster. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, is Brussels for an Ecofin (economic and financial affairs council) meeting. He has said he is “very confident” that the government will be able to revive the Brexit deal, the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg reports. In his Today programme interview Peter Ricketts, the former head of the Foreign Office, said what happened yesterday left the impression that Theresa May has not got the authority to deliver a Brexit deal. He said: It’s pretty extraordinary that this wasn’t all stitched up with the DUP beforehand. We’re used to prime ministers going to Brussels and having a row with the EU and coming back without an agreement, but to go agree with the EU and then have a row on your own side is inconvenient. It leaves an impression, I think, in Brussels that the prime minister hasn’t got authority over her own side and that will knock confidence in doing a final deal ... I think it leaves an impression that the prime minister hasn’t got the authority to get through these difficult negotiations. The deputy leader of Sinn Fein, which represents the nationalist community in Northern Ireland has appealed to the DUP not to be “reckless” and stop the Brexit deal because of local “orange vs green” politics. Mary Lou McDonald, who is widely expected to take over from Gerry Adams when he retires, said the deal agreed by Irish and British negotiators in Brussels yesterday was the right one for the island of Ireland. She told RTE’s Morning Ireland: I think the DUP position has been illogical, and frankly reckless on this topic from the word go. I would appeal to the DUP to understand this is not a case of orange vs green, this is all of us who live on this island protecting ourselves and protecting each other. Sinn Fein is the second largest party in Northern Ireland and won seven seats in Westminster in this year’s general election. However it does not take them because of Sinn Fein’s long standing policy of not swearing allegiance to the Queen or taking its seats in Westminster. Its Brexit policy is that Northern Ireland should have special designated status. McDonald said: I think we need the DUP to step back and understand that this isn’t a matter of short term political positioning; that Brexit will be as ruinous for farmers in Fermanagh as for a farmer in Bandon and in the interests of our stability, our collective welfare and stability. Nicola Sturgeon has called for opposition parties and pro-EU Conservative MPs to form an informal coalition at Westminster to ensure the UK remains in the single market and customs union, exploiting the disarray in Theresa May’s government. The first minister challenged Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, to get his act together in a tweet on Tuesday morning, stating: “This could be the moment for opposition and soft Brexit/remain Tories to force a different, less damaging approach - keep the UK in the single market and customs union. But it needs Labour to get its act together. How about it @jeremycorbyn?” StuSturgeon senses an opportunity to reassert herself on the Brexit agenda after UK officials agreed a putative deal for Northern Ireland to stay aligned to EU single market and customs unions rules in cross border trade with Ireland, only to see that rejected by the Democratic Unionist party. She has Labour allies in Carwyn Jones, the Welsh first minister, and Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, who both want to the UK to stay in the single market. Labour at Westminster, however, has so far only proposed an extended transition period and will not accept the free movement of people that single market membership demands. Corbyn’s rejection of a soft Brexit alliance could well strengthen Sturgeon’s appeal to pro-EU voters in Scotland at Labour’s expense. On Monday the latest Survation opinion poll, for the Record, said the gap between the SNP and Labour had closed significantly to nine points in a Westminster vote after the election of Richard Leonard as Scottish Labour leader. Unlike his pro-EU leadership rival Anas Sarwar, who campaigned for Scotland to remain in the single market, Leonard backs Corbyn’s stance. Theresa May chairs cabinet this morning knowing that she has just a few days at most to rescue the Brexit deal almost agreed yesterday after it was torpedoed by the DUP. Yesterday’s setback was the worst the government has had since the Brexit negotiations started about seven months ago. But quite how catastrophic was it? One view is that this was just part of routine Brussels/Ulster talks choreography, where no one ever signs up to something without a bit of a row because otherwise voters think they haven’t fought their corner. The Sunday Times’ EU correspondent Bojan Pancevski was one of those making this argument yesterday, and on RTE this morning Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the former Conservative foreign secretary, was saying much the same thing. ”This is classic last-minute drama which is pretty common in Europe,” he said. “There is no reason at all why this cant be sorted out.” But another view is that it is much more serious, because it has exposed a fundamental contradiction in what the British government wants to achieve from Brexit; it hopes to take the UK, including Northern Ireland, out of the single market and the customs union, while preventing the re-emergence of border controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Many people, like the Commons Brexit committee, say achieving both is impossible. Or, as the former head of the Foreign Office, Peter Ricketts, put in on the Today programme this morning, in rather diplomatic and understated language: “There are too many incompatible objectives jostling here, I think that’s the problem.” For a rather blunter analysis, this is what Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, tweeted about an hour ago. Since then it has had 14,000 likes. The key dispute was over this sentence in the draft agreement. In the absence of agreed solutions, the UK will ensure that there is continued regulatory alignment from those rules of internal market and customs union which, now or in the future, support north-south cooperation and protection of the Good Friday agreement. Originally the draft spoke about “no regulatory divergence” instead of “continued regulatory alignment”. The Irish government insist they mean the same thing, but the wording was changed because the British thought “continued regulatory alignment” was softer. The last-minute replacement perhaps explains why the sentence contains the inappropriate from when the sentence really should read “there is continued regulatory alignment with” etc. This morning the Irish government has made it clear that it will not back down on the substance of what this section says. This is from my colleague Lisa O’Carroll. And here is the quote from Simon Coveney, Ireland’s deputy prime minister. We have been moving forward on the basis of good faith. We believe the British government has also been. There has been very difficult negotiations, we recognise these are very difficult political issues to manage for the British prime minister and we want to give her the time and the space to do that. But we don’t want to give the impression the Irish government is going to reverse away from the deal we felt we had in place and agreed yesterday. Of course, it there are presentational issues they want to work with we will look at that. Coveney’s colleague Helen McEntee, the Irish Europe minister, has been saying much the same. But in London David Jones, the pro-leave former Brexit minister, said that an agreement that proposed “regulatory alignment” between Northern Ireland and the Republic was unacceptable. Asked about the phrase, he told the Today programme: I don’t think it should be there because I think the problem that we will have is trying to strike free trade agreements around the world [if the UK and Northern Ireland are aligned to EU regulation]. More on this all day. But here is what is in the diary. 9am: Theresa May chairs cabinet. 9.45am: The lord chief justice, Lord Burnett of Maldon, holds his annual press conference. 11.25am: May holds talks in Downing Street with the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy. Around 12.45pm: MPs begin a debate on a Labour motion saying that five universal credit assessments should be given to the Commons work and pensions committee. It is another “humble address” motion, like the one used to get the Brexit impact assessments, which means it is binding. 1pm: Adrian O’Neill, the Irish ambassador, speaks at an Institute for Government event.

Her criticism comes just two days after the government’s social mobility commissioner, Alan Milburn, resigned in protest at Theresa May’s failure in her own pledge to build a fairer Britain. Speaking before a scheduled appearance before a House of Lords committee, Casey echoed Milburn’s charge that the government was too focused on Brexit negotiations to tackle domestic problems. “Rhetoric about social mobility can’t crumble to dust,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. She added: “I feel very, very strongly that Brexit is as much about what is happening domestically in the United Kingdom as it is about what is happening in terms of negotiations.” Casey’s year-long study branded ministerial attempts to boost integration of ethnic minorities as amounting to little more than “saris, samosas and steel drums for the already well-intentioned”. It recommended a new strategy to help bridge divides with an “integration oath” to encourage immigrants to embrace British values, a greater focus on promoting the English language, and securing “women’s emancipation in communities where they are being held back by regressive cultural practices”. Casey said no progress had been made on any of these recommendations. “I think absolutely nothing has happened since I published that report a year ago,” she said. She acknowledged that the ministers were planning an integration strategy in the new year. But she added: “My sadness is a year is an awful long time in the lives of people growing up in this country.” She specifically highlighted the failure of the government to implement David Cameron’s pledge, made almost two years ago, to offer more English-language training to communities that need it most. Casey listed known problems that ministers had failed to address. She said: “We know that we have particular people within our country that are struggling more than others. So white British kids on free school meals we know are really struggling to achieve five or more GCSEs. We know that Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage women are 60% likely to be economically inactive. We know that the men in that community are twice as likely to speak English. We know that young black men growing up in this country are looking at an unemployment rate of 35% rather than 19%. It is time surely as we face such big decisions that we do something about that.” She also brushed off criticism that her report overemphasised the need for Muslims to integrate into society and underplayed what people from eastern European countries could do. The Guardian pointed out that her report mentioned Muslims mentioned 249 times, but Poles only 14 times. Casey said: “The truth is a very difficult thing for some people. Sometimes it doesn’t always make you popular when you are not very right on. A bust-up with the Guardian isn’t necessarily something that I’m going to worry about when I’m telling the truth.” She added: “The fact of the matter is that 57.2% of women from Bangladeshi and Pakistani heritage background, as opposed to 38.5% of other ethnic minority women, are economically inactive. As I said a year ago, it is often men in those communities that are standing in the way of women when it comes to their equality and integration. And if they weren’t women from those backgrounds, but somebody like me, we’d be creating holy hell about it and we’re not.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2017/dec/12/domestic-violence-power-whitehall-councils","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T07:23:27Z","webTitle":"Domestic violence: can moving power out of Whitehall make a difference?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2017/dec/12/domestic-violence-power-whitehall-councils","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/public-leaders-network/2017/dec/12/domestic-violence-power-whitehall-councils","fields":{"headline":"Domestic violence: can moving power out of Whitehall make a difference?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Women who have been abused need to feel safe, often in women-only environments, to be able to start addressing the issues they face. Taking a so-called “gender neutral” approach to service provision too often means women are referred to services that do not take their needs into account and are often designed, by default, for men. In addition, services for issues like addiction, homelessness and poor mental health are often commissioned separately. It can mean a real struggle for women facing multiple challenges to get the joined-up support they need. Devolution of power from Whitehall to regional combined authorities, including the election in May of six new metro mayors, offers real potential to do things differently for a group for whom the current system is not working. Some of the most excluded women in society, for whom domestic abuse is often part of a wider pattern of violence, have been continually overlooked at both national and local level and this has only got worse as budgets have shrunk, with support services for women closing down across the country. Vital services, such as the Asha Centre in Worcester, have been forced to close their doors with others under threat and reducing the services they provide. But devolution offers a real opportunity to make a difference to women and girls. Devolved areas can take a broader look at the challenges facing their communities. They can work locally with women to understand the issues they experience and try a new approach joining up budgets across issues and areas. As well as the impact on women, families and communities, there is also significant potential for savings in health, social care, housing, children’s services, justice and more, through authorities working with agencies and experts to deliver services in a more effective way. Research by the charity Revolving Door has shown that an investment of £18m a year in joining up the support provided by women’s centres could save £1bn over five years. . We have recently begun some pioneering research looking into how ways of working and support can be redesigned at a local level to put the needs and experiences of women and girls at the heart of service design and delivery. Of course we want to see this put into practice and, in theory, devolution can help make this a reality. There are already some promising initiatives out there. Greater Manchester is taking a gender-responsive approach, to provide support for women at three points of the criminal justice system - arrest, sentencing and release from prison. The aim is to help reduce re-offending and produce better outcomes for female offenders, at least half of whom, according to the Prison Reform Trust, will have experienced domestic abuse . There are other examples of local areas taking risks and trying out different approaches, such as the work being done to tackle domestic abuse in the north east and Yorkshire and Humberside. For some women, poverty, violence and abuse often starts in childhood, and continue to weave in and out of their lives, a catalyst for a range of other negative experiences. They may have very low self-esteem, use drugs or alcohol to cope and experience poor mental health and homelessness. This can leave them vulnerable to further exploitation and abuse, for example staying with violent partners to keep a roof over their heads or becoming involved in prostitution. They often face very complex issues and need specialist support. Yet such support for women is scarce. In some local authority areas there appears to be little or no support specifically for women, despite the fact that for so many of the most marginalised women, who have experienced abuse at the hands of men, mixed services are, at the very least, intimidating and, at worst, dangerous. It is encouraging that there are national standards like the Home Office’s National statement of expectations on violence against women and girls, which advises local commissioners to take into account the needs of women experiencing multiple disadvantage, but the reality is that cash-strapped councils are demanding more for less, and this can mean services that do not work in the best interests of those women who need longer-term, more flexible support. Devolved services offer opportunties to restructure services, but there are real challenges, too. Devolution has been patchy; some authorities wield more control - and budget - than others. Some areas vying for new powers have highlighted services for the most disadvantaged as a priority but others have not. There is also a risk that with men still holding most of the leadership positions in the new authorities, the voices, experiences and needs of women and girls can be overlooked. When trying to achieve significant policy change for women and girls with long histories of abuse and trauma, for whom there is no easy solution, it can be easy to think that targeting the politicians and civil servants at Westminster is the best way to achieve change. But to make systems and services work better for women and girls at risk, changes to both national policy and local systems are critical. Devolution offers opportunities to help thousands of women and girls rebuild their lives, but we need local and national leadership to drive that change.

A novel way to display houseplants that naturally grow on trees in the wild, I thought, and sort of a playful protest to the newly on-trend revival of taxidermy. Instead of a dead animal, why not mount a living plant? Surprisingly, many of you on social media have asked for a “how to” on my “plantidermy”, so here it is. First, pick your plant. I have tried everything from speckled-leaved pepper plants (Peperomia) to dazzling moth orchids (Phalaenopsis), but any plant that naturally grows on trees (what us botanists call an epiphyte) will do. In my experiments, however, without doubt the easiest so far have been the epiphytic ferns, in particular the fuzzy, light brown creeping stems of the hare’s foot fern (Davallia) and the striking, antler-like leaves of the stag horn fern (Platycerium). Take the plant out of its pot and tear off the bottom two-thirds of the compost. This may seem brutal, but these plants are adapted to have very small root systems, and will soon recover if kept well watered. With the small amount of remaining root-ball, gently tease away as much compost as possible, so you are left with a bare root plant. Take your piece of natural cork bark, this can be bought really quite cheaply online or in pet shops, where they are sold as naturalistic backdrops for the tanks of exotic pets, from dart frogs to iguanas. Place a small pile of wet moss in the centre of this, about the size of the root ball of your plant. I tend to get my moss from my driveway and garage roof, but it is also sold in florists’ shops. Pop the plant on top of this pile and finally cover the roots entirely with a layer of more damp moss. You should have a sort of moss sandwich, encasing the roots of your plant, all sitting on a piece of cork bark. Now here’s the tricky bit: using nylon fishing line, secure the moss-covered root ball in place. I do this by simply winding it round the whole slab of cork as many times as it takes before tying it off. Although simple in theory, it might take a couple of goes, as moss has a frustrating habit of falling out of place while you are doing this. When you are happy with your creation, dunk the whole thing in a sink filled to the brim with water and let it soak for 10 minutes. Fish it out and let it drain for a couple of hours until no longer dripping and you can hang it just like a picture on any wall near a bright window. After an initial 30 minutes of fiddling to set up, my mounted ferns only need a weekly dunk in the sink to keep them thriving.

Brooker had written a script for the new series in which a neurotic single mother uses technology to spy on her young daughter and keep her safe from the world. The Netflix people suggested they tried the script out on the two-time Oscar-winning actor. Brooker has had considerable global success with Black Mirror but still, the thought of working with Foster, “an actual icon”, made him come over, he says, “all British and starstruck”. He turned to his co-showrunner for the series, Annabel Jones. “We were like: ‘You’re kidding, right? You are going to try Jodie bloody Foster? Yeah right, of course you are.’” The script was given to Jodie bloody Foster, though, and she came back immediately and said she wanted to do it. Brooker had a Skype chat with her in which it became clear that as a mother and a daughter, and as someone steeped in issues around privacy, she had a strong feel for all the script’s themes. “And then also,” Brooker suggests, “on a practical level the film involved dealing with child actors, which I guess Jodie Foster probably knows more about than anyone alive.” Through the course of the film-making – the shoot was in Toronto, the editing in London – Brooker says Foster could not have been more engaged or engaging. And for his own part, he says, as long as he repressed the thoughts that went: “Christ, she was in Taxi Driver, she was in The Accused, she was in The Silence of the Lambs…” he was fine. Otherwise, obviously: “You got a bit of vertigo.” I met Foster to talk about her film earlier this year when she was over in London working with Brooker on the edit of “Arkangel” [her episode of Black Mirror], and experienced just a bit of that vertigo. It would be fair to say that the actor, now 55, is not the most enthusiastic of interviewees. Having been first put in front of cameras aged three, and subsequently having suffered well-documented traumas with stalkers, Foster has long been wary of talking about herself beyond her work. She is determinedly friendly, but radiates the same intense and guarded intelligence you know from her most famous roles, as well as a profound awareness of being quoted out of context. A mention of Trump at one point in our conversation brings a curt: “You’ll understand I never discuss politics, I leave that to the experts.” Stray a little too far into personal territory and you immediately feel like a tabloid hack with a back pocket stuffed full of grubby tenners. One of the reasons Foster has taken a break from acting for a while – a decision she announced in an uncharacteristically frank speech at the 2013 Golden Globes in which she came out both as single and as a director (she assumed everyone already knew she was gay) – was, she says, to avoid any of this. She still loves the idea of acting, but she finds all that goes with it, the junkets and the photo shoots and the interviews, “absolutely soul crushing”. With that idea hanging in the air we sit in a hotel room sipping Earl Grey tea and talk first about how the Black Mirror offer came about. Foster was at lunch with her agent, and “moaning as ever about the feature film industry,” she says. She was and is nostalgic for the three-act beginning and middle and end of 90-minute drama. “Much as I love this renaissance of episodic series,” she says, “characters are not in service of a single story, and I miss that.” As she grumbled along these lines, her agent stopped her – “I think I have something you should see” – and told her about Black Mirror, Brooker’s series of standalone “indie” films. Foster went away and binged on the first two series. (“Friends had told me about it a million times, but I hadn’t tuned in,” she says.) And then she read the script. “I was like: ‘How did you know?’” Part of that affinity was the fact that having “made movies for some 50 years” Foster was deeply aware of how few stories out there “are told by women, through women’s eyes, and with a female director”. (She has made no formal comment about the Weinstein revelations, except to observe tangentially that in her early career “for 15 or 20 years, every single script I read, the motivation for the female character was that they had been raped or abused as a child… Is that the only thing [men] think about us that feels deep or something?”) The other thing she liked about Brooker’s script was its believably human drama. “What was interesting,” she says, “is that though all of the shows are about technology, none of the shows are really about technology at all. All of them are about relationships and the emotional damage we all carry, which is highlighted by the Klieg light of technology.” In her notes to Brooker, Foster had quite a lot of thoughts about the dynamic between mother and daughter. He went away and rewrote parts. She wanted the feel of the film to be more blue collar and lived in, to depict a slightly bruised small-town American world. I guess Foster made those changes because she wanted to bring the story closer to home. She agrees to a point. “This show goes back to mothers and daughters,” she says, “and it brings you back to your own mother. I have been thinking about her in the edit suite this week.” Foster and her mother, Brandy, had a famously intense relationship. Brandy was divorced from Foster’s father, Lucius, a former lieutenant colonel in the US air force, before Jodie, the youngest of four, was born. In order to help support the family Brandy put her infant daughter forward for casting not long after she could walk. Foster was the breadwinner before she went to school and the pair of them were inseparable in her early movie career. Some years ago now, Foster began to lose her mother to dementia. Again at her Golden Globes speech, she addressed her directly: “Mom, I know you’re inside those blue eyes somewhere and that there are so many things that you won’t understand tonight,” she said. “But this is the only important one to take in: I love you, I love you, I love you. And I hope that if I say this three times, it will magically and perfectly enter into your soul. You’re a great mom. Please take that with you when you’re finally OK to go.” With those words in mind it is hard, when you watch Foster’s unsettling Black Mirror episode, not to think a lot of that relationship was running through her head when she made it. Foster insists it is not directly autobiographical – it was Brooker’s script, after all – but does allow that, “as a director I have always wanted every movie I have made to be in some way the story of my life. Otherwise how am I supposed to commit to it?” She suggests Brooker’s parable has a universal theme, about the fears any parent has about raising children, and the understanding that at some point you have to let them go. “In a weird way our children have become our favourite form of entertainment,” she says, talking more widely of the trend for “helicopter parenting”. “We live vicariously through them and rediscover the world through them. There is something wonderful and healthy about that – and something also suffocating and sad.” Does she recognise that dichotomy from her childhood? “My mother used to say she was always scared and she didn’t know why,” she says. “She said she would wake up in the middle of the night thinking: ‘How am I going to take care of my children?’ It wasn’t a given. It was very important to her to give that opportunity to me, and yet there was always that contrary sense of, ‘You’ll never take care of yourself without me!’” None of us can choose our childhoods. I wonder how Foster feels about hers now. “I am very grateful for it,” she says. “Whether you are raised in monastery in China or a farm in Nebraska everyone has their singular childhood. I travelled, and I got to be taken seriously, I got to learn a craft I loved.” Her mother must have been immensely proud. “She was, but she was a part of it. We were a team that made movies together. We went to little towns together and stayed at the Ramada Inn and made dinners on hotplates. It was like a travelling roadshow.” In some ways Foster has always seemed like a slightly reluctant movie star. She argues that’s not really the case: films were all she ever wanted to do; it was the fame part that hit her in her teens after Freaky Friday, Bugsy Malone and particularly Taxi Driver, that made her uncomfortable. She read Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers recently, she says, and the notion of successful people being those individuals who are lucky and committed enough to get in 10,000 hours of practice in a chosen field first, resonated with her. “When you are 18 and you have already made 30 movies you know quite a lot about storytelling…” One way of reading her subsequent career has been as an effort to change that insistent “we” she talks about of her mother, to a definitive “I”. In her 20s, she rejected acting for a while to study English literature at Yale, and graduated with honours (after befriending the subject of her dissertation, Toni Morrison). When she went back to films she began a run of extraordinary, drawn-out success with The Accused, and then The Silence of the Lambs. In 1991, the year she won her second Oscar for the latter, she started her own production company and directed her first film, Little Man Tate. There was a sense in which she could put her talent to anything. She doesn’t feel the need to do that any more. “I think what happens when you get a bit older is that you are very clear about what you want to do and what you don’t want to do,” she says. “When I was young, I thought: ‘Yeah, I can do cartoons! I can do musicals!’” The pressure of being a prodigy, of living up to her mother’s expectations, was hard to shake. In recent years she decided the best way to fulfil that might be behind the camera rather than in front of it. Was she a frustrated director all the time? She says it was more just how it turned out. “Sadly I never worked out how to be prolific as a director and have a career as an actor, and also raise children and run a company. It was the directing that always went on the back burner. But now is the time.” It is easier for her to commit to the total immersion that directing requires, she suggests, now that her two sons, aged 19 and 16, are more independent. She raised her boys with her former partner, Cydney Bernard (they met on the set of Sommersby in 1993 and separated in 2008). In April 2014, Foster married actor and photographer Alexandra Hedison. She has no interest in revealing how her marriage has affected her working life, but you have the sense, talking to her, that it has coincided with a greater self-confidence, that she is a bit less tough on herself than she once was. When she stepped back from acting, she says she felt a new freedom. “I didn’t want to be the most successful director, or the highest paid, I just wanted to be somewhat of an auteur,” she says. “If that meant I made two movies my entire life and I loved them, then I was fine with that.” Though she has recently accepted her first acting role for five years (as the lead in the thriller Hotel Artemis), she is doing so very much on her own terms, out of curiosity rather than necessity. “I think the thing that has made my work different than a lot of actors is that I don’t have an actor’s personality and I never did,” she says. “I wasn’t born with that. Would I have made a better lawyer? Possibly. My personality is made for other things.” We talk a little more about children fulfilling the ambitions of their parents, the way tennis and music prodigies feel about their childhoods. She insists that movies are never “just tennis”. “Through movies I learned about astronomy, the First World War. It is continually walking into other worlds and getting to the bones of them. What other life can offer that?” What once was chosen for her, now is very much her choice. “Some directors love cranes and CGI and spectacle, but that is not why I make movies,” she says. “I feel like I make movies because there are things I have to say in order to figure out who I am or my place in the world, or for me to evolve as a person. But until you get to the end of your movie you don’t always realise why you were obsessed with that particular thing.” And then she heads back to the editing suite to once again make doubly sure.

The rainbow lasted for eight hours and 58 minutes in the mountains around the Taiwanese capital of Taipei, according to Chou Kun-hsuan, a professor at the Chinese Culture University. Chou, along with colleague Liu Ching-huang, scrambled to document the rainbow that appeared on 30 November, mustering students to photograph the arc from every angle. The professors were originally monitoring the rainbow to test a theory that the bands of light descend as time passes. “It was amazing … It felt like a gift from the sky … It’s so rare,” Chou told the BBC. “When we broke the previous record after passing six hours, I was hardly able to stay seated for lunch. “I was so excited.” The professors observed four separate rainbows during the nine-hour period, at one time photographing all in a single frame. The previous day a rainbow near the campus appeared for six hours. A combination of a seasonal monsoons trapping moist air, a lack of strong winds and a partially cloudy sky allowed for the rainbow to be visible for such a long time. The moisture formed clouds and caused a steady stream of rain, but there was still plenty of sunshine. Sunlight passing through rain and moisture in the air create the phenomenon, but only when viewed from the correct angle. Chou plans to apply to Guinness World Records for the world’s longest visible rainbow. The previous record holder was seen for six hours above Sheffield, UK, in 1994. “With the 10,000 pictures we took in our department alone, and the many more taken by others on campus and people living nearby, I’m confident we can prove to Guinness second by second that this rainbow lasted for nine hours,” Chou said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/05/marilyn-manson-review-manchester-apollo","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T13:05:00Z","webTitle":"Marilyn Manson review – escapist vaudeville for an age of real-life horror","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/05/marilyn-manson-review-manchester-apollo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/05/marilyn-manson-review-manchester-apollo","fields":{"headline":"Marilyn Manson review – escapist vaudeville for an age of real-life horror","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"‘I may be a bit broken but you can’t fucking break me,” Marilyn Manson says after the heavy thunder of his most recent album opener, Revelation #12, subsides. He says this with his leg in a cast, propped up in a black throne that doubles as a standing wheelchair. Behind the black-clothed and makeup-clad singer are two giant guns. It was these prop firearms that recently fell on Manson in New York and broke his leg, postponing the tour. It’s not the only incident surrounding his latest album, Heaven Upside Down – he also recently parted ways with longtime bandmate Twiggy Ramirez, after sexual assault allegations were made against the bass player (although Johnny Depp stars in Manson’s recent Say10 video despite the actor’s domestic abuse allegations). He then drew criticism on his return show when he brought out a prop assault rifle on stage the day of the Sutherland Springs church shooting; his fascination with firearms also led to him pulling a fake gun on the Guardian’s Alexis Petridis earlier this year. Tonight such theatrics and gun-toting are kept to a minimum, no doubt due to Manson’s restricted movement. Instead he chooses to embrace his role as a patient: after every song, men in green doctors’ scrubs attend to Manson in some way, be it attaching a crutch to allow him to walk around or to assist with a wardrobe change. With Manson somewhat incapacitated and incapable of the crowd interaction he’s known for, the focus is on the band, who are a bare-bones hard rock outfit. The hissing ambience and clattering industrial electronics that often bubble through Manson’s recorded work is largely absent, replaced by the weight of aggressive guitars, hammering bass and crashing drums as the group, led by a screaming Manson, hurtle through older songs such as This Is the New Shit and Disposable Teens. The fundamental subtext that swirls around Manson’s show is: what impact can his shock-horror tactics actually have in 2017? Manson’s persona exists to showcase the decay and sickness of American society – but if the world around him is yet more troubled, where does that leave him? When you have a president that eclipses farce and parody on a seemingly daily basis, a rock star in makeup who embraces Satan, sings about drugs and covers the Eurhythmics’ Sweet Dreams doesn’t quite cut it. So his show instead becomes entertainment rather than provocation, taking the audience into a world of heavy-metal vaudeville – playful and knowing in its theatricality, but loaded with enough musical ferocity to elevate it beyond simple posturing. Amid the guttural screams and the furnace blast of guitars there are smatterings of melody throughout, be it The Dope Show or his recent single Kill4Me, the latter of which is flat-out pop music. While Manson has cited Killing Joke and Bauhaus as influences on his new record, he also picked out Rihanna, and such pop leanings have never been clearer than on this track, which bounces along with shimmering new wave guitars and a seductive, rolling bass line. Such deviations are welcome moments in the set, which comes dangerously close to feeling a little one-note, though Manson remains sarcastic and sardonic throughout. After a brief stint lying in a hospital bed on the middle of the stage, thrashing around like a patient kept against his will, Manson transfers to a wheelchair and is pushed to the front row, where he shines a bright white torch into his audience during a punchy take of We Know Where You Fucking Live. This, along with a gritty yet tuneful Say10, shows that Manson is producing some of his best material in years. The opening scratch of the encore, The Beautiful People, is a welcome plunge back into a song that, underneath the car-compactor crunch of the guitars and scorched vocals, remains an irresistible piece of pop music. Twenty-one years since its release, as Manson throws the microphone and its stand to the ground and hobbles off stage, the role that songs like this once played has now reversed. No longer is Marilyn Manson the a figure that instigates fear, panic and chaos. Instead he has he’s created a space where people can go to escape such fears and enjoy the spectacle of the grotesque, safe from the claws of reality. At O2 Academy, Glasgow, on 5 December.

On Tuesday the government confirmed it would proceed with its telegraphed crackdown on foreign interference, with the introduction of legislation that aims to counter incidences of espionage and improper foreign influence within Australia’s political system. While the government confirmed the laws it intends to introduce this week would not have retrospective effect, and while the prime minister said the regime was not aimed at rising Chinese influence specifically, Tuesday’s policy announcement quickly escalated into a full-throated political assault on Labor’s strife-torn senator Sam Dastyari, who remains in hot water over his dealings with the Sydney-based Chinese businessman, Huang Xiangmo. The government used question time to pile pressure on Dastyari and the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, with Turnbull declaring the Labor leader had “belittled and betrayed Australia” by leaving Dastyari in the Senate. Turnbull asked rhetorically whether Shorten believed the job of the Labor party was to work with the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to keep Australia safe, “or simply sell Australia out?” Labor returned fire, asking the government whether it had delayed the introduction of legislation banning foreign donations for more than a year because the former trade minister Andrew Robb had described Huang as a “visionary”. The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, referred to the bid by the Chinese company Land Bridge to operate the port of Darwin, and then Robb’s subsequent employment as a lobbyist by that company, asking whether that action would be caught by the prime minister’s proposed legislation on foreign interference. Telegraphing in-principle support for the foreign interference component of the package, Shorten pointed out that he had written to Turnbull six months previously seeking government action. The attorney general, George Brandis said the new laws were necessary because intelligence agencies had told the government there was an unprecedented level of interference in Australian politics by foreign actors. Brandis said intelligence agencies had told the government the attempts to interfere with Australian politics went beyond political donations and included active efforts to infiltrate political parties to gain positions of influence. The new laws, which will first be examined by the joint parliamentary committee on intelligence and security, will strengthen existing espionage offences and impose tougher penalties. The package will include new foreign interference offences targeting “covert, deceptive or threatening actions by foreign actors who intend to influence our democratic or government processes or harm Australia”. New provisions will criminalise support for foreign intelligence agencies, imposing penalties of up to 20 years in prison; criminalise leaks of harmful information; introduce new sabotage provisions; and introduce new theft-of-trade-secrets offences to protect Australia from economic espionage by foreign government principals, with a penalty of 15 years. A government briefing document says there will be a new aggravated offence for providing false and misleading information in the context of security clearance processes, with a penalty of five years’ imprisonment; and there will be additional scope for intelligence agencies to be given interception powers to investigate serious offences. Brandis said the new system of registrations would likely pick up people like the former New South Wales premier and federal foreign affairs minister Bob Carr, who is currently a director of the Australia-China Relations Institute. Asked whether Carr would need to register under the new system, Brandis replied: “Likely, yes.” He said the new arrangement would also apply to Robb in his new role as a lobbyist. The Turnbull government has been signalling consistently since the last federal election that it wants to curb the activities of activist groups such as GetUp. The legislation banning foreign donations would create a new class of “political actor” in commonwealth electoral laws – a category called “political campaigner”. The proposed legislation will ban donations from foreign bank accounts, non-citizens and foreign entities. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said on Tuesday political campaigners would be defined as organisations that had incurred more than $100,000 worth of political expenditure in any of the previous four years. GetUp said in response to Tuesday’s announcement that it raised only a very small proportion of its funds from overseas and was happy to support transparency. The Coalition and Labor have made an attempt previously through the joint standing committee on electoral matters to come to agreement on banning foreign donations but the agreement has broken down over the treatment of third-party activist groups. Dreyfus told reporters on Tuesday he was concerned the government was not able to separate its partisan interest from the public interest when it came to funding for activist groups. He said the Coalition had a track record of trying to silence dissent. The Greens foreshadowed amendments to make sure all charities and not-for-profits in Australia could continue to advocate for policy outcomes, including those that received international philanthropic donations. “There are many charities and not-for-profits that rely on international philanthropy to work on important issues such as saving the Great Barrier Reef, finding new treatments for incurable diseases and fighting Aids and malaria in developing countries,” the Greens senator Rachel Siewart said. “The government’s proposed changes seek to stop charities from doing their good work on humanitarian causes and protecting our environment.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/05/turnbull-warns-abbott-against-move-that-could-delay-marriage-equality","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T04:41:51Z","webTitle":"Turnbull warns Abbott against move that could delay marriage equality","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/05/turnbull-warns-abbott-against-move-that-could-delay-marriage-equality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/05/turnbull-warns-abbott-against-move-that-could-delay-marriage-equality","fields":{"headline":"Turnbull warns Abbott against move that could delay marriage equality","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Malcolm Turnbull has warned Tony Abbott against a procedural move that could delay marriage equality and force parliament to return next week after more than 30 hours of debate in the lower house. The stoush in the Coalition party room on Tuesday came as marriage equality advocates were increasingly confident the cross-party group has the 74 votes required to block any substantive amendments to the Senate marriage equality bill. Abbott and fellow Liberal backbench MP Kevin Andrews told the Coalition party room they intended to move a “pious amendment” which would not block the cross-party same-sex marriage bill, but would reaffirm the importance of religious freedom. Such a manoeuvre would reset the lower house debate back to the start of the second reading stage, which has already run all Monday and will continue with extended sittings until midnight Tuesday and again on Wednesday. According to a Coalition source, Turnbull said he takes traditional marriage “very seriously” but warned the Abbott amendment must not be allowed to derail the bill before consideration of substantive amendments in the committee stage. The leader of the house, Christopher Pyne, said if the Abbott amendment were passed it would “negate” the bill. Several others, including Trent Zimmerman, spoke against Abbott’s plan. The overwhelming sense in the Coalition party room was not to delay the same-sex marriage bill, with negligible support for Abbott’s procedural move. However, if Abbott goes ahead with the plan, it will give opponents of same-sex marriage and advocates of religious freedom a chance to show their numbers before the final vote, in which many have pledged to vote for same-sex marriage because the postal survey showed that 61.6% of Australians wanted them to. Conservatives have indicated they will also re-propose substantive amendments that were put to the Senate but rejected. Turnbull has said he supports at least two amendments to guarantee that charities will not be affected and to allow civil celebrants to refuse to solemnise same-sex weddings. A bloc of 73 members from Labor, the Greens, Rebekha Sharkie, Andrew Wilkie and Liberal MP Warren Entsch have said they will oppose all amendments. Although no final 74th MP has publicly committed to oppose all amendments, marriage equality advocates are confident the bloc of the bill’s co-sponsors Tim Wilson, Trevor Evans and Trent Zimmerman will provide crucial votes when amendments are considered. The independent MP Cathy McGowan is also reported to be unlikely to support amendments but has reserved her final position until the debate concludes. Asked on Tuesday about the fact government members may not back the amendments, Turnbull said Coalition MPs had a “free vote” and had the “absolute right” to vote on amendments as they wish. On Monday evening the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, all but conceded the amendments did not have the numbers. Dutton said it was “very hard to see” how proposed “protections” for religious freedom would pass the house, expressing hope amendments would succeed but adding “the arithmetic in my opinion dictates otherwise”. Zimmerman told the house the cross-party bill “will deliver the marriage equality the Australian public voted for”. “Not one word or one clause will change existing rights of religious freedoms,” he said. On Tuesday the Australian Marriage Equality co-chair Alex Greenwich said that advocates took nothing for granted but urged parliament to pass the cross-party bill unamended to “stop playing politics” with LGBTI people’s lives. Fellow co-chair Anna Brown accused conservatives of putting up “further elements to distract, to delay, to attempt via amendments to turn the no side’s talking points into legislation”. “This is a good bill, and this bill balances marriage equality and religious freedom and it should pass this week without delay,” she said. The debate on Tuesday was very personal for three MPs who shared stories of their LGBTI children: Liberal MP Andrew Wallace and Labor MPs Cathy O’Toole and Linda Burney. Wallace said when his daughter came out to him he asked himself “how could this be happening to our family” because “homosexuality went against what I had been taught to believe for many years”. In time, he accepted that the teachings of church “must not be allowed to override our civil laws”. O’Toole said one of her daughters planned to hold a commitment ceremony with her partner next year, but that ceremony “can now be a wedding”. Burney said her son, who was recently found dead after a struggle with mental health and addiction, identified as LGBTI. “I have seen first-hand the confusion, anxiety and pain that many of our young people experience struggling with their sexuality,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/ng-interactive/2017/dec/05/david-squires-jurassic-world-premier-league-managers","type":"interactive","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T10:45:27Z","webTitle":"David Squires on … the Jurassic world of Premier League managers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2017/dec/05/david-squires-jurassic-world-premier-league-managers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/ng-interactive/2017/dec/05/david-squires-jurassic-world-premier-league-managers","fields":{"headline":"David Squires on … the Jurassic world of Premier League managers","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/04/roy-moore-republican-national-committee","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T12:53:44Z","webTitle":"Republican National Committee resumes support for Roy Moore","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/04/roy-moore-republican-national-committee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/04/roy-moore-republican-national-committee","fields":{"headline":"Republican National Committee resumes support for Roy Moore","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Three weeks after the Republican National Committee cut ties with Roy Moore, after multiple women accused him of sexual misconduct when they were teenagers, the group is supporting him again, according to a senior RNC official. The reversal came just hours after Donald Trump announced his endorsement of the Alabama Republican, who is running for the Senate seat vacated by the US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, urging Moore in a phone call: “Go get ’em, Roy.” In November, the RNC pulled out of a joint fundraising agreement with Moore after two women came forward to allege that he had sexually assaulted them when they were teenagers. Leigh Corfman told the Washington Post Moore made her touch his genitals when she was 14 and, in a press conference, Beverly Young Nelson claimed that Moore assaulted her in a car, grabbed her breasts and forced her head down towards his crotch. Other women said that Moore either dated them or tried to date them when they were teenagers. The Senate candidate has denied the allegations and painted them as part of a conspiracy that includes “lesbians, gays, bisexuals and socialists”. The news, first reported by the rightwing website Breitbart, came shortly after the Washington Post reported that Debbie Wesson Gibson, who said she dated Moore when she was 17 years old, produced new evidence of their involvement, including a signed high school yearbook. Gibson said her relationship with Moore was proper but said she felt compelled to share the documentation after he claimed he did not know any of the women who came forward. The Moore campaign said in response to the new allegations: “Roy Moore already said he knew Debbie Wesson and her family but did not recall any formal dates. Furthermore, when he stated that he did not know any of the women, he was referring to those who accused him of sexual assault.” The campaign went on to claim that the Washington Post was trying to undermine their candidate and “write yet another story to distract from Doug Jones’ extremist liberal record”. Moore said at a campaign event last week in Alabama: “I do not know any of these women, did not date any of these women and have not engaged in any sexual misconduct with anyone.” He had previously said in an interview with Sean Hannity of Gibson: “I know her but I don’t remember going out on dates. I knew her as a friend.” Moore also said in that interview, “I don’t remember ever dating any girl without the permission of her mother.” Although the RNC reversed its decision not to back Moore, other prominent Republicans have yet to embrace him. Richard Shelby, Alabama’s incumbent Republican senator, told reporters last week that he had written in an alternative candidate instead of voting for Moore. The National Republican Senatorial Committee, majority leader Mitch McConnell’s political arm, is still refusing to back Moore. The Moore campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the RNC’s renewed involvement in the race. Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and Republican presidential nominee whose niece is the RNC chair, tweeted earlier on Monday: “Roy Moore in the US Senate would be a stain on the GOP and on the nation. Leigh Corfman and other victims are courageous heroes. No vote, no majority is worth losing our honor, our integrity.” Moore was also accused of making antisemitic remarks on Monday, after reportedly criticising the billionaire philanthropist George Soros in an interview with the Christian evangelical radio network American Family Radio. According to an apparent transcript of the interview posted by a Los Angeles-based Fox News producer, Dan Gallo, Moore described Soros’s agenda as “not American culture” and said he “comes from another world that I don’t identify with”. According to Gallo, Moore went on to say: “No matter how much money he’s got, he’s still going to the same place that people who don’t recognize God and morality and accept his salvation are going.” The election for the Alabama Senate seat will be held on 12 December. Polls currently show Moore in a tight race against Democrat Doug Jones.

In 2011 he said the railway was a “rich man’s toy”. The rail industry is doing its level best to deliver on that pledge with Tuesday’s announcement that rail fares will go up by an average of 3.4% in January, the highest increase in five years. Ticket prices have already risen by 27% since 2010, twice the rate of wages. Contrast this with fuel duty, which has been frozen for seven years at a cost of £46bn. Or air passenger duty in aviation – untouched for five years. Yet this government has disproportionately penalised rail passengers year after year while linking fare increases to the more punitive retail price index (RPI) rather than the lower consumer price index (CPI). Why? The simple truth is that the government won’t admit – indeed it cannot admit – that the rail system it created and so steadfastly defended for so many years is now broken beyond repair. Rail privatisation has wasted enormous sums of money. Yet the ongoing defence of failure can become dangerously misleading and potentially dishonest. Rail fares are the apotheosis of this mistrust. To compound matters the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, came to parliament last week to announce a strategic vision for rail. His new vision was actually a huge bailout for Stagecoach on the East Coast mainline which could cost taxpayers billions of pounds. The share price of Stagecoach and other train operators such as Go Ahead and First Group rose significantly last week following the news that the government will guarantee its profits. You would have thought the rail companies might have shown a bit of good grace and decency over the fares increase given the taxpayer bailout? Not a bit of it. Public faith in the railway seems to matter little to the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), the combination of Network Rail and the passenger and freight operation companies that run the network. For example, the group boasts that £925m of private investment was made in rail last year. In fact, much of this is finance for new trains. Finance is not investment. This is but one subjective claim among many. It’s hard to escape the conclusion that the RDG is not only misleading passengers but exploiting them over the fare increases. The next Labour government will cap regulated fair rises at the CPI, using the money saved through bringing rail franchises back into public ownership, to ensure fares rise no higher than inflation. This policy would save the average season ticket holder more than £500 over the course of this parliament compared with RPI. Labour’s policy of public ownership of rail will unite track and trains at the highest level of the railway under a united, public company. This organisation will take over train contracts as they expire and include the rail infrastructure work currently done by Network Rail. These plans will, for the first time in 20 years, give the railway a guiding mind which can take a strategic and operational view of the whole network. This contrasts with the current structure where decision-making is totally uncoordinated. Today’s fare rise announcement is yet another betrayal of rail passengers by the government and train companies. Only Labour has the ambition and courage to deliver the railway the public deserves. • Andy McDonald MP is shadow secretary of state for transport"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/05/persisting-problems-with-brexit-and-the-irish-border","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T19:33:52Z","webTitle":"Persisting problems with Brexit and the Irish border | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/05/persisting-problems-with-brexit-and-the-irish-border","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/05/persisting-problems-with-brexit-and-the-irish-border","fields":{"headline":"Persisting problems with Brexit and the Irish border","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It is understandable that Fintan O’Toole (Britain has just discovered it’s now weaker than Ireland, 5 December) should make the most of his country’s 15 minutes of fame but he will soon find that, when push comes to shove, the EU will treat Ireland with the same contempt as they did Greece. It wasn’t that long ago that the people of Ireland had to endure severe austerity imposed upon them by the EU following the 2008 financial collapse. So far the Republic and its taoiseach have been allowed to wallow in self-importance because it suited Brussels, but should that become a real threat to moving to the next stage of negotiating trade, something that’s as important to the EU as it is to the UK, the taoiseach will soon be pushed aside and, like Alexis Tsipras, do as he is told in the traditional way that the EU treats its smaller member states. Fawzi Ibrahim London • The DUP stance that they want a hard Brexit with a soft border has always been contradictory and impossible to achieve. It has to be suspected that they will accept a hard border, despite the damage it will cause in many ways, because they see Brexit as an opportunity to lessen the influence of the Republic on the North. Rejecting special status for Northern Ireland ignores the fact that a special status already exists under the Good Friday agreement. Jacob Rees-Mogg remarks that “we are the Conservative and Unionist Party after all”, disregarding the supposed neutrality of the UK government on the long-term status of Northern Ireland, when this neutrality underpins the peace agreement. This is a very dangerous move by the extreme Brexit supporters. Meanwhile Sinn Féin have abdicated, keeping the Stormont assembly closed and continuing their refusal to take their seats in the UK parliament, despite the crying need for someone to speak up for their constituents at Westminster. The people of Northern Ireland deserve better from the politicians. The obvious answer is of course to cancel Brexit, but failing that the only way to solve this problem is for the whole of the UK to stay in the customs union. Douglas Simpson Todmorden, West Yorkshire • I live in Northern Ireland and I voted remain in the referendum. I have never voted for the DUP. But your editorial (The DUP must not have a veto on the future of these islands, 5 November) rather misses the point. Regulatory alignment might cause few issues at the moment of Brexit but if regulatory regimes are changed, perhaps to secure trade deals, then the alignment of Northern Ireland with Britain will be gradually stretched apart. Why would a unionist support such a process? The editorial, moreover, seems confused in its final statements. If the UK as a whole decided to stay in the customs union the unionists in Northern Ireland would have no objections. What Dublin is seeking to achieve is an economic framework that traps Northern Ireland in a process drawing it away from London towards Dublin. There may be many in the Guardian readership who would support such a move. It is of course defying the consent principle of the Belfast agreement by stealth. That is why many unionists reject the honeyed words from Dublin. Emeritus Professor Bob Osborne Belfast • The DUP’s predictable refusal to countenance a border settlement that could be interpreted as a significant step towards the reunification of Ireland has left the republic between an EU rock and a Brexit hard place. The value of trade between Ireland and the UK is in the region of €1bn a week, including the export of 250,000 tonnes of beef a year. This is threatened not just by Brexit but also by the huge pending free trade agreement between the EU and the South American common market (Mercosur), which Argentina would like to see signed off during its hosting of the WTO ministerial meeting in Buenos Aires next week. As usual, negotiations have been conducted in almost complete secrecy to the extent that media coverage of the deal and its implications for British and Irish farmers has been virtually non-existent. The proposed volumes of exports from Mercosur could significantly undermine Irish beef prices, which will be of little comfort to British beef farmers either. What has been described as a “marginal economic activity” by the NFU is similarly threatened by South American imports and if Liam Fox’s trade bill becomes law, the intention is to “transition” EU free trade agreements into a UK jurisdiction, including Mercosur. So even if the Irish border impasse is resolved, there will remain a real threat to the rural economies of both the UK and the Republic, thanks to the neoliberal trade policies being pursued in London and Brussels.

You asked Google – here’s the answer","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Confession: I’ve watched porn on the job. So many times I’ve lost count, in fact. But then that was when I was writing an erotic memoir and reporting on the adult industry in LA as a freelance journalist. In fact, I’m probably one of the only people I know who can justify having watched adult content on what was technically a work web browser. Turns out I’m not the only one. According to a survey published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior last year, just over 20% of American men admit to having looked at porn at work, albeit the majority doing so on a personal tablet or device – only 5% admitting to using the work computer. We don’t know if they were caught in tech flagrante, or if they were disciplined or even fired for their viewing, but the point is: why do some men browse adult content during office hours? Well, the obvious answer is: they were horny. Whatever the biological or cultural reasons, as psychotherapist Philippa Perry says: “Most men wank most of the time. And in the words of Phill Jupitus: ‘Masturbation is the male screensaver.’” The author of Enjoy Sex, Meg-John Barker, agrees. “It happens to most of us a few times a day, and watching porn and solo sex can be a quick release of that.” So why don’t us women feel the urge on a similar scale, even though we make up a third of all porn viewers? Let’s examine that survey a bit more closely for a minute. The results relating to men were such because the survey only asked men about their porn habits. It’s perfectly possible that women and non-binary people also watch porn at work – we simply don’t have comparable results. Which is interesting in itself. Perhaps the others slip under the radar because our attention is so much on male consumption – and its relative cultural acceptance. Given that women watch less porn than men full stop, we would expect any percentage of women watching at work to be lower. How have we reached a point where a medium designed for private pleasure is infiltrating professional spaces? To some extent, it hasn’t always been about private pleasure. Throughout history, men have routinely consumed sexually explicit images, sometimes at work in group settings, often as a mark of collective sexual identity. If I think back to my childhood in 80s Yorkshire, I still remember the soft porn Sam Fox calendar that adorned the wall of the local car garage, before the Equality Act (previously the Sex Discrimination Act) had proclaimed it a form of sexual harassment for women who worked there. Meanwhile that idea of collective sexuality plays out today. It’s a phenomenon we see in how men (it is usually them) share sexually explicit content on social media – there’s bonding and a break in the usual shame if it’s done with humour in a group chat. And sometimes that extends to company computer use, such as “employees who are sharing something that they think is funny with their colleagues”, says Karen Baxter, employment Partner at Lewis Silkin LLP. With the Equality Act effectively making porn viewing in the workplace an act of sexual harassment if someone else is privy to it, plus the “gross misconduct” clause in employment contracts, which generally covers watching porn at work, if you get caught browsing Pornhub you’re at risk of seriously offending others at best, losing your job at worst. So why would you do it? That risk might be part of the thrill you’re getting from viewing it in the first place, says Barker. Similarly, “when people are watching porn in a way that could fairly easily be found out by others, there could be an element of self-sabotage going on”. It could also be a sign your relationship with porn has become compulsive. If it starts interfering with work duties, says psychosexual therapist Kate Moyle, there are even more damning personal repercussions: “If it starts to get in the way of productivity and eat away at working time, that can have a negative impact on the watcher’s stress levels or mental health as they start to fall behind.” Let’s get some perspective – incidents of individuals browsing adult content on a work computer are actually incredibly rare. Instead, “these issues tend to arise when employees are working long hours in the office, or are taking their work IT equipment home or on business trips”, says Baxter. “Once settled in a hotel room far from home, people can be under the false impression that their actions will never be discovered, or are even legitimate.” Who hasn’t logged into Asos or personal banking in between emails? Boundaries between personal and professional devices are now so blurred, we can forget on just which device – and under whose auspices – we are browsing. As Barker says: “People are used to doing other non-work things in work hours like social media and computer games. For some, it may not feel as though porn is so different.” Porn can be a wonderful, fantasy-fulfilling medium that gives a lot of people a lot of pleasure in a judgment-free, STI-free way. However, surely it has its place – and its place isn’t tucked in a tab in between office spreadsheets. Perhaps it’s time for the men viewing it at work to get a grip of their professionalism. After all, can you really do the job at hand when you’ve only got one free? • Nichi Hodgson is the author of The Curious History of Dating: From Jane Austen to Tinder and a sex and relationships broadcaster"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/06/uk-government-delays-possible-reforms-gig-economy-self-employment","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T06:00:09Z","webTitle":"UK government delays possible reforms to gig economy practices","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/06/uk-government-delays-possible-reforms-gig-economy-self-employment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/06/uk-government-delays-possible-reforms-gig-economy-self-employment","fields":{"headline":"UK government delays possible reforms to gig economy practices","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Reforms to the gig economy expected to improve rights for up to 1.1 million people have been delayed until next year, in the latest sign that Brexit negotiations are hampering domestic policy. Ministers had intended to announce before the end of this month whether they would introduce fresh legislation on modern working practices. But that plan has been shelved amid growing concern that reforms to boost workers’ rights could face parliamentary opposition from the rightwing of the Conservative party. Downing Street’s adviser on modern work, Matthew Taylor, recommended reforms to employment law, which defines whether someone is a worker and therefore eligible for sick pay and the national minimum wage, or is genuinely self-employed. It was expected to mean enhanced terms for large numbers of gig workers including tens of thousands of minicab drivers and couriers working for companies such as Uber, Deliveroo and Hermes, which use technology to enable gig working and have treated people as self-employed and therefore not entitled to the national minimum wage or sick pay. It could also put an end to the rash of court cases being fought by gig economy contractors, many of whom have successfully claimed they are in fact treated as employed workers only without the benefits. The minicab app company Uber was told on Monday that it would not be allowed to immediately appeal to the supreme court following last year’s test-case ruling that two of its drivers should have been classed as workers rather than self-employed. Instead it will have to make its case at the court of appeal, which means the legal dispute could extend into 2019. Hermes, the courier company, Deliveroo, the take-away delivery company, and Pimlico Plumbers are among the companies that have faced legal challenges over employment status. During this year’s general election campaign, Theresa May promised the “greatest extension of rights and protections for employees by any Conservative government in history”. She appointed Taylor in October 2016, four months after she became prime minister, and told the nation she would “be driven not by the interests of the privileged few” but people such as those “who have a job but you don’t always have job security”. It is now five months since Taylor published his review in July and Margot James, a business minister, told parliament: “I am determined that we consider the report very carefully and we will respond fully by the end of the year.” However, parts of the reform have now been taken over by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, because they affect national insurance contributions, James revealed on Tuesday. She told parliament the government’s view was “there is too much bogus self-employment”. But the Treasury is thought to harbour concerns that any action that increases the cost of employment could reduce the total UK employment rate. Self-employment has accounted for 45% of all UK employment growth since 2008, according to the Resolution Foundation thinktank. “Matthew Taylor’s review threw up some complex ideas and was wide-ranging,” said a spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. “It is quite right the government gives due attention to the recommendations.” One of the major gig economy companies told the Guardian that shifting self-employed contractors to worker status would increase the unit labour cost by 20%. Taylor confirmed on Tuesday that the response is now expected early next year. He said: “I would rather it was later and stronger rather than earlier and weaker.” There are around 1.1 million people in gig work in Britain, more than half of whom work as taxi drivers, delivery couriers, and in on-demand skilled building trades, cleaning, removals and DIY, according to the Royal Society of Arts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/dec/05/steelers-bengals-game-violence-ryan-shazier-nfl","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T19:03:36Z","webTitle":"Steelers-Bengals brutality a reminder life-altering violence is at NFL's core","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/05/steelers-bengals-game-violence-ryan-shazier-nfl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/05/steelers-bengals-game-violence-ryan-shazier-nfl","fields":{"headline":"Steelers-Bengals brutality a reminder life-altering violence is at NFL's core","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The body count included a pair of young men carted off on stretchers and still more knocked out with serious injuries. Some were a result of routine plays that embody football’s existential risks, others were the offspring of more sinister intentions. Who can say, as the medics rush the field before a hushed stadium or from the antiseptic fluorescent buzz of a hospital room, which brand of violence is more concerning? Does it even matter? One thing’s for certain: the grim tableau of carnage that was Monday night’s divisional grudge match between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Cincinnati Bengals, beamed in 4K ultra-high-definition to a national audience, comes at the worst possible time for a league beset with problems from all sides. The first sobering moment came early on when Ryan Shazier, the Steelers’ Pro Bowl linebacker, immediately reached for the middle of his back after a delivering a head-first hit across the middle. The game was halted for several minutes as the 25-year-old was strapped to a backboard, carted off the field and taken to the hospital for tests amid fears of a spinal injury. (Thankfully, he will not require surgery “at this time”.) What came next was hardly unavoidable: a parade of illegal hits and deliberate head shots between regional rivals bound by a well-documented antipathy. Steelers rookie JuJu Smith-Schuster detonated a vicious blindside block on Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict then preened over his motionless victim, prompting unfettered disgust from ESPN commentators Sean McDonough (“shame on him”) and Jon Gruden (who called it “sickening”). Not long after, Cincinnati safety George Iloka punctuated a game-tying touchdown catch by Pittsburgh star Antonio Brown with a late, high hit. (Iloka and Smith-Schuster have been suspended one game for their actions.) Pittsburgh quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, when asked to assess the brutality of the night in the immediate aftermath, offered a chilling assessment: “AFC North football.” The Steelers’ comeback from 17-0 down in a prime-time game bursting with playoff implications should have been the topline, but the reaction from NFL insiders spoke volumes. “This game is hard to watch for a number of reasons,” tweeted Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman. “Terrible for the NFL and the game of football overall.” “It’s beyond football,” Minnesota Vikings wideout Cris Carter said on Tuesday morning. “This isn’t what competition is about.” Added one longtime Pittsburgh Tribune-Review correspondent: “Tonight in Cincinnati a lot of truly terrible things happened. One NFL team scored more than the other, but nobody ‘won.’” For a league that’s made a strategic effort to persuade the public that it’s a worthy American pastime and not merely a vehicle for gratuitous violence, this was hardly a banner night. Television ratings continue to languish along with the quality of play. Look no further than the actual roll of starting quarterbacks for Week 13’s games, a who’s who that included: Jacoby Brissett, Ryan Fitzpatrick, Blaine Gabbert, Brett Hundley, DeShone Kizer, Josh McCown, Matt Moore, Tom Savage, Trevor Siemian, Geno Smith, Mitch Trubisky. Say nothing of the ongoing showdown with the president of the United States that’s represented a nightmare scenario for Roger Goodell’s pathologically apolitical operation as it’s ballooned into the biggest story in American sports. What was once a unifying force in American life, shrewdly wrought as it was, has become just another casualty of the culture wars. But even that pales to the more existential question that’s become unavoidable to fans of football over the past decade: the moral dilemma of supporting a league whose practices far too often favor profit over basic human decency. Time and again the NFL, which has been accused of concealing the harmful effects of concussions, has prioritized the short-term effectiveness of players over their long-term well-being. Some owners like billionaire oil tycoon Jerry Jones, whose Dallas Cowboys recently unseated Real Madrid as the world’s most valuable sports team, even still continue to deny the connection between football and brain injuries, a stance evocative of the seven largest US tobacco company CEOs who collectively denied the addictive nature of nicotine before a congressional subcommittee in 1994. Last month Bob Costas, who hosted NBC’s flagship Football Night in America program for more than a decade, articulated football’s bleak forecast at a roundtable discussion at the University of Maryland, saying “the reality is that this game destroys people’s brains” and that “the whole thing could collapse like a house of cards if people actually begin connecting the dots.” “The cracks in the foundation are there,” Costas said. “The day-to-day issues, as serious as they may be, they may come and go. But you cannot change the nature of the game. I certainly would not let, if I had an athletically gifted 12- or 13-year-old son, I would not let him play football.” He added: “There is no such thing as a safe blow to the head. And then when you have repeated blows to your head, it increases the risk of permanent brain damage. Once you start having hundreds or thousands of blows, there is a 100% risk of exposure to permanent brain damage. The brain does not have a reasonable capacity to regenerate. This is something we have always known.” The ethical gymnastics demanded of NFL fans have grown more challenging over the past decade as the scientific evidence linking football with brain injuries mounts, forcing spectators to reconcile their thirst for the bone-crunching hits at the core of the league’s appeal with an inconvenient reality: that life-altering violence is not a bug or aberration but an essential feature. “I hope my son plays golf,” Roethlisberger said later Monday night. “If he wants to play football, that’s fine, too. It’s a tough sport. It’s not for everyone.” Grim spectacles like Monday’s have become far too common to represent any sort of watershed moment in football’s marginalization, but make no mistake: they are signposts on a one-way street."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/14851","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T00:00:18Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 14,851","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/14851","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/14851","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 14,851","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/dec/05/what-can-we-expect-in-season-three-of-stranger-things","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T16:59:25Z","webTitle":"Stranger Things: what can we expect from season three?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/05/what-can-we-expect-in-season-three-of-stranger-things","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/05/what-can-we-expect-in-season-three-of-stranger-things","fields":{"headline":"Stranger Things: what can we expect from season three?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"If Stranger Things had ended after its second season we might almost have forgiven the powers-that-be at Netflix. For after all the horrors of the last nine episodes, as the malignant entities of the Upside Down once again invaded the small town of Hawkins, Indiana, that perfect series finale left us with a welcome sense of festive joy and hopefulness for the future of our lovable teenage gang of amateur supernatural investigators. Not for long, though. For Netflix last week announced that the Duffer brothers’ Emmy-winning paean to 1980s Stephen King will be back for another year at least. So what should we be expecting from season three? More brother and sister reunions for Eleven If Milly Bobbie Brown’s Eleven was logically named, there ought to be at least another nine children out there who were experimented upon as part of the nefarious Dr Martin Brenner’s evil MKUltra program, and they might all have different powers. Season two introduced us to Linnea Berthelsen’s Kali, AKA Eight, who is able to manipulate other people’s perceptions, and we already know that Eleven has remarkable telekinetic and psychokinetic abilities. She can eavesdrop on targets in other parts of the world – namely Russians – and manipulate huge objects – vans, giant, multi-limbed smoke monsters – using only the power of her mind. The question is not just what happened to the other nine MKUltra subjects, but also who they have become. It stands to reason that Matthew Modine’s Brenner might have had more success with some of his earlier victims than he did with his later subjects. Could there be a docile, evil version of Eleven out there somewhere, ready to work on the side of the doctor and his sinister cohorts? New creatures from the Upside Down We now know that there are at least three types of monster who have escaped from an alternate dimension into the Upside Down version of Hawkins, and from there occasionally into the real-world version of the town itself. Season one’s Demigorgon was joined by the apparently sentient Mind Flayer and several demonic Demo-Dogs in season two. So what can we expect next? It’s a little known fact that both the Mind Flayer and Demigorgon were named after monsters from 1980s Dungeons and Dragons. The former was described as a (presumably much-smaller) octopus-like creature that fastens itself to humanoid subjects, eats their still-living brains and takes over their remaining limbs, while the latter was a two-headed demon prince. If the Duffer Brothers are leafing throughout the pages of old RPG looking for freaky creatures to riff off, we can perhaps expect to meet monsters like the Flail Snail (sporting spiked balls on its eye stalks, but … you know … still pretty slow and easy to run away from), or the dreaded “Atropal” (ahem … the stillborn foetus of a god) in season three. Or maybe just give us some dark elves. The return of Martin Brenner Absent for most of season two after being attacked by the Demigorgon at the end of season one, the mad scientist needs to return to Hawkins to help explain to us exactly what happened during his hideous experiments in the 1970s. We know he might still be alive, thanks to the information provided by former Hawkins lab worker Ray Carroll in season two. We need to know, for a start, who Eleven’s father is and whether she’s actually related to the other MKUltra subjects. It’s possible that Brenner himself might have impregnated Eleven’s mother Terry Ives while she was trapped in Hawkins Lab – the young psychic did call him “Papa” during early episodes of season one. But it’s just as likely that Brenner is the only one out there who knows the true identity of our hero’s last remaining fully lucid parent. Some sweet relief for poor Will already Noah Schnapps’ Will Byers may have escaped the fate of his literary forebear, King’s unfortunate little Georgie Denbrough in It, but he’s surely suffered enough from the attentions of the Upside Down’s grim denizens that it’s clearly time for someone else to take the strain. Besides, we’re fed up with seeing Winona Ryder heroically forced to find different ways to look anguished and pallid as his mom, Joyce. At the tail end of season two, it became clear that both David Harbour’s Jim Hopper and Gaten Matarazzo’s ever-ebullient Dustin Henderson have most probably been infected with material from the freakish netherworld, so perhaps it’s time for the Mind Flayer to start messing with them instead. Billy Hargrove’s continuing adventures in heavy metal haircut hubris Not since Bill Paxton’s Chet in Weird Science has there been such a fabulous figure of unreconstructed alpha male jockishness as Dacre Montgomery’s Billy, the ornately mulleted, appallingly racist new kid on the block at Hawkins high school who drove all before him in season two before coming up against an even bigger jerk – his own violent bully of a father. Now that we know why Billy behaves the way he does, it would be fascinating to see if he is able to evolve from bully-boy 80s rock star wannabe into something more multilayered in season three, just as Joe Keery’s Steve Harringon eventually managed to find his way in season two after a rocky beginning on the show. And if he can’t, well, an excruciating death in the jaws of something abhorrent from the Upside Down will do just as nicely."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/05/sober-and-living-a-happy-alcohol-free-life","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T19:23:16Z","webTitle":"Sober and living a happy alcohol-free life | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/05/sober-and-living-a-happy-alcohol-free-life","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/05/sober-and-living-a-happy-alcohol-free-life","fields":{"headline":"Sober and living a happy alcohol-free life","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"For those of us who have attained our majority and are reasonably healthy, the decision to not drink is a personal one and one we take fully aware of the benefits and pitfalls.

I was berated – gently, but berated nonetheless – by a heavy-drinking friend of long standing because I no longer drink: when was I going to start drinking again?; drink makes for interesting conversations; no one who doesn’t drink can be fun. He was utterly bewildered at my decision never to drink again – one I made over a year ago and have never regretted. I go to pubs, restaurants and parties where people drink and I don’t.

Female farmers in Arizona – a photo essay","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"By 9am, it’s already 100F (38C). In the desert afternoons, rain gathers on the horizon, teasing – and then it disappears. There is so much heaviness, so much waiting. I pulled on to the ranch of Anastasia Rabin with Audra Mulkern, a Washington-based photographer and founder of the Female Farmer Project. We were on assignment for a story and chasing a statistic: according to the most recent US census, Arizona is the state with the highest proportion of female farm operators. Despite the fact that women have always farmed, they have been left out of our agricultural narrative. An incomplete story has real consequences: women have been left off land titles and bank documents; they have been denied federal loans and training opportunities; and until the 1982 census of agriculture, female farmers were not counted at all. At Anastasia’s, we shadowed her on her daily chores – as she milked the goats and then walked them out on the range to browse the desert brush. And she introduced us to Jo Geerdes, her 78-year-old neighbor and mentor. At the confluence of their stories, we felt the pull of possibility: the potential for mentorship between female farmers and the return of a much-needed business for southern Arizona. And we felt the harsh clip of reality: the human cost of food production amid an arid landscape being sucked dry of its groundwater. For Audra and me, their story has lingered. Anastasia Rabin, 39, ranches on a 160-acre piece of rangeland in Cochise County. The land is scrubby, flat, dry – dotted with creosote bushes and spindly mesquite trees. On the horizon are the silver silhouettes of grain silos. In Arizona, 45% of principal and secondary farm operators are women. Nationally, that same statistic is 30% – a total of 1 million women operating farms or ranches on more than 62m acres and generating $12.9bn in annual agricultural sales. Farming does not respect personal boundaries, exhaustion levels, or breaking points. It is a lifestyle, a spilling over of beauties and emergencies – sick animals, bolting crops, impending freezes, equipment failures, last-minute orders – and all of the coinciding human actions and emotions. A farmer cannot ever fully leave her farm. Anastasia admits to needing solitude – even craving it during times of high stress. But rural isolation has also created a tapestry of challenges, some of which she says have been harrowing. There is no one to depend on, to help with chores, to hold the wire taut while repairing a fence, to share in the beauty and risk of the operation. To put down a sick animal. Within this space, Anastasia has fought to acquire the vast knowledge and skills necessary to survive: marketing, agronomy, lease writing, computer skills, accounting, and animal husbandry. Just a quarter-mile down the road from Anastasia lives Jo Geerdes, aged 79. When Jo and her late husband, George, moved to Elfrida in 1977, their four sons were school-aged and wild. The transition from the midwest to the desert was shocking. Suddenly, the roads were not held in by trees. They learned to watch for rattlesnakes. They could see dust storms and monsoons from miles away. At first they grew hay. But three years after the move, they erected a metal building and opened George’s Custom Meat Processing, becoming the area’s go-to family-owned slaughter and custom butcher shop. In the past few years since George died, Jo and Anastasia have cultivated a close friendship necessitated by living on the range alone as women. They look out for one another. They butcher turkeys and hogs together. When Anastasia had to attend a wedding in New York, Jo hemmed the bottom of a $9 thrift-store evening gown. It was gold and gorgeous, Jo says, clasping a hand to her chest. “Ana looked so beautiful.” Agricultural apprenticeships are regarded as one of the most important and effective ways to transfer knowledge, skills and land to new generations of farmers. Because it is estimated that 70% of farmland will change hands in the next two decades, it has become more urgent than ever to connect young farmers with retiring farmers in order to keep land in agricultural production. When Jo wrenches open the metal door to George’s, it’s as though the building lets out a small sigh – the ghosts of people and animals who have passed through, the love between Jo and George as they stood beside each other for 35 years, the meticulous dedication that each had for the operation. Each piece of equipment is immaculately kept – the kill pen, the skinning hooks, the scalder, the smoker, the vintage scale. It is as though time has stopped: knives are sharpened and laid out on a cloth; a tidy desk holds records and hand-kept books; rubber stamps are hung just-so, depicting each cut of meat. There is not even a layer of dust. As the years have ticked by, Anastasia has begun unofficially apprenticing with Jo, desperate to soak up her immense bank of slaughtering and butchering knowledge. As their friendship has grown, they’ve begun talking about partnership opportunities or creative financing so that Anastasia can reopen George’s. But just before we visit, on the same day that Jo celebrated her 39th anniversary on the property, her well failed for the first time in its history. Here in Cochise County, temperatures spike to 110F in the middle of June. The long growing season supports extra plantings of cotton and alfalfa, and hay dries quickly once it’s been cut. Nuts grow well here, too – heat-loving pistachios, almonds and pecans. But these crops are particularly thirsty, and they pose an interesting resource issue for Arizonans. Anyone who lives here knows you don’t buy land in Arizona – you buy water. That water is quickly being bought by housing speculators: mega-billionaires looking for agricultural tax write-offs, and almond and pistachio farmers flocking from drought-stricken California. Even foreign agricultural companies have begun to appear. Perhaps the most shocking example is the Saudi dairy company that purchased 17 miles of Arizona desert for alfalfa production, only to ship the alfalfa back across the ocean for feed. Amid this frantic land grab, small-scale farmers and ranchers like Anastasia and Jo face an uncertain future. With the additional demand on groundwater imposed by outsiders, the aquifers are being depleted at nearly double the rate they once were, which has experts wondering how many more years of commercial agriculture Arizona can support. As wells are beginning to go dry, farmers are left with two options: spend tens of thousands of dollars to drill deeper – or get out now. “Do you have water to drink?” Anastasia asks Jo, as we stand in the quiet of the meat cutting room. She leans against a long stainless steel table. “Have you been able to shower?” Jo shrugs and cracks a joke about bathing in a bucket. But there is worry in Anastasia’s voice, and a palpable anger at the situation. What will they do out here without water – to drink, to cook, to grow gardens, to water livestock? What will happen to the land value? Jo’s sons keep trying to move her back to the midwest. “What are you doing out there, Mom?” they ask her. She has trouble answering them any more. “If there’s no water, what’s the point?” Jo asks us. Her voice is somber, defeated. We do not answer, because we do not know – how do you pull water from a stone? Should Jo and Anastasia leave their land and abandon their plans, it is a loss that extends to the entire community, whether it is realized or not. Not only do we lose a solution to the bottleneck in meat processing options, but it is a missed opportunity for the transference of knowledge and skill – a loss that is impossible to quantify. Since we visited, in June 2016, Jo sold George’s to a local rancher, but she has been able to continue living on the property. Anastasia has scaled back her operation to a homestead level."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/dec/05/air-pollution-harm-to-unborn-babies-may-be-global-health-catastrophe-warn-doctors","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T23:30:01Z","webTitle":"Air pollution harm to unborn babies may be global health catastrophe, warn doctors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/05/air-pollution-harm-to-unborn-babies-may-be-global-health-catastrophe-warn-doctors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/dec/05/air-pollution-harm-to-unborn-babies-may-be-global-health-catastrophe-warn-doctors","fields":{"headline":"Air pollution harm to unborn babies may be global health catastrophe, warn doctors","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Air pollution significantly increases the risk of low birth weight in babies, leading to lifelong damage to health, according to a large new study. The research was conducted in London, UK, but its implications for many millions of women in cities around the world with far worse air pollution are “something approaching a public health catastrophe”, the doctors involved said. Globally, two billion children – 90% of all children – are exposed to air pollution above World Health Organization guidelines. A Unicef study also published on Wednesday found that 17 million babies suffer air six times more toxic than the guidelines. The team said that there are no reliable ways for women in cities to avoid chronic exposure to air pollution during pregnancy and called for urgent action from governments to cut pollution from vehicles and other sources. “It is an unacceptable situation that there are factors a woman cannot control that adversely affect her unborn baby,” said Mireille Toledano, at Imperial College London, and who led the new research published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ). The study analysed all live births in Greater London over four years – over 540,000 in total – and determined the link between the air pollution experienced by the mother and low birth weight, defined as less than 2.5kg (5.5lbs). The scientists found a 15% increase in risk of low birth weight for every additional 5 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) of fine particle pollution. The average exposure of pregnant women in London to fine particle pollution is 15µg/m3, well below UK legal limits but 5µg/m3 higher than the WHO guideline. Cutting pollution to that guideline would prevent 300-350 babies a year being born with low weight, the researchers estimated. “The UK legal limit is not safe and is not protecting our pregnant women and their babies,” said Toledano. “We know that low birthweight is absolutely crucial,” she said. “It not only increases the risk of the baby dying in infancy, but it predicts lifelong risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease etc. You are setting in stone the whole trajectory of lifelong chronic illness.” The new research shows the impact of air pollution on babies in London is significant, but affects a relatively small number – only about 2.5% of all full-term babies are born with low weight. However, many cities around the world – such as Delhi in India – suffer far higher levels of toxic air, raising concerns of huge impacts on unborn babies. “Though the new results from the UK are concerning, a global perspective reveals something approaching a public health catastrophe,” said Sarah Stock and Tom Clemens, from the University of Edinburgh, in a BMJ editorial. “The pregnancy effects of extreme exposure environments like Delhi are unmeasured, and there is an urgent need to turn attention to such environments where large numbers are at considerable risk of harm.” Stock told the Guardian that outdoor air pollution is already causing millions of early deaths every year among adults and children: “And that is not taking into account deaths in utero or resulting from exposure in pregnancy, because we just don’t have the data yet.” Unicef executive director Anthony Lake said: “Not only do pollutants harm babies’ developing lungs – they can permanently damage their developing brains – and, thus, their futures. No society can afford to ignore air pollution.” The new BMJ study is based on observations and so cannot prove a causal link between air pollution and low birth weight, but the correlation is very strong, said Toledano: “The power of our study is incredible due to the sheer numbers.” The study is the largest to date in the UK and the link is strengthened by a series of previous studies from other regions that replicate the findings. There are some uncertainties in the estimates of air pollution exposure and the level of smoking among the pregnant women. But Toledano said: “Could it be that we are slightly off in how much the increased risk is? Yes. Is it going to completely disappear? No.” She said there are a number of serious public health problems around the world, such as the lack of clean water that kills over 500,000 infants every year, but said toxic air was one of them: “There is no question this is an extremely important public health risk. We have to do something and we can’t just say it is down to the individual mother. Every baby deserves to be born safely.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/10/lady-bird-my-mum-my-daughter-and-me","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T06:00:28Z","webTitle":"Lady Bird, my mum, my daughter and me | Eva Wiseman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/10/lady-bird-my-mum-my-daughter-and-me","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/10/lady-bird-my-mum-my-daughter-and-me","fields":{"headline":"Lady Bird, my mum, my daughter and me","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Greta Gerwig’s directorial debut Lady Bird has become the best reviewed film of all time. Until now, Toy Story 2 was number one on Rotten Tomatoes, which aggregates critics’ reviews, but since its release in the US, Lady Bird – a film about a teenage girl who wants more – has leapt ahead. Which pleases me. Not that I wish ill on an animated sheriff or his thick space mate, but this film is a sort of heaven. As well as a perfect portrait of an imperfect girl, it’s an exquisite example of one of the least appreciated genres of film – the mother-daughter drama. The ma-dra, if you will. The mo-dau mystery, perhaps. Personal highlights include: Mermaids – Cher bringing up Winona Ryder and Christina Ricci on a diet of canapés and girl group songs, with death and religion humming away in the background; Carrie – whose mother punishes her for having breasts and also being a witch, she has to die; Mommie Dearest – the very fabulous biopic about Joan Crawford’s abusive relationship with her adopted daughter; and Grey Gardens – two women raging against fading beauty in a house that crumbles before our eyes. Lady Bird is right up there with them, with Saoirse Ronan in the title role (yes Lady Bird is her character’s given name, she says, in the sense that “It’s given to me, by me”) and Laurie Metcalf as Marion, the mother who loves her in a way that makes it feel like war. There’s a scene in a charity shop, Thrift Town, where in the same breath of an argument about the mother’s ability to be lovely to a virtual stranger, but monstrous to her daughter, the two come together over finding a perfect dress, 50s, sleeveless, peach. This, says Gerwig, was an illustration of “How mothers and daughters are with each other. They fight and they love really hard.” Though there’s nuance and tenderness, tears and slapstick, each moment of softness is pierced with a stalactite. At times Marion’s criticisms are so relentless, so pass-agg they make you wince and hold yourself. Lady Bird asks if her mother actually “likes her”. Marion’s reply is: “Of course, I love you.” “But do you like me?” she repeats, and her mother, what a cow, refuses to answer. She’s drawn by Gerwig as a woman who again and again is shocked to hear how bitter she sounds, but is trapped behind too many windows to do anything about it. I came out of the screening sort of dazed – the first thought was how hard it is to be a decent mother, after being a woman for so long, and the second was: “I should call my mum.” At what point does a woman stop being a daughter and become just a mother? It was a shock to leave that velvet dark and emerge into the afternoon all full of questions about life, full of feelings that I was on a breaking bridge between this and that. Newly 37, I feel like I’ve spent my adulthood studiously learning how to be a really excellent 17-year-old. And at the same time I’m mumming furiously, one eye always on incoming traffic, one finger always pointing out planes. I continue to be fascinated by the expectation that once you become a mother you have completed the level before, as if childbirth is the final boss to be conquered before you move on to the next game. Whether it’s a career to be brushed aside in favour of a job that’s organic and linen-based and will fit around school pick-ups, or friendships exchanged for new, local co-dependencies like unwanted gifts at M&amp;S, or your daughterhood – your girlhood, your identity – lost, there is little acknowledgement that a woman continues to be and want a multitude of things when also a parent. And with that, inevitably, are the horrors of personality, pitted with experience, that mean even if you decide, as a project, to be a good mother, there is the obstacle of yourself, there, saying mean things about ambition and shoes. Though this is a film about a teenage girl growing up, the real coming-of-age story is that of her mother, forced to be better. It speaks in a voice we’ve learned to shush, about the trickiness of our formative relationships, ones soundtracked by the slamming of doors. But these are the type of characters, questions and relationships many women crave more of, and the kind of film that deserves to break records. I loved it; it helped.

That is roughly the same estimated cost as a single presidential golfing trip to Mar-a-Lago. The office of the special counsel released on Tuesday its details of expenditures from May to the end of September. The biggest amount for the team of lawyers and investigators who are looking into the presidential campaign is personnel costs: $1.7m. The cost of the investigation is significantly higher – a total of $6.7m in that same period – when other expenses that are related to the investigation that were paid for by the DoJ directly were taken into account. The office said those expenses would have been paid as part of the federal investigation into the possible Russia conspiracy regardless of whether or not the special counsel was involved. The special counsel office was set up in the wake of the firing of James Comey, the FBI director, by the White House. Comey’s dismissal is believed to be one of the subjects Mueller is investigating. The office is paid for by an “indefinite appropriation” at the Department of Justice, which is dedicated to funding special counsels. The other high cost was travel: $223,643 for special counsel staff to travel and, in some cases, relocate in order to do their jobs. The report revealed that the office has contracted out several important functions, including IT services ($111,245), transcripts ($24,456), and building costs ($17,217). Four individuals have so far been charged in the investigation. Two people connected to the Trump campaign – former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign aide George Papadopoulos – have pleaded guilty to perjury and are cooperating. Two others – Paul Manafort and Rick Gates – have been indicted and pleaded not guilty on money laundering and other charges. That’s about $800,000 per indictment. It is not clear how much the White House has spent on the president’s frequent weekend getaways, but estimates range from about $1m to $3m per weekend."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/06/boris-johnson-expresses-frustration-with-failure-to-move-brexit-talks-on","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T10:03:45Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson expresses frustration with failure to move Brexit talks on","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/06/boris-johnson-expresses-frustration-with-failure-to-move-brexit-talks-on","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/06/boris-johnson-expresses-frustration-with-failure-to-move-brexit-talks-on","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson expresses frustration with failure to move Brexit talks on","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Boris Johnson has expressed his frustration at the failure to move the stalled Brexit negotiations on to the next phase, as Theresa May appeared to be running out of time to secure a breakthrough. The foreign secretary is reported to have voiced doubts in cabinet about May’s plan to promise some form of “regulatory alignment” with the EU, in an attempt that has so failed to move the talks forward. Speaking on his way to a Nato summit in Brussels on Wednesday, Johnson suggested the issues could only be resolved in the next phase of the talks. “The best way to sort it out is to get on to to the second phase of the negotiations where all these difficult issues can be properly teased out, thrashed out and solved,” he told Sky News. He added: “What we are going to do, as the prime minister has repeatedly said, we are going to take back control of our borders, of our laws and UK cash contributions, and that’s the way forward. And we will come up with a solution, but that solution can only be discovered in the context on discussion on the end state of the UK’s relations with the rest of the EU.” The prime minister had hoped to be heading back to Brussels as early as Wednesday after reassuring the DUP on the wording of the draft text that it vetoed on Monday. Instead the DUP is demanding “radical surgery” to the draft, leaving May facing an awkward prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, with little prospect of a breakthrough. The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, is understood to have refused to take May’s phone calls to discuss rewording the text of a draft agreement. Meanwhile the pound has fallen against the dollar, adding pressure on May to reach a deal. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said it was impossible for May to insist there could be no hard border in Northern Ireland and rule out membership of the customs union, the single market and the jurisdiction of the European court of justice. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “It is very hard to see how you can reconcile those two positions, and that’s why the government has got into such a contorted position that unravelled this week.” He added: “We think there should be a UK-wide Brexit approach. The government has made a mistake in suggesting there will be one option for Ireland that might be separate from the rest of the United Kingdom, and that’s unravelled.” Pressed on whether Labour wanted continued membership of the customs union, Starmer said: “We say leave that option on the table. We certainly wouldn’t rule it out.” He claimed the stalled talks had exposed splits in the cabinet between those who accepted alignment with EU regulations and those who wanted to deregulate. The former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said it would be “intolerable” to bind the UK to EU regulations prior to trade talks, telling the BBC that the government was starting to “stare at the edge of what is a price that we simply cannot afford to pay”. Former cabinet minister Nicky Morgan hit back, saying: “Walking away when the Brexiteers encounter difficulties they never bothered to anticipate is not in the national interest, betrays the futures of millions of young people and those who never wanted to leave in the first place.” May was due to talk to Foster and the Sinn Féin leader, Michelle O’Neill, on Tuesday night but the DUP leader delayed her conversation with the prime minister, amid suggestions that the unionist party believed there was too much work still to be done on the wording of the divorce deal text. Speaking in the House of Commons on Tuesday, Davis admitted that the government was seeking regulatory alignment with the EU in some circumstances, but insisted that it would be UK-wide and that it did not mean retaining exactly the same rules as the EU. May was warned that she had less than a week to salvage a Brexit deal that would open trade talks before the end of the year, amid increasing signs of impatience within the EU over her handling of the process."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/06/australian-researchers-identify-new-species-of-marsupial-lion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T17:01:22Z","webTitle":"Australian researchers identify new species of extinct marsupial lion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/06/australian-researchers-identify-new-species-of-marsupial-lion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/06/australian-researchers-identify-new-species-of-marsupial-lion","fields":{"headline":"Australian researchers identify new species of extinct marsupial lion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australian researchers have identified a new species of marsupial lion that roamed the rainforests of northern Australia 25m years ago. Weighing in at just over 22kg and boasting a squat, flat head, the new species, named Wakaleo schouteni after wildlife illustrator and paleoartist Peter Schouten, is the fifth known species of dog-sized marsupial lion discovered at Riversleigh, located within Boodjamulla national park, near the Queensland-Northern Territory border. The formal announcement of discovery, made in the Journal of Systematic Palaeontology on Thursday, followed two decades of careful checking and cross-referencing with fragments of other marsupial lions scattered throughout Australia. The first piece of the puzzle was spotted by a keen-eyed volunteer in the 1980s, who saw some weathered bone and teeth protruding from the rocks in a steep gully in Riversleigh. Palaeontologists later discovered a skull, which was cleaved in two halves, and fragments of the postcranial skeleton – the humerus, sacrum and a few hand bones. Lead author Dr Anna Gillespie, who began working on the fossils as part of her PhD with the University of New South Wales in the 1990s, was working on the back half of the skull when she got a call from a laboratory in Mt Isa. Both parts of the skull were found at Riversleigh, a fossil-rich limestone deposit that received Unesco world heritage listing in 1994. It is unique in Australia for capturing a broad sweep of fossils dating from nine to 24 million years old, allowing palaeontologists to see the evolutionary history of certain species. “[The lab] contacted me and said, ‘We’ve got the front half of a marsupial lion,’ and I said, ‘Well, I’ve got the back’, and it was from the same site, and they sent it down to me and lo and behold it matched beautifully,” Gillespie told Guardian Australia. “That’s the best specimen we have actually, this beautiful skull.” The skull placed the animal in the Wakaleo family, an early ancestor of the largest known carnivorous marsupial, the 130kg Thylacoleo carnifex, which hunted megafauna between 1.9m and 30,000 years ago. Most of the fossils were found in an area of limestone dated as the early Miocene period while others are believed to date back to the late Oligocene, putting the animal’s time on earth at between 18 million and 29 million years ago. It’s believed to be a contemporary of Priscileo pitikantensis, a slightly smaller marsupial lion discovered at Lake Pitikanta, near Lake Eyre, in remote South Australia in 1961. The similarities between the two species saw the later reclassified as Wakaleo pitikantensis. Gillespie said the difference between the two could be due to differences in habitat or geographic isolation. It’s also possible pitikantensis is slightly older. Fossils of the three previously-discovered Wakaleo suggest that each iteration of the carnivores was larger than the last. Gillespie has not found enough examples of the W. schouteni’s arm and leg bones to be sure but she said fossils of other animals preserved alongside it suggests it may have led a tree-climbing existence, scurrying up trunks with the help of koala-like opposable thumbs. Arm bones collected so far suggest “a fairly sturdy shoulder, halfway between the koala and a brushtail possum”, she said. “The diversity of the mammal faunas at the sites at Riversleigh have indicated that it’s likely that the environment up there in the late Oligocene was forested, probably open forested, but was we move into the early miocene, Australia’s climate got hotter and wetter and also we can see at Riversleigh that the diversity increases again, so it looks like the forest is more closed, maybe possibly rainforest,” Gillespie said. “The likelihood is that this animal was scampering after its prey, up trees and through the treetops.” Its size, roughly that of a border collie, would have lent itself to an arboreal existence. “They weren’t heavy animals, they could easily have scampered up trees after prey,” Gillespie said. The limestone caves and ridges of Riversleigh, which continually open up new sinkholes and dissolve in puddles, trapping and preserving new fossils for scientists to study in another 100,000 years, may yet yield more information. “We continue to look for more bits of it to answer more questions,” Gillespie said. “Everybody else gets excited when they find skulls and teeth, I get excited when I find limb bones because I really like to fit these animal in their environments and see how they’re actually living.” Schouten, a highly respected illustrator whose imagination has given shape to most of the prehistoric animals found at Riversleigh, said he was “flabbergasted” a species had been named after him. “After scribbling away at what I absolutely love to do for the past 40 years it is somewhat strange to realise that people have noticed,” he told Guardian Australia. “It is just as great an honour to be recognised by my peers by having a species named after me. And what a species! I would have been happy with a lowly nematode, but a marsupial lion - wow!”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2017/dec/06/shakhtar-donetsk-v-manchester-city-champions-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T21:37:09Z","webTitle":"Shakhtar Donetsk 2-1 Manchester City: Champions League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/dec/06/shakhtar-donetsk-v-manchester-city-champions-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/dec/06/shakhtar-donetsk-v-manchester-city-champions-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Shakhtar Donetsk 2-1 Manchester City: Champions League – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"City lose for the first time this season - and it was a deserved defeat, as Shakhtar were superb: they’ll be tough opponents for someone in the last 16; and City will be very different next time we see them, back to full strength. Perfectly executed by Aguero. He swipes it into the top corner in a way that made it impossible for the keeper to guess his intentions - and even if he had, there’d have been no saving it. Butko brings down Jesus, whose feet were too nimble for him. 90 min: Most of the crowd now appears to be wearing Zoro masks. Fonseca is going to have to make good on this vow ... 89 min: City are pushing Shakhtar back as they pursue a consolation goal, at least. But it’s not looking like they’ll get one. Ukrainian resistance is strong. 87 min: A sweeping move by City, thwarted by more splendid defending. Odets beat Jesus to a low cross by Silva. 86 min: Brahim Diaz is a lovely dribbler. 84 min: A terrific tackle by Butko stops Aguero from firing off a shot from close range. Shakhtar substitution: Kovalenko on, Marlos off. 80 min: Lovely skill by Diaz, who feints and accelerates past Butko on the right wing He scurries along then byline and then tries to beat Pyatov at the near post from an acute angle. But he hits the outside of the post! 79 min: More good play by Adarabioyo, as he keeps pace with Taison before relieving him of the ball. 77 min: Adarabioyo does well to step in and put an end to another fast counter-attack by Shakhtar. 76 min: Rakitskiy curls a 25-yard freekick over the wall but into the arms of Ederson. 74 min: Taison shimmies past Danilo and then lets fly from 20 yards, firing several yards wide. 72 min: Guardiola is looking animated on the sideline, but nowhere near as busy as Shakhtar’s players are on the pitch: they’re a most elegant swarm and full value for this commanding lead. City substitution: Aguero on, Fernandinho off. That presumably means a switch from a back three to something closer to a 4-4-2. 68 min: Shakhtar are coming on strong again and look the more likely scorers. So Guardiola has told Aguero to warm up, which is not easy feat as there now appears to be some snow falling. 65 min: Azevedo blazes down the left, eliciting more excited squeals from the home crowd. But his cross is a real let-down. Shakhtar substitution: Azevedo on, Ismaily off. City substitution: Diaz on, Sane off. Guess that’s more about Sunday than today. 60 min: There’s one of those counters! When they break at speed, City can’t keep up with them. Poor old Toure is being bypassed in midfield. City are grateful that Ismaily’s low pass into the box from the left is too close to Ederson, who flops down on to it in a grateful heap. 59 min: City are getting well on top now. Shakhtar remains dangerous on the counter but those counters are becoming rare. The home crowd are having to whistle themselves hoarse. 57 min: Danilo, another City player who has been slack so far, hurries down the right to provide an overlap for Silva. The pass duly comes to him and he hammers an inviting low cross into the danger zone. But Pyatov pounces on it. 56 min: After a cross by Sane is cleared, Silva collects the ball on the right and chips it back into the box. he finds Fernandinho, who has a clear header from eight yards ..... but he nods badly wide! 56 min: Rakitskiy booked for taking down Jesus. 54 min: Taison runs at the City defence again. They’re properly frightened of him. But he shoots over from 20 yards. 52 min: Shakhtar gives the ball away in midfield. Sane takes it up and slips it off to Toure, who lopes towards the opposing box. he sprays the ball wide to Foden, coming in from the left. But the youngster shanks his attempted cross. 50 min: Silva, who has been very disappointing so far, dabs a feeble cross from the right straight to the first defender. 49 min: Ismaily drives down the left again. But his crosses towards the back post is overhit. 47 min: Sane tries to dribble through a forest of bodies. Foden sprints forward from his left wingback berth to offer assistance. The youngster then picks out a smart ball in to Jesus at the near post. Jesus, with his path to goal blocked by two defenders, wriggles around for a bit and then tries to feed Silva near the penalty spot, but his pass is intercepted. 46 min: Sane has a blast from distance, forcing a decent sae from Pyatov. That’s more like it from City. 46 min: No substitutions during the break. Let’s see if Guardiola has at least managed to stimulate an increase in his players’ intensity. Thanks to two fine goals and a sizzling performance, Shakthar are on the verge of reaching the knockout stages and ruining this City’s invincible run. What’s Pep going to do about it? He has a strong bench - and he has the Manchester derby on Sunday. 43 min: Shakhtar one-two their way through City again before Taison dashes past Toure and curls a shot inches over from the edge of the box. There aren’t many teams who make this City side look clunky, but that’s what Shakhtar are doing: they’re tremendously slick. 42 min: Foden bisects the Shakhtar defence with a lovely low pass into the path of Jesus, who suddenly one-on-one with the keeper. The striker does a little shimmy but confuses himself more than Pyatov, who keeps his eyes on the ball and snaffles it, much to the joy of the home crowd. 41 min: Taison hurtles down the left wing, receives a pass and stands a cross up to the back post. Fred meets it with a sharp blast, and it’s deflected out for a corner. Adarabioyo heads clear. 39 min: Toure looked a tad sluggish earlier in the game but he’s up to speed now and starting to exert an encouraging influence for City. 37 min: Nice play by City. Toure lofts a pass towards Jesus, who nods it down for Gundogan. The German takes it on his chest and lets fly with a volley from the edge of the area. Rakitskiy throws himself in front of it to make a top block. 35 min: Superb play by Sane down the left. He tricks and dodges his way past two plays and into the box. Then he tries to cut the ball back for Foden, but he hits it so hard that the youngster can’t possibly control it, instead it rebounds of him and flies high over the bar. 33 min: Feyenoord have equalised against Napoli. Everything’s coming up Shakhtar! Marlos dinks a lovely ball over the top of City’s defence. Ederson charges out to try to sweep up ... but he misses the ball ... and Ismaily canters through to tap the ball into the net from 16 yards! Shades of Hart and Bravo there from Ederson, and City’s invincibility is really in peril now. Over to you, Pep! 30 min: Shakhtar are going for the kill here and their fans are loving it! City, on the other hand, are reeling. They’re finding it difficult to cope with the home side’s speed and slickness, especially on the counter. Good game! 28 min: Taison romps through midfield again, leading a swift counter-attack. he fizzes the ball wide to Bernard, who rips into the left-hand side of the box again. Can he make it 2-0? He lashes a low shot .... straight at Ederson, who reacts smartly to keep it out. Marlos embarks on a nifty dribble towards the City box and then nudges the ball wide to Bernard, who uses the decoy run of Ismaily to buy a couple of yards and then curls a sumptuous shot from near the left-hand corner of the box into the far corner of the goal! It’s a work of beauty. Are City going to come from behind and win 2-1 for the fourth match in a row? Or is their invincibility about to end? 24 min: Adarabioyo receives the ball out near the right-hand touchline, right in front of his manager. He takes the opportunity to demonstrate his composure on the ball, calmly turning away from Rakitskiy. But then he takes a hefty touch and allows the ball to run out of play, straight to Guardiola. Doh! 22 min: Danilo booked for a late tackle on Ismaily. 20 min: Taison, whose hamstring seems to have healed, bursts through midfield, leaving Toure lumbering in his week. He eventually offloads to Marlos, who darts into the box and tries to curl a left-footer towards the far corner. But it’s straight at Ederson, who makes an easy save. 17 min: Since the start the locals have been whistling City every time they take possession. It’s going to be quite the challenge to keep that up if City continue to hog the ball as they are doing now 15 min: City are starting to dominate. But they still haven’t created a real chance. Sane tried to do something about that just now but he didn’t get very far, as Bernard stepped in to take the ball off him as soon as he tried to go past a defender. 13 min: Butko heads away a corner by Sane at the near post. 11 min: Jesus wins a corer down the right for City, as his cross is put behind by Ordets. Sane takes it short to Gundogan, who tries to dribble into the box. But he’s foiled. 10 min: City knock the ball about, trying to sap the energy of the home team rather than seriously threaten them yet. 7 min: A nimble move takes Shakhtar sweeping forward and into the box, where their speed sparks panic among City’s defence. The ball eventually breaks form a scramble to Perreyra, whose shot from 12 yards is blocked by Fernandinho. 6 min: Taison appears to have a sore hamstring. He’s trying to stretch it out but Shakhtar have sent a sub to get stripped already. 4 min: In terms of formation, by the way, Foden is on the left-hand side of midfield while Fernandinho is on buccaneering right-back duty. 3 min: Napoli are already leading at Feyenoord, so Shakhtar more than likely need to get at least a draw from this match. But they already suspected that would be case. And on that note, Taison bog-toes the ball over the bar from 20 yards. 1 min: Shakhtar are already demonstrating the slick one-touch interplay that they showcased in the first half in Manchester... City are wearing their usual sky blue kit. Shakhtar’s shirt is white but with orange pauldrons, like unit-leader stormtroopers in Star Wars. The teams are in situ. It sounds like a splendid atmosphere in Kharkiv, where many Shakhtar fans are wearing Zoro masks after their manager declared that he would run around the town dressed as Zoro if Shakhtar qualified. “Any idea why Pep has burdened several of his first XI with the long trip, even if they are probably going to remain on the bench ?” parps hristopher Jollife. “It seems a missed opportunity to rest about eight players but only De Bruyne (suspension) and Magic Dave (phantom injury certain to heal by Sunday) are given a complete rest.” He’s targeting invincibility, I fancy: he couldn’t bring himself to just throw this game. “I want to win the game. We have prepared seriously for that, with respect for the opponents and everybody.” About Shakhtar he says: “I came here with Barcelona and Bayern and it was always so so tough. Even with our normal lineup it would have been difficult because they have a lot of talent, with some Brazilian players and a Portuguese manager who I think will be one of the best in the future.” As you can from the lists below, Guardiola has chucked a couple of rookies into his starting lineup. Tosin Adarabioyo is a 20-year-old centreback who has been at City since the age of five; and Phil Foden is one of the 17-year-olds who scaled to the top of the world with England recently - and today it looks as if he’s going to be deployed in Fabian Delph’s left-back/central midfield role. Or perhaps Danilo will go there and Fernandinho will slot in at right-back. The element of surprise is strong with this one ... Shakhtar: Pyatov; Butko, Ordets, Rakitskiy, Ismaily; Fred, Stepanenko; Marlos, Taison, Bernard; Ferreyra Subs: Shevchenko, Dentinho, Khocholava, Alan Patrick, Petriak, Azevedo, Kovalenko City: Ederson; Danilo, Adarabioyo, Mangala, Foden; Gundogan, Fernandinho, Touré; B Silva, Jesus, Sané Subs: Bravo, Walker, Sterling, Aguero, Otamendi, Duhaney, Diaz Referee: B Bastien (France) Hello there. Welcome here. Here’s what we’re dealing with today: Shakhtar Donetsk need to get at least a draw from this match (unless Napoli drop points against Feyenoord) in order to follow Manchester City into the knockout stages. So the Ukrainians will be pleased that City are already safely through as group winners and can treat this appointment like nothing more than one of those work bashes where you have to show your face before slinking off home. But is that really how City will approach this? They may have a big date with their neighbours in red this Sunday but they also have a proud unbeaten record to protect. City have not lost in any competition this season and Pep Guardiola does not seem the sort to give up that record lightly, even if his lineup here is likely to bear little resemblance to the one that will face United. Surely a perfectionist such as Guardiola is aiming for invincibility this season? Real invincibility, not like Arsenal in 2003-04, when Arsene Wenger’s men were indomitable in the Premier League but lost six times in other competitions that season (seven if you include the Community Shield), including once in Ukraine (and twice in the League Cup to Steve McClaren’s Middlesbrough, for goodness sake). No, Guardiola won’t stand for any of that sort of caper. Expect him to seethe and gesticulate like a wild thing if his team don’t perform today. And since Shakhtar showed in the first half in Manchester that they are a slick side when in the groove. This, then, could be an entertaining affair all around. So don’t go away! Pretty please."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/06/serena-williams-very-likely-to-return-for-australian-open-says-tiley","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T09:24:29Z","webTitle":"Serena Williams 'very likely' to return for Australian Open, says Tiley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/06/serena-williams-very-likely-to-return-for-australian-open-says-tiley","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/06/serena-williams-very-likely-to-return-for-australian-open-says-tiley","fields":{"headline":"Serena Williams 'very likely' to return for Australian Open, says Tiley","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Serena Williams is “very likely” to return to Melbourne for the 2018 Australian Open, according to tournament director Craig Tiley. Williams gave birth to her first child, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr, during the 2017 US Open, and has not competed professionally since she won her 23rd Grand Slam singles title at the Australian Open earlier this year. She has been in training since the birth with new hitting partner Jarmere Jenkins, but coach Patrick Mouratoglou said last week that she had not yet made a decision on whether she would compete for her eighth Australian Open singles title. Tiley, however, was much more enthusiastic when asked about the prospect at a Tennis Australia event to announce that NBL clubs Melbourne United and Cairns Taipans would play a game on Hisense Arena during the Australian Open. “She has got her visa, she has entered, she’s practicing, and she probably just needs a bit more space for a bigger entourage,” Tiley said. “There is no question she will be ready in our view. “She wants to break the record owned by Margaret Court and it would be a significant accomplishment.” Court won a record 24 Grand Slam singles titles. Nonetheless, she continues to attract controversy for her views on a range of topics, including marriage equality, and comments earlier this year that “tennis is full of lesbians”. Most recently, Tina Arena drew attention to the spectre of the name of Court’s arena being changed as Ashleigh Barty was awarded the Newcombe Medal for 2017."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2017/dec/06/wakefield-city-academies-trust-west-yorkshire-police","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T11:22:11Z","webTitle":"Police investigate multi-academy trust accused of asset stripping","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/dec/06/wakefield-city-academies-trust-west-yorkshire-police","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/dec/06/wakefield-city-academies-trust-west-yorkshire-police","fields":{"headline":"Police investigate multi-academy trust accused of asset stripping","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Police have confirmed they are looking at the conduct of a multi-academy trust accused of asset stripping its schools before collapsing. Wakefield City Academies Trust announced days into the new term in September that it would divest itself of its 21 schools because WCAT could not undertake the “rapid improvement” they needed. The Department for Education is in the process of arranging for new trusts to take over management of the schools. In October, it was revealed that the trust had transferred millions of pounds of its schools’ reserves to centralised accounts before admitting that new sponsors would need to be found for them. Last month, Wakefield city council backed a motion calling for police to investigate the trust’s finances and insisted that the DfE ensure “full restitution” of money transferred from schools into the trust’s accounts. A spokesperson for West Yorkshire police said: “Following further discussions with the local council, information has been now passed to us which we are looking at. No crimes have been recorded at this stage and consultations are ongoing with relevant authorities.” WCAT declined to comment. Giving evidence to the education select committee on Tuesday, Sir David Carter, the national schools commissioner, blamed the DfE for giving WCAT an “impossible” task by allowing it to take on 14 schools in special measures in 32 months. Before its collapse, WCAT had been dogged by scandal. In October 2016, it emerged that the trust had paid almost £440,000 to IT and clerking companies owned by its then chief executive, Mike Ramsay, and his daughter. The trust insisted the contracts had represented the best value. A draft of a DfE report on the trust’s finances, seen by TES, also raised concerns that Ramsay had been paid more than £82,000 for 15 weeks’ work, despite the fact that the trust faced a large budget deficit. The multi-academy trust model came under renewed scrutiny this weekend when it was revealed that more than 40,000 children are being educated in “zombie schools” – academies waiting to be transferred to another chain. DfE figures, obtained through a freedom of information request, showed 64 academy schools were waiting to find a new sponsor after being given up by, or stripped from, the trust originally managing them. Half of those schools were waiting to be transferred from two chains: WCAT and the Education Fellowship Trust. In March, the latter became the first trust in England to give up control of its 12 academies, including a school in the prime minister’s Maidenhead constituency, following concerns about educational standards."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/06/talking-horses-dettori-can-land-lingfield-prize-plus-the-rest-of-wednesdays-tips","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T08:24:09Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Dettori can land Lingfield prize, plus the rest of Wednesday's tips","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/06/talking-horses-dettori-can-land-lingfield-prize-plus-the-rest-of-wednesdays-tips","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/06/talking-horses-dettori-can-land-lingfield-prize-plus-the-rest-of-wednesdays-tips","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Dettori can land Lingfield prize, plus the rest of Wednesday's tips","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"We may be in the middle of the jumps campaign, with the Express and Star predictably predicting a long, hard freeze and the bookmakers shortening the odds on a white Christmas on a daily basis, but the focus of attention on Wednesday is Flat racing. It is the action at Lingfield that catches the eye with Toast Of New York, the horse that finished second in a Breeders’ Cup Classic on his latest racecourse appearance, reappearing in the Betway Conditions Stakes. Frankie Dettori will be rocking up to the Surrey venue and clearly if his mount can reproduce anywhere near the level of form he showed when runner-up at Santa Anita three years ago, he should win with ease here. However, the Jamie Osborne-trained runner is unlikely to be wound up first time out after such a long absence and Intern (1.10) is the one to take him on with. The selection was highly tried but well beaten in the King Edward VII Stakes at Royal Ascot when last seen, racing far too freely that day. He had previously been beaten just a head in the Sandown Classic Trial and could find the switch to all-weather action to his liking. Dettori will be arriving early at Lingfield to take the mount on the very well-bred Mordin (11.40) in the opening mile maiden race. The jockey booking is one to note here as is trainer Simon Crisford’s recent record with three-year-old newcomers. Mordin is certainly one to keep a close eye on in the betting. Summer Icon (12.10) on the same card looks to have been readied with this seven-furlong contest in mind. Mick Channon’s runner was third in the equivalent race last year and can run off a lower rating than when successful over track and trip earlier this year. The best bet on the two National Hunt cards is at Haydock where Rolling Dylan (1.20) who raced as if the step up to three miles he faces this time when winning at Worcester last month.

Hammerson, which also owns the Brent Cross shopping centre in London, is acquiring smaller rival Intu in a £3.4bn deal that highlights the increasingly tough retail environment.The trend for online shopping is prompting many retailers to close stores and focus their property portfolio on the top tier of the most popular malls. Rents in the premium shopping centres are holding up or rising, while less popular malls and some high streets are struggling to survive. Marks &amp; Spencer, Debenhams and Toys R Us have all announced plans to close stores this year while the collapse of BHS last year has also left shops empty. The cost of living squeeze caused by inflation outpacing wage growth has forced companies such as Hammerson and Intu into action, according to Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group. “Online shopping means shopping centres and high street shopping are in a long-term malaise,” he said. “Shareholders will want to see assets sold down in the merged company to help fund the deal and to reflect the lower demand for bricks and mortar stores.” The merged Intu and Hammerson group plans to sell at least £2bn of assets to strengthen its balance sheet and allow it to reinvest in other, higher return opportunities. Analysts said the merged company was likely to focus efforts on its supermalls, where shoppers and retailers most want to be. The new group will own 12 of the country’s 20 supermalls, including Birmingham’s Bullring and Manchester’s Arndale centre, according to retail analyst GlobalData. “As clothing and footwear retailers focus on supermalls to create large-scale, experience-led stores, physical retail spend will move away from town centres towards destination shopping centres, ensuring supermall space is hot property,” said Sofie Willmott, senior retail analyst at GlobalData. “The proposed deal will net the group a stake in almost 60% of all UK supermall space, making it a force in the retail landscape, well placed to benefit from retail spend shifting across locations.” Hammerson, which also owns Bicester Village, will pay 253.9p a share in a deal that values Intu at £3.4bn. It will hand Hammerson Intu’s porfolio of shopping centres in the UK and Spain, including Lakeside in Essex and the Metrocentre in Gateshead. Hammerson also owns property in Ireland and France. John Strachan, chairman of Intu, said the deal between the two companies would “present a highly attractive proposition for retailers and shoppers in Europe’s leading cities”. He added: “A combination of both Intu and Hammerson will create a more resilient, diversified and stronger group.” The combined group will retain the Hammerson name and be led by the firm’s chief executive, David Atkins. He said the deal would strengthen its portfolio and opportunities for growth, including in Spain and Ireland, two of Europe’s fastest growing economies. “The acquisition creates a leading pan-European platform of desirable retail and leisure destinations which are better positioned to serve the needs of our retailers, excite our customers and support our partners and communities,” Atkins said. Shares in Hammerson closed down more than 6% at 501.5p, while Intu shares were up nearly 14% at 226p. On Tuesday, the day before the deal was announced, Intu shares had fallen 27% since the beginning of the year. Hammerson said it expected the deal to generate £25m of annual pre-tax savings by the end of the second year, as a result of lower office costs and by combining support functions such as IT and digital operations. The company expects a one-off cost of about £40m as the two businesses are integrated. The deal would result in Hammerson shareholders owning about 55% of the enlarged company, with the remaining 45% owned by Intu shareholders. Hammerson, a FTSE 100 company, has received backing from investors who hold 50.6% of Intu shares – including from Peel, the property firm founded by John Whittaker, currently deputy chairman of Intu. Whittaker will retain the same role in the combined company. David Tyler, chairman of Hammerson, will become chairman of the new company."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/08/amazon-has-come-to-australia-with-its-model-to-recolonise-our-markets-and-minds","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T00:00:54Z","webTitle":"Amazon has come to Australia with its model to recolonise our markets and minds | Susan Hawthorne","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/08/amazon-has-come-to-australia-with-its-model-to-recolonise-our-markets-and-minds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/08/amazon-has-come-to-australia-with-its-model-to-recolonise-our-markets-and-minds","fields":{"headline":"Amazon has come to Australia with its model to recolonise our markets and minds","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Amazon has opened its store in Australia. I wonder how long it will be before there will be casualties? In the USA, it did not take long. The very first one was one of the finest feminist bookshops in America, Amazon Bookstore in Minneapolis. The proprietors of this store protested. They took amazon.com to court. They won a payout, but they still lost because they could no longer stay in business. When other feminist bookstore owners saw this outcome, many lost heart and gave up struggling to survive. The demise of the Amazon Bookstore occurred in the midst of other changes in the book trade. The industry was being technologised. Amazon, Borders and other superstores had the financial resources to computerise all stock in their retail outlets. The lower turnover feminist and independent stores relied on knowledgeable staff who knew their stock and could take a customer to the correct shelf in the shop. Most of the independent booksellers had neither the knowledge base for technology nor the finances to move into this new way of operating. And even those who did rarely survived. By the end of the 1990s, few feminist bookstores remained. Booksellers and publishers in other parts of the English-speaking world were also soon affected as globalisation spread and superstores were established in other territories. Feminist publishers were the canary in the mine, because like the bookstores, they relied on a loyal audience. You would think that feminist publishers would do better with more players, but that was not so since the superstores are not interested in independent publishers who might publish for a select, niche audience. When independent bookstores folded, independent publishers also struggled and many went out of business. These changes had a cascading effect on feminist publishers as well as on independents across the industry. As Mark Rubbo pointed out in his article on independent bookshops in the USA, independent bookshops have fallen from around 6,000 in the early 1990s to 2,321 in 2017. That is a loss of almost two thirds of the independents. Like ecology, publishing is part of a complex system that responds to the changing forces in the world. Independent publishers often have a knack for anticipating cultural shifts. This is because they ride the fast-moving outer shoreline of the cultural river while the big publishers paddle in the shallow mainstream. Publishing works in ways similar to farming and independent publishers are more like heirloom plants. Amazon promises a future of monocultures, the kind of monoculture that rides roughshod over bibliodiversity. It is also a process of recolonisation, and this is particularly evident in the digital space. Self-publishing too has been appropriated, and much of it is now in the hands of Amazon. Traditional publishing involves a contract agreed upon by publisher and author, and although there have been many disgruntled authors who have signed up to contracts they later regretted, at least the publisher is obliged to obtain the consent of the author to change those conditions. Amazon, by contrast, reserves the right to change any part of its contract, for any reason, at any time with any author who has signed on. Writers need to inform themselves about the pitfalls of these new kinds of contracts. Against recolonisation we should bear in mind the words of Arundhati Roy in her 2003 book War Talk, that we should be prepared “to not only confront empire, but to lay siege to it.” Small publishers have the advantage of flexibility and smaller lists to convert or create. Through our websites we can make literature available directly to our readers and we can engage with those readers. It is my hope that bibliodiversity will extend into this new digital space. The contradictory positions of mega-publishers and independent publishers requires the latter to walk the tightrope between flexibility and early adoption of new technologies, and the “need” for wide distribution, which is almost totally in the hands of some of the most powerful and capitalised companies in the world. In the world of contemporary globalised publishing we are facing the massive market power of one player: Amazon. Not only does Amazon have distorting power as a buyer – of books and eBooks from publishers (monopsony); but also as the most powerful seller – of books and other consumer goods to consumers (monopoly). It is the model favoured by imperialists of all kinds and a matter of recolonising our markets and our minds. Independent presses represent our hope for the future. First the independent bookstores will feel the pinch; next it will be the independent publishers whose books are less likely to be stocked in the major bricks and mortar stores; writers will feel the crunch coming on their already low incomes; finally readers will miss out because the range of books available will be hugely diminished. Not only that, but marginal stories – and Australia is a marginal story in the global culture – will rarely be heard. If you are a reader, you might want to consider which books you buy and where. You might want to consider what will be left for your children to read. Will it be limited to mass-market American celebrity and violence stories? Or do you want something more? • Susan Hawthorne is co-founder of Spinifex Press and author of Bibliodiversity: A Manifesto for Independent Publishing"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"media/2017/dec/06/abc-makes-big-changes-to-radio-programs-across-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T04:23:25Z","webTitle":"ABC makes big changes to radio programs across Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/dec/06/abc-makes-big-changes-to-radio-programs-across-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/dec/06/abc-makes-big-changes-to-radio-programs-across-australia","fields":{"headline":"ABC makes big changes to radio programs across Australia","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The ABC has made sweeping changes to its radio schedule, dumping hosts, shifting time slots and introducing double-headed Breakfast programs in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth. At ABC Sydney, the Breakfast presenter, Robbie Buck, will team up with the Mornings presenter, Wendy Harmer, for one show which will run between 6am and 10am, with a half-hour break for AM at 8am. Although AM remains untouched in the restructure, The World Today with Eleanor Hall and the flagship PM have been halved to 30 minutes, as revealed by Guardian Australia on Tuesday. The decision to cut the ABC’s daily radio current affairs output from two and a half hours to 90 minutes has been met with anger by ABC listeners and journalists. The Drive shifts have been extended to 6.30pm to capture the longer commuting times at the end of the day, says the director of radio, Michael Mason. “We know that our metropolitan audiences are seeking a broader mix of quality local news and information at that time relevant to their commute home,” Mason said. The ABC’s news director, Gaven Morris, told staff the changes to radio current affairs were audience-driven, there were no cuts to jobs and they would free up resources for podcasts and digital storytelling. Seven months after the death of PM host Mark Colvin, the ABC has named former foreign correspondent Linda Mottram as his replacement next year on the shorter PM, which will shift to 6.30pm on local radio and remain at 5pm on Radio National. Melbourne also gets a dual breakfast team with Jacinta Parsons and comedian Sami Shah co-hosting from 5.30am to 7.45am, replacing Red Symons who announced last week he had been dumped. A new capital city mid-morning program, Focus, will start at 10am in Brisbane, Sydney and Perth hosted by Emma Griffiths in Brisbane, Cassie McCullagh in Sydney and Nadia Mitsopoulos in Perth. Mornings presenter Jon Faine hosts his Conversation hour at 11am in Melbourne. RN Drive presenter Patricia Karvelas has added a television show to her roster at the ABC and will give up her role hosting her Sunday night program on Sky News Australia. The new ABC Karvelas show is yet unnamed but will screen on the ABC News channel at 9pm Sundays. Regional audiences are getting a new 25-minute regional national current affairs program at 6.05pm on weekdays. “Our new current affairs program provides audiences, particularly those living in regional Australia, with a mix of news and information from across the country at the end of the day,” the director of ABC Regional, Fiona Reynolds, said. “Regional Australians have told us that they want to know what matters to people in other communities and have a say in national conversations.” As previously reported, Triple J and Double J presenter Myf Warhurst will host a new early afternoon music and culture show with a “contemporary and conversational feel” on local radio on weekdays at 12.30pm, replacing the second half of The World Today. In Perth the Breakfast presenter Peter Bell will be joined by Paula Kruger for another joint production. Mason said the move to co-hosted Breakfast programs was due to the positive response from listeners in cities where a double-header presentation had been trialled. In Canberra, Adam Shirley was named the new Mornings presenter, replacing experienced broadcaster Genevieve Jacobs who told colleagues she was “very sad” to be told by management “her services were no longer required” after a decade. “At 50 I am certainly not retiring and I am also hoping to continue my work in the community,” Jacobs said in an email. The 2018 line-up also includes new afternoon presenters in Brisbane (Katherine Feeney); Melbourne (Richelle Hunt); Canberra (Anna Vidot); and Liz Trevaskis in Darwin. There are also new Drive presenters in Brisbane (Steve Austin); Perth (Geoff Hutchison); and Canberra (Laura Tchilinguirian). On Radio National, Michael Cathcart’s Books and Arts has been replaced by a new daily arts show, The Hub, which will cover a different discipline each day at 10am. The Stage Hub will be presented by Cathcart on Mondays, The Book Hub by Claire Nichols on Tuesdays, The Art Hub by musician Eddie Ayres on Wednesdays and on Thursdays Jason Di Rosso will present The Screen Hub. On Fridays a popular culture show Stop Everything!, presented by Beverley Wang, Benjamin Law and Lauren Rosewarne, will air at 10am."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/07/maciej-obara-unloved-review-ecm","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T18:20:20Z","webTitle":"Maciej Obara: Unloved review – exhilarating drive and mercurial energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/07/maciej-obara-unloved-review-ecm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/07/maciej-obara-unloved-review-ecm","fields":{"headline":"Maciej Obara: Unloved review – exhilarating drive and mercurial energy","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Early in his first album for ECM Records, the Polish saxophonist Maciej Obara seems to be confirming that he knows all about the label’s famous penchant for vaporous tones and moonlit moods. But anyone who has heard Obara and his regular piano partner Dominik Wania live knows otherwise - both are improvisers of mercurial energies. If Ula, the opening ballad, begins in melancholy long tones and cymbal whispers, a jazzier urgency soon surfaces, and the Polish pair’s ensemble empathy with Norwegian bassist Ole Morten Vågan and drummer Gard Nilssen emerges. Obara’s pensive jazz-ballad originals are steadily intensified by graceful piano touches and pulsing basslines, and the late Krzysztof Komeda’s lovely title track is delivered in a resonating alto sax purr. Looser improv occupies the later stages of the set, with Obara firing off a barrage of clipped figures and scalding runs on Echoes, his thoughts quickwittedly mirrored by the pursuing Wania.

It is the first comprehensive data-gathering exercise from any parliament across the UK after last month’s revelations of historic sexual harassment and assault rocked both Westminster, Holyrood and the Welsh Assembly. The wide-ranging survey was sent to 1,650 recipients working across Holyrood on Wednesday morning, including MSPs, their staff and interns, parliament and government staff, contractors and members of the media. It asks detailed questions about their experiences working at the Scottish parliament, but also in regional and constituency offices. The survey covers experiences of both sexual harassment and sexist behaviour, ranging from unwanted text messages to persistent pressure to form an intimate relationship to unwanted physical contact. It also allows bystanders to such behaviour to register their own experiences, by asking recipients if they have ever witnessed colleagues behaving in such a way. There are a number of questions covering the institutional attitudes of the parliament, including: “Do you think that there is an atmosphere or culture in the parliament that discourages people to report their experiences of sexual harassment or sexist behaviour?” and “How confident are you that, if you reported an incident of sexual harassment or sexist behaviour, it would be treated seriously?” In a letter urging as many people as possible to complete the survey, Holyrood’s presiding officer, Ken Macintosh and chief executive, Paul Grice, said: “The parliament takes a zero tolerance approach to harassment and sexual misconduct and, through the establishment of the dedicated help line and the commissioning of this survey, is working hard to tackle concerns raised and any underlying causes.” The letter also noted that, over the lifetime of the Scottish parliament the number of reported cases of sexual harassment had been very low, while the number of calls to the helpline established after last month’s revelations remains in single figures. The survey was developed by parliamentary officials, with input from Emma Ritch, the head of Scotland’s leading equalities organisation Engender, and from the independent market research company Progressive. Progressive will administer the survey on the Scottish parliament’s behalf and carry out an independent analysis of the results which Macintosh and Grice have committed to making public after an initial review. This is expected in March next year. Meanwhile, party investigations are ongoing into the suspensions of two MSPs after allegations of sexual harassment. Three weeks ago the SNP suspended Mark McDonald, the former Scottish government minister who resigned his cabinet post after admitting “inappropriate” behaviour towards women. In the same week, Scottish Labour suspended Alex Rowley, who stepped aside as its interim leader after his former partner made a series of claims about his behaviour during and after their relationship. The SNP also has one other investigation ongoing into a party member who is not an MSP."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/06/joe-hart-west-ham-david-moyes-dropping-chelsea","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T10:00:48Z","webTitle":"David Moyes considering dropping Joe Hart for West Ham’s meeting with Chelsea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/06/joe-hart-west-ham-david-moyes-dropping-chelsea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/06/joe-hart-west-ham-david-moyes-dropping-chelsea","fields":{"headline":"David Moyes considering dropping Hart for West Ham’s meeting with Chelsea","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"David Moyes is giving strong consideration to dropping Joe Hart against Chelsea on Saturday, casting doubt over the West Ham United goalkeeper’s status as England’s No1. Hart’s form has been erratic since his loan move from Manchester City in the summer and his absence from last Sunday’s defeat by his parent club offered a rare chance to Adrián, who produced an assured performance on his first Premier League start of the season. Moyes was impressed with the Spaniard, who frustrated City with several fine saves, and it is thought that the 30-year-old has done enough to keep his place for the visit of Chelsea this weekend. That would be a major setback for Hart, whose England place is under pressure before next summer’s World Cup. Gareth Southgate, England’s manager, has made it clear to his squad that they need to be playing regularly for their clubs and he has strong competition in goal, with Everton’s Jordan Pickford and Stoke City’s Jack Butland improving all the time. Hart, who earns £120,000 a week, had hoped to revive his career at West Ham after being cast aside by Pep Guardiola. However the 30-year-old, who was inconsistent during a loan spell at Torino last season, has struggled despite arriving in east London to much fanfare. West Ham remain hopeful that they will still see the best of him, but their concerns have grown. Hart has conceded 30 goals in 14 matches and was heavily criticised after last week’s 4-0 defeat by Everton at Goodison Park. West Ham are in 19th place before hosting Chelsea, have conceded the most goals in the Premier League and have not won since Moyes replaced Slaven Bilic last month, but they produced a better defensive performance against City. Adrián was a big part of that and there were already calls for him to start more regularly after he starred in the Carabao Cup win over Tottenham Hotspur in October. He is a popular figure with West Ham’s supporters and Moyes, who is determined to stamp out complacency within his squad, does not want to send out the wrong message by bringing Hart straight back into the side. Moyes, who has picked up one point in his first four matches, will leave it late before reaching a final decision, but all signs are pointing towards Hart facing a fight to win back his place from Adrián."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/10/ladydata-could-help-solve-gender-inequalities","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T00:05:21Z","webTitle":"‘Ladydata’ could help solve gender inequalities | Stella Creasy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/10/ladydata-could-help-solve-gender-inequalities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/10/ladydata-could-help-solve-gender-inequalities","fields":{"headline":"‘Ladydata’ could help solve gender inequalities","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Benjamin Franklin once argued nothing was certain except death and taxes. Certain they may be, but experience of both is very unequal. While women tend to live longer than men, their pockets are hit much harder when it comes to public revenues. And if one is a matter of physiology, the other is a question of politics. Without data to identify how and why, neither can be addressed. It is now devastatingly clear that seven years of austerity budgets have hindered equality in Britain. Raising the personal tax allowance and the higher rate threshold to £50,000 may be popular, but it helps older white men most of all. More than 43% of adults do not earn above this allowance in the first place and, of these, 66% are women and 41% have dependent children. Seventy-three per cent of those who can expect to gain from raising the higher rate threshold are men. The refusal to lift the public sector pay cap, where women make up two-thirds of the workforce, not only pushes more into poverty but also widens the gender pay gap. More than 40 years after the legislation, women still do not have equal pay and are therefore much more likely to be dependent on benefits. With policies such as universal credit, they will lose 10 times as much as they gain from initiatives such as the national living wage. Understanding the impact of economic policy is not just about gender – if the government continues with its courses of action, black and ethnic minority women will lose 12 times as much. House of Commons analysis has found that 86% of cuts between 2010 to 2017 have fallen on women, costing them a total of £79bn since 2010, against £13bn for men. Ending inequality in Britain requires not only action on the underlying problems, but also budgets that don’t make things worse. To make better choices requires politicians with the data to understand the consequences of their actions on the public – and the determination to act when presented with the numbers. The last prime minister proclaimed sunlight was the best disinfectant. The current one and her team view a little knowledge as a dangerous thing. Stubbornly, they avoid calls for the collection and publication of evidence about the impact of Treasury policy changes, arguing it is too difficult and that inequality caused by one area of policy – tax – is offset by spending in others – childcare. Work by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, the Women’s Budget Group and the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows how it is both possible and desirable to measure the individual and cumulative impact of economic policies on different groups in society. It is a matter of mindset, not maths, to choose not to do so. Failing to gather such evidence and react to it not only leads to poor policymaking, it is also a breach of the government’s statutory duties. Since 2011, the public sector equality duty has required action to advance equality across all departments. After years of austerity, those paying the price for this government’s choices cannot wait any longer. That is why the “ladydata” campaign, which has taken off on social media, is calling for independent impact assessments of how any proposed budget affects different groups is conducted – and made public – ahead of being enacted. As Brexit has shown, impact assessments are never a solution. They are a tool to help explain what could happen as a result of any decisions being made. What matters is what you do when presented with the results. No government can keep claiming it wants to help the “just about managing” while ignoring the fact that some are able to manage much better than others because of their gender or ethnicity or the region in which they live. Over these coming days in parliament, we have a chance to make such impact assessments as much a part of the budget process as the annual speculation over the chancellor’s drinking habits. Yet if MPs vote against proposals to require these studies, then something else is as certain as death or taxes – inequality will persist."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/09/boris-johnson-iran-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-09T18:11:37Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson holds 'frank' talks for release of Zaghari-Ratcliffe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/09/boris-johnson-iran-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/09/boris-johnson-iran-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson holds 'frank' talks for release of Zaghari-Ratcliffe","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Boris Johnson has held “frank” talks with his Iranian counterpart in Tehran regarding Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman who has been imprisoned there for nearly two years. The foreign secretary, who landed in the Iranian capital on Saturday morning, had a two-hour meeting with Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, about a number of issues including his “grave concerns” for Zaghari-Ratcliffe. A British Foreign Office spokesman said a range of bilateral issues had been covered and that both ministers had “spoken frankly about the obstacles in the relationship”, including Johnson’s concerns about the consular cases of British-Iranian dual nationals. He said the meeting had been “constructive” and both emphasised their commitment to continuing to work together to improve the bilateral relationship. Johnson will also meet Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s president, Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran’s supreme national security council, and other officials, the state news agency Irna said on Saturday. The visit will be Johnson’s first to the country and only the third by a British foreign minister to Iran in the last 14 years. Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been told she will appear in court on Sunday facing new charges relating to espionage that could result in her five-year sentence being extended by as much as 10 years. Johnson has denied these additional charges are due to his error in telling a foreign affairs select committee in November that she had been in Iran to train journalists. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested at Tehran airport in April 2016 with her young daughter, a British national, and accused of attempting to orchestrate a “soft overthrow” of the Islamic republic. She has always maintained her innocence and said she was visiting family. Her employer, Thomson Reuters Foundation, has said she was not there to work and was only on holiday. Johnson has since apologised for the mistake and recently met her British husband, Richard Ratcliffe, who said he was “waiting on tenterhooks and biting his nails” about the foreign secretary’s visit. He told the Guardian: “I’m really pleased he is there in time for Nazanin’s trial and waiting to see what will happen, and trying not to have too clear expectations at all.” Zaghari-Ratcliffe is one of a small number of cases of dual nationals (a status that Iran does not recognise) whose release Britain is seeking on humanitarian grounds. The Foreign Office has declined to name the other individuals involved – or even identify the number in jail – after their families asked for their cases to be kept out of the public eye. Johnson said in a statement prior to his arrival that he hoped his visit would be constructive. The conflict in Yemen and securing access for humanitarian aid were top priorities, he said, as well as underlining the UK’s continued support for Iran’s nuclear deal. He said: “We will also discuss our bilateral relationship and I will stress my grave concerns about our dual-national consular cases and press for their release where there are humanitarian grounds to do so.” He also said that the relationship with Iran was not straightforward but that dialogue was key to managing differences and making progress even under difficult conditions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/09/jacinda-ardern-bill-shorten-australia-new-zealand-education","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-09T07:24:31Z","webTitle":"Jacinda Ardern: Australia education policy penalising New Zealanders will backfire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/09/jacinda-ardern-bill-shorten-australia-new-zealand-education","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/09/jacinda-ardern-bill-shorten-australia-new-zealand-education","fields":{"headline":"Jacinda Ardern: Australia education policy penalising New Zealanders will backfire","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has urged Australia to give its citizens “equitable treatment” in higher education, while meeting opposition leader Bill Shorten for the first time since her election. Ardern and Shorten met in Auckland on Saturday, and spoke to the media briefly about the treatment of New Zealanders in Australia. Ardern again attacked the Australian government’s proposed higher education changes, which have stalled in the Senate. The changes would expose New Zealanders to significantly higher university fees. The policy prompted an angry response from former prime minister Bill English, and Ardern has been similarly scathing in her assessment. Ardern raised the issue during her visit to Australia last month, and warned Australian students might face the same treatment in New Zealand, which is embarking on its own higher education changes. On Saturday, Shorten said the New Zealanders were being “unfairly penalised”. “I want to hear Jacinda’s views,” Shorten said. “But I think at the end of the day there is real merit in reviewing the way in which New Zealand permanent residents in Australia are getting penalised in terms of higher eduction costs.” Ardern said the policy would ultimately hurt Australia, by deterring New Zealanders from pursuing tertiary education in Australia. “These are often New Zealanders making a long-term commitment to Australia,” she said. “If they aren’t able to get that same equitable access to tertiary education, if often means they just don’t pursue, potentially wouldn’t pursue, tertiary education.” “That ultimately would hold Australia back in our view. So we know that New Zealanders who are making a good commitment, they are taxpayers, so we are simply seeking their equitable treatment. And equally I’m sure we’ll discuss some of our proposed changes to higher education here in New Zealand as well.” The Turnbull government’s higher education reforms replace commonwealth subsidies for permanent Australian residents and New Zealand citizens with access to a loan scheme. The move would triple or quadruple the fees paid by the students, on average, but would mean they pay nothing up front. The student loan, however, would come with a 25% fee. The government believes giving access to the loan scheme would attract more New Zealand students, rather than drive them away. It would help students “for whom upfront payment was a disincentive to study”, the policy statement said. The statement estimates it will attract an additional 60,000 New Zealand students and permanent Australian residents."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/dec/13/why-are-palaeontologists-suing-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T11:05:51Z","webTitle":"Why are palaeontologists suing Trump? | Elsa Panciroli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/dec/13/why-are-palaeontologists-suing-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/dec/13/why-are-palaeontologists-suing-trump","fields":{"headline":"Why are palaeontologists suing Trump?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Research published earlier this year suggested that the only area of science that liberals and conservatives could bond over, was dinosaurs. Everyone loves Brontosaurus, right? Whatever else may be going wrong in the world, surely palaeontology is safe from the ravages of politics? At the start of December Trump announced plans for the biggest loss of protected public lands in the history of the US. By gutting two of America’s National Monuments – Grand Staircase-Escalante and Bears Ears - he will remove government protection for over two million acres of land. These areas were designated because they contain thousands of archaeological sites, landscapes sacred to Native American tribes, virtually pristine wilderness, and unique geology. Among the countless geological treasures are palaeontological specimens of international importance, spanning 320m years of life on Earth. Much of this will be open to destruction if planned cuts go ahead. But the scientists are fighting back. Almost as soon as Trump had spoken, the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology (SVP) made an announcement of their own: they are suing the president of the United States. “From a paleontological point of view, these two areas contain remarkable fossil records of important intervals of North America’s history, including segments that cannot be studied anywhere else,” explains David Polly, president of SVP and professor of palaeontology at the University of Indiana. The society represents more than 2,300 members internationally, from professionals to students, artists, preparators, and those simply passionate about palaeontology. Around 10% of SVP members have been actively engaged in research at these two monuments. “Because science is an evidence-based process, it is important that sites remain intact and that the fossils go into the public trust. The monument ensures that the same sites can be revisited in a hundred years when technologies, methods, and questions have changed. Scientists therefore choose to conduct research in protected places like these national monuments whenever they can. Trump’s changes have now exposed many sites to potential destruction,” said Polly. A national monument is similar to a national park, but whereas a national park must be established by congress, national monuments can be proclaimed by the president. First created by Theodore Roosevelt under the 1906 Antiquities Act, they were primarily conceived to protect Native American cultural and archaeological sites and artefacts, but also “other objects of historic or scientific interest” – including fossils. Indeed, one of the first national monuments created was the Petrified Forest in Arizona, where Triassic tree ferns, ginkgoes and cycads scatter the landscape. The national monuments cuts will supposedly put the land back in the hands of the people, rather than “a small handful of very distant bureaucrats”. National monuments, like all protected areas, are actually designated in order to preserve sites of importance for the public, in posterity. The billionaire president seeks support from a small handful of conservative ranch owners – and from the fossil fuel companies who would undoubtedly benefit from access to any coal, oil and gas on these lands. Fossil fuels may be on many people’s minds since the announcement, but these are far from the most precious fossils to be found in these parks. Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah was established in 1996, and has yielded one of the most diverse herbivorous dinosaur faunas in the world. As many as twenty-five new species of dinosaur have been found in Grand Staircase-Escalante in the last two decades. The stratigraphy spans from the Permian, around 270m years ago, all the way through the Mesozoic “time of the dinosaurs”, to the Late Cretaceous. Polly describes it as “almost literally erupting with Late Cretaceous fossils that have forced us to rethink Mesozoic ecosystems and the processes that control biodiversity then and now.” Fossils from Grand Staircase-Escalante also include the largest Triassic petrified forest outside of Arizona, rare Cretaceous mammals, dinosaur and early mammal footprints, and multiple type sections and localities (the rocks that define a geological unit or area). Many Cretaceous marine fossils would no longer be protected under the new boundaries, including key marine reptiles such as the oldest known mosasaurs, and plesiosaurs, ichthyosaurs and pliosaurs. Lying in the heart of Utah’s Canyon Country, Bears Ears National Monument gets its name from the two symmetrical towers of sandstone which dominate the landscape, and have been sacred to Navajo, Hopi, Ute and New Mexico pueblo people for hundreds, if not thousands of years. Scientific papers on fossils from Bears Ears were first published in the 1890s, and since then looting and illegal excavations have seen the loss of many important fossils, hindering preservation and scientific research. Preserving these fossils was part of the rationale for putting this National Monument protection in place last year. The rocks at Bears Ears reach back even further than at Grand Staircase-Escalante, right into the woodland world of the Carboniferous, 320m years ago. The Carboniferous is so-named for the coal it bears, formed from these global rainforests, but the rocks at Bears Ears are primarily marine – telling tales from a period when this arid desert was the bottom of a warm ocean. Bears Ears is also unique in preserving ecosystems from the Late Permian. “The first ecosystems that were dominated by vertebrates, in the time of the sail-backed Dimetrodon and its relatives” says Polly. This time period preceded the biggest mass extinction of all time, which cleared a path for the evolution of the iconic Mesozoic reptiles: the dinosaurs, and marine and flying reptiles. The Triassic also holds the origins of our own lineage, the mammals. Bone beds from the Triassic will be excluded from protection under the proposed cuts to the National Monument, as will Cretaceous rocks that record the earliest flowering plants, called angiosperms, and multiple Quaternary-aged sites – the time between two and fifty-eight million years that includes the formation of modern ecosystems in the North American continent. I asked Polly what he thought of the president’s claim that he was giving the land back to the public. “The president’s claim is misleading, probably intentionally so. These Monuments already belong to the public, and they exist specially to protect specific resources that belong to the public and are not found elsewhere. One reason the public should care [about the cuts] is that these sites and the history they preserve belong to the public. The fossils collected there remain public property. Everyone has the chance to enjoy them, everyone can learn the stories they tell. If we lose them, they are gone for everyone.” He added, “contrast that to coal – when coal, gas, or petroleum are collected they become private property, they are sold for someone else’s profit, and then they are burned or processed. The public is left with nothing except for a few days of energy – for which they have to pay.” Although the 3.5m acres that comprise these two parks may seem like a lot of land, it is a drop in the ocean when placed in the context of the vast US landscape. “People talk about how big these monuments are,” says Polly, “but they are collectively only one-half of one percent of US public land, just a speck. The US has 640m acres of public land. Almost all of that public land is open to ranching, mining, and fossil fuel extraction, as well as other uses, under what is called the ‘multiple-use principle’.” Grand Staircase-Escalante and Bears Ears National Monuments on the other hand, are unique: “[They] have greater restrictions because they have unique resources that would be damaged by ranching, off-road vehicle use, or mining.” He added: “There is more than enough room for ranching and mining without needing to risk the destruction of the special resources found at Grand Staircase and Bears Ears.” The loss of protected sites for research will naturally also affect jobs, both in the US and abroad. “They will have lost their research permits,” says Polly, “and they may have lost funding streams that help support their work.” Professor Emily Rayfield, a University of Bristol-based palaeontologist who is current vice-president of SVP, points out that the fossils being found at these national monuments “are not only significant to North American palaeontology, they are of importance to palaeontologists worldwide. For example, both Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante preserve detailed evidence of how flora and fauna were impacted and subsequently recovered across Earth’s largest ever mass extinction at the end of the Permian 252m years ago.” This kind of information isn’t just of interest to a handful of scientists, but informs our understanding of changes taking place today. “We are in dire need of a greater understanding of deep time mass extinction events in order to better understand and mitigate our current biodiversity crisis,” Rayfield explains. If Trumps gets his way, none of these key Permian fossils will be protected under the newly proposed monument boundaries. I wondered, with all the rocks out there in the world, can’t palaeontologists just go somewhere else to study these time periods and fossils? Polly answers definitively: “many of the fossil areas inside the monument are unique. Nowhere else can you study the ecosystems of the Kaiparowits Formation, or the marine reptiles of the Tropic Shale. The only mammal fossils from important intervals in the Late Cretaceous are also found only in the monuments.” “You can go other places to mine coal or graze cattle, but you can’t go other places to study these parts of Earth’s history.” SVP will join the Conservation Lands Foundation, and the Grand Staircase-Escalante Partners in filing against the president and members of his administration for the cuts to Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. Fighting the cuts at Bears Ears, SVP joins the Friends of Cedar Mesa, Archaeology Southwest, the Conservation Lands Foundation, Patagonia Works, The Access Fund, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, and the nonprofit Native American organisation Utah Diné Bikéyah. Everyone is watching the rest of America’s protected lands carefully – the US Department of Interior has already announced that it recommends cuts Gold Butte National Monument in Nevada. “Gold Butte also has a mission for preserving palaeontology. Congress has not given the President authority to unprotect [any of these] resources,” says Polly. “If a move is made to cut it, we will join a third lawsuit with a different configuration of partners.” Let’s hope that SVP and others can prevent the loss of these sites, not just for the people of the United States of America, but in order to preserve the rich global palaeontological heritage found in these amazing and sacred landscapes.

Tim Boyle threw down a gauntlet on 10 November in the Oregonian newspaper when he wrote that its Sorel brand, which produces footwear, was considering moving. Its employees, Boyle said, were being “threatened” and “menaced” by people “near our office,” or “camping in the doorway”. “I am so concerned about the safety of our employees at the Sorel headquarters that we are taking the next 90 days to re-evaluate our location decision,” he said. Boyle’s op-ed never used the word “homeless”, a fact which he pointed out in a second statement and in the media, but many in the city read between the lines, not least in the reference to camping. A demonstration in front of his downtown flagship store seemed to have led to its closure for a day recently, and Boyle has upped the ante with continued public statements. The imbroglio is another cold splash of water for believers in “Portland exceptionalism” – the notion that the progressive city is immune to broader social problems. “We have daily defecation in the building’s atrium,” Boyle said on Oregon Public Broadcasting last week. Boyle’s talk of feces isn’t the only touchy issue in which the company is enmeshed: unlike North Face, REI and Patagonia, the company didn’t proclaim its opposition to the Trump administration’s shrinkage of national monuments in Utah on its home page. (It did, however, sign an industry group’s letter.) “I think Tim Boyle may have a legit complaint about people hanging out,” said longtime advocate Ibrahim Mubarak. “But to put an ultimatum before a city official to get rid of these houseless people or I’m going to leave the city, that’s cruel. Everybody knows the houseless community don’t have nowhere to go.” Through Columbia Sportswear, Boyle declined an interview request. The actions of Portland mayor Ted Wheeler in the wake of Boyle’s comments seem conflicting. On 30 November, the mayor tweeted that “homelessness is not a crime” and added that “it’s irresponsible to conflate homelessness and crime”. In the days leading up to that tweet, however, the mayor’s office pushed for the designation of eight blocks of “pedestrian use zones”, one of which includes the Columbia Sportswear flagship store, co-located with 40 employees who work at the Sorel headquarters. The result is that homeless people are forbidden from sitting or sleeping on the sidewalk, historically a highly controversial type of restriction in Portland. Intriguingly, in a discussion on Oregon Public Broadcasting of the context in which he wrote his op-ed, Boyle related that the mayor had “asked me: ‘Listen, we need more policemen on the street’”, to which Boyle replied that he would “help”. In e-mailed comments, the mayor’s spokesman, Michael Cox, said “there is nothing in this segment that implies” that the mayor asked Boyle to write the op-ed. In the space of five minutes on a crystalline, windy Thursday, the situation on a corner in front of Columbia Sportswear encapsulated the controversy. First, Toby Bean took a break from politely panhandling and protested Boyle’s portrayal. “There are some crazy people out here. But regular homeless people are pretty courteous.” Next, a 50-something white man in tattered clothing passed, sing-song chanting to himself a scary, rapidfire barrage of expletives and racial slurs. (Oregon was ranked 49th of 51 states and Washington DC this year for overall mental health services.) A minute later, a passerby, Joe Leineweber, 35, staged a mini-protest by defiantly sitting on the ground despite the ban. “I’m probably wearing Columbia attire right now,” Leineweber said, taking off his jacket and discovering a label for prAna – a brand purchased by Columbia in 2014 for $190m. “I love their stuff, but I can’t really get behind it anymore.” Public-safety statistics do not appear to fully validate Boyle’s concerns. While Portland’s police-officers-per-capita numbers are low compared to US cities, FBI crime statistics show crime is down locally on a broad range of measures. “I think that we can safely say that our crime stats are much lower than they are in a lot of other cities,” said police spokesman Sgt Christopher Burley. The Portland police bureau “does not capture” housing data and cannot assess whether homeless people commit more crimes than others, Burley said. Boyle has said he’s received a lot of support since speaking out. And even those on the other side acknowledge it is not cut-and-dried. “It’s hard for me to read [Boyle’s statements] as anything else but: ‘I really don’t want homeless people outside of my business,’” said Gregory McKelvey, co-founder of Portland’s Resistance, which was formed in response to Donald Trump’s election. But he noted: “My mom actually is on the opposite side of this issue. She works downtown, and she’s like, ‘Sometimes I feel unsafe’. I obviously had to think about that. That could be a valid point.’” Ironically, it’s possible some of those camping in Columbia Sportswear’s doorways are wearing its jackets. In November, Columbia donated 25 boxes of clothing to a nonprofit that manages nine shelters in the metro area. It’s one of many philanthropic efforts by the company and its employees. It’s also a drop in the bucket compared with the company’s $2.38bn in annual sales. Do you have an experience of homelessness to share with the Guardian?

For a start there was rain about but there was no Ben Duckett about. He was supposed to be playing in the game; he was on the team sheet issued by the management on Thursday; but on Saturday morning he was replaced by Worcestershire’s Joe Clarke, and not because the selectors have suddenly realised the need for more right‑handed batsmen to combat off‑spinners such as Nathan Lyon and Ravi Ashwin. It is all about another bar, another late-night incident, another self‑inflicted blow that suggests a shambolic set of self-indulgent England cricketers drowning themselves in alcohol in Australia. This always seems to happen on the first night in Perth when no curfew has been imposed. Duckett, it should be stressed, is in the Lions squad rather than the senior one. Moreover these England cricketers probably do not drink more than their predecessors. But they perhaps do not drink as wisely or as well. The risks of this kind of incident taking place are significantly increased by the number of England cricketers in Australia, many of whom do not have much major cricket to play. Given the febrile atmosphere of this tour, the Lions suddenly come under the same sort of scrutiny as the senior Ashes side. So Duckett could be given a severe punishment to encourage the others not to be so daft. An early flight home he could bear; being removed from the shortlist of England hopefuls might be more painful. There is a certain amount of paranoia on this subject, not to mention media interest. The perception could be that England have an alcohol problem among a small minority of their squad and they have a batting problem: there are situations vacant, right-handed teetotallers preferred. On another tour the Duckett incident would be a pinprick. But on this one Trevor Bayliss’s reaction might easily have created a predictable, exasperated rhyming couplet. Against the backdrop of the weird “head-butt” affair on the first night in Perth back in October that has since tormented Jonny Bairstow, this matter is being treated very seriously. England’s tour has been haunted by their players’ nocturnal activities – as well as a shortage of runs from the top seven. In the past the Lions management has sought to set a stern precedent about player behaviour on tour – without conspicuous success. In February 2013 Kent’s Matt Coles was sent home from Australia early for alcohol-related offences. Thereafter Coles disappeared off the international radar. Duckett himself has a bit of form. He was removed as captain of the England Under-19s after failing a fitness test; he missed a pre-season tour for Northamptonshire for the same reason and he has been to court on a drink driving charge. These incidents do not sit prettily on his cricketing CV despite his obvious talent. And now this. It may not help his career prospects if he deposits large quantities of alcohol over the head of a senior colleague, which he appears to have done to Jimmy Anderson in the dreaded Avenue bar in well-to-do Claremont. Duckett has picked a bad time to transgress, though this may not be the first time. On top of all that Kevin Pietersen, in Australia as a BT Sport expert, popped off the golf course to do some more helpful punditry, during which he suggested that Alastair Cook did not look very interested – it was four years ago that Paul Downton, then the new England and Wales Cricket Board cricket director, observed that he had never seen anyone look so “disinterested” on a cricket pitch as Pietersen during the Sydney Test. Pietersen was none too complimentary about the other batsmen, either. Later it seems that he became more animated when asking on this extravagantly punctuated tweet: “What the hell is happening in English cricket?!?! Strauss????? It’s becoming a f*****g embarrassment!” So this tour is becoming something of a nightmare for the English management, who took active steps to expose Duckett’s “unacceptable” behaviour. They might have adopted the risky strategy of keeping the incident to themselves and allowing Duckett to play at Richardson Park. Andrew Strauss, back in England, will be appalled at the turn of events. Conversely it is hard to tell who is enjoying Strauss’s discomfort more, KP or the Aussies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/dec/14/a-phil-taylor-versus-wayne-mardle-classic-snow-and-an-agile-jockey","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T10:00:28Z","webTitle":"A Phil Taylor v Wayne Mardle classic, football in the snow and an agile jockey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/14/a-phil-taylor-versus-wayne-mardle-classic-snow-and-an-agile-jockey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/14/a-phil-taylor-versus-wayne-mardle-classic-snow-and-an-agile-jockey","fields":{"headline":"A Phil Taylor v Wayne Mardle classic, football in the snow and an agile jockey","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"1) The raucous PDC World Darts Championship is back again. In the competition’s first year at Alexandra Palace in 2008 the big favourite Phil ‘The Power’ Taylor was expected to ease through the rounds to a 12th title but came up against Wayne ‘Hawaii 501’ Mardle in the quarter-final. What ensued was an all-time classic that ended with a victorious Mardle on his haunches in tears of joy. On that night Taylor was magnanimous in defeat, with Mardle in the Sky studio last year he did not take so kindly to his former rival’s line of questioning. Still Taylor learned the art of darts needle from the master, Eric Bristow. 2) Those of you with phone apps, friends on social media or windows will have noticed there was a flurry of snow over the weekend. This means it’s time to revisit some football being played in the trademarked good ol’ days when nothing would stop those hearty men kicking leather around. There’s Aberdeen versus Rangers in 1955, when seeing the ball was not a straightforward task. More recently, the Welsh non-league side Risca FC faced Aberdare Town in snowy conditions on Friday. Alternatively, if you like to be knee-deep in the white stuff, then the snow World Cup is the one for you. 3) Before Pint-over-the-head-gate, Ben Duckett was known for his batting and agility in the field, as proven when stopping a certain six against Lancashire. He can also show you how to play the reverse sweep, not that he’ll be using it soon following his suspension. 4) A jockey and their horse need to have an understanding if they are to succeed out on the course. When Jack Kennedy and Robin Des Mana hit a fence at Clonmel, it looked as if the jockey would be quickly separated from his horse but instead he fought to stay on, like a budget circus act, and ultimately succeeded after some gymnastics. Obviously this is a regularly occurrence in a sport where jumping hurdles is mandatory. 5) Sheffield Wednesday are playing Wolves on Friday night but neither goalkeeper will be able to match Kevin Pressman for this piece of glory from the penalty spot. Pressman thwacking one in has made everyone else forget Chris Waddle’s second most famous penalty blooper. 6) Chris Ashton was not celebrating his contribution to a Bath try when the Toulon full-back tried to kick the ball clear from underneath his own posts, only for him to completely mess it all up, sending the ball zero yards forward and allowing Jonathan Joseph to capitalise and run in a fluky try for Bath. Luckily, for Ashton, Toulon did manage to win the game 24-20. Our favourites from last week’s blog 1) Anyone for Whirlyball? 2) In the Romanian second division they know how to deal with snow. Splendid stuff. 3) Glen Maxwell suited up for motion capture imitating the batting styles of various world legends. 4) A miked-up Warney calls exactly how he is going to dismiss Brendan McCullum in the BBL.

This felt like the first major step in an unlikely rehabilitation for both: if the recruitment of Moyes last month felt repulsive to supporters of a sepia-tinted persuasion then surely even the most begrudging of souls would acknowledge the improvements he has wrought in only a month. Chelsea were deservedly beaten by opponents who were simply more organised, more determined, more athletic and who found a sting when on top. Nobody in West Ham’s current position can ask for much more and their first league win since September was achieved with an added touch of old-fashioned style. The flourish in question was provided by Marko Arnautovic, whose very selection came to feel like a piece of sound management from Moyes. West Ham had set a template for their relegation battle in digging deep for a narrow defeat at Manchester City last weekend. Arnautovic had been consigned to the bench for that one and it seemed a clear message that the £20m signing from Stoke needed to up his game. Greater forward thrust was always going to be needed for a home fixture and Moyes recalled him here, the manager seeing himself rewarded by 69 minutes of unstinting energy and the kind of outstanding strike such a fee demands. If Antonio Conte chooses to be critical – and that is not really a question – then he might look at how easily Arnautovic rolled Andreas Christensen after receiving possession from Michail Antonio, as well as the smooth passage he was then granted into the penalty area. But the Austrian’s sixth-minute give-and-go with Manuel Lanzini was the action of two players perfectly in tune; the finish, curled left-footed into the far corner, was his first goal for the club and West Ham had reward for a fast start that caught Chelsea flat-footed. Conte had spoken beforehand of the “sacred fire” required of players in the very top bracket. Few have ever detected that in Arnautovic but he set the required tone here and West Ham followed, throwing themselves into every duel and barely losing a challenge in the opening 20 minutes. In the meantime they began to enjoy themselves; the sight of Arthur Masuaku bamboozling Davide Zappacosta with a slick pirouette on the ball may have prompted double-takes but was entirely reflective of the devilment with which they emerged. Arnautovic later had Christensen on toast again near the right corner flag but, after wriggling free, allowed the centre-back to recover. In the second half he had a reasonable claim for handball, and a possible penalty, against the same player turned down by Anthony Taylor but by that point any attacking situations West Ham created were essentially crumbs. Moyes thought his players could have done better on the counter as Chelsea pressed but the diligence with which they held their lead excused any inattention further forward. There were spells, particularly midway through the first half and at the start of the second, when the pattern threatened to degenerate into the same kind of siege that eventually broke them at the Etihad. In the event, it never quite turned out that way and West Ham rarely found themselves struggling for oxygen even when under intense pressure. When they did flounder, Adrián saved in quick succession from N’Golo Kanté and Zappacosta, keeping them ahead at the break and justifying his selection ahead of Joe Hart. In fact Adrián was hardly extended in the second 45 minutes, Winston Reid marshalling an impeccably drilled back line that was rarely turned around and spent much of its time repelling speculative deliveries from out wide. How disappointing this was for Chelsea and Conte, who suggested afterwards that a title race is barely worth discussing. His concern is now the five-into-three equation that all the Champions League contenders bar Manchester City must trouble themselves with; his mood might have brightened if Álvaro Morata, played onside by Masuaku after Kanté produced a rare moment of ingenuity, had not blasted their best chance wide six minutes from time but a draw would have papered over the cracks. Morata, who had been a late fitness doubt for this game, did not look sharp and Conte would presumably love to lighten the load on a player who is shouldering a heavy burden with no alternative of comparable quality. “I can give my opinion but the last decision is of the club,” Conte said of any January arrivals. Greater attacking variation would do little harm, the half-time introduction of Pedro for Tiémoué Bakayoko doing nothing to add subtlety. For Moyes, whose after-match grin perhaps betrayed the circumspection of his words, it was a return to the top. Almost three years have passed since he led Real Sociedad to a similarly stirring 1-0 win over Barcelona; there have not been many highs since then but now the big names keep on coming. “I came off there, took my jacket off and then thought: ‘No, I’ve got Arsenal in midweek’,” he said. That test will take place on Wednesday. More where this came from and the impression will solidify that, for West Ham, he is the right man at exactly the right time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2017/dec/11/net-neutrality-vint-cerf-tim-berners-lee-fcc-letter","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T15:01:07Z","webTitle":"Net neutrality: 'father of internet' joins tech leaders in condemning repeal plan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/11/net-neutrality-vint-cerf-tim-berners-lee-fcc-letter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/dec/11/net-neutrality-vint-cerf-tim-berners-lee-fcc-letter","fields":{"headline":"Net neutrality: 'father of internet' joins tech leaders in condemning repeal plan","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"More than 20 internet pioneers and leaders including the “father of the internet”, Vint Cerf; the inventor of the world wide web, Tim Berners-Lee; and the Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak have urged the FCC to cancel its vote to repeal net neutrality, describing the plan as “based on a flawed and factually inaccurate” understanding of how the internet works. “The FCC’s rushed and technically incorrect proposed order to repeal net neutrality protections without any replacement is an imminent threat to the internet we worked so hard to create. It should be stopped,” said the technology luminaries in an open letter to lawmakers with oversight of the Federal Communications Commission on Monday. The letter refers to the FCC’s proposed Restoring Internet Freedom Order, which removes net neutrality protections introduced in 2015 to ensure that internet service providers (ISPs) such as Comcast, AT&amp;T and Verizon would treat all web content and applications equally and not throttle, block or prioritise some content in return for payment. The FCC’s vote on the proposed order is scheduled for 14 December and it is expected to be approved. “It is important to understand that the FCC’s proposed order is based on a flawed and factually inaccurate understanding of Internet technology,” the internet pioneers state, adding that the flaws were outlined in detail in a 43-page comment submitted by 200 tech leaders to the FCC in July. “Despite this comment, the FCC did not correct its misunderstandings.” Over the last 15 years, both Republican and Democratic FCC chairs have supported and enforced the principles of net neutrality, believing it to be important for protecting open markets on the internet. Donald Trump’s FCC, headed by the former Verizon lawyer Ajit Pai, plans to break with convention, arguing that it is unnecessary regulation that is preventing ISPs from making money to fund new broadband infrastructure – something the ISPs themselves have denied when speaking to their investors. The net neutrality rules have broad support from members of the public across the political spectrum, according to multiple polls. More than 22m comments were submitted to the FCC by members of the public in response to Pai’s proposal to scrap the rules, indicating that the public is “clearly passionate about protecting the internet”. Although the total number was inflated by spam and pre-populated form letters, 98.5% of the unique comments opposed the repeal, according to a study funded by ISPs. Despite widespread public outcry, the FCC broke with established practice by not holding any public meetings to hear from citizens and experts about the appeal, the letter states. Other signatories include Mitchell Baker, executive chairwoman of the Mozilla Foundation; Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, pioneers of public-key cryptography; Brewster Kahle, founder of the Internet Archive; and Jennifer Rexford, chair of computer science at Princeton University. They argue that the FCC should delay the vote until it has fully investigated the problems with the online commenting system and come up with an alternative way of protecting net neutrality principles."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/10/women-killed-at-home-refuges-womens-aid-survey","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T00:04:21Z","webTitle":"‘Shocking’ toll of women killed by men renews call for safe spaces","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/10/women-killed-at-home-refuges-womens-aid-survey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/10/women-killed-at-home-refuges-womens-aid-survey","fields":{"headline":"‘Shocking’ toll of women killed by men renews call for safe spaces","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Of the 113 women killed by men in England, Wales and Northern Ireland last year, 85 died in their homes, according to the Femicide Census, an annual analysis by the charity Women’s Aid. Nine in 10 women killed during 2016 died at the hands of someone they knew. Of these, 78 women were killed by their current or former intimate partner, three by their sons and five by another male family member. Nine were killed by a stranger. Women’s Aid said that the census revealed patterns in the killings. Many were committed in similar locations, a sharp instrument was used as a weapon in 47 cases. “More needs to be done to address men’s fatal violence against women, as once again the Femicide Census reveals fatalities not as isolated incidents but as part of a repeated pattern of male violence against women,” said Katie Ghose, chief executive of Women’s Aid. “Shockingly, in 2016, over two-thirds of women killed by a man were killed by a current or former intimate partner; 83% of these women were killed at their own home or the home they shared with the perpetrator. “The government must urgently put the prevention of femicide at the centre of its work to combat male violence against women and girls.” Women escaping domestic violence can be rehoused in refuges, but Ghose warned that the government was planning to remove supported housing funding for refuges, placing women in greater jeopardy. “Without a safe space to escape to, more women will be killed by men that they know,” Ghose said. “The government must act now. Refuges are a vital lifeline, not an optional extra; they are not just a bed for a night but essential for women and their children to safely escape domestic abuse and rebuild their lives away from the perpetrator. A crucial part of preventing more fatalities must be to ensure sufficient provision for domestic abuse and sexual violence services, including refuges.” She added: “Demand for refuges already far outstrips supply and the proposed funding model could be the breaking point. Refuges will be faced with the awful reality of either turning more women away or closing their doors for ever. “Only by creating a long-term and sustainable funding model for a national network of refuges can we ensure that every woman can safely escape domestic abuse.” Karen Ingala Smith, chief executive of the charity, nia, which campaigns to end violence against women and children, said the census provided vital data allowing for male on female violence to be contextualised. “Men are killing women and girls; most often women and girls that they are related to,” she said. “Nine out of ten women killed by men in the census were killed by someone they knew. Over three quarters by a current or former partner. Every woman killed was important. But when we think about women killed by men, it’s important that we don’t forget about women who were killed by a man who wasn’t a partner; in 2016 they included a 30-year-old woman who was sexually assaulted and killed as she walked to work, a 20-year-old woman who suffered 60 separate injuries as she was raped and murdered by a delusional sexual predator who had promised to help her get home safely and an 81-year-old woman who was battered on the head and set alight by an intruder in her home. Men’s fatal violence against women extends beyond their partners and families.” The National Domestic Violence helpline can be contacted on 0808 2000 247"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/10/how-uruguay-made-legal-cannabis-work","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T00:01:21Z","webTitle":"How Uruguay made legal highs work","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/10/how-uruguay-made-legal-cannabis-work","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/10/how-uruguay-made-legal-cannabis-work","fields":{"headline":"How Uruguay made legal highs work","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Every afternoon a long queue of people gathers outside a tiny neighbourhood pharmacy in Montevideo. The shop is so small that they can only be let in one at a time. It’s a slow process but the mostly young clients don’t seem to mind. They stand outside or sit on doorsteps chatting in groups of twos and threes as they wait their turn in the warm southern spring. A chemist inside in a green medical coat asks them each to press their thumb on a fingerprint scanner. The electronic device is connected to a central government computer that will either authorise or deny the purchase of their allotted 10 weekly grams of legal marijuana. It is a state-controlled, high quality product guaranteed to provide excellent highs. “On the street 25 grams of marijuana would cost you 3,000 pesos, that’s about $100 for something with probably a large amount of pesticide, seeds and stems,” says Luciano, a young buyer who is next in line. “But here the same amount would cost you only $30, and it comes in guaranteed, premium quality, thermosealed 5g packs.” In July this year, tiny Uruguay became the first country in the world to legalise the sale of marijuana across its entire territory. “The most important thing has been the change of paradigm,” says Gastón Rodríguez Lepera, shareholder in Symbiosis, one of the two private firms producing cannabis for the government’s Institute for the Regulation and Control of Cannabis. “Uruguay dived in at the deep end without too much international support. They said it wouldn’t work. Well, it’s working now.” With a population of only 3.4 million, squeezed in between its two giant South American neighbours Brazil and Argentina (population 208 million and 43 million respectively), Uruguay has long been at the forefront of liberal policies not only in South America but worldwide. A divorce law that allowed women to separate from their husbands simply by asking a court for permission was passed as far back as 1913. Abortion was legalised in 2012, with Uruguay the only country in Latin America to do so apart from Cuba. Part of the reason for Uruguay’s liberal temperament is a longstanding separation of church and state in a region where the Catholic Church remains dominant. There is no official Christmas day on Uruguay’s state calendar. Most Uruguayans refer to the holiday by its government denomination of family day. Easter week is referred to as tourism week. Uruguay’s switch to a legal marijuana market has not been without its hitches, however, notably the resistance of most pharmacists to act as outlets for the recreational marijuana (medical marijuana remains illegal in Uruguay). Only 12 of the country’s 1,100 pharmacies have signed up so far to supply the 17,391 government-registered consumers served by the system, which explains the long queues outside. The low price and slim profit margin partly explain their reticence. “But the main problem is that banks have threatened to close the accounts of pharmacies selling marijuana,” said one chemist who sells marijuana in Montevideo, but who did not want to reveal his name for fear of such bank intervention. Although sales of the drug have been legalised in various US states, they remain illegal at federal level, leading to a situation where most banks refuse to handle marijuana-related accounts anywhere in the world. Even now that sales in Uruguay have been completely legalised, the fear of running into trouble with the US federal authorities has become concrete. “The problem with the banks was an unforeseen hitch,” says Eduardo Blasina, president of Montevideo’s cannabis museum, set in an old house in the artsy Palermo district of the capital city. “But these bumps will get smoothed out eventually.” The potency of the original government-licensed marijuana also failed to satisfy consumers at the start. “The government made a mistake because the first batch they released to the market in July had a potency level of only 2% THC,” says Blasina. THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, is the main psychoactive constituent of cannabis content. This is much lower than the levels found in legal recreational weed in US states like Colorado. “The government quickly got the message and has now upped the content to 9% THC,” says the Montevideo pharmacist. A consumer himself, he adds: “I’ve tried it and I can assure you that it provides a most satisfactory experience.” For those who would rather not buy their legal weed at a pharmacy, Uruguay’s marijuana law allows consumers to plant their own at home (up to six plants) or join special privately run “cannabis clubs” with a maximum of 45 members who are allowed to withdraw 40g per month from the club’s crop. “The transformation of consumers has been astounding,” says Blasina. “They’ve gone from buying low-quality products from street dealers to becoming gourmet experts who compete with the crops at their clubs.” Confident that pharmacists will eventually find a way to work round the refusal of banks to handle their accounts, Blasina is more worried about the ban on selling legal marijuana to visitors from abroad in a country where tourism keeps growing, partly due to Uruguay’s beautiful beaches, but also because of its growing reputation as a liberal haven in South America. “Visitors arrive here hoping to enjoy freedom in one of the most liberal countries in the world, so they feel disappointed when they find out they can’t buy legal marijuana,” says Blasina. “They end up buying it on the street, which contradicts the whole point of the law, which is to cut traffickers out of the business.” Blasina and others have started pressing the government for the passports of tourists to be stamped with a permit to purchase a small amount of marijuana during their stay. “A record number of visitors will arrive this summer and what will we say to them? Sorry, you can’t smoke?” he says. There are ways round the problem, however. “The quality of the marijuana is so high that the 40 monthly grams permitted by the government far exceeds what I could smoke on my own,” says one Uruguayan who works with foreigners travelling here. “So I always have enough to share around with visitors.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/09/what-would-it-take-for-labour-moderates-to-revolt","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-09T18:40:14Z","webTitle":"What would it it take for Labour’s moderates to revolt?  | Nick Cohen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/09/what-would-it-take-for-labour-moderates-to-revolt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/09/what-would-it-take-for-labour-moderates-to-revolt","fields":{"headline":"What would it take for Labour’s moderates to revolt?","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Labour’s new leaders and Labour’s new members appear utterly incompatible. On the one hand, we have stone-hearted Leninists, who proved they were no better than establishment apologists for Saudi Arabia when they endorsed the most vicious men and movements on Earth. On the other, idealists who just want peace, love and understanding. (Or, failing that, a well-funded NHS, an end to food banks and a Palestinian state.) Watching them run towards John McDonnell, Seumas Milne and Andrew Murray is like watching lambs flock to wolves. They shouldn’t be on the same planet, let alone belong to the same party. The kindest explanation is that Labour members don’t know who they are following. Most have read enough of the history of Nazism to grasp what Donald Trump’s flirtations with Britain First and the Ku Klux Klan portend. They do not shudder when they see Corbyn surrounding himself with aides from the Communist party of Britain and the fragments of the Socialist Workers party because they know little or nothing of communism. As democracy and liberty come under attack, from Poland to the US, the salient point to remember about Leninists who stayed with communism after the fall of the Soviet Union is that they switched from embracing one form of totalitarianism to embracing every form of totalitarianism. Their grim journey took them from the decrepit Brezhnevian regime in Cuba to the religious reactionaries in Iran and Gaza via the national socialism of Saddam Hussein’s Iraq and Bashar al-Assad’s Syria Understand their authoritarian promiscuity and you understand their push to readmit George Galloway. For why shouldn’t he have a hero’s return? Labour is Galloway’s party now. He was John the Baptist to Jeremy Corbyn’s JC, who led the way in saluting murdering thieves in the presidential palace regardless of whether they happened to call themselves rightwingers or leftwingers. I accept that Labour supporters may be ignorant. But ignorance is no defence if they never stop to question what might happen if Corbyn and his “team” were to come to power. The normal place to search for an answer is to look at the record. Try that, however, and you run into a problem. The greatest weakness of the far left is also its greatest strength. Momentum does not yet control a single council in Britain, let alone the British government. There is no record of Momentum in office to scrutinise. Critics cannot point to a London borough or northern city and say this is what happens when Momentum comes to town. Without evidence of the worst, supporters can hope for the best. But there is another record: the record of the movement’s soul, for want of a better word. Any account of how it has treated dissent and uncomfortable facts would look at the deep vein of conspiracism on the far left, no more strikingly evidenced by its Trumpian willingness to attack the BBC so hard that its political editor had to hire bodyguards to protect herself from those supposedly kindly followers of the supposedly decent “Jeremy”. It is safe to say that in government nothing would ever be Labour’s fault. Failure would be the fault of the “saboteurs”, to coin a phrase, in the civil service, BBC and judiciary, who – if form is a guide – the far left would accuse of fomenting a “coup”. Except that, once in government, its supporters would have the full power of the state to deploy against their enemies. Staying with the record, never forget that the Unite union now dominates the Labour party. Its general secretary, Len McCluskey, drove his rival out of the union for daring to challenge him in a free election. Not a good omen, I hope you agree. Notice, too, that Momentum claims to be a democratic movement. Nevertheless, it demands that Labour candidates submit to “loyalty tests”, an authentically Leninist tactic, now celebrating its 100th birthday. Even Corbyn’s critics in the Labour party accept he is a nice but dim man rather than a wicked one. Understand this, they say, and you understand his appeal. They reserve their scorn for the comrades surrounding him. The foreign policy of a Labour government is predictable: Britain would no longer be a reliable member of the western alliance. The Labour leadership’s inability to understand that its government would be unable to afford its programmes if Britain left the single market means that its social reforms could unravel. When they spoke of their experience of Labour’s sinister, centralised culture, however, my mind turned to gentle friends and colleagues who have signed up to the Corbyn revolution. Once again, the image of wolves and lambs flashed up. Surely they will revolt? Maybe not. If you look at the worst of today’s generation of radicals – not all of them or most of them but at the worst of them – you notice the persistence of the Leninist style. In substance, they could not be less interested in the class conflicts that animated the old Marxists and social democrats. The first concerns of their hyper-liberal politics are the fights against sexism, racism, homophobia and transphobia. Compare their tactics instead and you find few differences worth mentioning between old leaders and young followers. The willingness to mount heresy hunts against traitors has found a new home on Twitter. The determination not just to refute opposing arguments but to ban them and destroy their proponents is everywhere. The worst of the young left is just as humourless as its forebears and just as suspicious of irony and complexity. The modern mentality was caught with clear-eyed precision by the late British cultural theorist Mark Fisher. If X makes an off-colour remark that can be construed as sexist or transphobic, the middle-class left does not argue back but attempts to start a Twitter frenzy that defines X’s entire being as that of a transphobe or sexist. The online leftish culture, Fisher said, is driven by a “priest’s desire to excommunicate, an academic-pedant’s desire to be the first to be seen to spot a mistake and a hipster’s desire to be one of the in-crowd”. This is not too far from the decayed Leninist milieu of the Labour leadership, where “Blairites” must face excommunication by purge, a “mistake” by a Labour MP can lead to his or her deselection and Momentum insists that the only way to be in the in-crowd is to parrot the party line. As I said, I am talking about the worst of the left. But here is Britain’s bind: the worst of the left controls the left. One day, it may control the country too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/10/observer-profile-roy-moore-gun-toting-judge-with-god-by-his-side","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T00:04:21Z","webTitle":"Roy Moore: a sex scandal judge with God by his side | Observer profile","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/10/observer-profile-roy-moore-gun-toting-judge-with-god-by-his-side","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/10/observer-profile-roy-moore-gun-toting-judge-with-god-by-his-side","fields":{"headline":"Roy Moore: sex scandal judge with God by his side","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Perhaps only in the deeply Republican state of Alabama could a pistol-packing, stetson-wearing ex-judge accused of sexual misconduct become a formidable political candidate. That candidate, the former chief justice of the Alabama supreme court, Roy Moore, a 70-year-old evangelical Christian who was recently accused of sexually coercing teenagers in the 1970s, stands this week in a special election for the Senate seat vacated by President Trump’s attorney general, Jeff Sessions. Moore’s avowed intent is to bring God to Washington – he once installed a 5,280lb rock inscribed with the Ten Commandments in his courthouse. If he wins, as is predicted, against Democrat Doug Jones, a prosecutor who once convicted members of the Ku Klux Klan for a 1963 bombing that killed four teenage black girls, his victory might represent a refusal by the state’s conservative Christians to prioritise accusations of sexual coercion and assault over sending a southern, anti-authoritarian message to Washington. In evangelical Alabama, the choice between a Republican candidate facing sexual harassment claims and a Democrat who twice missed opportunities to adjust his position on late-term abortion in favour of an all-encompassing woman’s right to choose may not be much of a choice at all. “We’ve got to go back to restoring the morality of this country,” Moore told supporters at a rally last week, an event that was also attended by Steve Bannon, the conservative ideologue and former Trump chief strategist, who views the election as a test of his theories about “party realignment”. In one sense, Bannon already has his answer: Moore became the candidate after beating Luther Strange, who had been supported by Trump and the Republican party leadership, in the first round of elections in September. Bannon described that vote as an opportunity to tell the party establishment “what you think of the elites who run this country”. It was an opportunity voters duly accepted, giving Moore 55% of the votes. Washington Republicans view the Moore-Bannon coupling as a marker of their diminished authority. Democrats, busy cleaning their own house of elected officials accused of sexual harassment, have struggled to achieve differentiation. While Trump hasn’t formally campaigned for Moore in Alabama – he held a rally on Friday over the state border in Florida – he has said plainly: “We don’t want to have a liberal Democrat in Alabama.” One can also read Trump signalling his comfort with Alabama evangelists in the timing of the decision to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Many US evangelicals express strong solidarity with conservatives in Israel and express a belief that the Jews must return to the holy city before the rapture (the transporting of believers to heaven) can take place. Promoted by the vice-president, Mike Pence, who joined the Trump campaign ticket on condition that Trump would support a push to relax tax-code restrictions on churches engaging in excessive political activity, the timing of the Jerusalem decision might influence the Alabama election. In Moore, Christian evangelicals and Israeli hardliners alike have found a conservative crusader to embrace; in contrast, he has united the Republican establishment, Democrats and much of the media in disapproval. There is plenty to abhor. He has described 9/11 as punishment for America turning away from God. He’s called Islam a “false religion” and said homosexuality should be outlawed. At a rally in September, he warned of “the awful calamity of abortion and sodomy and perverse behaviour and murders and shootings and road rage” as “a punishment inflicted upon us for our presumptuous sins”. While campaigning with Bannon, a visiting Nigel Farage and Phil Robertson, star of TV’s Duck Dynasty, Moore waved a silver revolver. He also sent out a campaign video lamenting America’s enduring, post-Civil War divisions. Instead of brothers fighting, he said: “Now we have blacks and whites fighting, reds and yellows fighting, Democrats and Republicans fighting, men and women fighting. What’s going to unite us? What’s going to bring us back together? A president? A Congress? No. It’s going to be God.” Throughout his career, Moore has routinely overlooked separation of church and state. He became known as “Alabama’s Ten Commandments judge” when the American Civil Liberties Union sued him to remove a homemade plaque of the Ten Commandments from the lobby of the state judicial building, a dispute that helped him win the election as chief justice in 2000. In 2003, Moore was removed from the Alabama supreme court after defying a federal order to take away the monument. Nine years later, in 2012, he won his old job back but was removed again after he was found to have encouraged lower court judges to deny marriage licences to gay couples, six months after same sex was legalised by the US supreme court. In an interview last summer, Moore told the Guardian that he observed similarities between himself and Vladimir Putin in their attitude to same-sex marriage. “Maybe he’s more akin to me than I know,” he said. But Moore’s problematic attitude to jurisprudence has lately been overshadowed by allegations of sexual coercion published by the Washington Post a month ago. Leigh Corfman claimed that in 1979, when she was 14, an older man approached her outside a courtroom and introduced himself as Roy Moore. Moore, then a 32-year-old district attorney, offered to keep an eye on the girl while her mother went inside for a child custody hearing. Days later, she said, he picked her up and drove her to his home in the woods. On a second visit, she said, Moore took off her shirt and trousers and removed his clothes. She claimed he touched her over her bra and underpants and guided her hand to touch him over his underwear. Under Alabama law, a person who is at least 19 who has sexual contact with someone older than 12 and younger than 15 has committed sexual abuse in the second degree. The crime is punishable by up to one year in jail. “These allegations are completely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat party and the Washington Post on this campaign,” Moore said. Nine other women came forward to accuse him of a variety of inappropriate behaviour, starting from pestering them for dates as teens. Initially, Republican leaders distanced themselves from Moore. Majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said he believed Moore’s accusers. “Innocent until proven guilty is for criminal convictions, not elections,” said Mitt Romney, the party’s 2012 presidential nominee. Trump, burned by Moore’s win over Strange, kept his distance. However, as Moore’s poll numbers have improved – he leads by 1.5 points – official support has been restored. The Republican National Committee, which had cut off Moore, resumed funding for the embattled candidate. Many senior Republicans have equivocated, arguing that Alabama voters should decide. But Republican speaker, Paul Ryan, has maintained his position that he should drop out. “Just because the polling has changed doesn’t change my opinion on that, so I stand by what I said before.” Still, if Moore wins on Tuesday it will give Trump confidence that the energy of his insurgent, “anti-establishment”, Make America Great Again campaign endures. Trump may not be religious, but with the Jerusalem embassy decision he has renewed his connection with America’s evangelicals. Democrats can only hope that the resignations of Minnesota senator and former comedian Al Franken and Michigan congressman John Conyers will put some clear political distance between the parties’ respective attitudes toward sexual harassment ahead of the midterm elections next year. Republican congressional leaders have intimated that they could initiate an ethics investigation if Moore is elected, which could pave the way for the Senate to expel him and have a replacement appointed. But moderate Republicans acknowledge that such an approach would be problematic. “If the voters of the state, fully knowing all of these allegations, nevertheless choose to elect Roy Moore, is it appropriate for the Senate to expel him?” Susan Collins, the Republican senator from Maine, asked last week. Even as the Moore-Jones race enters its final two days, the question of sex continued to reverberate after one of Moore’s accusers, Beverly Young Nelson, conceded she’d written part of an inscription in her high school yearbook that was earlier presented as being written by Moore. On Tuesday, Moore and his wife, Kayla, will ride horses to the polling location, they have said. The couple typically ride to every election Moore contests. If he wins, Moore will have many people to thank for his improbable rise. There’s another name certain to get a shout-out. “He’s done more for my campaign than anybody,” Moore said after his first round victory. “And that’s the Almighty God.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/10/kezia-dugdale-scotland-labour-im-a-celebrity-jungle-to-bearpit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T00:04:21Z","webTitle":"After snakes and grubs, Kezia Dugdale steps out of the jungle into the bearpit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/10/kezia-dugdale-scotland-labour-im-a-celebrity-jungle-to-bearpit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/10/kezia-dugdale-scotland-labour-im-a-celebrity-jungle-to-bearpit","fields":{"headline":"After snakes and grubs, Kezia Dugdale steps out of the jungle into the bearpit","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The Christmas pantomime season started a few weeks early in Scotland. The star attraction was a young political leader who abruptly resigned her post. Kezia Dugdale, 36, former leader of the Labour party in Scotland, then popped up a few months later in the Australian jungle amid the C-listers of ITV’s I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! In the vivid 20-year history of the reconvened Scottish parliament, no story has been as bizarre as this. Instead of campaigning for Labour, Dugdale was eating grubs, walking with snakes and jousting with Boris Johnson’s dad. The financial package that lured Dugdale into risking her entire political career has been the source of speculation, as has been the portion of it she will donate to charity, as she had initially declared. There have been reports that she negotiated a six-figure package for her stint. If so, then she may soon require every penny of it. For when she returns to Scotland to face the music, she may find herself having to consider a future outside of politics. Senior Scottish Labour sources have indicated that all options remain open to the party about how to deal with Dugdale’s lucrative stint in the jungle. “There is still a lot of anger and disappointment around about Kezia’s decision, and there is a distinct possibility that she will face a disciplinary procedure,” said one. Dugdale will be asked to expand on her initial justification for agreeing to participate in the show. When the news was first broken, many of her disbelieving colleagues thought it was the output of a fake social media account. Their initial fury seems not to have abated. Jenny Marra, a Labour MSP and personal friend of Dugdale, tweeted: “Election to parliament is a privilege to serve and represent people. It’s not a shortcut to celebrity.” At the time, Dugdale responded to the criticism by claiming that being on the show would give her a unique opportunity to talk about socialism to a global audience. However, fans of I’m a Celebrity who tuned in to watch her crawling with snakes and eating kangaroos’ testicles claim to have seen little evidence of Dugdale banging the drum for international workers’ rights. The senior Labour source added: “Some of us will want to ask her how she managed to spread the Labour message while she was down under. We saw precious little of it on the show.” On the douce streets of Edinburgh on Saturday there were mixed reactions to Dugdale’s jungle foray among voters in her Lothian constituency. Willie Duff, a 63-year-old university technician from Newhaven in Edinburgh said: “What I want to know is how much is she giving to charity and what percentage. And who was representing her constituents when she was away?” Thomas Lenaghan, a construction specialist and Labour party member, said: “People always accuse our politicians of being out of touch. So, best of luck to her – she’s giving her three weeks’ MSP’s salary to a good charity, as well as a portion of her fee. So what’s not to like?” There is also a real-life tale of romance across Scotland’s bitter political divide underpinning Dugdale and her jungle shenanigans. The former Labour leader this year announced that she was in a relationship with Jenny Gilruth, a rising star of the SNP, the party that has become Labour’s most implacable enemy in Scotland. Political observers say that the couple are devoted to each other, and Gilruth has been gallantly defending her partner in the pages of the Daily Record Scottish tabloid in a column that ran for the duration of Dugdale’s three-week stretch in the jungle. Some informed speculation has linked Dugdale’s resignation of the leadership in August with her romance and, subsequently, her decision to participate in a celebrity game show. One party activist said: “I would not be in the least bit surprised if Kezia took the money, knowing that her days in the party are numbered.” Dugdale is not the first serving politician to have appeared on celebrity reality shows. Nadine Dorries was suspended by the Tory party in 2012 after she went on I’m a Celebrity without informing the chief whip, and her Conservative colleague, Penny Mordaunt, now international development secretary, appeared in Splash! in 2014. The most notorious example was George Galloway, who as the Respect party leader, entered the Big Brother house in 2006. Only he knows why he agreed to squeeze into a red catsuit and pretend to lap milk from a bowl on actress Rula Lenska’s knee. Galloway, though, is also known for his political comebacks, and the opprobrium he attracted for that stunt simply slid off him as he returned unscathed to the political fray. It remains to be seen if Dugdale, a universally liked politician, possesses Galloway’s reserves of chutzpah and bloody-mindedness to come back from this. • This article was amended on 11 December 2017 to clarify that Dugdale and Gilguth are dating, not engaged."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/dec/10/universities-can-charge-two-thousand-pounds-more-for-fast-track-degrees","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T00:05:21Z","webTitle":"Universities win permission to charge £2,000 premium for two-year degrees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/dec/10/universities-can-charge-two-thousand-pounds-more-for-fast-track-degrees","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/dec/10/universities-can-charge-two-thousand-pounds-more-for-fast-track-degrees","fields":{"headline":"Universities win permission to charge £2,000 premium for two-year degrees","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Universities will be allowed to charge students almost £2,000 a year more in fees in return for allowing them to complete a degree over two years instead of three, ministers have revealed. The decision to allow universities to charge a 20% premium for so-called “accelerated degrees” is the latest attempt to encourage more institutions to offer the option. It follows frustrations inside government that only about 2,500 students – just a fifth of 1% – are studying accelerated degrees, despite hopes that they would encourage more mature students into higher education, as well as those who do not want to commit to three years on campus. There has long been support among ministers from different parties to encourage the growth of two-year degrees, but universities have complained that the extra costs of their longer term times and the loss of a year’s tuition fees meant they were reluctant to offer them. There had been suggestions earlier this year that universities could be allowed to charge the full three years’ worth of fees over two years, which would have seen students paying more than £13,500 a year. However, ministers have opted to allow institutions to charge a premium that they believe will cover any extra costs. Under the latest proposals, universities will be able to charge up to £11,100 a year in fees for accelerated degrees, compared with the £9,250 paid by regular undergraduates. The fast-track degrees offer the same qualifications and are quality-assured in the same way as a standard degree. The new fees regime should be in place by September 2019. However, they have to be approved by parliament – which may be problematic for the government when faced with a Labour party determined to abolish fees altogether. Jo Johnson, the universities minister, said the move was part of the government’s attempts to “bust open the increasingly inflexible system of higher education”. He argued that the average student taking up the shorter courses would be £25,000 better off due to lower overall fees and an extra year’s earnings. “There are savings for the student, big savings for the taxpayer, and universities have an incentive now to offer these courses, because instead of losing all of that final year of income, they just forgo a proportion of it,” he said. He said he was confident that universities would now come forward and offer the accelerated courses, and that there would be a “huge first-mover advantage” to the institutions that did so. The shorter degrees might encourage more mature students to go in to higher education, Johnson said, but the move was not explicitly an attempt to head off skills shortages when immigration controls are tightened after Brexit. “Over the years, we’ve seen the classic three-year residential model take up an increasingly large market share,” Johnson told the Observer. “We have been concerned by the decline in some areas of provision that we want to give a boost to now – and in particular we have been worried about the decline in mature students looking at higher education to reskill, retrain and adapt to a changing economy.” A recent government survey found that 73% of higher education providers reported demand from students or employers for the courses, but 36% of responders cited concerns about the cost of delivering them. More established universities were found to be less likely to offer them. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said: “Several universities have been offering two-year, fast-track degrees for a number of years, but demand has been limited under the current system. But if these proposals help encourage even more flexible modes of study, and meet the needs of a diverse range of students and employers, it is to be welcomed. “The priority is ensuring that each student is given good advice and information so that they can choose the course and university that is right for them. While the three-year undergraduate degree on campus will remain the preferred option for many students, accelerated degrees could also meet the needs of many students and their families.” Les Ebdon, the director of the regulator Fair Access to Higher Education, said accelerated degrees were “an attractive option for mature students who have missed out on the chance to go to university as a young person”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/dec/09/sussex-university-head-paid-230000-golden-handshake-report","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-09T12:27:49Z","webTitle":"Sussex University head paid £230,000 'golden handshake' - report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/dec/09/sussex-university-head-paid-230000-golden-handshake-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/dec/09/sussex-university-head-paid-230000-golden-handshake-report","fields":{"headline":"Sussex University head paid £230,000 'golden handshake' - report","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The vice-chancellor of Sussex University is reported to have received a £230,000 “golden handshake” when he left the institution in August last year, the latest revelation in a week of controversy about excessive payoffs and rising salaries for higher education chiefs. Michael Farthing, who was head of the university for nine years, was received the payout “in lieu of notice” upon his departure, according to Times Higher Education. His salary was not disclosed, but Adam Tickell, his successor was paid £293,000, a fee that included £17,000 to relocate from Birmingham and £9,000 for his pension. The research-based institution paid £545,000 to two senior staff members this year. Spiralling pay for top university officials is in the spotlight at a time when pay for teaching staff has flatlined or increased only modestly. Students continue to pay £9,000 fees plus interest payments, and anger has led to greater scrutiny on the sector. It was reported this week that Bath Spa University paid Christina Slade £808,000 in her final year as vice-chancellor before she was appointed emeritus professor in what is thought to be the highest payment made in the sector to date. She was paid a salary of £250,000, plus £429,000 as “compensation for loss of office”, £89,000 in pension contributions, a housing allowance of £20,000 and £20,000 for “other benefits in kind”. Dame Glynis Breakwell, the vice-chancellor of nearby Bath University, stepped down last week after an outcry over her £468,000 pay package, Southampton University was forced to defend paying its vice-chancellor £423,000, and academics at Birmingham University protested against the £2.9m paid its vice-chancellor, Sir David Eastwood, since 2009. More than 160 academics signed an open letter about Eastwood’s pay that read: “This is on top of the highly desirable university-funded residence provided for him on campus, and his university-funded chauffeur-driven car.” The row at Southampton was aggravated by the revelation that its vice-chancellor, Sir Christopher Snowden, sat on the renumeration committee that approves pay packages. “Vice-chancellors must be removed from the committees setting their pay and signing off their perks,” said Sally Hunt, the general secretary of the University and College Union, in comments made to the Times. “They must publish full minutes of those meeting and staff and students must be given a seat at those tables to properly scrutinise these deals. “With further excessive pay revelations likely to follow, it is time universities stopped simply trying to defend the system and accept there must be radical change.” Andrew Adonis, the former Labour education minister who has campaigned on the issue, has described remuneration at Sussex as a scandal. In the House of Lords, where he sits as a non-affiliated peer, he said: “Our universities are wracked by controversy over sky-high student fees and debts, run by vice-chancellors who have become latter day prince bishops paid up to £500,000 a year, and likening themselves to [Diego] Maradona and Richard Branson. “There should now be an independent inquiry and a salary and pay-off cap of no more than £200,000,” he said. Sussex University defended the arrangement and said it was transparent about staff pay. “The university’s approach to senior staff remuneration continues to be open and transparent, and we take our governance responsibilities and sector compliance requirements very seriously,” said a spokesperson. “In the case of our former vice-chancellor, we met our contractual obligations to him and this has been clearly published in our annual financial accounts.” The universities minister, Jo Johnson, has promised “greater restraint in setting top salaries”. He said excessive pay for university heads would be brought under control by new regulations next year. He said he was “absolutely convinced” that a new regulator, the Office for Students, would deal with pay concerns."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/09/first-same-sex-couples-register-marry--australia","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-09T05:35:27Z","webTitle":"'A really happy morning': first same-sex couples register intent to marry in Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/09/first-same-sex-couples-register-marry--australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/09/first-same-sex-couples-register-marry--australia","fields":{"headline":"'A really happy morning': first same-sex couples register intent to marry in Australia","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It has been four years since Daniel proposed to Daniel on a lantern-lit cliffside in Bali. The pair had been inseparable since they met three years earlier, when they found each other on a night out and fell instantly in love. Their engagement came at a time when same-sex marriage was locked in political intransigence. But on Saturday, Daniel Barnett, 39, and Daniel Gray-Barnett, 36, helped record another small step in Australia’s political history. They became the first same-sex couple to register their intent to marry in Sydney. They were at NSW’s registry of births, deaths, and marriages office in Sydney’s centre, bright and early. They plan to marry on 30 January, but went to the registry to take full advantage of its legal protections and formalise their union. “We wanted to have a party and ceremony with all our family and friends and show to everyone we felt like we were married,” Gray-Barnett said. The office had put on a couple of extra staff in preparation for a possible rush of registrations on Saturday, the first day the law was active. There was a line out the door, as predicted. But it wasn’t the customers staff were expecting. “They were journalists,” NSW registrar Amanda Ianna said, laughing. “But we have had a few people through today, and we’ve had marriages all day today as well.” By about 2pm, the office had registered five same-sex couples for marriage. Others had used the website to register, although precise figures on the number of same-sex couples weren’t available. The mood among staff was upbeat. “It was really happy this morning when people were in here, but this place is a really happy place on the weekend generally anyhow, because we’re performing marriages,” Ianna said. One of the other couples at the registry was Valeria Ballantyne, 48, who joined her partner Clare Jacobs, 31. “Being a child of the 80s there was so much more that we had to fight for,” Ballantyne said. “Gay acceptance. Let’s not get bashed. I never thought that we’d reach this level of acceptance so quickly.” “It’s overwhelming.” The couple held a commitment ceremony in Byron Bay last year, and felt it important to quickly have their marriage legalised. “We already consider ourselves married anyway,” Jacobs said. The registry is usually only open on Saturdays to conduct civil wedding ceremonies, however an exception has been made for same-sex couples who want to register their intent to marry this weekend. New intended marriage forms include the heading Party 1 and Party 2 instead of Bridegroom and Bride, with a description of party section offering three options: groom, bride and partner. As well, there are three boxes for gender: male, female and x - which is described as “indeterminate, intersex or unspecified”. Ianna said it was hard to predict whether the same-sex marriage laws would cause a large increase in workload for the registry. “We really don’t know. But we’re prepared, we’re promoting marriage overall anyhow,” Ianna said. “We’re getting different places to marry people all the time. We’ve got a new venue just around the corner in beautiful cellar ... so we’re hoping to increase our marriage performing.” Gay couples who tied the knot overseas will now have their unions officially recognised. A review into religious freedom will report in March, which could lead to further law changes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/10/30-local-authority-child-protection-departments-special-measures","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T00:02:21Z","webTitle":"More than 30 child protection departments in special measures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/10/30-local-authority-child-protection-departments-special-measures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/10/30-local-authority-child-protection-departments-special-measures","fields":{"headline":"More than 30 child protection departments in special measures","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The children’s services departments of more than 30 councils in England are in special measures, an Observer analysis has revealed. The survey comes amid claims that the child protection sector is experiencing a funding crisis similar to the one that engulfed adult social care two years ago. Of the record 31 authorities currently under some form of intervention, 21 – including Birmingham, Buckinghamshire, Norfolk and Tower Hamlets – are subject to statutory directions in which the education secretary legally requires an authority to take action. The remainder – which include Manchester and Surrey – have been issued with improvement notices. Richard Watts, chair of the children and young people board of the Local Government Association (LGA), said: “Across the sector there is basically no dispute that there is a larger number of councils struggling to cope than anyone is comfortable with. Pretty much every council in the country now considers children’s social care to be their biggest headache, not adult social care. A couple of years ago adult social care was under enormous pressure and the government found more money but now councils are saying that children’s social care is the biggest single funding pressure that local government faces at the moment.” A combination of rising demand and shrinking budgets has conspired to place children’s services under acute pressure. Since the Baby P scandal in Haringey in 2007 there has been an almost doubling of demand for children’s social care as councils adopt a more cautious approach to child protection. There has also been a rise in the number of children who have joined gangs being cared for. Austerity, too, has proved a major factor. “Families are really struggling at the moment. There has been a noticeable increase in neglect cases and I think there is a link between that and the financial pressures that many families are under,” said Watts. Some £2.4bn has been cut from budgets for children’s services since 2010, in addition to £1.7bn of cuts to early intervention funding. Anna Feuchtwang, chief executive of the National Children’s Bureau, said: “There is a relentless squeeze on funding for children’s services and councils are seeing budgets dwindle at an alarming rate. We need urgent investment to alleviate the mounting pressure on children’s services and a commitment from government that all children should get the right support at the right time.” Andrew Gwynne, the shadow communities and local government secretary, said: “We often discuss adult social care, but the crisis facing children’s services poses an even greater threat to public services and to the financial sustainability of local authorities. In the past seven years, budget cuts have left councils with little option but to close family support services that are proven to spot and address the signs of neglect before emergency intervention is needed.” That an increasing number of councils are subject to intervention has become deeply contentious. Many local authorities believe that the framework for monitoring performance, introduced in 2013, fails to recognise the complexities of child protection and is too quick to draw negative conclusions. These concerns have prompted a rethink by the government, which next month will roll out a new framework, trialled in several pilot areas. It appears to be a tacit acknowledgement of research commissioned by the LGA, which has shown that councils deemed “inadequate” often deteriorate rather than improve. Watts said: “Inevitably good staff look elsewhere and it becomes more difficult to recruit. There’s often a leadership change at either a political or managerial level.” Birmingham’s children’s services were rated inadequate in 2008, and have struggled to recover since. The latest Ofsted report, published in October, said that “senior managers are aware that considerable work needs to be done” to ensure that services “are of a standard at which outcomes for children are consistently good.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/09/england-chelsea-manchester-city-eni-aluko","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-09T11:59:06Z","webTitle":"England subplots bring intrigue to Chelsea’s clash with Manchester City","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/09/england-chelsea-manchester-city-eni-aluko","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/09/england-chelsea-manchester-city-eni-aluko","fields":{"headline":"England subplots bring intrigue to Chelsea’s clash with Manchester City","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Emma Hayes and Nick Cushing could have spent Sunday on tenterhooks, each waiting to learn if they had impressed Football Association officials sufficiently to be named as England’s new manager next week. Instead the pair prepare to renew their domestic rivalry at Kingsmeadow on Sunday night after signing new contracts with Chelsea and Manchester City respectively. With an England side newly rated as Europe’s best in Uefa’s latest rankings, those mutual decisions may appear surprising. In reality, the presence of both Hayes and Cushing on Sunday evening emphasises the growing clout of the English club game’s two superpowers. Cushing appeared the more conflicted of the two, City’s coach withdrawing from an FA shortlist also believed to include Canada’s Consett-born coach John Herdman and England’s caretaker, Mo Marley, only a week ago. It leaves him free to extend an intriguing duel with Hayes as City arrive at Kingsmeadow two points clear of Chelsea at the top of the WSL. By the end of 90 minutes brimming with subplots they aim to have stretched their winning run to 14 straight victories. Foremost among those subplots is Eni Aluko’s possible reunion with a cadre of City players who were once her England team-mates but are no longer on speaking terms with the Chelsea striker. “I think it’ll be quite a feisty game,” says Claire Rafferty, the Chelsea and former England left-back who has just celebrated 10 years with the club. “But a match of talent, too. Both sides have got some very good, very experienced players, so it’ll be a tactical game and hopefully we’ll prevail.” Hayes has deployed Aluko primarily as a substitute this season but she has frequently stepped off the bench to goalscoring effect. Should she be involved, then all eyes will be fixed on her likely contest with City’s England captain, Steph Houghton. Any cameos featuring Aluko and Jill Scott, the City and England midfielder, will be interesting. In October the former received an apology from the FA after Katharine Newton, an investigating barrister, found Mark Sampson – the former England Women manager – to have made two racial remarks. One was directed at the Chelsea midfielder Drew Spence and the other “an ill-judged attempt at humour” to Aluko. By then he had already been sacked for behaviour relating to a relationship with a player during a previous job at Bristol Academy. While Sampson is now pursuing an unfair dismissal claim against the FA, Aluko has publicly berated the England squad for not supporting her. She is also understood to have sent critical text messages to Houghton and another player. An England squad encouraged to think for themselves on and off the pitch have responded by meeting the Professional Footballers’ Association to discuss their concerns about recent events. Neutrals may be intrigued to see how Spence, judged worthy of an England recall in some quarters, copes against Cushing’s formidable midfield. But Hayes seems most concerned about leapfrogging City. Chelsea are the WSL’s top scorers but their coach is well aware City will be joined by the gifted Denmark striker Nadia Nadim next month. If this year’s Spring Series winners, Chelsea, want to beat the 2016 WSL champions, City, to the title, Hayes’s team could do with a victory. “I think it’s a game every player on both sides is looking forward to,” she says. “Manchester City have had the best of matches against us in the past few years so it’s time for us to deliver a strong performance. “We’re in good form, we’ve got a full squad to pick from and, regardless of which XI start, I’ve got players who can make a difference from the bench. We’re confident and we fear no one – including City. We respect them but they’re going to be in for a very tough game.” Jen Beattie, City’s Scotland centre-half, is not only undaunted but expects no modification of City’s hallmark attacking style. “We want to keep winning trophies,” she says. “But we’ll always try to be a team that plays exciting football and enjoys building out from the back; that’s what Nick encourages every day in training and it’s the way we aim to build attendances.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/08/sheffield-united-bristol-city-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T22:03:09Z","webTitle":"Aden Flint’s late strike helps Bristol City pull away from Sheffield United","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/08/sheffield-united-bristol-city-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/08/sheffield-united-bristol-city-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Aden Flint’s late strike helps Bristol City pull away from Sheffield United","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Bristol City closed the gap on the Championship’s top two with a remarkable win over Sheffield United, sealed by Aden Flint’s 91st-minute winner. The Blades hit the woodwork four times in an entertaining contest between third and fourth and had dominated until John Fleck’s sending off on the hour. Mark Duffy was the first to find the frame of the goal with a curling free-kick after 20 minutes and 15 minutes later Billy Sharp saw a first-time effort ping away off the bar. United were denied for a third time in the opening half two minutes later when Sharp’s header from an inswinging corner was brilliantly turned on to the crossbar by Frank Fielding in the Bristol City goal. The home side’s failure to take advantage of their dominance was punished two minutes before half-time. Jamie Paterson picked up the ball 25 yards from goal and thrashed a scorching effort past Simon Moore to give the visitors the lead. Three minutes into the second half, though, the Blades were back level, with Leon Clarke, the Championship’s leading scorer, slamming home his 14th of the season with a fizzing effort that left Fielding with no chance. Before the hour, United had hit the woodwork for a fourth time – Duffy again finding the post with a superb effort from distance – but had also been reduced to 10 men after Fleck’s reckless two-footed lunge on Korey Smith, who was helped off the field and substituted shortly after. That changed the tone of the game and it took a fine Moore save to keep out Marlon Pack’s effort before Josh Brownhill’s goalbound effort was deflected narrowly wide. But with time running out, Bobby Reid’s cross found Flint at the far post and the centre-half made no mistake from close range. “I thought Sheffield United were outstanding and they were certainly the better side for the first 55 to 60 minutes. I had to change the shape three times,” said Bristol City’s manager, Lee Johnson. “My boys stuck in. Once they went down to 10 men, I thought we controlled the game.” The victory takes City to within three points of second-placed Cardiff City, while United’s winless run now stretches to four matches. “It’s a cruel game at times. I didn’t think we deserved the defeat. I thought we did more than enough to win against a really good side that’s going well,” said Sheffield United’s manager, Chris Wilder. “I was delighted with the reaction from last Saturday (a 3-1 defeat at Millwall). I think we showed everybody in this division that we’re a decent side when we play as I know we can and we’re a match for anyone. “Things aren’t really going for us but we’ve just got to keep going. Sometimes fortune doesn’t favour the brave.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/10/liam-fox-wto-talks-tech-giants-digital-customs-duties-summit","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T07:00:29Z","webTitle":"Liam Fox seeks to spearhead tech giants’ grab for ‘digital oil’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/10/liam-fox-wto-talks-tech-giants-digital-customs-duties-summit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/10/liam-fox-wto-talks-tech-giants-digital-customs-duties-summit","fields":{"headline":"Liam Fox seeks to spearhead tech giants’ grab for ‘digital oil’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Britain’s trade secretary, Liam Fox, will be a star of this week’s meeting in Buenos Aires of the World Trade Organisation. This won’t be for anything he has to say so much as for being the representative of the UK as it nears the European Union’s exit door. Most economists expect that a hard Brexit – which Fox prefers to a deal that keeps the UK entwined with EU institutions – would damage global trade. A soft Brexit is expected to be a modest blow. This might not matter had global trade not been going through a rough patch over the past couple of years. In 2014 and 2015 it slumped as foreign investment slowed, developed nations rowed back on outsourcing, sanctions on Russia bit and Brazil’s corruption scandals hit some of the country’s biggest businesses. This year is proving to be much better with the International Monetary Fund forecasting growth of 3.7% and the investment bank ING saying it will be more like 4.2%, up from its measure of below 2% last year. Next year, though, is likely to see a slowing again as China seeks to source more services internally, offsetting a return to more buoyant trade figures from Russia, Brazil and the US. Fox, though, says he is in the Argentinian capital to talk about rules governing the export of digital services and information without costly customs duties and to make domestic regulations in other countries more transparent for the UK’s small and medium-sized businesses. On these points he is considered by anti-poverty campaigners and developing world nations to be just another mouthpiece for big corporations. Google, Amazon and Facebook are desperate to open the doors of nervous developing world countries and gain access to the information held on their citizens. Fox and his colleagues in the G7, believing they have lost the race for domination in the trade of goods, want to make sure the digital services revolution remains firmly in their hands. Global Justice Now, the charity previously known as the World Development Movement, says digital services are “the new oil” of the global economy and that developed countries “want rules to ensure they can use and abuse this data as they wish – moving it around the world without restriction or responsibility”. It adds: “This stops countries being able to adequately tax and regulate these companies so that all can benefit from new technology.” The charity wanted to be in Buenos Aires to protest at moves to write into the WTO’s rules the digital dominance of western businesses, but Argentina’s president, Mauricio Macri, banned it and 62 other activist organisations from entering the country. The Norwegian activist organisation Attac Norway has already seen its representative deported in a show of strength by Argentinian authorities. All the non-governmental organisations were accredited by the WTO before Macri stepped in to crush any potential dissent. As a way of stopping another Seattle, where anti-globalisation activists rioted for two days in 1999, the president’s actions have cut off protest at the source. But as an advert for the benefits of global trade and globalisation, it reveals a nervousness that appears to make protest more than justified. The debate about e-commerce, in the view of many charities hoping to attend the event, was a distraction from discussing farm subsidies, fishing rights and the development agenda that is supposed to promote the efforts of poorer countries to grow in a more sustainable way than their rich counterparts. The US, among others, wants to limit India’s protections for its farmers and consumers. Rich countries want to lay down blanket rules on subsidies for fishing that ignore local concerns. It’s a focus on artisan fishing in poor countries that ignores the industrial-scale scouring of the ocean floors. Roberto Azevêdo, WTO director general, is concerned about tackling government support for “unfair and unsustainable fishing practices”. But his support for helping smaller businesses “to participate more fully in international trade” is seen as a distraction when most trade is conducted and controlled by the biggest companies. Bitcoin’s hardly our first bubble. But where are the regulators? Fear of missing out – or Fomo, as chroniclers of investment bubbles call it – is the lust for unearned and easy money that drives even conservative types to speculate wildly, although they know the music could stop at any moment. Bitcoin is at the full-blown Fomo stage. The digital currency is the talk of offices, pubs and newspaper front pages – and that’s just the UK. The mania is said to be most frenzied in Asia, especially China. Few people, one suspects, could explain how bitcoin’s blockchain technology works or describe what a bitcoin “miner” does. But everyone knows punters are sitting on stunning profits. One unit of the currency cost $750 a year ago, fetched $10,000 10 days ago and hit $16,000 at the end of last week. A 60% return in 10 days? It’s a speculator’s dream. Should the rest of us – those shaking our heads and muttering about how it can’t last – care? Before now, no. When the bubble burst, the losers would have only had themselves to blame. Yet we’ve now reached a point where regulators cannot simply sit on their hands. The theoretical value of bitcoins in circulation is £200bn and the mainstream financial world is moving in. Two Chicago exchanges want to offer trading in bitcoin futures, or derivatives of the digital currency. That changes the game, and potentially makes it seriously messy. Derivatives allow the opportunity to bet with leverage and borrowed money, and thus create the possibility of losses rebounding through the system. Should trading in bitcoin futures even be allowed? Perhaps: but regulators should insist that any firm speculating with other people’s money has the approval of end investors and can show it can absorb heavy losses. Regulators should also tell us what they are doing to protect the integrity of the financial system. If bitcoin is only directly useful for fraudsters and money launderers, as bankers keep telling us, who is looking out for society’s interests? We don’t mind speculators getting burned – but we expect zero tolerance of tax evasion. It’s time officials showed they’re on the job. Their current silence is alarming. Could walkouts at Ryanair spell the end for O’Leary? Could the unthinkable be happening at Ryanair? In a decade marked by grassroots uprisings against established order, from the Arab spring through to Brexit to Trump, the Irish airline’s leader has, so far, blithely faced down all dissent from the ranks. Michael O’Leary, who refuses to recognise trade unions, said complaints aired by pilots and crew were concocted by unnamed “competitor” airlines, and has been dismissive of any threatened staff action. However, a shortage of pilots left the chief executive unusually contrite this year over outspoken comments about his staff – and some believe this is the time for a showdown. Ryanair pilots are due to walk out in Portugal and Italy this week, and colleagues elsewhere may join, despite the risk of sanctions. Ryanair pre-emptively cancelled thousands of flights this winter because of a lack of pilots on the roster – a decision which, according to some analysts, O’Leary preferred to the risk of leaving the airline stretched and exposed to industrial action. Don’t expect to see the statues of O’Leary toppled in Ryanair’s Dublin HQ soon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/dec/11/energy-firms-say-price-cap-on-bills-could-hit-uk-roll-out-of-smart-meters","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T10:32:08Z","webTitle":"Energy firms say price cap on bills could hit UK roll-out of smart meters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/dec/11/energy-firms-say-price-cap-on-bills-could-hit-uk-roll-out-of-smart-meters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/dec/11/energy-firms-say-price-cap-on-bills-could-hit-uk-roll-out-of-smart-meters","fields":{"headline":"Energy firms say price cap on bills could hit UK roll-out of smart meters","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Theresa May’s price cap on energy bills risks damaging her government’s hopes of installing millions more smart meters in homes, two of the UK’s biggest energy companies have warned. In evidence submitted to the business, energy and industrial strategy committee , British Gas owner Centrica said: “We believe the price cap will damage the rollout of smart meters and may reduce the total number of meters installed.” The country’s biggest energy supplier also said if the cap was set too low, energy firms would be unable to recover their costs, slowing down or even stalling the rollout. That warning was echoed by E.ON. It said too low a cap would squeeze companies’ profits or push them into a loss, making it difficult or too expensive for them to access capital for the devices. The roll-out “would be constrained by what a supplier could afford”, E.ON added. The government target is for every home and business to have been offered one of the meters, which automate readings and pave the way for innovative new tariffs, by the end of 2020. Centrica, E.ON and the other four of the big six energy also said investment in the sector was in jeopardy if the government did not allow for energy companies to challenge the level at which bills are capped. As it stands, the cap’s draft legislation appears to block companies from appealing to the UK’s competition watchdog, which ScottishPower said broke with standard practice since the energy market was privatised. Business groups said energy firms were concerned that their only route to appeal was via a judicial review, which one smaller company, Co-Op Energy, said was prohibitively expensive for all but the biggest suppliers. The CBI said: “This approach also seems inconsistent with other regulated markets and risks setting a precedent which could spread to other sectors and knock investor confidence in the future.” However, MPs, consumer groups and smaller suppliers that control about a fifth of the market gave their backing to the price cap. The Labour MP Rachel Reeves, who chairs the committee, said: “The government needs to act to stamp out energy companies exploiting loyal customers and leaving these consumers stuck on overinflated energy tariffs. It will come as little surprise to these customers that the big six energy companies oppose a price cap which could reduce consumer bills.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/10/who-is-going-to-learn-the-lords-prayer-again-pope-francis","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T00:05:21Z","webTitle":"Who’s going to learn the Lord’s Prayer again? | Barbara Ellen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/10/who-is-going-to-learn-the-lords-prayer-again-pope-francis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/10/who-is-going-to-learn-the-lords-prayer-again-pope-francis","fields":{"headline":"Who’s going to learn the Lord’s Prayer again?","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Pope Francis has signalled his approval of moves already under way in the Catholic church to change the line in the English version of the Lord’s Prayer, from “Lead us not into temptation” to “Don’t let me fall into temptation”.

In 1631, printers left a crucial “not” out of the Ten Commandments and people were solemnly instructed to commit adultery and this was even before the emergence of the holy churches of Ashley Madison and Tinder.

It seems unlikely that people would bother to “unlearn” the Lord’s Prayer – the version they memorised at school would stay stuck, dusty, but indelible, in their cerebral cortex forever.

The region was already teetering on the edge, but recent events have only made things worse. And while the mayhem should be apparent to any casual observer, what’s less obvious is Jared Kushner’s role in the chaos. Kushner is, of course, the US president’s senior advisor and son-in-law. The 36-year-old is a Harvard graduate who seems to have a hard time filling in forms correctly. He repeatedly failed to mention his meetings with foreign officials on his security clearance and neglected to report to US government officials that he was co-director of a foundation that raised money for Israeli settlements, considered illegal under international law. (He is also said to have told Michael Flynn last December to call UN security council members to get a resolution condemning Israeli settlements quashed. Flynn called Russia.) In his role as the president’s special advisor, Kushner seems to have decided he can remake the entire Middle East, and he is wreaking his havoc with his new best friend, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, the 32-year-old who burst on to the international scene by jailing many members of his country’s ruling elite, including from his own family, on corruption charges. Days before bin Salman’s unprecedented move, Kushner was with the crown prince in Riyadh on an unannounced trip. The men are reported to have stayed up late, planning strategy while swapping stories. We don’t know what exactly the two were plotting, but Donald Trump later tweeted his “great confidence” in bin Salman. But the Kushner-bin Salman alliance moves far beyond Riyadh. The Saudis and Americans are now privately pushing a new “peace” deal to various Palestinian and Arab leaders that is more lop-sided toward Israel than ever before. Ahmad Tibi, a Palestinian parliamentarian in the Israeli Knesset, explained the basic contours of the deal to the New York Times: no full statehood for Palestinians, only “moral sovereignty.” Control over disconnected segments of the occupied territories only. No capital in East Jerusalem. No right of return for Palestinian refugees. This is, of course, not a deal at all. It’s an insult to the Palestinian people. Another Arab official cited in the Times story explained that the proposal came from someone lacking experience but attempting to flatter the family of the American president. In other words, it’s as if Mohammed bin Salman is trying to gift Palestine to Jared Kushner, Palestinians be damned. Next came Donald Trump throwing both caution and international law to the wind by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. But it’s not just Israel, either. Yemen is on the brink of a major humanitarian disaster largely because the country is being blockaded by Saudi Arabia. Trump finally spoke out against the Saudi measure this week, but both the state department and the Pentagon are said to have been privately urging Saudi Arabia and the UAE to ease their campaign against Yemen (and Lebanon and Qatar) for some time and to little impact. Why? Because Saudi and Emirati officials believe they “have tacit approval from the White House for their hardline actions, in particular from Donald Trump and his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner,” journalist Laura Rozen reported. The Kushner-bin Salman alliance has particularly irked secretary of state Rex Tillerson. Kushner reportedly leaves the state department completely out of his Middle Eastern plans. Of special concern to Tillerson, according to Bloomberg News, is Kushner’s talks with bin Salman regarding military action by Saudi Arabia against Qatar. The state department is worried of all the unforeseen consequences such a radical course of action would bring, including heightened conflict with Turkey and Russia and perhaps even a military response from Iran or an attack on Israel by Hezbollah. Here’s where state department diplomacy should kick in. The US ambassador to Qatar could relay messages between the feuding parties to find a solution to the stand-off. So what does the ambassador to Qatar have to say about the Kushner-Salman alliance? Nothing, since there still is no confirmed ambassador to Qatar. What about the US ambassador to Saudi Arabia? That seat’s also vacant. And the US ambassador to Jordan, Morocco, Egypt? Vacant, vacant, and vacant. What about assistant secretary for Near Eastern affairs, a chief strategic post to establish US policy in the region? No one’s been nominated. Deputy assistant secretary for press and public diplomacy? Vacant. It’s partly this vacuum of leadership by Tillerson that has enabled Kushner to forge his powerful alliance with bin Salman, much to the detriment of the region. And in their zeal to isolate Iran, Kushner and bin Salman are leaving a wake of destruction around them. The war in Yemen is only intensifying. Qatar is closer to Iran than ever. A final status deal between Israel and the Palestinians seems all but impossible now. The Lebanese prime minister went back on his resignation. And the Saudi state must be paying the Ritz-Carlton a small fortune to jail key members of the ruling family over allegations of corruption. There’s a long history of American politicians deciding they know what’s best for the Middle East while buttressing their autocratic allies and at the expense of the region’s ordinary people. (The New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman has traditionally provided the rationale for America and its allies in the region, and his recent sycophantic portrayal of bin Salman certainly didn’t disappoint!) But the Kushner-bin Salman alliance also represents something else. Both the US and Saudi Arabia are concentrating power into fewer and fewer hands. And with fewer people in the room, who will be around to tell these men that their ideas are so damaging? Who will dare explain to them how they already have failed?

Including in the White House. It’s easy to feel helpless in the face of anonymous rightwing bile. But one activist has come up with a novel solution – creating a platform through which people can donate to liberal causes in response to hate-filled tweets. “Troll Tax” is the brainchild of Seth Callaway, a Brooklyn-based creative consultant. A web app, it allows people to select individual tweets and link them to a donation to organisations that have worked against the Trump agenda: Planned Parenthood, the American Civil Liberties Union, Conservation International and more. The donor can then use the Troll Tax website to tweet at the troll – letting them know their message has inspired a donation. Callaway had the idea after noticing the innovative way in which one Twitter user reacted to a troll during an online spat. “This one random tweeter replied to a troll,” he said, “and said: ‘Thanks for your donation to Planned Parenthood.’ And he’s like: ‘What are you talking about? I don’t donate there.” She said: ‘I’m donating each time you’re tweeting.’ “I just saw the kind of confusion and befuddlement of the troll and thought it would be cool if you could automate that, or turn it into an easy way to really do that.” Callaway worked with Kevin Haight, a freelance developer, to develop Troll Tax, which launched on Wednesday. Troll Tax keeps a leaderboard of which Twitter users have inspired the most donations. On Friday morning, @realDonaldTrump was “top troll”. Final battle looms over net neutrality The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is planning to vote on Thursday 14 December on a series of measures which would allow a “two-tier” internet in the US. The FCC is likely to vote for “Restoring Internet Freedom”, despite the best efforts of activists who have been campaigning against the bill for months. But while the battle might be over, the war is not yet won. Online activism website Battle for the Net is planning a drive to get Congress to intervene against the FCC ruling – which would dismantle net neutrality rules. Battle for the Net has created a widget that websites can install – enabling readers to call Congress directly through their sites – and has created a simple way for people to write to members of Congress asking them to stop the FCC from voting. What we’re reading Polling in Alabama gives Democrat Doug Jones a shot at beating Roy Moore, writes Lauren Zanolli in the Guardian. “But political analysts have highlighted the importance of an Obama-level turnout among African American voters for a rare Democratic victory.” Zanolli went to Mobile to meet some black organizers trying to get out the youth vote. While activists were launching a frantic effort to stop the Republican tax bill – an effort which ultimately failed – conservative groups were launching their own bid to pressure senators, Jeremy Peters writes in the New York Times. That effort included students, working on behalf of the Koch-funded Americans for Prosperity, going door to door to ask people to call their elected officials. It’s an interesting read.

Noor Fadel, 18, was speaking to a friend on the phone as she headed home from work on Monday. “All of a sudden you just hear some dude start saying these words,” Fadel told CKNW 980. “I wasn’t paying attention to him until he actually got up. He had a very aggressive look on his face.” The man – whom she described as white – began swearing at her in a mix of Arabic and another language. “And then he called me a slut and said all those kinds of words,” said Fadel, who wears a hijab. “And he told me that he’s going to kill me and kill all Muslims.” Fadel, who was born in Canada to parents from Iraq, said she regularly fended off comments from people telling her to go back to her country but she was stunned by his behaviour. The man then tried to grab her and force her head on to his crotch, she said. “And I looked at the passengers,” she said. “And everyone saw that he did it. But they were all just sitting. No one got up, no one said a word.” She took her eyes off him to steal another glance at the busy train. “And the second I looked at the passengers, he struck me across the face. Hit me,” he said. “And he kept calling me a whore and he called me slut and he was talking about my mom.” Jake Taylor, a cook who was sitting nearby, ran over and pushed the man away from her, forcing him off the train at the next stop. Fadel – who described Taylor as her ‘hero” – manage to snap a photo of her alleged attacker before he got off the train. Taylor stayed with her as she exited at the next stop and called police, still reeling from shock. Hours later police arrested Pierre Belzan, of no fixed address, and charged him with one count of threatening to cause bodily harm and one count of assault. A charge of sexual assault is also being considered. Fadel later posted an account of what happened on social media. “It saddens my heart that so many people watched as I was being attacked and assaulted simply because of a man who knew nothing of me but chose to judge me based on the hijab I wear,” she wrote. Thousands of responses poured in – including from hundreds from other Muslim women across Canada who said they had also suffered Islamophobic violence. But in Canada, the discussion has now focused on why Taylor was the only person to intervene, with some pointing to the bystander effect – a social phenomenon used to describe why people are less likely to offer help when others are present – or pointing to the fatal stabbing of two men in Portland, Oregon, who tried to shield two women from an anti-Muslim tirade. Transit officials said that nobody on the train pushed the emergency alarm or made use of the emergency intercoms. The same debate has swirled in south-western Ontario, where on Thursday a man wielding a baseball bat attacked a family – yelling about terrorists and Isis – in the parking lot of a strip mall. The father of the family, who suffered a cracked rib in the attack, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that he was surprised that most in the parking lot pretended nothing was happening. Police later charged a 36-year-old man with aggravated assault and three counts of assault with a weapon. In Vancouver, Fadel said she held nothing against those who chose not to intervene. “I can only imagine what I would do,” she said. “I would hope that I would stand up as well. But honestly, these days, you just don’t know what people can do if you stand up.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/08/la-angels-shohei-ohtani-japanese-babe-ruth-mlb-baseball","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T19:53:30Z","webTitle":"LA Angels win sweepstakes to sign 'Japan's Babe Ruth' Shohei Ohtani","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/08/la-angels-shohei-ohtani-japanese-babe-ruth-mlb-baseball","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/08/la-angels-shohei-ohtani-japanese-babe-ruth-mlb-baseball","fields":{"headline":"LA Angels win sweepstakes to sign 'Japan's Babe Ruth' Shohei Ohtani","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Los Angeles Angels have landed the most coveted free agent in baseball, Japanese superstar Shohei Ohtani. The 23-year-old, dubbed ‘Japan’s Babe Ruth’, has been highly coveted by Major League Baseball clubs due to his rare two-way skills – his fastball has reached over 100mph and powerful left-handed swing allows him to play in the line-up when he is not pitching. Ohtani, who turned down the New York Yankees, ultimately chose the Angels over the Los Angeles Dodgers, San Francisco Giants, Chicago Cubs, San Diego Padres, Seattle Mariners, and Texas Rangers. Ohtani was coveted by every team because of his exceptional skills but also because he represents an extraordinary bargain due to baseball’s rules around international players. The Angels will have to pay the $20m posting fee to Ohtani’s previous club, the Nippon Ham Fighters, but he will not be paid a huge salary. Ohtani, who will join two-time MVP Mike Trout, will sign a minor league contract and can receive up to $2.3m in international bonus money. “This morning, after a thorough, detailed process, Shohei Otani has decided to sign with the Los Angeles Angels,” Nez Balelo, the co-head of Otani’s agency CAA Baseball, said in a statement. “Shohei is humbled and flattered by all the time and effort that so many teams put into their presentations and sincerely thanks them for their professionalism. In the end he felt a strong connection with the Angels and believes they can best help him reach his goals in Major League Baseball. “I want to thank the clubs and everyone else for respecting our intent to make this very important process as private as possible. We were resolved to having a fair, methodical process. Teams clearly put in a lot of work, and we are grateful for that. The past few weeks also further demonstrated Shohei’s incredible thoughtfulness, attention to detail and determination to make an informed decision. “He read every page of every presentation and listened to every word in each meeting, and he was so impressed that it was not an easy choice. While there has been much speculation about what would drive Shohei’s decision, what mattered to him most wasn’t market size, time zone or league but that he felt a true bond with the Angels. He sees this as the best environment to develop and reach the next level and attain his career goals. “More than ever, I believe this is not only a special talent but a man of special character, and like everyone else I’m excited to see him in Major League Baseball.” The Angels are coming off their second consecutive losing season and haven’t won a play-off game since 2009, but their combination of a promising young core and a beautiful West Coast location clearly appealed to Ohtani."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/08/ngolo-kante-deserves-to-win-ballon-dor-says-chelsea-manager-antonio-conte","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T22:30:07Z","webTitle":"N’Golo Kanté should win Ballon d’Or, says Chelsea manager Antonio Conte","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/08/ngolo-kante-deserves-to-win-ballon-dor-says-chelsea-manager-antonio-conte","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/08/ngolo-kante-deserves-to-win-ballon-dor-says-chelsea-manager-antonio-conte","fields":{"headline":"N’Golo Kanté should win Ballon d’Or, says Chelsea manager Antonio Conte","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"N’Golo Kanté is currently more deserving of the Ballon d’Or than Eden Hazard, according to Antonio Conte, but only the Belgian has the chance to win it in his career, the Italian has said. Speaking before Chelsea’s Premier League match at West Ham in which Conte hopes to close an 11-point gap to the leaders, Manchester City, he spoke of nurturing in Hazard the “sacred fire” that drives the top players to “win, win and win”. But he also compared himself to Kanté, who came eighth in the vote – the highest ranking for any Premier League player – and said the Frenchman deserved the prize. “For sure [Hazard] is a fantastic player, he is important, but at the same time I tell you that to win the Ballon d’Or you have to win, and in your career you have to win a lot,” Conte said. “For [this year’s winner] Cristiano Ronaldo it’s the fifth time, like Messi. It means that in the last 10 years it didn’t change, two players, three players, because also there is Neymar.” Conte has previously described Hazard as being in the world’s top three players, and emphasised on Friday the qualities that set apart the game’s truly elite players. “I like to call it a ‘sacred fire’ when you have it inside you; the will to win every game,” Conte said. “At this level we all have it inside us. Then the flame can be big or little. When you have an inferno it means you are like Messi, Ronaldo, Neymar. “When you see these players you see a hunger in every moment. Score one goal, they want to score the second; score the second and they want to score the third. They want to win, win and continue to win. “The past is not important for these players. Eden has the right characteristics to try to fight with these giants. He has the characteristics, so then he has to try to do it. And to improve his position in this table next year.” Conte praised Kanté but said the midfielder’s skill-set means the former Leicester player is unlikely to win football’s prestigious individual prize, awarded by France Football magazine and selected by journalists. “When I was a player I wanted to win the Ballon d’Or but I knew my characteristics, I knew that it was impossible,” Conte said. “But I won a lot in my career. I won everything. I don’t know if Kanté can win the Ballon d’Or in his life because of the characteristics of this player. He doesn’t score a lot of goals. He is a great worker. “For me as a coach Kanté has to win, but in reality it would be very difficult. Paolo Maldini never won but he was the best defender in the world. Gianluigi Buffon never won, he was the best goalkeeper in the world for many years. But this is the story of the Ballon d’Or. “You have to respect it is a particular classification.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/08/mauricio-pochettino-tottenham-transfer-deals","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T22:30:07Z","webTitle":"Mauricio Pochettino says Tottenham must act more swiftly on transfer deals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/08/mauricio-pochettino-tottenham-transfer-deals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/08/mauricio-pochettino-tottenham-transfer-deals","fields":{"headline":"Mauricio Pochettino says Tottenham must act more swiftly on transfer deals","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Mauricio Pochettino has suggested that Tottenham Hotspur have paid a price for the late completion of their summer transfer business and has made it plain that the club will have to be quicker and smarter next time. The manager will be restricted in the January window as his Champions League squad already contains the maximum of 17 foreign players – and that number does not include the fit-again Érik Lamela, whom he is keen to reintegrate for the knockout stage. Pochettino said he would focus next month on trying to “take advantage of the English market and add an English player”, together with the drive to promote English youngsters from the academy. But he wants to use January, primarily, as a means to prepare the summer business; to steal a march on rivals, after he felt the club failed to do so last summer. Pochettino signed Davinson Sánchez, Paulo Gazzaniga, Juan Foyth, Serge Aurier and Fernando Llorente in the final two weeks of August. Foyth, Aurier and Llorente came in the last 48 hours – the latest example of the chairman Daniel Levy’s penchant for taking deals down to the wire. Pochettino was quick to spell out the downside of that approach. “This summer was a very good example because we signed good players but it was so late and with no pre-season [for them], you pay,” Pochettino said. “You then need six or seven months for the player to be fit, adapt himself in everything and that is always against us. “The most important thing that we have been talking about is to identify our targets and, on 3 July, when we start our pre-season, they are here. If we don’t, it’s so difficult for them to help the team and then, during the season, you are going to pay. It’s so important today to identify your targets for the summer. If not and we wait until May and, before we sign, we sell, it’s so difficult to bring in players that can help.” Pochettino betrayed an element of frustration at Tottenham’s summer business when he was asked whether he needed to qualify once more for the Champions League to attract the best players. “But you have the very good example of last season,” he said. “How did we finish? In second place. And we attract? We attract?” The questioner tried to be positive and highlighted how Sánchez had been signed. “We attract a 21-year-old,” Pochettino said, pointedly. “Yes or no?” Pochettino is painfully aware that the summer market will be particularly difficult because of the World Cup and the fact that the window will close for incoming signings on the Thursday before the Premier League season begins. It has made him more determined to act swiftly – possibly tying up some business for the summer in January, in the same way that Dele Alli was signed from MK Dons in the winter window of 2015 with an agreement for a five-month loan-back. Pochettino would like to put something similar in place for Fulham’s Ryan Sessegnon. “The Dele signing is a very good example of the need to anticipate,” Pochettino said. “We cannot be reactive because if we are, we are going to lose. If we are going to compete in the same period with City, United, Liverpool or Chelsea, then we are going to struggle to bring in the players we want. Maybe we need to sign the player in January and they can join in the summer. “We tried to make early signings last summer but we could not, for different reasons. Now, we are going to try again to do things early. If we cannot again, I am going to say: ‘Come on, we could not again!’” Pochettino said that Tottenham had recall clauses in the loans that have taken Josh Onomah and Cameron Carter-Vickers to Aston Villa and Sheffield United, respectively. “We have the possibility to bring them back,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/09/asda-turns-its-fire-on-staff-and-frills-in-bid-to-fight-off-discounters","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-09T16:00:11Z","webTitle":"Asda turns its fire on staff and frills in bid to fight off discounters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/09/asda-turns-its-fire-on-staff-and-frills-in-bid-to-fight-off-discounters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/09/asda-turns-its-fire-on-staff-and-frills-in-bid-to-fight-off-discounters","fields":{"headline":"Asda turns its fire on staff and frills in bid to fight off discounters","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"This year, Asda is promising shoppers their “Best. Christmas. Ever” with a festive advert set in a Willy Wonka-inspired factory. The ad is billed as a “love letter to our customers and products”, featuring tiny Asda workers assembling party canapés and a reindeer-powered food mixer stirring its Christmas puddings. But many Asda staff will be spending the period worrying about the what the retailer’s latest round of cost cutting will mean for them in the new year. The Guardian revealed last week that more than 800 senior Asda shopfloor workers were facing a pay cut or redundancy in the new year as the UK’s third-largest supermarket chain grapples with the existential threat posed by the rise of the German discounters Aldi and Lidl. Thousands more Asda employees risk having their working hours reduced in 2018 as the retailer adopts a no-frills approach to stacking and tidying shelves. In a handout given to staff, Asda bosses spelled out the company’s predicament in stark terms: “A proposition based on being the cheapest of the big four [supermarkets] is no longer a viable business model. We need to look at ways to reduce our operating costs to close the price gap with the discounters.” Aldi and Lidl opened their first UK stores in the early 1990s, but it took the 2008 financial crisis for them to become serious players in the UK food market, as soaring food price inflation encouraged the middle classes to darken their doors for the first time. Now Aldi and Lidl account for £1 in every £8 spent in UK supermarkets. This Christmas, two-thirds of shoppers will pick up some of their holiday treats at a discounter, thanks to positive write-ups in the food press, with Good Housekeeping magazine, for example, giving Aldi its Christmas pudding gong this year. Asda, whose US parent Walmart is the world’s largest company by sales, is far from bust, yet its battle with the discounters contributed to a near 20% drop in pre-tax profits to £657.2m last year. But the document given to staff warned that about half of its 153 smallest supermarkets are currently loss-making and it needs to fashion new ways of working to “ensure the longevity of the format”. The management-speak points to the need to improve staff productivity at a time when inflation and higher business running costs are eroding profits. The squeeze has forced the big four supermarkets – Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons – to react, carving out billions of pounds in cost-savings from their stores, warehouses and head offices. Tesco banked operating profits of £1.28bn in the last financial year, down from £4bn in its heyday under Sir Terry Leahy. Profits are also down at Sainsbury’s while Morrisons, under David Potts, is busy climbing out of the hole it dug for itself. In October, Asda announced that its newish chief executive, Sean Clarke, would be replaced by his deputy, Roger Burnley, in January. Clarke, a Walmart troubleshooter, was parachuted into the role last summer and the most recent sales figures show his turnaround, focused on price cuts and fewer gaps on shelves, is paying off as a three-year sales slump ends. The latest item in Clarke and Burnley’s turnaround involves getting rid of 842 section-leader jobs, whose hourly pay rate is higher. If the plan is pushed through the jobs will be downgraded, with attempts made to redeploy staff who are potentially at risk of redundancy. Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said Asda had been quick to identify the threat posed by fast-growing discounters but that Walmart had been “greedy”, demanding chunky dividends and starving its UK subsidiary of the money needed to invest in its more than 600 supermarkets so it could fight back. “There has been a failure of investment and management across the board,” said Black. “The big supermarket chains became flabby, self-serving corporations. They committed the cardinal sin of losing touch with their customers.” Aldi’s UK boss Matthew Barnes recently signalled a programme of aggressive expansion, suggesting the chain could nearly double in size to 1,300 stores by 2022. Lidl, meanwhile, has secured sites to add between 50 and 60 shops a year for the next two years, boosting the chain’s UK presence to around 800 stores. But the discounters cannot escape the problems that have beset their bigger rivals indefinitely. The German chains, once famous for their simplicity and tiny product ranges, have altered their winning formula to succeed in the UK. In particular, they have replaced canned vegetables and bratwurst with bountiful displays of fresh food and meat, making stores more complex and expensive to run. “I wouldn’t be surprised if we have reached the zenith of the discounter opening programmes in the UK,” said Black. “They may by privately owned business with deep pockets, but they are not irrational and [divorced] from the laws of economics.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/08/theresa-may-eu-deal-brexit-hard-border-ireland","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T19:25:02Z","webTitle":"Theresa May’s EU deal will postpone the pain of Brexit, but won’t prevent it | Jonathan Freedland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/08/theresa-may-eu-deal-brexit-hard-border-ireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/08/theresa-may-eu-deal-brexit-hard-border-ireland","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May’s EU deal will postpone the pain of Brexit, but won’t prevent it","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The least important consequence of Theresa May’s dawn breakthrough in Brussels is that it might well have saved her premiership. After Monday’s Brexishambles, in which the prime minister had to tell Jean-Claude Juncker to put the cork back in the champagne thanks to a party-pooping call from the DUP, the clock was ticking on the prime minister. Failure to strike an agreement that satisfied both her Belfast allies and the negotiators in Brussels would, in the eyes of many Tory MPs, have removed the chief justification for her continued tenure in Downing Street: namely, that she can deliver Brexit. The Tory regicidal instinct, never still, was twitching. Today’s declaration that the talks had made “sufficient progress” has pacified that urge for a while. As things stand, Tories are minded to allow her to stay until the end of March 2019, to see through article 50 and Britain’s exit from the European Union. They know that’s bound to be a horrible job so, for now, they’re happy to let her do it. But, to repeat, that’s the least significant aspect. More important, because it is a matter of the country’s future rather than one politician’s career, is that the “no deal” scenario has receded. It hasn’t disappeared, but it has become less likely. That explains the ill temper of Nigel Farage and his successor as Ukip leader, Henry Bolton, who declared May’s move a “total surrender to the European commission”. They, and the hardest Tory Brexiteers, were yearning for the deadlock that would have justified Britain storming off and slamming the door. Instead a phased departure looks to be the most probable outcome. How did this come about? Like any deal, it required all the key players to have their own reasons for preferring agreement to failure. For May, the motive was obvious. Not only was her career hanging by a thread, but she could see what’s clear to all but the most wild-eyed Brexiteer: that no-deal would be an economic catastrophe. That’s why she was ready to give ground on all those EU demands where once her government struck such an unbending pose – including paying the hefty divorce bill and accepting that the writ of the European court of justice will run until at least the late 2020s. You can also see why the DUP eventually fell into line. They wanted reassurance that Northern Ireland was not going to be treated any differently from the rest of the UK – a defining tenet of Ulster unionism – but they were never likely to push May too far. They don’t want to see this government collapse followed by fresh elections. They don’t dare risk the elevation of Jeremy Corbyn, whom they remember as a republican sympathiser during the era of the Troubles. Besides, the current, rather lucrative arrangement, in which they hold the government’s fate in their hands, suits them very well. Most interesting is the European willingness to shake hands. Farage will say that’s hardly a surprise, given May’s capitulation to the EU’s key demands. But we know that Brussels had resolved from 24 June 2016 onwards to make Brexit as painful as possible, seeing its potential as an instruction video for any other member states that were considering making the same mistake. In which case, why not let May, and Britain, suffer a few months longer? I’m told the EU believes it has already made its point: the remaining EU27 can all see that Brexit will cost Britain dear, starting with that bill, estimated at around £40bn. With that done, they are keen to put Brexit to one side, lest it consume any more European energy than it needs to. The French and Germans, in particular, have big European ambitions – including on defence and security – and believe now is a good moment to advance them. Their economies are ticking up nicely, just as Britain’s is lagging; the migration crisis is not as pressing as it was; and the UK is not around to block their plans. They want to seize this moment, rather than be tied up with the chaos of a British crash exit. What’s more, they didn’t want to risk the toppling of May. For them, she’s a known quantity. And she’s promised them the main thing they wanted: money. Better to have her across the table than be faced with, say, Boris Johnson or another ardent Brexiteer keen to demonstrate his Europhobic resolve. So they decided to help her: hence today’s torrent of condescending praise from Juncker and the others. And yet what was agreed was not much more than a series of convenient fictions, starting with the notion that the transition will last only two years. Everyone involved believes it will take much longer than that – five years is a minimal estimate – not least because Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, reckons substantive talks, beyond merely outlining the key areas, won’t even begin till January 2019. But it suits them all to pretend otherwise. More important is the delicate piece of fudge cooked up on the core question of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The crucial sentence – in paragraph 49 – promises that, in the absence of a full UK-EU agreement, a hard border will be avoided by ensuring “full alignment” between the UK and those rules of the single market and customs union that directly bear on the relationship between the republic and the north. Now, that could play out in one of three ways, depending which of the current red lines turns out to be pinkest. It could mean that the entire UK will end up being in full alignment, in which case it’s the softest possible Brexit: a Bino –Brexit in name only – to cheer remainers. Or, if that prospect is simply unacceptable to the Tory Brexiteers, it could mean those EU-friendly rules apply to Northern Ireland only – a stance unpalatable to the DUP and most Tory unionists, and explicitly ruled out in the very next paragraph of the agreement. Or, third, all these conflicting promises prove irreconcilable, and Ireland ends up with a hard border after all. My inner pessimist has long suspected that will be the eventual outcome. Of those three red lines, the hard border in Ireland is surely the one least theologically sacred to Tory Brexiteers. It matters to the Irish enormously, of course, but Dublin will find itself squeezed between Westminster political logic on the one hand and the logic of Brussels on the other. For the EU does, and will, insist on policing its external frontiers. Consider that there are border posts separating Norway and Sweden – it takes a lorry about six minutes to get through – and Norway is actually in the single market. “The Irish were always going to lose out,” says Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, ruefully. “If Britain leaves the single market and customs union, there has to be a hard border.” They might find diplomatic language to dress it up, they might call it a soft boundary, but a hard border it will be. Privately, Barnier’s team admits as much. This, then, is the moment of reckoning that today’s agreement postpones. What matters to the current British government more: avoiding a hard border, or breaking free of the single market and customs union? The dispiriting news for remainers hoping to prevent the national calamity of Brexit is that we surely know the answer. • Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/08/theresa-may-orders-ministers-to-cool-public-dispute-over-defence","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T19:30:13Z","webTitle":"Theresa May orders ministers to cool public dispute over defence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/08/theresa-may-orders-ministers-to-cool-public-dispute-over-defence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/08/theresa-may-orders-ministers-to-cool-public-dispute-over-defence","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May orders ministers to cool public dispute over defence","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Theresa May has intervened in a damaging row between Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, and Philip Hammond, the chancellor, by asking them to cool down their spat. The dispute started over Williamson’s attempts to get more money for the armed forces, with allies of Hammond blaming him for orchestrating a backbench rebellion. One ally of the chancellor is said to have briefed a Sunday newspaper that Williamson looked “like Private Pike from Dad’s Army”. There followed reports that the Ministry of Defence was banning Hammond from using military planes for foreign trips after complaints about an unpaid Treasury bill. The row escalated further on Wednesday when Hammond suggested to the House of Commons defence committee that Williamson was yet to “get his head around the defence budget”. One MP said one of May’s parliamentary private secretaries had taken both men aside to ask them to calm the situation. Another Conservative source said this had happened after an escalation of their row in the House of Commons on Wednesday evening. Downing Street has previously acknowledged there was an “administrative discussion” under way between the two departments, but the prime minister has intervened amid concerns the row was getting out of hand. No 10 and spokespeople for Williamson and Hammond had no immediate comment. Williamson was promoted to the role of defence secretary despite a lack of departmental experience after Michael Fallon was forced to step down last month over allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour.

For Theresa May’s government, leaving a union with Europe is proving to be a humiliating experience. It has been embarrassing to witness ministers pursue a strategy of bluster, blunders and climbdowns to deliver the misguided exit from the European Union. On Friday morning the terms of the divorce settlement were reached, two months later than expected. In surrendering to reality, Britain could begin talking about how we could rub along once the divorce was finalised. It is instructive that Brexiters in the cabinet congratulated Mrs May for her capitulations, which only weeks ago they would have viewed as treason. The Tory leavers know that the ultimate prize – to depart the EU – is within their grasp. They are prepared to put aside their supposed principles to achieve it. This is not the end of the marriage but it is the beginning of its end. The needed restoration of faith in the stability that a union of purpose provides will not come through recriminations. To inspire confidence one must demonstrate it in oneself. Yet the 15-page deal crystallises the divisions within the Conservative party. It is significant that the passage on Northern Ireland commits the UK to full regulatory alignment with the EU after Britain leaves the bloc “in the absence of other agreed solutions”. This goes beyond areas of cooperation under the Good Friday agreement and would tacitly commit Britain to many facets of EU membership as a default option post-Brexit. Such an outcome would be anathema to ardent Brexiters, who fantasise about being able to conduct free trade deals outside of the “protectionist” EU. To avoid a damaging split in her government, Mrs May had wanted to put off a decision about Britain’s long-term relationship with the EU until after securing a transitional deal early next year. But solving the puzzle over Northern Ireland forced Mrs May to be less ambiguous than she wanted to be. Logically she has accepted a soft Brexit, but politically she advocates a hard Brexit. This tension cannot be sustained. She has exposed a division in her cabinet – increasing the risk that her government may fall. The UK government’s failures and incompetence on Brexit are a threat to this nation’s future prospects. The chancellor this week admitted that the cabinet has never had a discussion about the kind of Brexit it is aiming for, probably because the arguments once begun would never stop. However, this failure to face down the fanatics in cabinet and set out a course in the national interest means that the EU is loth to waste any more time having discussions about discussions with the UK. If Britain continues with the farrago of fact and myth about not wanting to be part of the EU’s single market, customs union, nor subject to rulings by the European court of justice, then we would at best get a deal rather like the one Brussels has with Canada. Even Mrs May admits this would be less beneficial than what we have today. Britain will lose out from exiting the EU. Brexiters want Britain to maintain trade ties with Europe without the constraints of its legislative requirements. The EU has the opposite incentive. It cannot reward Britain’s leavers by granting the UK better terms than it enjoyed as a full member. Hence a punitive element is hardwired into the EU’s bargaining position. If Brexit is to go ahead, it is up to Mrs May to advance an autonomy that embraces cooperation and solidarity with the EU, not least to protect jobs. As every divorcee will tell her, to have cordial future relations, one must avoid a bitter break up."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/11/forget-italian-pizza-twirling-britain-cultural-heritage","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T11:02:03Z","webTitle":"Forget Italian pizza-twirling – what about Britain’s ‘intangible cultural heritage’? | Nigel Kendall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/11/forget-italian-pizza-twirling-britain-cultural-heritage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/11/forget-italian-pizza-twirling-britain-cultural-heritage","fields":{"headline":"Forget Italian pizza-twirling – what about Britain’s ‘intangible cultural heritage’?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The news that Unesco has recognised the pizza-twirling that goes on in Naples as an “intangible cultural heritage” sent us back first to the source for more riveting info, then on to the full list of intangible treasures from around the world, where we discovered to our dismay that there’s not a single one from the UK. Not even for morris dancing. Time, then, for six suggestions for consideration. 1 Pub etiquette This collection of complex rituals should be studied and absorbed by all. A basic course might include tips on how to catch the eye of the bar staff in a crowded pub when you know it’s your turn, and a reminder that anyone who turns down the chance to queue-jump in front of you deserves a sincere thank you. Advanced students may then progress to learn how to keep a round functioning smoothly and the art of holding the whip. Detailed knowledge of the actual food and drink on offer is not necessary and can in some cases prove to be a deterrent. 2 Tea-making The Japanese and Chinese have their glorious green teas, and America has a concoction called Lipton, drunk neat or with lemon. Surely, it’s time for Unesco to recognise the making of real tea, as enjoyed by most people in Britain? This should be made with water 10C below boiling point, with the milk added when the brew reaches the desired strength. Putting the milk in before the teabag cools the water down prevents the brewing working its sacred magic and is, therefore, the work of the devil*. If you know, or think you might know, anyone who prelactates in this manner, unfriend them immediately and report them to Unesco. Teabags or other containers are good because you can easily remove them from the water to prevent the tea becoming bitter. 3 Pronunciation of place names The accepted rules of English orthography fly out of the window when it comes to proper names, yet the decline of written communication may threaten these treasures, seemingly designed to trip up the unwary out-of-towner. Unesco should step in. Here’s a short list: Leicester, Towcester, Cirencester, Claughton (Lancs), Wybunbury, Strathaven, Magdalen College Oxford, Rievaulx, Udny, Mousehole, Salisbury, Prideaux Castle and Laugharne. 4 The shipping forecast This national institution, which taps neatly into the British obsession about the bloody weather, celebrated its 150th anniversary in August – but has really only been widely loved since the advent of radio. Poems and songs have been written about it, and a regular audience in the hundreds of thousands tunes in nightly to be lulled to sleep by the steady rhythms of “Fisher, Viking, German Bight, North Utsire [pause, short breath] South Utsire.” As Mark Damazer, the former controller of BBC Radio 4, once observed: “It scans poetically. It’s got a rhythm of its own. It’s eccentric, it’s unique, it’s English. It’s slightly mysterious because nobody really knows where these places are.” 5 The friendliness of everyone north of Watford When I first moved down south from Manchester more than 30 years ago, I made the mistake of saying hello to people I didn’t know. They looked back at me as if I’d just vomited on their shoes and expected them to lick it off. Now when I return up north I have the opposite problem, since years in London have deprived me of the ability to trust folk who want nothing more than to spark up a conversation. The mass relocation of silent southerners to the BBC in Salford and the consequent migration north of other creative industries threaten the future of human interaction across the upper half of the country. Unesco must act now to ensure the survival of meaningless bus-stop chatter and pub conversation with strangers. 6 The rail fare rise It is culturally remarkable that this annual kick in the wallet is the only thing that our fragmented rail network is guaranteed to deliver on time. Every December, shortly after the ritual autumn laying of leaves on the line, the rail companies tell customers exactly how much food they’ll be taking from the mouths of their children the following year. This year’s announcement of a hike of 3.4% exceeded most forecasts, unlike the rest of the once-great railway network. One day, a society that wants its citizens to own fewer cars and pollute the world less might make it convenient, clean and cheap for them to take the train. Until then, Unesco recognition is long overdue. *Some unscrupulous cafe owners will give you tea in a mug with milk already in.

A packed committee room at the House of Commons heard emotional testimony from four bereaved residents including Ahmed Elgwahry who said he had not received an apology from the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC) for the fire. The meeting was called to mark six months since the fire which claimed 71 lives and was organised by Grenfell United, which represents the majority of the surviving residents of the tower and the bereaved. It was attended by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, the Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable,and the shadow housing minister, John Healey. “My mum and my sister were poisoned by the smoke, they were burned and they were cremated,” Elgwahry said. “I had to listen to them suffer. I had to listen to them die. I had to watch the flat burn for a couple of days. If that is not torture, I don’t know what is.” His sister Mariem, 27, and mother Eslah, 64, both died. Eslah was found on the 23rd floor and was identified by her dental records, an inquest heard. Following their deaths, Elgwahry said he had hoped to see his loved ones but “what I got was fragments of bone and muscle tissue”. He said the fire happened because “of a culture of negligence and self-interest” and “treating residents as second-class citizens”. “I asked for one single thing from RBKC and that’s a simple apology,” he said. “I am still waiting. I have received an apology for the aftermath, but not what happened up to the inferno.” Replying, Javid said: “I am deeply sorry for the failure of the state to be there for the people of north Kensington when they needed it most. In 21st-century Britain, people were left without their homes, their belongings and without any kind of meaningful help. There is absolutely no excuse for that.” He said he had personally been “frustrated at the pace of help and support” available to residents and the bereaved and that he recognised residents of Grenfell had been “pushed to the very edge of consciousness by society that hoped to forget about them”. Referring to the efforts of Grenfell United, which has been lobbying for greater representation for the community on the public inquiry which entered its second day on Tuesday, he said: “You have shown the city, you have shown the world what community is all about.” Natasha Elcock, 39, told how she was trapped on the 11th floor with her six-year-old daughter and boyfriend. She flooded the bathroom to help protect against the fire and managed to flee after 90 minutes when a fire crew reached her. They stumbled over a body on their way out. “What went on after that was just unbelievable,” she said. “We want justice for the young children who died in that building and that person who I had to disrespect by stepping on. Grenfell should never have happened. We want justice for those 71 people that died [so they] have not died in vain.” Bellal El Guenuni, told how his pregnant wife and three children escaped at 3.30am but his son and daughter collapsed and went into a coma. He described how the rest of his family were in hospitals in other parts of the capital. He was given a room in a hotel, only to be told he couldn’t stay beyond one night and had to look for another place. Then, when his children were discharged, he was told he couldn’t have so many people in one room. “After the fire, I thought things would be better, but I don’t know if we were ignored or dismissed or they were incapable,” he said. “Even now we are teaching [the officials] how to be human. When the councillors come and speak with us we have to teach them how to talk to us.” He told the Westminster politicians: “We need you to help us because everybody else has failed. We have no more faith in the local government. We need you to be understanding where we are coming from.” Capturing the feeling of a stunned and visibly emotional audience, Healey said the group had presented some “very hard truths” and what they had said “forcibly reminds us of how much there is left to do”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/dec/18/six-minutes-in-may-how-churchill-unexpectedly-became-prime-minister-review-nicholas-shakespeare","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T09:00:55Z","webTitle":"Six Minutes in May: How Churchill Unexpectedly Became Prime Minister – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/18/six-minutes-in-may-how-churchill-unexpectedly-became-prime-minister-review-nicholas-shakespeare","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/dec/18/six-minutes-in-may-how-churchill-unexpectedly-became-prime-minister-review-nicholas-shakespeare","fields":{"headline":"Six Minutes in May: How Churchill Unexpectedly Became Prime Minister – review","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Hitler died amid the flames of Berlin in April 1945. The most reckless criminal in modern history was no more. So long as “good” Germans are at the helm of Germany today, a Fourth Reich seems unimaginable. Yet Nazism really did happen, and it came close to engulfing Britain. The BBC sitcom Dad’s Army poked fun at the feared German invasion. In one episode, Private Godfrey’s sisters are seen to prepare their Regency cottage for the most charming of guests. “The Germans are coming, Miss Godfrey,” Lance Corporal Jones warns. “Yes, I know, so many people to tea. I think I’d better make some more.” The second world war continues to fascinate young and old alike: how to make a familiar subject new? Several large, one-volume histories have appeared in recent years. Smoothly readable, they present the standard British narrative of the war built round the rise of Hitler and the dictator’s attempts to assert hegemony over Europe. Correspondingly little analysis is made of the Scandinavian theatre of operations, though the Führer’s assault on neutral Norway in 1940 set the stage for the coming “total” war, which claimed the lives of more than 50 million people. Six Minutes in May, by Nicholas Shakespeare, chronicles Churchill’s lightning-quick rise to power following Hitler’s invasion of Norway. Shakespeare, better known as a novelist, has written an absorbing account of how events 1,300 miles away across the North Sea led to the most drastic cabinet reshuffle in modern British history. The odds were stacked against Churchill becoming prime minister. As first lord of the Admiralty he had bungled the Anglo-French operation to counter Hitler’s aggression in Norway. Campaigns that end in failure usually tend to be forgotten very quickly, and the April-May 1940 Norwegian campaign was no exception. The operation’s strategic prize was to cut off the supply of Swedish ore shipped to Germany through Norway; instead, British troops had to be ignominiously evacuated. The episode was considered such a disaster that the Admiralty later mislaid crucial files so as to hide its mistakes from historic records. Churchill’s campaign did, however, help to extricate the Norwegian royal family and much of the gold reserves (for which the Christmas tree in Trafalgar Square each year is a memorial gift). Churchill’s failure to deny Hitler his iron ore meant that Britain faced the real threat of Nazi German invasion. It is also meant, ironically, that Churchill was favoured to take over from Neville Chamberlain as prime minister. The Umbrella Man in pince-nez and wing collar, who had returned from Munich in September 1938 “fluttering a barren sheet of paper”, was reckoned to be too weak for the job. “In the name of God, go!” the Birmingham-born Chamberlain was commanded in the House of Commons on 7 May 1940, a watershed date, after which Chamberlain left office, and presently died. Shakespeare is at pains to rescue Chamberlain’s reputation from Churchill’s revisionist history; far from the feeble prevaricator of legend, Chamberlain was a resolute and quietly humorous man, who had run a sisal plantation in the Bahamas and, as prime minister from 1937-1940, ensured that Britain spent an astonishing 40-50% of its GDP on defence. In Shakespeare’s view, Churchill tried to freeze the “narrow, obstinate man” Chamberlain out of posterity. It was easy to do. Churchill had all the best lines in his four-volume A History of the English-Speaking Peoples, published between 1956 and 1958. If Churchill claimed that Chamberlain was “the most disastrous prime minister in British history”, it must be true. Though indifferently written at times (“Churchill’s star might have sunk to its lowest in eight months, but that of Lloyd George had rocketed over the weekend to astronomical heights”), Shakespeare’s book grips the attention from beginning to end. He conjures the characters and personalities of the senior commanders in the Norwegian campaign with a novelist’s flair and eye for detail. Most memorable are the Earl of Cork and Orrery, a monocle-wearing admiral known to junior officers as “Cork-n-orrible” and Adrian Carton de Wiart VC, who wore a patch after losing an eye during the first world war and was the model for Evelyn Waugh’s Brigadier Ritchie-Hook in the Sword of Honour trilogy. The fjords and ironbound rocks of Norway are memorably evoked. The country that gave us trolls and Peer Gynt also gave us, indirectly, Winston Churchill. • Six Minutes in May by Nicholas Shakespeare is published by Harvill Secker (£20).

A Labour councillor, she had battled to get her voice heard previously and was sceptical about the unexpected decision to promote her. “I felt it’s a bit strange that all of a sudden you are appointing me when you’ve never really listened to what I’ve had to say before,” she said. “I think they chose me because I am the only councillor who lives on that estate. The only reason I did it was for the people of Grenfell. I wouldn’t have found the strength otherwise. I want to be there as a reminder of what happened that night.” She has found the role immensely hard because she is still recovering from the shock of witnessing the fire. She fled from her flat six metres (20ft) from the tower with her two small children in the middle of the night, as debris from the building fell on her balcony. The family remains in temporary accommodation. “I am depressed rather than angry – about the fire and the situation afterwards. It is a taboo to talk about depression, but it’s important. A lot of people on the estate feel depressed. Getting through the day is a challenge. It is difficult to work, to be a mother to the children. I have nightmares and flashbacks,” she said. The shock has affected her whole family; one relative tried to take their own life five days after the fire. “I cry when I go back, thinking about my friends there, looking up and remembering which floors they were on. Emotionally it is raw. I thought I would be stronger at this stage but actually I am worse.” The majority of the council is white, middle-class and over 50, and she has found it hard since her election as a councillor in 2014 to make her voice heard. “We would be laughed at, mocked in the council chamber,” she said. “I felt the attitude was: well, what do you know? It is pretty clear how unrepresented we are.” She remains bitter about the attitude of the council towards residents during the protracted refurbishment of Grenfell Tower, which finished last year. In her role as councillor, she took up a number of concerns from residents. As deputy mayor, she wants to see a culture change that will bring a new focus to the issues raised by the disaster. She has twice tried to move back to her flat but on both occasions her four-year-old son had an allergic reaction and had to be hospitalised. “The people putting the scaffolding up around the tower are wearing protective clothing, but the dust is falling into our flat,” she said. Six months pregnant, she is worried about toxic substances in the dust. “My son gets sick every time I go there – last time he couldn’t breathe. It can’t be a coincidence.” For a while the family was in a hotel, but her children were told off by hotel staff for running around. “We have been in limbo. The council has been very weak – they have made promises that shouldn’t have been made. Too many people are in hotels. The council is overwhelmed with it all.” She had seen fires in the tower before, she said. “But they were nothing like what I saw that night. It was like petrol. It should not have spread like that. I still think about the people I saw that day who I will never see again, people you say hello to for 20 years, you see them every day and then you don’t see them again. I feel so sad. I don’t think I can take any more grief.” Amelia Gentleman Father Alan Everett is the vicar of St Clement’s church, close to Grenfell Tower, which became a focal point for residents and survivors in the aftermath of the fire. He wrote a powerful poem about the community’s anger and anguish. “I hope the service at St Paul’s [on Thursday] will bring a measure of healing, and the high-level representation of the royal family and the government will give people a sense of acknowledgement and solidarity. I hope it will be an important rite of passage. “Six months on, while there are still large numbers of people wanting to be rehoused, and while residents have the daily trauma of seeing Grenfell Tower standing in their midst, it’s impossible to say more than the situation is ongoing. There has to be significant movement on both those fronts before people can move forward psychologically. “I hope in 2018 it will become clearer what is to happen with the tower. The psychological damage it is inflicting on people on a daily basis is so extreme that for it to remain standing is unthinkable. It’s the first thing some people see when pulling up their kitchen blind in the morning; children are walking past it every day on their way to school. It will be a massive relief when it comes down, and then we can take time to decide what to do with the site. “We’re still working out the implications of communal trauma and how it differs from individual trauma and what the cumulative effects are. I’ve been reading about trauma and one thing is clear: if you’re already experiencing difficulties in other areas of your life, then the impact of something like the fire is going to be magnified. We’re going to be living with this for a long time to come.” Harriet Sherwood Lucy Masoud is a firefighter and a senior Fire Brigades Union official. She was first sent to Grenfell Tower the day after the fire and spent every day there for at least a month thereafter. “Firefighters dealt with Grenfell in the best way we could. Our brave men and women who went in there did an absolutely amazing job and I don’t think anyone would ever criticise them. But what we did was all we could do with the equipment and the resources we had. “When you’re dealing with a job in an area where fire cover has been cut by 50%, it would be reasonable to suggest that, had those savage cuts not taken place, we may have been able to save one more person. Not only are we heartbroken but we’re also angry. “There is no other brigade in the UK that could have handled an incident of this size because there is no other brigade that would have had the resources on duty that night. Grenfell was a disaster but, had it happened anywhere other than London, it would have been even worse. “As per usual, when any kind of disaster happens, the prime minister will come out and tell the country how wonderful the emergency services are. But it was that very same government that sat on the frontbench of the House of Commons and cheered when they continued to impose the public sector pay cap.” Kevin Rawlinson Kerry O’Hara lived on the sixth floor of Grenfell Tower. Two months after the fire, she was reunited with her cat Rosey. O’Hara has now been rehoused in the Kensington Row development, two miles from Grenfell. “I’m still upset and angry after six months. I’m sad about my friends that I lost. I’m glad to be in permanent new accommodation, but I feel isolated and lonely. There’s no proper community there, just posh restaurants and bars. So I come back [to North Kensington] as often as I can. “Rosey is completely back to normal. I don’t think she cares as long as she’s warm and fed and I’m there with her. My cat is my life. She’s not just a cat, she’s my baby. “My health is still not good since the fire. My depression’s got worse – I have more bad days than good days. I get some support, but I’d like more. “I’m not really celebrating Christmas this year. I’m just not in the mood. The Salvation Army is putting on a Christmas dinner, but I’m not sure how I can get there. I’m trying to sort out transport. Christmas is going to be grim this year. No one is in the mood for celebration. “I don’t really have any hopes for 2018. It will be a long time before I can put this [the fire] behind me. Some people will never be able to get over what happened.” Harriet Sherwood Sarah Cooper is the headteacher of nearby Oxford Gardens primary school, which lost a current and former pupil in the blaze and opened its doors to affected families. “I heard Grenfell Tower was on fire from someone who works in our school office. She phoned me around 4am and said: ‘It’s really bad, Sarah, it’s really bad.’ I’ll never forget those words. The tower was still smoking when we got here, and there was talk of it collapsing, but we decided this needed to be a safe space if people wanted to bring their children in, so we sent out that message and made breakfast for everyone. “We lost a year 3 boy, Mehdi El Wahabi, and a former pupil, Biruk Haftom. We’ve got 127 children here who were directly impacted because they lost a relative or friend, or they were displaced or witnessed the fire to a horrific level. But Mehdi’s year group have been especially affected. “We decided to have a day where we aren’t saying ‘it’s six months since the fire’, we are saying ‘it’s six months in which together we’ve built strength’. We’re doing prayer flags and the children are drawing pictures of things that have given them strength – their families, their friends. “What happened has changed life and we have to work with that. Naturally it brings up emotions and upsetting thoughts but that is an important part of us learning from day to day, and a way of the people who lost their lives being with us. It’s still very up and down. Six months is not a lot of time. But it is about building something back that is stronger and much more resilient, and making sure the young people here get every chance they can in life and that they’re supported every step of the way.” Susanna Rustin Mahboubeh Jamalvatan, who escaped from the third floor of the tower, is still in temporary accommodation with her two children, both students. She has been sharing a bedroom with her adult daughter for the past six months. “I have no idea how long I will be here for. It has been very difficult for all of us. The families are broken and the council is responsible. What I don’t like is how they keep us in the dark. I’m afraid that their support and help will arrive too late, so by the time that we are rehoused we will be so tired and so shattered. “I don’t want to go back to the area because of the memories. I can’t look at the building. I often think about what happened on the night, how the firefighters were advising people to go back to their flats. I feel so sorry that in such an advanced country, the fire service had to deal with such a fire in a 23-floor building with such poor equipment. They didn’t come and get me out. They were only just starting to arrive when I got out. “I don’t understand why it is taking so long. Kensington and Chelsea council is a very rich council. They can afford to get a flat for me and my children. I know that the housing team cannot work miracles to rehouse everyone at once, we have to give them time and we have to be fair with them, but they aren’t sharing information with the residents, keeping us informed. “It has been very difficult for us all. I feel very bad mentally. We are all very stressed. We can’t see the future. You don’t know what is waiting for you after going through these difficulties. You don’t know if you are finally going to have a normal life. You don’t know if you are going to survive.” Amelia Gentleman Martin Howe is a founding partner at the law firm Howe and Co who specialises in social justice cases. He has been working with survivors and bereaved families from Grenfell since shortly after the fire. “We have been at the frontline, working with highly traumatised people who very often are telling their stories to us for the first time. Their lawyer is often the first person to whom they have spoken in detail about what happened that night. What shines out is the bravery and dignity of the survivors and bereaved families. It is a privilege to try and help. “People break down and are very distraught. It’s not only adults but children who died. We are not counsellors or trauma experts, and listening to the stories of such horrific tragedy has a traumatic effect on us too. I defy anyone not to be deeply moved when listening to the recordings of 999 calls. We have provided counselling services for the lawyers in our firm because they need it. None of us has experienced anything like this before. “The individuals and families we represent want to bear witness for family members and friends who died. They want to make sure their voices are heard loud and clear. There were enough warnings, enough signs along the way. The tenants had spoken up, had made their concerns obvious. Tragically, it seems no one with decision-making power was listening. “As a human rights lawyer, I’m responsible for handling the trust I have been given by 66 survivors and bereaved family members to help to look after their interests in this awful tragedy. I’ll do everything I can to make sure that there’s not a single page left unturned, a single stone not looked under, so that together we get to the truth.” Owen Bowcott"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/12/crystal-palace-watford-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T23:46:00Z","webTitle":"Crystal Palace’s Bakary Sako and James McArthur strike late to stun Watford","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/12/crystal-palace-watford-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/12/crystal-palace-watford-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Crystal Palace’s Bakary Sako and James McArthur strike late to stun Watford","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Now Crystal Palace have hope. How could they not when after spluttering in arrears for almost the entire match, blunted and diminished by an imposing Watford team, they still plucked an improbable win from the jaws of defeat? The din which erupted in the second minute of injury time was a roar to greet the first gasp of air this team have enjoyed above the relegation zone all season. Conviction is flooding back. There were inevitable parallels to be drawn with the post-match mood after Saturday’s fluffed late penalty and Roy Hodgson was rightly still preaching caution as he considered what is to come following a six-match unbeaten run. But, as the manager put it, “it’s gone from sadness to euphoria” within a few tense days. A team who had started the season by granting all-comers a seven-match start, and are still to register a goal on their travels since April, are fourth from bottom for now at least. The outpouring of emotion at the end owed much to the unlikely nature of this latest comeback. Watford had been superb throughout a one-sided first half. Every second ball was theirs, every set piece viciously delivered. Richarlison ran riot, spreading panic across Palace’s backline whenever he marauded forward. He set up the opener, nodded home by an unmarked Daryl Janmaat, and squared for Troy Deeney to score a second only for the captain to skew the simplest of chances wide, distracted by Scott Dann’s faint touch. Yet it hardly seemed to matter. While Watford’s discipline remained, markers swarming all over Wilfried Zaha whenever he collected his possession, their grip on the game was like a vice. Tom Cleverley’s dismissal six minutes from time for two fouls loosened the stranglehold and would transform the match. Zaha had cut an enraged figure up to then, distracted in a constant whinge at the officials as Adrian Mariappa or Christian Kabasele snapped at his heels. The referee had taken Dann to one side to warn the Palace captain his team’s talisman was talking his way into the book. Yet as the second half ran its course, the striker hoisted himself out of his sulk and became a man possessed. Thrust back into his favoured role on the flank, it was Zaha who cut inside to forced Heurelho Gomes to push out a fizzed low shot. The goalkeeper recovered to block the follow-up from Bakary Sako but was unable to keep out the substitute’s second attempt. Three of Palace’s four shots on target came in that one incident. The fourth was reserved for stoppage time. Zaha, suddenly liberated from his markers with Watford unnerved, tore at Janmaat, dizzying the Dutchman before reaching the by-line. The cut-back was accurate and converted emphatically by another replacement, James McArthur. The celebrations betrayed a team who had barely believed this was possible, despite the late recent salvation of points against West Ham and Stoke City. Hodgson, who has organised and eked points from a team who had appeared forlorn when he arrived, could not have scripted this more outlandishly, other than to have Christian Benteke, the scoreless striker who had missed that late penalty against Bournemouth, come up with the winner. “But he still did something quite incredible in the last minute, chasing a ball down back to Gomes and forcing him into a poor kick out of play, which effectively killed the game for us,” said the manager. “When you’re a coach, those little moments mean a lot. It gives you a bit of pleasure.” For his opposite number, there was no such consolation. Marco Silva, relegated with Hull on his last visit here, had been mugged this time round and was left to curse the profligacy that undermined Watford’s dominance. Julian Speroni had marked his 400th Palace appearance with a smart save with his legs to deny Richarlison. At the time, it did not seem an overly significant a moment, only for a familiar late capitulation to cost Silva’s side. No team have as many red cards since the start of last season. Just as at Everton, where they had led by two, they were overrun at the last. “But it’s not because of Tom we lost this game,” Silva said. “At this level you have to kill the game off when you can.” The ludicrous nature of the finale had left him numbed. Zaha, cupping his ears in front of the away fans, had enjoyed the last laugh."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/12/burnley-stoke-city-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T00:05:00Z","webTitle":"Ashley Barnes’ late goal against Stoke sends Burnley soaring into top four","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/12/burnley-stoke-city-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/12/burnley-stoke-city-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Ashley Barnes’ late goal against Stoke sends Burnley soaring into top four","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ashley Barnes grabbed a late winner to send Burnley soaring into fourth place, the team’s highest position in the top flight for 42 years, when they were second in the old First Division in March 1975. Burnley, on 31 points, are now behind only Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City and above Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur, for 24 hour at least. The manager, Sean Dyche, though, was keeping his feet firmly on the ground before Saturday’s game at Brighton &amp; Hove Albion and chose to joke about the team’s position. “It’s just slightly less than 43 years,” he said. “I’m proud of it. The proudest man in Proudsville. I’m proud of all of it. It’s about the next game. Football is about realities but also about dreams. It’s a tough task for us winning games at this level but Leicester blew the roof off dreams in football [by becoming champions in 2016] – there’s no bold statement from me on that. We’re having a real go at what we can achieve this season.” The defeat for Stoke, who remain in 15th place, piles more pressure on Mark Hughes, who was booed by his owns fans near the end after taking off Xherdan Shaqiri for Eric Choupo-Mouting. The manager acknowledged the unrest. “There’s a little bit of dissent, we understand it,” he said. “It’s been there a number of months, you only keep it down if you win football matches. That’s the only way to keep the noise down. The message to the players is: ‘Give me that every time we play and we’ll be fine.’” Looking ahead to Saturday’s home match against West Ham, the manager added: “We have to stick our chests out and get some points. I’m looking forward to the weekend already because I think you’ll see more of the same.” For this game Dyche picked an unchanged side from the 1-0 win over Watford. Hughes, though, reacted to the 5-1 defeat by Tottenham by making three changes, with Ramadan Sobhi, Peter Crouch and Geoff Cameron coming in for Thomas Edwards, Kevin Wimmer, and Choupo-Mouting. Inside three minutes Crouch might have given Stoke the lead. Sobhi drifted in from the left and crossed, James Tarkowski flapped, and Nick Pope had to beat the danger away via his left-hand post with Crouch ready to pounce. This was sloppy from the Clarets, who were soon caught out again. Shaqiri swung in a corner from the left and as Burnley ball-watched Kurt Zouma had time to volley but his effort was straight at Pope, who gathered the ball. Gradually, Dyche’s men settled and started to enjoy more possession and just before the half hour won their first corner. Johann Berg Gudmundsson took it from the left, but Stoke’s Joe Allen intervened before the ball could reach Steven Defour. It was drab fare and would not have impressed the England manager Gareth Southgate, perhaps present to run the rule over Stoke’s goalkeeper Jack Butland and Jack Cork of Burnley. After Stoke camped near Pope’s goal for a period, it was Burnley’s turn to attack and win a rare free-kick. Gudmundsson took it and picked out Tarkowski, whose header yielded a corner. Again, though, there was disappointment as Gudmundsson’s delivery went awry. Now came the move of the half. Defour turned Stoke’s defence with an inside pass for the onrushing left-back Stephen Ward but though his cross was in the right area, Chris Wood failed to connect. The second half began in near freezing temperatures and with Burnley probing Stoke’s left flank. But too often the ball was hoofed skywards in hope, with little craft involved. There had also been far too many errors. A spritely Burnley attack foundered when Scott Arfield ceded the ball too easily, drawing disappointed “oohs” from the home crowd. Kevin Long then slipped to allow Stoke’s Darren Fletcher a run down the left but the defender recovered to snuff out the danger. Zouma tweaked a hamstring and had to be replaced by Wimmer – “he’ll miss games,” Hughes said – then Dyche brought on Barnes for Jeff Hendrick. It proved to be a masterstroke and with time running out, Barnes took a return pass from Arfield and fired the winner past Butland."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/13/newtown-sandy-hook-shooting-victims-five-years-later","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T07:00:25Z","webTitle":"Five years after Sandy Hook: families keep the memory of lost children alive","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/13/newtown-sandy-hook-shooting-victims-five-years-later","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/13/newtown-sandy-hook-shooting-victims-five-years-later","fields":{"headline":"Remembering the 26: how families honor Sandy Hook victims five years later","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"School safety campaigns. An animal sanctuary. A children’s book. Support for mental health reform. A lawsuit against the manufacturer of a military-style rifle. In the five years since the mass shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school, the families of the 20 children and six educators killed have taken very different paths to honor the lives of their loved ones. Some family members have chosen to remain intensely private. Others have become prominent advocates for gun violence prevention. No single campaign represents all 26 families. The continuing lawsuit against the manufacturer, distributor and dealer of the AR-15-style rifle used in the shooting, for example, was brought by the families of only nine Sandy Hook victims and one survivor. Here, drawn from the joint website for the Sandy Hook victims’ families, is a brief look at how each family has asked to remember and honor those who died. Charlotte Helen Bacon, age six “Smart, funny, curious, messy, in-intimidated, and adventurous,” her family wrote, describing six-year-old Charlotte. “We like to use the word BOLD.” A foundation in Charlotte’s honor supports a therapy dog program, a scholarship for students studying to become veterinarians, and a grant to help couples grieving the death of a child. Together with an award-winning children’s book author, her parents co-wrote a picture book, Good Dogs, Great Listeners, which tells the story of Charlotte and her dog, Lily. Charlotte’s brother also wrote a book about his experience with therapy dogs after his sister’s death, called The Dogs of Newtown. Daniel Barden, age seven Seven-year-old Daniel was unusually compassionate, always concerned that the people around him were happy and safe. He used to sit next to a special needs girl in his class to “make sure she was OK”, and when she would lose her glasses, Daniel would find them. The “What Would Daniel Do?” campaign encourages other people to follow Daniel’s legacy of kindness. His parents have been outspoken about participating in a lawsuit against a gun manufacturer, focused on the “irresponsible” militaristic advertising for AR-15-style guns sold to civilians. Mark Barden, his father, is one of the founders of Sandy Hook Promise, a nonprofit that advocates for mental health reform, certain gun laws, and a violence prevention program that trains students and adults to “Know the Signs” of someone at-risk of violence. Olivia Rose Engel, age six Olivia loved swimming and soccer and dancing in a pink tutu, singing and art projects and math. At dinner, she led her family in saying grace, and she was proud of her role as a big sister and her participation in an educational program at her parish church. To honor Olivia’s “zest for life”, her family has raised money for Newtown Park &amp; Bark, a group that supports a local off-leash dog park. The organization has a page that honors Olivia’s joy, with photographs of happy dogs and messages about them. Olivia’s family also created a web site in her honor. Josephine Gay, age seven Seven-year-old Josephine, known as “Joey”, was the “girly-est” of her sisters, and she adored her older siblings, the family wrote in a recent article in the Newtown Bee. Fun-loving and affectionate, Joey had worked hard to “meet the milestones that came so easily to her older sisters,” after being diagnosed with autism, global apraxia and apraxia of speech. Her family wrote that she had found love and support in Newtown: “Her classmates eagerly learned sign language and encouraged and included her whenever they could.” Her family has raised money for Joey’s Fund, which supports families in New England who need resources to help family members with autism. Her mother, Michele Gay, is also one of the founders of Safe and Sound Schools, an organization that promotes improved school security. Ana Grace Marquez-Greene, age six A budding musician, six-year-old Ana Grace had a “gift for melody, pitch and rhythm” that stood out even in a musical family, as her father put it. “She never walked anywhere - her mode of transportation was dance. She dance from room to room and place to place.” The Ana Grace Project supports arts education and has worked with schools to implement a “Love Wins” curriculum, which supports a stronger social and emotional environment for students and staff. Recognizing that the counseling resources available to Newtown residents after the shooting are not available to every community dealing with violence, the organization has also worked to bring professional development in counseling and trauma-informed care to other communities that need them. Her father, prominent Jazz saxophonist Jimmy Greene, released a tribute album, “Beautiful Life”, in 2014. Her mother, Nelba Marquez-Greene, writes frequently on social media about grief, activism, and how political developments affect survivors of violence. Dylan Hockley, age six A photograph of British-born Dylan in a Superman t-shirt has become one of the icons of the fight to pass tougher gun laws in America. Dylan, his family wrote, adored chocolate and cuddling and bouncing on trampolines. He was sensitive to loud noises and loved routine. He wanted to play with other kids so much, they wrote, “even though he didn’t always know how”. The Dylan’s Wings of Change Foundation benefits children with autism and other special needs. His mother, Nicole Hockley, is one of the founders and managing directors of Sandy Hook Promise. His parents have been outspoken about their participation in a lawsuit against the manufacturer, distributor and dealer of the military-style weapon used in the Sandy Hook shooting. Madeleine F Hsu, age six Her family described Madeleine as a “a petite princess with a big personality”, always ready to jump into surf at the beach, plunge into the pool, or ride her bike without training wheels as soon as they had been taken off. “Once you set your mind to do something,” her family wrote of her, “it was as good as done.” Catherine Violet Hubbard, age six Catherine, with her red hair and freckles, loved animals so much she made her own business cards for “Catherine’s Animal Shelter”, her family wrote. Her title: Care Taker. “Tell your friends I am kind,” she would whisper to animals when she played with them. Catherine’s family is building an animal sanctuary in her honor on 34 acres of Connecticut farmland. The sanctuary already hosts events, and individuals and groups can donate to support the sanctuary or volunteer their time – for instance, building garden beds or clearing out invasive plants. Chase Kowalski, age seven Chase had already been an enthusiastic athlete and competitor for years. He began running competitively at age two, his family wrote. “At age 6, Chase asked to be entered into his first triathlon – in his first ever competition, he took on the field and won his age group!” The CMAK Foundation supports programs for physical and emotional well-being for kids and their families, including Race4Chase, a kids’ triathlon program. Jesse Lewis, age six The quintessential image of Jesse, his family wrote, is him in boots with no socks, ripped jeans, an army helmet on his head, and dirt smudged on his cheek as he marched through a field from one adventure to another. When he and his classmates were targeted on December 14, his family wrote, “Jesse used his last few minutes on earth yelling to his friends to run, saving many lives.” The Jesse Lewis Choose Love Movement supports a social and emotional learning program for teachers and students. Jesse’s mother Scarlett Lewis has spoken publicly about the importance of this kind of learning in children’s lives – as well as the importance of forgiveness. James Radley Mattioli, age six James was “all boy”, his family wrote, always wrestling with his father, jumping off tall objects, and moving through the world with boundless energy. He loved his sister and learning from her. He had also developed a “keen interest” in math. His family asked that donations to support the programs that brought him joy should be sent to: The James R Mattioli Memorial Fund C/O Newtown Savings Bank; 39 Main Street Newtown, CT 06470. Grace McDonnell, age seven Grace had been taking art classes since she was three years old, and showed early talent. “She saw beauty in everything and was fortunate to have found her passion early in life,” her family wrote. Through the Grace McDonnell Memorial Fund, her family wrote, they hoped to support young artists and youth art programs. Emilie Parker, age six Emilie loved visiting the craft store, and her family constantly found “beads, bits of paper, colored cotton balls – or anything else Emilie thought she could use to create art – all over the house.” Her family shared a photograph of her next to a canvas with a palette of paints, wearing an enormous t-shirt as an artist’s smock. The Emilie Parker Art Connection supports art programs. Alissa Parker, her mother, has written a book, An Unseen Angel, about a “faith-filled, spiritual path” to coping, healing and forgiving in the wake of tragedy. She is also one of the founders of Safe and Sound Schools. Jack Pinto, age six Jack had a huge smile and a love for mischief. He loved playing sports and, “most of all,” being with his big brother. To honor his memory, his family has supported Kids in the Game, an organization that provides funds for athletic programs for kids and schools that could not otherwise afford them. Noah Pozner, age six Noah loved playing deep imaginative games with his Legos and superhero toys. He went to school in a Batman shirt and Spider-Man shoes, listening to Gangnam Style, one of Noah’s favorite songs, on the way. His twin sister, Arielle, survived the shooting. In the wake of the shooting, Noah’s father, Lenny Pozner, founded the Honr Network, a group that works to combat the conspiracy theorists who claim the Sandy Hook shooting is a hoax and that grieving family members are “crisis actors”. The Honr Network coordinates volunteers to monitor and take down hoaxer posts and videos. Working with tech companies like Google on this effort has been an uphill battle, one that has made Pozner himself the target of intense harassment. A Florida woman was sentenced to five months in prison earlier this year for making threats against him. Caroline Previdi, age six Caroline was “joyful”, a lover of art and dance. Before Christmas one year, she brought her piggy bank to her parents and asked to donate all of her savings to their church to make sure the every kid would have a present under their Christmas trees. At her funeral, some mourners wore pink, her favorite color, to honor her, the New Haven Register reported. The Caroline Previdi Foundation provides support for kids without financial resources to engage in extracurricular activities. Jessica Rekos, age six As well as horseback riding, Jessica spent hours watching the Free Willy movies and taking notes on orcas, her family wrote. “Mom, I just want to be friends with an Orca,” she once said. Her family wrote, she “was always planning, asking questions, and figuring out the details”. They called her “our little CEO”. The Jessica Rekos Foundation supports horseback riding scholarships and research and internships on orca and whale conservation. Avielle Richman, age six Avielle had a “spitfire personality”, her family wrote. She was often barefoot. Asked what she wanted to be, she replied that she would like to be an artist ... and a spy ... and a fairy princess ... and a writer. She loved to name things: the maple trees next to her house were “Efford and Maeve”. The Avielle Foundation supports “neuroscience research aimed at understanding the brain’s chemistry, structure, and circuits that lead to violence and compassion”, as well as community education and outreach about neuroscience research and its findings, and how to promote brain health. Benjamin Wheeler, age six Ben was full of urgent questions that he wanted answered at once. He demanded attention. He loved lighthouses and “dreamed of being an architect, a paleontologist and a lighthouse keeper all at once”. Ben’s Lighthouse, a community organization in Newtown, was founded to support Newtown youth over the long term as they dealt with the aftermath of the violence at Sandy Hook. Allison N Wyatt, age six Allison lined the walls of her home with rows of pictures she had drawn, and she loved drawing for people she cared about, from friends and relatives to her school bus driver. Her family wrote that they had found a final picture Allie had drawn for her first grade teacher, Victoria Soto, who was also killed in the shooting. It had a message: “I love you, Love Allie.” The Allison Wyatt Memorial Fund has donated to St Jude Children’s Research Hospital, the Ronald McDonald House Charities and International Child Art Foundation. Rachel Davino, age 29 A behavioral specialist, Rachel had “a clear focus on helping adults and children with autism”, her family wrote, and she had just completed the requirements to become a board certified behavioral analyst. Her soon-to be-fiance Tony Cerritelli had just asked her family for permission to marry her, and they were planning to become engaged on Christmas Eve. Rachel was working on a family collection of Italian recipes for a family cookbook, and she loved karate, photography, cooking and baking. At a celebration honoring her life, she was compared to The Giving Tree, a Shel Silverstein book about selflessness. Her friends and family made plans to walk and raise money for Autism Speaks to honor her life. Dawn Hochsprung, age 47 Sandy Hook’s school principal was “strong, confident, inspiring and compassionate”, her family wrote. She balanced raising her two daughters with her own continuing education, always keeping in touch with her children as she moved from one meeting to another. “Dawn died as she lived: always in control, handling whatever came her way,” her family wrote. Erica Lafferty, one of her daughters, spoke about her mother at the Democratic National Convention in 2016 in support of Hillary Clinton and her commitment to gun violence prevention. She is now a program manager at Everytown for Gun Safety, major a gun violence prevention advocacy group. Anne Marie Murphy, age 52 When the shooting happened, Anne Marie Murphy, a classroom aide, wrapped a child in her arms, protecting him. Both she and the child were killed. “Thank you for respecting our privacy,” her family wrote. Lauren Rousseau, age 30 Sensitive and focused, Lauren had worked multiple jobs, including as a substitute, on her way to getting a job as a teacher. Her family set up two scholarships in her name to support future educators: The Lauren Rousseau Memorial Scholarship, Danbury High School Scholarship Fund, 43 Clapboard Ridge Rd, Danbury, CT 06811; and the Lauren Rousseau Memorial Scholarship/University of Bridgeport Graduate School of Education, 126 Park Ave, Bridgeport, CT 06604. Members of her family traveled to Washington last week to press for tougher gun laws. Mary Sherlach, age 56 Mary’s Fund honors her work as the Sandy Hook school psychologist. It provides access to mental healthcare for Connecticut residents who might not otherwise be able to get it. Her husband, Bill Sherlach, is also part of Sandy Hook Promise, and has spoken out about the importance of the lawsuit he joined against an AR-15 manufacturer. Victoria Soto, age 27 Victoria, a teacher, was “living her dream teaching first grade”, her family wrote. She lived at home with her siblings and her dog, Roxie. The Victoria Soto Memorial supports scholarships for future teachers and other educational endeavors."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/dec/12/westfield-sale-amazon-shopping-centres","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T19:32:53Z","webTitle":"Westfield sale looks like a knee-jerk reaction to the Amazon age | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/dec/12/westfield-sale-amazon-shopping-centres","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/dec/12/westfield-sale-amazon-shopping-centres","fields":{"headline":"Westfield sale looks like a kneejerk reaction to the Amazon age","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The crisis of confidence among owners of large shopping centres is contagious. Last week it was Hammerson, the Birmingham Bullring folk, bidding for Intu, owner of Gateshead’s Metrocentre. Now, on grander scale, French giant Unibail-Rodamco is paying $25bn (£18.5bn) to own Westfield, the Australian outfit that has erected its multistorey car parks, with malls attached, in east and west London. The new duo claimed “compelling” rationale for the deal but never quite got round to saying what it’s supposed to be. It can’t be the cost savings since they are tiny in the context of a company that will own €61bn-worth of assets. The savings are worth just €100m, of which only €60m is attributed to eliminating “corporate overheads”, which presumably means closing Westfield’s Australian office. Instead, the impetus for this deal seems to be the idea that greater size offers better protection from the rise of online shopping. The new firm will certainly be big. Unibail brings 69 shopping centres in Europe, including Forum des Halles in Paris. Westfield, aside from the two London sites, has interests in 33 centres in the US. At the margin, maybe size helps. An international fashion brand seeking shops across Europe and the US could save time and hassle by making a single call to the Unibail/Westfield combo. In the end, though, property is always local. It’s hard to understand why painting the “world famous Westfield brand” on the Unibail centres is supposed to pull in more punters. Even the two London Westfields feel very different. The calculation, then, is that investment risk in the age of Amazon is best spread across a broader portfolio of properties. That’s not so silly from the point of view of Sir Frank Lowy, Westfield’s 87-year-old founder, who regards Unibail as “the natural home” for the business he built. But a compelling logic? The rush to consolidate looks more like a defensive kneejerk reaction. Trump can’t cloud climate change progress When Donald Trump began the process of pulling the US out of the Paris agreement on climate change in June, a few optimists suggested there might be a silver lining to his damaging action. The rest of the world might be so appalled that it would show greater unity. The good news, to judge by three developments this week in the financial world, is that there are reasons to be cheerful. First, the World Bank said it will no longer finance upstream oil and gas projects after 2019; the only exceptions will be in the poorest countries where other sources are energy are hard to secure. Second, Bank of England governor Mark Carney announced that an initiative to push companies to reveal their direct and indirect exposures to global warming is gaining traction. The UK’s big six banks have signed up and are committed to saying how much they have lent to companies that pose the biggest risks to the climate. Eight out of 10 of the largest asset managers and insurance companies are also part of the effort and say they are committed to financing a lower-carbon global economy. Third, US oil giant ExxonMobil has finally agreed to bow to its shareholders’ wishes and reveal data on how governments’ actions to limit the increase in global temperatures will affect its business. We await details, but at least Exxon, after years of resistance, has accepted that it must publish. These are all small steps – and, note, greater disclosure of risks is not the same as mitigating actions. But they are welcome signs. So is the fact that, while there was no official US presence at the Paris summit at which Carney spoke, there were plenty of American non-government organisations and city mayors. Trump’s lead, it seems, is being rightly ignored. H/2 must spell out where it stands H/2 Capital Partners, when it takes ownership of Four Seasons, the UK’s largest care homes operator, must open up and tell us what it stands for. The reticent style was vaguely understandable while H/2 was buying up Four Seasons’ debt at a discount to face value. But, when it claims control of the business from current owner Terra Firma, the US hedge fund will be responsible for the care of 17,000 elderly people who will want to know that it brings more to the industry than a keen eye for property values. Spencer Haber, H/2’s founder, apparently likes cats, dogs and toucans (he produced a film about the latter). It’s not much to go on, and there’s no point checking the corporate website for past deals because there isn’t one. Bland statements about bringing “responsible private capital” are not enough. Who are you, and what’s your track record in the US?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/12/brexit-debate-how-many-mps-does-take-fill-eight-hours-dead-air","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T19:31:44Z","webTitle":"Brexit debate: how many MPs does it take to fill eight hours of dead air?  | John Crace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/12/brexit-debate-how-many-mps-does-take-fill-eight-hours-dead-air","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/12/brexit-debate-how-many-mps-does-take-fill-eight-hours-dead-air","fields":{"headline":"Brexit debate: how many MPs does it take to fill eight hours of dead air?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Brexit can often have the air of a tired TV game show in the Commons. One hosted for the most part by children’s TV presenters who are well past their sell-by date. On Monday, we were treated to the prime minister dropping by to update the house on what had already been decided elsewhere. Everyone was just going through the motions. The best that could be said for it was that it made for a rather nauseating spectacle as Tory MPs, who had spent months briefing against Theresa May, fell over themselves to praise her brilliance. Tuesday was another case in point, with parliament debating day six of the committee stage of the EU withdrawal bill. Barely 30 Conservative MPs bothered to make the effort to turn up. Not because they didn’t care about Brexit but because there was no need. The session was to be an eight-hour charade. A mere formality as the government had long since made trifling concessions to stave off any rebellion from its own side. The votes were in the bag. The opposition benches were rather fuller. In Westminster, there’s no such thing as dead air. If there are eight hours to fill, there’s never any shortage of MPs to fill them. Even if they know they are by and large wasting their time, there’s always the hope of landing a few glancing blows. Labour’s Chris Leslie began the session by observing that the government didn’t appear to have thought through the constitutional implications of its so-called Henry VIII powers, which would allow it to pass primary legislation by statutory instruments. The country had not voted to take back control from the EU only to let the British government do whatever it felt like without the need to consult parliament. The Brexit minister, Steve Baker, could not bring himself to look up from the files he was colouring in with highlighter pens. Neither he nor the government cared about what the country thought it had voted for. There was a chance of a land grab and it would be stupid not to take it. They had had to square off a few bleeding hearts in their own ranks by agreeing to the formation of a sifting committee. But as the committee would be top loaded with Tory MPs, it could be relied on to do whatever the government wanted. “You ought to be embarrassed by the extent of the powers being appropriated,” Leslie continued. “The government is even allowing itself to amend the act itself by secondary legislation.” Several Tory MPs smirked. They weren’t in the slightest bit embarrassed by this. Anything to make Brexit less accountable to parliament could only be good. The Conservative opening remarks in the debate were entrusted to Oliver Letwin. A curious choice. He has the reputation for being one of the brightest people in parliament but frequently goes out of his way to appear one of the dimmest. He is also unquestionably one of the most trusting and gullible. A true naïf, Westminster’s very own idiot savant. There was no need for anyone to be concerned because everything was for the best in the best of all possible worlds, he insisted. He was well aware that the government had over-reached itself in clause 393... “It’s clause 397,” Leslie interrupted. “Of course, yes, clause 397. I got the number wrong,” Letwin conceded. He definitely knew what he was talking about even when he didn’t. Where was he? Oh yes, the government may have over-reached itself, but everything would be fine because the government had promised him it wouldn’t use the powers it was going out of its way to give itself and he believed it could be trusted. There was a moment’s pause as everyone absorbed Letwin’s flawed logic. Having gone out of his way to point out that being stupid was no bar to being the Brexit secretary, David Davis had then set out to prove it by first contradicting himself within 24 hours and then letting slip that he considered the first stage of the Brexit negotiations to be barely worth the paper they were written on. The government could not have done more over the past few days to underline just how untrustworthy it wanted to be considered. Or creatively ambiguous as it preferred to call it. Labour’s Mary Creagh then asked about environmental protections. Letwin threw his arms in the air. No one loved the environment more than Michael Gove. The country was lucky to have an environment minister who cared so much. Mikey had watched every episode of Blue Planet and sobbed when the dolphin got caught in a net. He had even asked the prime minister to appoint a couple of otters to cabinet. On the basis they couldn’t do any worse than the current lot. So no environmental protections would be diminished on his watch. Letwin trusted Mikey. Just like he trusted everyone. So it went on. Labour continued to raise doubts while the Tories promised to be trustworthy. It was all much ado about nothing. Though on the plus side, Baker got to finish his colouring.

He was 29 when he went to be the director of the Shakespeare Festival Theatre and transformed it into a resident ensemble, persuading the Arts Council to let his new Royal Shakespeare Company have a base in London. There, he pursued a revolutionary policy of presenting the work of living writers like Harold Pinter, John Whiting and David Mercer on the same main stage – and with the exact same status – as that of the dead. On any night in his theatres you could see Vanessa Redgrave and Judi Dench and Paul Scofield and Peggy Ashcroft and Ian Holm, while he also produced some of Peter Brook’s greatest work as a director. When he moved the National Theatre from the Old Vic to the South Bank in 1976, he welcomed every one of us who wanted theatre not just to reflect society, but also to represent it. By the time he left in 1988, Peter had turned what had seemed a shaky and expensive venture, beset with fierce enemies from Fleet Street to Downing Street, into an institution that not even the most malign government would dare to close down. It was typical of Peter that he insisted the doors and lobbies of the National Theatre be open all day, because he wanted everyone else to enjoy the art and culture that had transformed his own life. If you now see tens of thousands of people enjoying the river between Tate Modern and County Hall, remember the open-door initiative began with him. The most musical of directors, in his spare time he managed casually to be artistic director at Glyndebourne, where he directed operas by Mozart and Benjamin Britten better than anyone else in his lifetime. For someone who worked in public for so many years, he was a curiously private man, with a much stronger idea of loyalty than friendship. In spite of publishing carefully edited diaries, self-revelation was not his thing. In 40 years I had only one conversation with him that you could call intimate. With four wives and six children, no one was ever going to call Peter solitary. But the man who reshaped an entire industry and fought so hard for the principle of state subsidy would flee parties, preferring to go home and play the piano. The theatre we inherit is largely his. If you dislike the British theatre as it’s currently arranged, then you will blame Peter Hall. But if you approve of it, and of its values, then you are never going to be able to thank him enough for the courage and foresight he showed in creating the stages, the financing and the structures that have enabled countless actors, writers, designers and directors to do their very best work. We owe him everything."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/14/maryam-saleh-maurice-louca-tamer-abu-ghazaleh-lekhfa-review-remarkable-egyptian-indie-collaboration-is-a-triumph","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T18:15:02Z","webTitle":"Maryam Saleh, Maurice Louca, Tamer Abu Ghazaleh: Lekhfa review – remarkable Egyptian indie collaboration is a triumph","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/14/maryam-saleh-maurice-louca-tamer-abu-ghazaleh-lekhfa-review-remarkable-egyptian-indie-collaboration-is-a-triumph","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/14/maryam-saleh-maurice-louca-tamer-abu-ghazaleh-lekhfa-review-remarkable-egyptian-indie-collaboration-is-a-triumph","fields":{"headline":"Maryam Saleh, Maurice Louca, Tamer Abu Ghazaleh: Lekhfa review – remarkable Egyptian indie collaboration is a triumph","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s not easy being an experimental indie musician in Egypt. There are very few venues, no state funding, and censors to worry about. All of which makes this compelling, brooding collaboration so remarkable.

The influences include Egyptian shaabi, electro-shaabi, pop and psychedelia, with backing provided by anything from oud and buzuq lute to slide guitars, drums, beat loops and electronica. The result is an intriguing, distinctive style that veers between off-kilter dance passages to such songs as Mathaf Fonoun El Ghesh, a contemplation on truth and deception that sounds like the soundtrack to some gently exhilarating nightmare.

Neonicotinoids were banned from use on flowering crops in the European Union in 2013 due to the harm they cause to bees and other vital pollinators. Following even more evidence of harm, an EU vote to extend the ban to all outdoor uses is expected soon. However, evidence is also growing that neonicotinoids – the world’s most widely used insecticide – harm other species, such as songbirds. Neonicotinoids have been in use since the early 1990s and now contaminate landscapes around the world. But very little monitoring of their concentration in soils or water is done, a failing recently condemned by a UK government chief scientific adviser. The first systematic testing of neonicotinoids in rivers in Britain was mandated by EU water regulations and conducted in 2016. The results, obtained by the conservation charity Buglife, show that half of the 16 rivers tested in England had either chronic or acute levels of contamination. Of the 23 rivers tested across Britain, neonicotinoids were not detected in six. No official limits exist in the EU for neonicotinoid pollution in freshwater. But a peer-reviewed scientific analysis published in 2015 recommended chronic and acute levels that should not be exceeded “to avoid lasting effects on aquatic invertebrate communities”, and these were used by Buglife to asses the new river data. Like flying insects, aquatic insects are vulnerable to neonicotinoids and provide the main source of food for many fish and birds. Recent research in the Netherlands has shown chronic neonicotinoid pollution in water led to sharp drops in insect numbers and was linked to heavy falls in bird numbers. “We are devastated to discover that many British rivers have been heavily damaged by neonicotinoid insecticides,” said Matt Shardlow, CEO of Buglife. Mark Lloyd, CEO of the Angling Trust, said: “These results are highly alarming in the context of widespread declines in aquatic insect life and fish populations. We urge the government to act urgently to ban continued use of these chemicals to protect wildlife, fisheries and drinking water.” The most polluted river tested was the river Waveney on the Norfolk/Suffolk Border, where the acute harm level was exceeded for a whole month in the summer of 2016. Sugar beet fields are the most likely source of pollution, said Shardlow. The nearby river Wensum, in a Special Area of Conservation for its river life, was also chronically polluted. Both rivers supply the Norfolk Broads, an internationally important wetland site and home to many endangered aquatic animals. The proposed EU ban would still allow neonicotinoids to be used in greenhouses and as a flea treatment for pets. A new Greenpeace study suggests neonicotinoids are frequently found in waterways close to greenhouses where they have been used. The new tests found contamination in a stream in the Cairngorms, which Shardlow said is most likely the result of a treated dog entering the stream. “It is vital that action is taken to completely ban these toxins, including in greenhouses and on pets, before another year of disgraceful pollution occurs,” he said. Arlin Rickard, CEO of the Rivers Trust, said: “We work closely with farmers and growers to reduce and better target chemical and fertiliser usage, however some chemicals are just too damaging and persistent to be tolerated.” A spokesman for the National Farmers Union said: “British farmers take their environmental responsibilities seriously and have high levels of pesticide stewardship through schemes like the Voluntary Initiative, which offer advice and actions designed to keep pesticides out of water. The Environment Agency closely monitors pesticides in rivers and we are not aware of it raising any specific concerns about high levels of neonicotinoids.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/12/mike-campbell-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T18:19:03Z","webTitle":"Mike Campbell obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/12/mike-campbell-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/12/mike-campbell-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Mike Campbell obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My friend Mike Campbell, who has died of cancer aged 68, was a creative force in skills and economic development policies. He was convinced that skills are the key to productivity and social mobility. In recent years he had applied his ideas through the Sector Skills Development Agency (2002-06) and the UK Commission for Employment and Skills (2007-11). At UKCES he was director of research and policy and advised the government. A proponent of lifelong learning and convinced that employers should take responsibility for investing in training, he helped UKCES make a real impact by involving employers and academics in policy formulation. Mike was a member of many influential bodies, undertook assignments in South Africa, Sri Lanka, Australia, Japan and Europe, and addressed Unesco, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the International Labour Organisation and the World Bank. He was an excellent speaker – humorous and compelling. His ideas were also disseminated through books and reports including Ambition 2020: World Class Skills and Jobs for the UK (2009), More Jobs, Better Cities (2013) and Job Generation for a Jobless Generation (2015). He was born in Birkenhead, to Phyliss (nee Conn), a PA to the chief executive of Wirral council, and Patrick Campbell, a Nupe official at Arrowe Park hospital. Mike was educated at St Anselm’s grammar school in the town, then studied economics and geography at Sheffield University, going on to take master’s degrees at Lancaster and Leeds. He was appointed as a lecturer at Leeds Polytechnic (now Leeds Beckett University) in 1972 and became professor of economics and public policy from 1988 until 2002. Appointed OBE for services to economic development in 2004, he was an honorary fellow at the Institute for Employment Studies and a visiting professor at Durham and Hiroshima universities. When national policy ambition narrowed, he became an independent consultant, working for the Local Economic Partnership in Leeds and for non-governmental agencies such as the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust. Away from work, he treasured his family life, especially the annual holiday in Cornwall. He was a loyal supporter of Blackpool FC and a cricket fanatic; he was a long-time opener for his club, Romany, which is based in Leeds. Our days at Test matches, with the chill-bag hiding some decent red wine, were highlights of the year. He is survived by his wife, Janie Percy-Smith, whom he met at Leeds in the 1980s and married in 2010, and their daughters, Christina and Rosa."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/13/make-facebook-liable-for-content-says-report-on-uk-election-intimidation","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T00:01:04Z","webTitle":"Make Facebook liable for content, says report on UK election intimidation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/13/make-facebook-liable-for-content-says-report-on-uk-election-intimidation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/13/make-facebook-liable-for-content-says-report-on-uk-election-intimidation","fields":{"headline":"Make Facebook liable for content, says report on UK election intimidation","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Theresa May should consider the introduction of two new laws to deter the intimidation of MPs during elections and force social media firms to monitor illegal content, an influential committee has said. The independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which advises the prime minister on ethics, has called for the introduction within a year of a new specific offence in electoral law to halt widespread abuse when voters go to the polls. The watchdog will recommend another law to shift the liability for illegal content on to social media firms such as Facebook and Google, a legal change which will be easier once Britain leaves the European Union. Both changes form part of the hard-hitting conclusions of an inquiry into intimidation experienced by parliamentary candidates in this year’s election campaign. Other recommendations include: Social media firms should make decisions quickly to take down intimidatory content. Political parties should, by December 2018, draw up a joint code of conduct on intimidatory behaviour during election campaigns. The National Police Chiefs’ Council should ensure that police are trained to investigate offences committed through social media. Ministers should bring forward rules so that council candidates will no longer be required to release their home addresses. Lord Bew, the committee chair, said: “This level of vile and threatening behaviour, albeit by a minority of people, against those standing for public office is unacceptable in a healthy democracy. We cannot get to a point where people are put off standing, retreat from debate, and even fear for their lives as a result of their engagement in politics. “This is not about protecting elites or stifling debate, it is about ensuring we have a vigorous democracy in which participants engage in a responsible way which recognises others’ rights to participate and to hold different points of view.” A YouGov survey of 1,616 adults last month, commissioned by the committee, found that 49% either agreed or were ambivalent when asked if MPs who received abuse brought it upon themselves. But 62% found it highly unacceptable that any member of the public should send abusive messages to MPs on social media. A majority of the public – 60% – found it unacceptable that MPs had been disrespectful to members of the public on social media. MPs reported being subjected to weeks of abuse leading up to the general election, including racism, antisemitism and death threats. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, was found by Amnesty to have received 45% of all abusive tweets sent during the election, many of which were racist and sexist. Dozens of MPs had already moved to improve their security after Labour MP Jo Cox was murdered by a rightwing extremist in 2016. The report said that the intimidation of parliamentary candidates was of particular significance because of the threat it posed to the integrity of the democratic process. “A new electoral offence of intimidating parliamentary candidates and party campaigners during an election should be considered. This would serve to highlight the seriousness of the issue, result in more appropriate sanctions, and serve as a deterrent,” it said. Facebook, Twitter and Google “are not simply platforms for the content that others post” because they play a role in shaping what users see, and so “must take more responsibility for illegal material”, the committee said. They were not liable “largely” due to a EU directive which treated them as “hosts” of online content, the watchdog said, but May’s commitment to Brexit means the government can introduce laws to make companies responsible once the UK leaves the EU. The report said social media was “the most significant factor” driving harassment, abuse and intimidation of 2017 general election candidates, which included threats of violence and sexual violence, as well as damage to property. “Some have felt the need to disengage entirely from social media because of the abuse they face, and it has put off others who may wish to stand for public office,” the report said. “Not enough has been done. The committee is deeply concerned about the limited engagement of the social media companies in tackling these issues.” The committee said it was concerned about the impact on the diversity of a representative democracy and said parties had an “important responsibility” to support female, black and minority ethnic and LGBT candidates. Abbott welcomed the proposal for new obligations on social media companies but questioned whether it would be right to call for new legislation covering intimidation. “I’m not persuaded that yet more legislation is required. Intimidation, threatening behaviour and violence are all illegal. These laws need to be enforced for everyone,” she said. She questioned whether she could work with all political opponents given that some were accused of being behind some social media campaigns. “Yes, of course, political parties should work together to combat intimidation. But some of my opponents have engaged in dog-whistle politics, and not just at election time,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2017/dec/31/jeans-denim-jacket-new-power-dressing-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T10:00:27Z","webTitle":"It's in the jeans: why the humble denim jacket is the new power dressing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/dec/31/jeans-denim-jacket-new-power-dressing-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/dec/31/jeans-denim-jacket-new-power-dressing-2018","fields":{"headline":"It's in the jeans: why the denim jacket is 2018's new power dressing","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"You can tell a lot about a decade by its most overused words. The noughties had “bling bling”, which evolved into the slightly more refined but essentially similar “fabulous”. The nineties were all about irony, though we didn’t really know what it was, so we said “as if!” and “whatever!” a lot. Though this decade started out belonging to the term “hipster”, we now uphold “authentic” as the ultimate accolade. In the age of authenticity, the denim jacket is the new power dressing. Expect to see a jean jacket everywhere in 2018. Authenticity, being a balance of keeping it real and keeping it cool, reveres denim more than cashmere. Denim is as grounded as it is steeped in heritage; as utilitarian as it is complex. (Do not get a denim geek on to the subject of selvedge versus wide loom unless you have time for an extended chat.) But 2018 will not be about jeans. As we enter the endgame of this decade, the hunt for authenticity is shifting to the less obvious. So to win next year, you will need a denim jacket. At the most recent New York fashion week, there were classic boxy denim jackets at Calvin Klein, Tibi and Adam Selman. Every hip label has a hot take on the jean jacket: Vetements has collaborated with Levi’s for a chopped and remade Frankenjacket that brings the same deconstruction vibe that made Vetements’ patchwork jeans an out-of-the-box fashion hit back in 2016. Virgil Abloh’s Off-White version is sawn off at mid-ribcage level and fastened with an outsize white zip. Paul Newman in Hud, Robert Redford in The Electric Horseman: there is a rugged, road-tripping American glamour to a denim jacket, which is reflected in the new-era Calvin Klein styling of wearing one over a fitted polo neck. (Selena Gomez, American sweetheart, nails this look off-duty.) Rihanna “shrobes” hers, thanks to the trompe-l’œil seams on her Balenciaga swing denim jacket, which lend an effect of being fitted around the ribcage but shruggable off bare shoulders, for that mink-coat-at-the-opera silhouette. Gigi Hadid also shoulder-robes hers. And while everyone is on the bandwagon now, Kanye West has been rocking a jean jacket for years. For the Met Gala in 2016, Olivier Rousteing created a custom Balmain denim jacket for the rapper which took longer to make than his wife’s dress. Kim Kardashian’s gown might have been created from the mirror shards of disco balls, but “the hardest thing was Kanye’s jacket”, Rousteing told GQ. “We had to bleach the denim and then embroider it with all the stones and pearls. I felt like this was a different kind of process that we’re not used to doing in couture.” In one crucial way, jeans paved the way for the return of the denim jacket. As stretch denim gave way to rigid, the heavy, boxy feel of a jean jacket – which had been off-putting to a generation who wore hoodies – started to become a badge of fashion honour. As the athleisure star wanes, the denim jacket is the new hoodie. They tap into the trend for “nowstalgia” that sees millennials referencing times only just gone by. For digital natives, what isn’t catalogued on Google Images never happened, which makes Edwardian tailoring or Victorian embroidery a tough sell to this market. Britney Spears in double denim in Crossroads, on the other hand? That’s iconic. A word on terminology. The trucker jacket is the Levi’s denim jacket, born in 1967. You can recognise it by the diagonal seams, which form a narrow inverted triangle below each breast pocket. (Anything else is a jean jacket, but not a trucker.) This might seem petty, but when fashion gets fussy about terminology, its invariably a sign that this is what people will be talking about. To the list of words you’ll be hearing next year: listen out for the trucker. Three other trends for 2018 Lilac Pantone declared ultra violet the colour of 2018. Lilac was all over the spring catwalks, most notably at Gucci and Marni. The difference is the name, which conjures up a sort of otherworldliness and nods towards branding. Highland Spring, NatWest and the pope have deployed shades of purple to memorable effect. It’s also the colour of amethysts (crystals often appear in Vogue), a favourite shade of the architect Frank Lloyd Wright, was often worn by Hillary Clinton (which also suggests it is the unofficial colour of centrists) and reminds us of Prince. Something for everyone. Fringing The cowgirl – or boy – feels like an uncomfortable source for inspiration given its history, but fashion continues regardless, and from Balmain to Nina Ricci to Ellery, this “finish” will probably rule the high street in 2018. Vogue describes it as sensual and swooshing, although that largely depends on the fabric (they were mainly talking about tassels). However it’s worn, when viewed through the hemline index, it conjures up all sorts of uncertainty. Rugby shirts Sportswear as daywear will remain a dominant trend in 2018, though this time it’s less about posh tracksuits and more about specific sports. Golfwear (see Rihanna’s Fenty label) is one option, although rugby shirts will probably be the key, unisex trend. Acne’s unisex line has a rugby dress/shirt depending on height, Tommy Hilfiger has something pleasingly nostalgic, Koche has a pricier version for womenswear, and H&amp;M has one for £30. Part reworking of nostalgia and part cultural tourism, it nods just as much to a mockery of a certain class and schooling as it does to the luxe sportswear takeover.

As British politics was consumed by battle over the terms of EU departure, it is fitting the Labour leader happened to be in the country famous for avoiding European conflicts. Corbyn’s Brexit stance looks a lot like neutrality. It is not an issue that ignites his campaigning spirit. His power to mobilise legions of loyal supporters was not deployed for the remain cause in the referendum. It has since been marshalled towards other causes. In parliament, the tone of Labour’s response to May’s European manoeuvres sounds more like commentary than combat. John McDonnell revealed the essence of his party’s convoluted Brexit calculations when he said on Monday Labour prefers to talk about “a single market” as distinct from “the single market”. There is only one continental single market under discussion in the current negotiations: the UK can be in it, as most Labour MPs would like, or out of it, which is the government’s goal. The shadow chancellor’s indefinite article clarifies only his reluctance to make definite choices. Such calculated ambiguity has served Labour well so far. The party fought the June election with a manifesto that was explicitly but not ostentatiously pro-Brexit, and a campaign that steered debate elsewhere. Labour reassured leavers in its traditional heartland seats that it would not undo the referendum result, while scooping up votes from remainers whose urgent motive was thwarting May. The electoral alliance that deprived the Tories of a majority is a patchwork of anti-Conservative feeling, masking contradictory attitudes towards the EU and the Labour leader. Even within the pro-Corbyn camp there are latent tensions between culture warriors who despise Brexit as Trumpesque xenophobic nationalism, and ideological stalwarts who have always seen the European project as irredeemably capitalist. That is largely a generational divide. Corbyn’s roots are in the vintage-left Eurosceptic tradition, but his fortune has been made by a new, instinctively Europhile generation – the crowd that chanted his name at Glastonbury. The Labour leader doesn’t want to betray their affection, but nor does he comfortably deviate from familiar doctrines. For McDonnell the calculation is different. He sees EU rules that promote market competition and prohibit some forms of industrial subsidy as impediments to Labour’s renationalising ambitions for the economy. But he also wants to be an unthreatening candidate for the chancellor’s job. He recognises that businesses and investors like the single market, and the Treasury needs the revenues that accrue from membership. McDonnell is pragmatic enough to dial down his distaste for European institutions if that helps defuse the City’s terror of a Corbynite government. Besides, pursuing a radical economic programme while aligned with EU rules might be inconvenient, but not as inconvenient as trying to pursue a radical programme in the crater of an economy that has been struck by a meteor-hard Brexit. Opaque signals on Brexit are symptomatic of a deeper problem for the Corbyn project. It draws its insurgent energy – its political life force – from promises of unalloyed radicalism. But that was easier to sustain when government felt remote. The relative success of Labour’s election campaign took even its authors by surprise. Labour’s 40% vote share contains a portion who backed the party in spite of its leader, not because of him. Escaping opposition means reassuring those sceptics, inspiring loyalists and making new recruits. Those agendas are not easily combined. It is tricky, for example, to persuade investors that their money would be in safe hands under Labour, while also pushing Facebook clips in which the leader tells bankers: “You’re right – we are a threat.” It is possible that the incumbent administration is so lousy it is destined to collapse, making Corbyn prime minister by default. But there are no guarantees. May could hardly have shed more authority in the past six months had she been trying to sabotage her electoral prospects; yet she approaches the end of the year with some semblance of credibility restored. The deal that allows her to proceed to the next phase of Brexit is gooey fudge, but her MPs are swallowing it. She is now able to trumpet progress to the sizeable chunk of the electorate that just wants to know Brexit is happening without being bothered by fiddly details. That attitude happens also to sum up the Labour leader’s approach. Even allies concede that Corbyn is not interested in the fine grain of trade analytics. Responsibility for the technical stuff has been delegated to Keir Starmer. The shadow Brexit secretary has navigated Labour towards advocating maximum alignment with the single market. But his strength is lawyerly forensics, not motivational politics. That is the leader’s department. As a result, Labour’s stance looks both vague and pernickety – focused on the terms and conditions without describing the actual product. This has dulled attacks on a prime minister who doesn’t appear to know what she is buying but ticks the T&amp;Cs box regardless. Labour cannot lurk in the shadow of Tory disunity forever. Even if the Conservatives maintain their incompetent streak, the negotiating timetable for the second phase of Brexit will impose stark choices on Downing Street. Corbyn will need a response. But the opposition has come to rely on ambiguity as a way to avoid confronting other unresolved issues. It is a curtain from behind which the party emits different signals to different audiences: one message for older leavers, another for young remainers; a radical pitch for some, a pragmatic tone for others. This system works as long as the government is also hiding from tough decisions. But May’s Brexit path will soon get clearer. Then Labour will have a duty to the country to stop its European prevarications. The options will be fewer and simpler: follow or lead. • Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/15/bad-sounds-are-you-high-zippy-banger-like-rat-boy-covering-tame-impala","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T15:00:36Z","webTitle":"Bad Sounds’ Are You High: a zippy banger, like Rat Boy covering Tame Impala","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/15/bad-sounds-are-you-high-zippy-banger-like-rat-boy-covering-tame-impala","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/15/bad-sounds-are-you-high-zippy-banger-like-rat-boy-covering-tame-impala","fields":{"headline":"Bad Sounds’ Are You High: a zippy banger, like Rat Boy covering Tame Impala","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"TRACK OF THE WEEK Bad Sounds Are You High?

Just in case anyone’s missed the point, it also contains the words “I hate Coldplay”. Chris Martin’s lawyers have been informed. The Wombats Turn Ten years on from their debut album, the Wombats are still ridiculously popular, selling out major venues and supporting the likes of the Pixies. Turn fails to shed any light on this continued appeal, with its uber-bland melodies, nonsense lyrics about watering potted plants and running with wolf packs, and a very “dad who’s just discovered Hotline Bling” Drake ref. Honey Hahs Forever With an average age of 11, family band Honey Hahs are a bit of an easy target for detractors (“They’re too young! They’re too precocious! Don’t they have homework to do?”) Thankfully, Forever is a very sweet, folky pop song with a deeper message. Yes, there’s a line about quinoa, but within the context (an existential meditation on how we might fare if the world were to end tomorrow) one last Ocado delivery seems permissible."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/12/jerusalem-chapter-century-colonialism-donald-trump-intervention-palestine","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T19:38:45Z","webTitle":"In Jerusalem we have the latest chapter in a century of colonialism | Karma Nabulsi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/12/jerusalem-chapter-century-colonialism-donald-trump-intervention-palestine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/12/jerusalem-chapter-century-colonialism-donald-trump-intervention-palestine","fields":{"headline":"In Jerusalem we have the latest chapter in a century of colonialism","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"One hundred years ago, on 11 December 1917, the British army occupied Jerusalem. As General Allenby’s troops marched through Bab al-Khalil, launching a century of settler colonialism across Palestine, prime minister David Lloyd George heralded the city’s capture as “a Christmas present for the British people”. In a few months’ time, we mark another such anniversary: 70 years since the Palestinian Nakba of 1948, the catastrophic destruction of the Palestinian polity; the violent dispossession of most of its people with their forced conversion into disenfranchised refugees; the colonial occupation, annexation and control of their land; and the imposition of martial law over those who managed to remain. The current US president’s recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel bookends a century of such events: from the Balfour declaration in November 1917 to the partition plan of 1947; from the Nakba of 1948 to the Naksa of 1967 – with its annexation of Jerusalem, the occupation of the rest of Palestine, further mass expulsions of Palestinians including from East and West Jerusalem, and the invaders’ razing of entire ancient neighbourhoods in the city. Donald Trump’s declaration could easily be read as one more outrage in his growing collection of chaotic and destructive policies, this one perhaps designed to distract from his more prosaic, personal problems with the law. It is viewed as the act of a volatile superpower haplessly endorsing illegal military conquest and consolidating the “acquisition of territory by force” (a practice prohibited and rejected by the UN and the basic tenets of international law). And it is seen alongside a long list of domestic and international blunders. However, this analysis obscures what happens each day in occupied Palestine, and hides what will surely happen next – unless governments, parliaments, institutions, unions and, most of all, citizens take measures to actively resist it. Leaders across the world appear incapable of naming what is taking place in Palestine, so their received wisdom on the cause and nature of the conflict, along with the “consensus solutions” they offer, prove futile. This century of events instead should be understood as a continuum, forming part of an active process that hasn’t yet stopped or achieved its ends. Palestinians understand it: we feel it in a thousand ways every day. How does this structure appear to those who endure it day in, day out? Patrick Wolfe, the late scholar, traced the history of settler colonial projects across continents, showing us that events in Palestine over the last 100 years are an intensification of (rather than a departure from) settler colonialism. He also established its two-sided nature, defining the phenomenon – from the Incas and Mayans to the native peoples of Africa, America, and the Middle East – as holding negative and positive dimensions. Negatively, settler colonialism strives for the dissolution of native societies; positively, it erects a new colonial society on the expropriated land: “Colonisers come to stay: invasion is a structure not an event.” After the British marched into Jerusalem in 1917 and declared martial law, they turned Palestine into an Occupied Enemy Territory Administration (OETA). Declaring martial law over the city, Allenby promised: “Every sacred building, monument, holy spot, shrine, traditional site, endowment, pious bequest, or customary place of prayer of whatsoever form of the three religions will be maintained and protected.” But what did he say of its people? Allenby divided the country into four districts: Jerusalem, Jaffa, Majdal and Beersheba, each under a military governor, and the accelerated process of settler colonialism began. At the time of the military takeover, Palestine was 90% Christian and Muslim, with 7-10% Palestinian Arab Jews and recent European settlers. By the time the British army left Palestine on 14 May 1948, the expulsion and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people was already under way. During their 30 years’ rule, the British army and police engineered a radical change to the population through the mass introduction of European settlers, against the express wishes of the indigenous population. They also suppressed Palestine’s Great Revolt of 1936-39, destroying any possibility of resistance to what lay ahead. Once any individual episode is understood as part of a continuing structure of settler colonialism, the hitherto invisible daily evictions of Palestinians from their homes assume their devastating significance. Invisible too has been the force driving the expansion of illegal settlements on Palestinian land. Without a framing of settler colonialism, the notion of the founder of Zionism, Theodor Herzl, of “spiriting away” the native Arabs “gradually and circumspectly”, makes little sense. In Jerusalem this is how gradual ethnic cleansing is being practised today. The new US policy on Jerusalem is not about occupation and annexation; the supremacy of one religion over another so “balance” must be restored; the two-state solution or the failures of the Oslo agreement; or the location of an embassy, or division of Jerusalem. Nor is it even about the soap opera-level conspiracy the Palestinian people have been abandoned to: where the son-in-law of the US president, who has actively funded the rightwing settlement movement in Israel, has been granted absolute power to fabricate a “peace process” with a crown prince who has just locked up his relatives. In this dystopic vision, the village of Abu Dis outside Jerusalem is proposed as the capital of a future fragmented Palestinian “state” – one never created, given that (along with all US-led peace processes), its eventual appearance is entirely dependent on Israel’s permission. This is named, in “peace process” language, as any solution to be agreed “by the parties themselves”, via “a negotiated settlement by the two sides”. With colonialism always comes anti-colonial resistance. Against the active project to disappear the indigenous people, take their land, dispossess and disperse them so they cannot reunite to resist, the goals of the Palestinian people are those of all colonised peoples throughout history. Very simply, they are to unify for the struggle to liberate their land and return to it, and to restore their inalienable human rights taken by force – principles enshrined in centuries of international treaties, charters, and resolutions, and in natural justice. The US has been blocking Palestinian attempts to achieve this national unity for years, vetoing Palestinian parties in taking their legitimate role in sharing representation. Palestinians’ democratic right to determine their path ahead would allow our young generation – scattered far and wide, from refugee camps to the prisons inside Palestine – to take up their place in the national struggle for freedom. The US assists the coloniser and ties our hands. Former European colonial powers, including Britain, now claim they are aware of their colonial legacy, and condemn centuries of enslavement and the savage exploitation of Africa and Asia. So European leaders should first name the relentless process they installed in our country, and stand with us so that we can unite to defeat it. • Karma Nabulsi is fellow in politics at St Edmund Hall, and teaches at Oxford University"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"news/2017/dec/12/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T21:00:00Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/12/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/dec/12/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"• A report about plans by the health secretary to introduce an opt-out system of consent to organ donation incorrectly referred to England and Wales.

The deal, which will reportedly be announced before the New York stock exchange opens on Thursday, or around midday UK time, marks a turning point in an empire building career that started in the 1950s and is expected to lead to a split in the Murdoch family dynasty. Rupert’s son James Murdoch, the Fox chief executive, will leave the company, either to join Disney in a senior role or set up his own venture, according to the Financial Times The deal includes the 20th Century Fox film studio, home to franchises including Avatar and Ice Age, Fox’s TV production business, which produces shows including The Simpsons and Modern Family, and cable stations FX and National Geographic. Internationally, Disney would pick up Fox’s 39% stake in Sky, the Star network in India and the Fox International Channels business, which airs shows such as The Walking Dead. “It is a fundamental parting of ways between James and his father,” says Claire Enders, founder of Enders Analysis. “It is an extraordinary change of dynamic.” Fox’s bid to buy the 61% of Sky it does not already own, which has been mired in a protracted regulatory process, will now be inherited by Disney. One senior analyst said the deal is set to change the balance of power and control of news media in the UK due its ramifications for Britain’s biggest pay-TV network. “It means another company other than Fox will own Sky in due course,” says Enders. “The level of power the Murdochs would have had owning 100% of Sky, including Sky News, and the newspapers and the issues that has raised will be washed away.” As well as breaking up his own media empire which he has built over five decades, 86-year-old Rupert Murdoch is attempting to make his family one of the major shareholders of an enlarged Disney, which would become the world’s most powerful entertainment company. According to reports, the Murdoch family trust is expected to take a 5% stake in Disney. Rupert Murdoch has made the strategic move to secure his family’s legacy, after missing out on sealing an $80bn deal to takeover Time Warner to build the scale needed as film attendance falls and new rivals emerge including Apple, Amazon, Google and Netflix. The deal will be scrutinised by the US and UK regulatory authorities. A Disney-Fox combination would see it control almost 40% of the $11bn US box office, the biggest movie market in the world. Following the Disney deal, Fox will retain ownership of Fox News, its biggest profit driver, Fox Sports channel and sports rights, Fox Business and its broadcast TV network of 28 local television stations in the US. Rupert and his elder son, Lachlan, would also continue to run News Corp, the separately listed company that owns the Sun, Times, Sunday Times, Wall Street Journal and book publisher Harper Collins. Analysts are speculating whether in the long-term the remnants of 21st Century Fox will be folded into News Corp."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/13/westminster-watchdog-investigates-camelots-funding-of-good-causes","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T00:01:04Z","webTitle":"Westminster watchdog investigates Camelot’s funding of good causes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/13/westminster-watchdog-investigates-camelots-funding-of-good-causes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/13/westminster-watchdog-investigates-camelots-funding-of-good-causes","fields":{"headline":"Westminster watchdog investigates Camelot’s funding of good causes","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Parliament’s spending watchdog has launched an inquiry into whether the National Lottery operator Camelot is failing the good causes it was set up to fund. Concerns have been raised after auditors found that Camelot’s profits over a seven-year period increased by 122% and have been proportionately greater than sales or the returns for good causes. The National Audit Office (NAO) report released on Wednesday reveals that National Lottery income for good causes fell by 15% over the year to April and is expected to drop again next year. The findings have prompted Westminster’s public accounts committee to launch an immediate inquiry. Meg Hillier, the committee’s chair, questioned whether Camelot was operating within the National Lottery Act. “Profits increasing while money for good causes falls really does go against the spirit of the act. We need to dig in to how such a huge increase in profits can occur,” she said. The lottery’s overarching objective is to maximise returns for good causes, by selling products in an efficient and socially responsible way. The NAO report points out that lottery players have turned away from draw-based games and are instead playing scratchcards, which give a significantly smaller amount to good causes. Camelot’s accounts show that lottery sales increased by 27% (£1.5bn) to £6.9bn , between 2009-10 and 2016-17. Over the same period, , returns for good causes increased by 2% to £1.5bn and Camelot’s profit attributable to its shareholders increased by 122% (£39m) to £71m. The National Lottery, currently run by Camelot UK Lotteries Limited (Camelot), aims to raise money for good causes in the arts, sports, heritage, health, education, environment and charitable sectors. The NAO report shows that income for good causes fell to £1.63bn at the same time as three of the six largest Lottery distributors increased their grant commitments by a total of £88m. The drop in money for good causes came as Lottery sales fell by 9% to £6.93bn compared with the previous year. Camelot has predicted a further fall in sales and income for good causes in 2017-18, the report said. The NAO said distributors, which include UK Sport, Spirit of 2012, Heritage Lottery Fund and the Big Lottery Fund, often had commitments spanning many years “so it is likely that commitments will exceed their fund balance at a given date”. In December last year, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport agreed to underwrite up to £25m a year to cover any shortfalls in lottery income for UK Sport over the 2017-2020 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic cycle. Returns for good causes are higher from sales of draw-based lottery games, which fell by 13% in the year to April, than for scratchcards and instant-win games, which fell by 2%, the report said. As of February this year, the approximate return for good causes ranged from 34p for each pound spent on draw-based games bought online to 10p for scratchcards, with some scratchcards returning as little as 5p. Camelot told the NAO that scratchcards and instant-win games returned less to good causes because of the need to offer a higher proportion of proceeds as prizes to encourage consumers to participate. Camelot said the company had recently carried out a wide-ranging strategic review of the business and announced strong plans to get the National Lottery back into growth next year and raising as much money as possible for good causes. A spokesman said: “We continue to return around 95% of all National Lottery revenue – almost £6.6bn in 2016/17 – back to winners and society, one of the highest percentages in the world. In contrast, our profit after tax is around just 1% of total revenue – £70.5m in 2016/17. “Since the start of our third operating licence in 2009, returns to winners and society have increased by almost £1.8bn, while shareholder profit has increased by just £26m over the same period.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/13/unions-brexit-jeremy-corbyn-labour","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T12:02:19Z","webTitle":"The unions are sounding the alarm over Brexit.

Why isn’t Jeremy Corbyn?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"There’s a joke about English breakfast that explains the difference between commitment and involvement: the pig is committed, because it provides the bacon; the hen, which has provided the eggs, is only involved. In the full English Brexit that Theresa May is stuffing down our throats, working people are the pigs, and multinational companies are the hens. If we get a bad Brexit – as we surely will, unless we can stop the whole mad escapade – business will be put out. But ultimately, big companies can just shift investment offshore. Workers, though, are all in. They will be stuck with a low- investment, low-productivity, low-wage economy. That means low-quality jobs. They won’t even be able to move offshore, because we won’t have free movement. The trade union movement realises this. Frances O’Grady hasn’t been hoodwinked by the prime minister’s deal with the EU last Friday. The TUC general secretary knows that it doesn’t mean we’re staying in the EU’s single market, which helps underpin investment in our industry and our prosperity. Rather, it means we are heading for, at best, a free trade agreement with the EU a bit like one the bloc has with Canada. Such a deal would do virtually nothing for our services industries, which account for 80% of our economy. That’s why O’Grady says it would be a “disaster for Britain’s workers”. Her warnings are backed up by Tuesday’s research from the Rand Corporation, a top US thinktank, which concluded that the UK will be “economically worse off outside of the EU under most plausible scenarios”. Although the TUC general secretary is sounding the alarm, the Labour party isn’t yet willing to say we should stay in the single market. It has, admittedly, shifted quite a bit in that direction since the election – and there was a further move at the weekend. Keir Starmer, the party’s Brexit spokesperson, said Labour backed a “single market variant”, was open to paying money to the EU for future access to its market, and would even go along with “easy” movement of people – if not the “free” movement that underpins the single market. But Jeremy Corbyn is not yet willing to nail his colours to the single-market mast. The Labour leader knows that some of his most enthusiastic young supporters, as well as many activists in big cities, are ardently pro-European. But he is also worried that many working-class voters in the party’s post-industrial heartlands in the north of England and the Midlands are pro-Brexit. Corbyn’s team therefore still seems to want to maintain “constructive ambiguity” over Labour’s policy on Brexit – in a bid to be all things to all people. Such a strategy worked well during the election, with many pro-European voters either believing Labour was more anti-Brexit than it really was, or at least thinking it had better European policies than the Tories. O’Grady, who will be seeing the Labour leadership today to talk about Brexit, needs to persuade them that such a timid approach is wrong. Corbyn should launch a full-throated campaign spelling out the dangers of a Tory Brexit to working people. He should explain how the government is hiding the truth of what it is planning from the people because it is worried they will take fright. If the Labour leader fights arm in arm with the trade union movement, he has the capacity to shift the opinion of working people. And if he does that, he will no longer find he is pulled in different directions by his two most important bases – metropolitan centres and the old Labour heartlands. Leadership is about shaping opinion, not just reflecting it. Corbyn has a duty to join O’Grady in sounding the alarm about where the Tories are taking us. If he does this, he will be able to mobilise parts of the electorate that are lukewarm about Labour. But if he doesn’t fight hard, there’s a risk that when the horrors of the full English Brexit become clear, and workers realise they’ve provided the bacon, Corbyn will get a big share of the blame. • Hugo Dixon is editor-in-chief of the pro-European website InFacts"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/29/kay-mellor-band-gold-father-mother-husband-daughters-grandchildren","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T13:00:32Z","webTitle":"Kay Mellor: ‘If it hadn’t been for family, I wouldn’t have survived’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/29/kay-mellor-band-gold-father-mother-husband-daughters-grandchildren","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/29/kay-mellor-band-gold-father-mother-husband-daughters-grandchildren","fields":{"headline":"Kay Mellor: ‘If it hadn’t been for family, I wouldn’t have survived’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My mother, Dinah, divorced my father because of domestic violence. My earliest memory is of finding her on the floor in the living room and of my father leaving. He beat up my mum. She threw him out. I remember watching him walk away with his trilby and his suitcase as I looked out of the window. I was two and my brother, Robert, was five. Mum brought us up singlehandedly for eight years. Mum didn’t crumble. She was very strong. We were raised in Leeds in the 1950s – the only kids on my council estate from a single-parent family. She didn’t care what people thought. She wouldn’t wear a wedding ring and wouldn’t take state benefits. She worked as a tailoress. She did everything: making carpet for our rooms, wallpapering, cooking, sewing and had time to read us stories and be affectionate. A pretty amazing person. My father, George, wasn’t in my life much after he left. He turned up a couple of times to ask Mum back. She wouldn’t let him in to the house. He made contact when I was 21. I did get to know him, but the relationship was soured by the images in my head. It broke down pretty quickly. He was remorseful. He said he came home from the war and was never the same. I suppose he had seen a lot of atrocities. You think: “Maybe that did affect him …” But there were a lot of men who fought in the war who didn’t beat up their wives. There are echoes of my father through my work. I have perhaps worked through my thoughts in my writing. My mother could tell a story. I get that from her without a doubt. She used to have us all in raptures listening. I met my husband, Anthony, on a blind date. I was sat on the chip-shop wall and his sister Gail came up and said: “D’ya wanna go out with me brother? There’s a party on Saturday. He’s looking for a lass to take. He’s called Anthony.” I went: “Yeah, all right …” I went to the party and there was this handsome man called Tony. He looked like Ray Davies from the Kinks. I remember thinking: “Well, if this Anthony bloke don’t come, I’m going to make a beeline for him.” Gail turned up and said: “This is me brother …” It was the guy I was eyeing up. We’ve been together ever since. Anthony told his mate that night he’d marry me. I had only had sex twice when I got pregnant. I was a naive 16-year-old and Anthony was 17 when we got married. On our wedding day, everyone said: “This is never going to last …” Everybody was crying and saying: “Oh, you’re just babies …” We were. We had no money. We lived with Anthony’s mum, Sybil, and slept in his single bed. The morning after we told my mum I was pregnant, she said: “You’ve ruined your life. That’s it now, you’re a mother …” I remember her saying: “You were so clever …” I felt terrible, as if I’d let her down. At the same time, she was doing me a boiled egg and saying: “You’ve got to eat right, now you’re pregnant.” She was torn. She wanted the best for me. I promised I’d go back into education when my children went to school. Anthony was the breadwinner, a motor mechanic, so it meant I could do my O-levels and A-levels. I went to drama school when I was 27. Anthony is a constant. He does everything he can to help me. He is upset if I am upset. He loves me and he tells me he loves me. When you feel you have got almost unconditional love, you can operate in this world that much better. You sort of feel you can do anything with someone like that by your side. I hope I have passed on my strength to my daughters, Yvonne and Gaynor. Strength and compassion – they should go hand-in-hand. I hope I have given them a socialist background: caring about, and having empathy for, other people. Education, too. And spirituality. I don’t have a religion, but I believe in not hurting another soul. I passed on dramatic tendencies – they are both in the business. I can see dramatic tendencies coming through my four grandkids, too. We all gather round the table two or three Sundays a month and chat and support each other. Family’s important. If it hadn’t been for family, I wouldn’t have survived. I certainly wouldn’t be the writer I am today.

The six percolating tracks of this Melbourne band’s extraordinary March outing share literate space with a peer such as Courtney Barnett even as they hark further back, to the wry, loose takedowns of 80s masters the Go-Betweens. You never know exactly what this band’s three singing guitarists, Fran Keaney, Tom Russo and Joe White, are getting at on these obliquely crafted songs. But lust, rancour and misunderstandings figure prominently, as do bejewelled guitar lines and a rhythm section that doubles as a perpetual motion machine. Kitty Empire Mhysa: Fantasii (Halcyon Veil) This debut from queer black diva Mhysa, aka multimedia artist E Jane, is an experimental masterwork of industrial electro meets R&amp;B. Largely self-produced, it has a sculptural, echoey sound, evoking the abrasive beauty of smashed mirror glass, plus glitchy, nonchalantly confident bangers such as Strobe. The Philadelphia performer uses her lithe, light vocals to investigate sensuality, vulnerability, loneliness and, most of all, black femininity. With gloriously jarring nods to Beyoncé, Janet Jackson and Prince, and striking spoken word interludes, this is a superb left-field album. Tara Joshi Anna of the North: Lovers (Different Recordings) Lovers, the debut of Norwegian singer-songwriter Anna Lotterud and New Zealand-born producer Brady Daniell-Smith, cloaks a devastating breakup in soft-focus electro-pop. The gently pulsating title track dissects emotional numbness over supple drum beats; Someone is drivetime 80s MOR via M83; while All I Want (“is your love and affection”) closes things on a suitably bittersweet note, Lotterud’s multitracked, unvarnished vocal adding a blank sadness. In fact, Lovers is so unfussy that on first listen it can wash over you, but there’s real beauty to be found on repeated listens. Michael Cragg Aimee Mann: Mental Illness (Superego Records) Despite four decades as a songwriter on a par with Randy Newman and Elvis Costello, Aimee Mann rarely gets her dues. And Mental Illness, her ninth album, is a low-key yet major work. She picked the title to mock critics who ignore the diversity of her catalogue to label her a sad sack, but inhabits depressive stoicism with total conviction and characteristic grace. The acoustic arrangements are light, her melodies indelible – the counterpoint to 11 beautifully melancholic songs about addiction to extreme emotional states. Laura Snapes Protomartyr: Relatives in Descent (Domino) The fourth album from Detroit post-punks Protomartyr is their most ambitious yet: lyrically tangential and musically dense, rich with ideas, drawing equally from the National and Les Savy Fav. The palpable sense of unease conjured up by singer Joe Casey, by turns angry and vulnerable but always compelling, is perfectly complemented by the arrangements. Hooks are deployed sparingly, yet are all the more thrilling when they crash in. With the exception of Don’t Go to Anacita, there’s little here that’s immediate, but persevere and an exceptional album slowly comes into focus. Phil Mongredien Kevin Morby: City Music (Dead Oceans) Wistful and pithy, Kevin Morby’s fourth album is a sepia-tinted tribute to New York. There are echoes of Lou Reed, Television and, on the homespun 1234, Ramones, but the singer-songwriter is never derivative. Mostly he sounds sleepy, lost in his own thoughts, excited by the bright lights of the big city but fearful of facing life alone. “Ain’t got no friends in a world so big,” he drawls on the brooding Come to Me Now, while the liquid title track revels in the energy of the sidewalk. Paul Mardles Future: Hndrxx (Epic) Dedicated to one of his many alter egos, dubbed Future Hendrix, Hndrxx’s ascetic self-examination and croaky, metallic flow perhaps isn’t the ideal introduction if you’re unfamiliar with Future’s weirdly hypnotic weep-hop aesthetic. However, it’s the most coherent of the Auto-Tune king’s six albums, despite being somewhat overshadowed by the million-selling Future, released just a week before. It remains unclear if doing shedloads of downers and rapping like you’re about to pass out makes you the spiritual child of rock’s most exciting guitarist. Still, there’s just about enough evidence of generation-severing genius to call for a DNA test. Damien Morris Priests: Nothing Feels Natural (Sister Polygon) Most punk bands would die for the synchronicity that Priests achieved when their debut album landed the week after Trump’s inauguration. But although the DC four-piece had delivered funny, searing polemics (even aimed at Obama’s unfulfilled promises) on earlier EPs, Nothing Feels Natural abandons sloganeering for a more introspective interrogation of how capitalism and chaos can corrupt anyone’s sense of self. Happily, it’s nothing like as worthy as that sounds. Instead, it’s a raunchy rampage through surf rock, hardcore and sprightly punk-funk, led by firebrand Katie Alice Greer. LS Kikagaku Moyo: Stone Garden (Guruguru Brain) For fans of Kikagaku Moyo, a psychedelic rock band from Tokyo, this fourth album is a surprising break from the past. Stone Garden eschews the furious guitar thrashing that has earned the band cult-like status in Japan in favour of an experimental fusion of global beats, jazz and rock. It still explodes in places as guitars scream away from the jazz-inspired bass lines, but there are also moments of tranquillity, heralded by the trill of the sitar and a haunting vocal score. Leander Hobbs Battle of Santiago: La Migra (Made With Pencil Crayons) There is no shortage of brass-heavy world fusion bands, but on their third album this Toronto collective conjure up a distinctive hybrid of Afrobeat, salsa and funk. The Santería-style chants of Aguanileo and Barasu-Ayo attest to Toronto’s large Cuban community, while elsewhere the band explore dub on the clattering Cimarron, show off skilful hard bop sax and African balafon, and squeeze in electronica and stratospheric guitar on Rumba Libre. The album title refers to the feared border cops whom the band clearly hope to vanquish if they play hard enough. Neil Spencer Echoes of Swing: Bix: A Tribute to Bix Beiderbecke (Act) Behind a rather boring title lurks a fascinating set of modern reworkings of jazz classics from the 1920s. Sometimes a simple change of tempo or rhythm style makes the trick of jumping 90 years sound simple; in other cases it’s a whole new tune, hauntingly reminiscent of a melody remembered but just out of reach. The playing is pitch perfect throughout. The second disc of this double set contains 10 original tracks, beautifully remastered, proving that distant generations can still talk the same jazz language. Dave Gelly Es war einmal… Once Upon a Time… Fairy Tales by Robert Schumann &amp; Jörg Widmann Tabea Zimmermann (viola), Jörg Widmann (clarinet), Dénes Várjon (piano) (Myrios Classics) Once upon a time, a trio of top soloists pulled together an irresistible collection of music depicting fairy stories. Robert Schumann’s Märchenerzählungen, Op 132 for trio, his Fantasiestücke for clarinet and piano and his Märchenbilder for viola and piano capture both the lyricism and the dark side of German romanticism, the Grimm brothers’ 1812 collection of tales ever hovering in the background. Clarinettist-composer Jörg Widmann’s spiky, delicate, musical ghost tales, in this world premiere recording, make a mysterious, unsettling contrast. Ideal fireside listening, beautifully packaged. Fiona Maddocks A Telemann Companion Akademie für Alte Musik Berlin/Jacobs (Harmonia Mundi) Much anniversary attention was given to Monteverdi this year, but Georg Philipp Telemann (died 1767), who eclipsed Bach in fame and fortune during his 86-year life, fared less well. This varied set demonstrates “the three lucky cards dealt him by nature: precocity, facility, longevity”. There’s a complete opera, Orpheus, the popular Brockes Passion, and several quirky instrumental suites, including the famous Hamburger Ebb und Fluth. An absurd slip is that the box set is described as celebrating the 350th anniversary of Telemann’s death: early planning for 2117? Nicholas Kenyon Sterndale Bennett; Schumann: Sonata Op 13; Symphonic Etudes Hiroaki Takenouchi (piano) (Artalinna) Exhilarating playing here from pianist Hiroaki Takenouchi, who champions the work of the 19th-century English virtuoso William Sterndale Bennett, and now tackles his demandingly muscular Sonata in F minor, Op. 13. The 20-year-old composer gave the piece to Mendelssohn as a wedding gift when he befriended him in Leipzig, where he also became firm friends with Schumann, who dedicated his masterly Symphonic Etudes to Bennett. It’s also played with great panache on this recording. Stephen Pritchard What have we missed?

The World Inequality Report, published on Thursday by French economist Thomas Piketty, warned that inequality had ballooned to “extreme levels” in some countries and said the problem would only get worse unless governments took coordinated action to increase taxes and prevent tax avoidance. The report, which drew on the work of more than 100 researchers around the world, found that the richest 1% of the global population “captured” 27% of the world’s wealth growth between 1980 and 2016. And the richest of the rich increased their wealth by even more. The top 0.1% gained 13% of the world’s wealth, and the top 0.001% – about 76,000 people – collected 4% of all the new wealth created since 1980. “The top 0.1% income group (about 7 million people) captured as much of the world’s growth since 1980 as the bottom half of the adult population,” the report said. “Conversely, income growth has been sluggish or even nil for the population between the global bottom 50% and top 1%.” The economists said wealth inequality had become “extreme” in Russia and the US. The US’s richest 1% accounted for 39% of the nation’s wealth in 2014 [the latest year available], up from 22% in 1980. The researchers noted that “most of that increase in inequality was due to the rise of the top 0.1% wealth owners”. The world’s richest person is Amazon’s founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, who has a $98.8bn (£73.9bn) fortune, according to the Bloomberg billionaires index. Bezos, the biggest shareholder in Amazon, has seen his wealth increase by $33bn over the past year alone. Collectively, the world’s five richest people – Bezos, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Amancio Ortega, the owner of Zara, and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg – hold $425bn of assets. That is equivalent to one-sixth of the UK’s GDP. In the UK, the richest 1% control 22% of the country’s wealth, up from 15% in 1984. The very richest in the UK have seen a huge increase in their wealth. The top 0.1% – around 50,000 people – have seen their share of the nation’s wealth double from 4.5% in 1984 to 9% in 2013. “The increase in the concentration of wealth in the last four decades is very much a phenomenon confined to the hands of the top 0.5% (the richest 250,000 Britons), and in particular the top 0.1% (the richest 50,000),” the report said. The richest people in the UK are the Hinduja family, who control a conglomerate of businesses including cars and banks, and are worth $15.4bn. The economists, led by Piketty who shot to global fame after the publication of his book Capital in the Twenty-First Century, said there was a “huge gap” in wealth between the richest people in the UK and everyone else in the country. They said the bottom 90% of people in the UK had an average wealth of £68,000, compared with £321,000 among the richest 10% and the top 0.5%, who were worth £3.7m on average. While inequality was high in north America and Europe, the researchers warned that the problem was even more acute in Africa, Brazil and the Middle East, where they said “inequality has remained relatively stable at extremely high levels in recent decades”. “The top 10% receives about 55% of total income in Brazil and sub-Saharan Africa, and in the Middle East, the top 10% income share is typically over 60%,” the report said. “These three regions never went through the postwar egalitarian regime and have always been at the world’s high-inequality frontier.” The report warns that unless there is globally coordinated political action, the wealth gap will continue to grow. “The global top 1% income share could increase from nearly 20% today to more than 24% by 2050,” the report said. “In which case the global bottom 50% share could fall from 10% to less than 9%.” However, the economists said increasing inequality was “not inevitable” if countries acted to bring in progressive income tax. “It not only reduces post-tax inequality, it shrinks pre-tax inequality by discouraging top earners from capturing higher shares of growth via aggressive bargaining for higher pay.” The authors said taxation alone was not enough to tackle the problem as the wealthy were best placed to avoid and evade tax, as shown by the recent Paradise Papers investigation. The report said a tenth of the world’s wealth was held in tax havens.

England were defeated by 150 runs, which meant they lost the Ashes at the earliest opportunity and Cook was out first ball in the second innings to a devastating delivery from Ryan Harris, which just clipped his off bail. It was not the perfect anniversary. Once Cook steps on to the field at the Waca on Thursday morning there will be only seven cricketers in the world who have played more Tests. It is a long time since he made his debut, as an emergency replacement, against India in Nagpur along with Monty Panesar and Ian Blackwell in 2006. Since then he has missed one Test for England – the Mumbai match in 2006 – because of ill health. He has never been dropped. “I probably did not think I would be here when I turned up in Nagpur all those years ago,” he said. “It’s very special in terms of a personal milestone. Not many people play 150 Tests and to do it at the top of the order, I’m quite proud of that. Hopefully there can be a few more after this one.” No opening batsman has played as many matches as Cook; among that special breed Sunil Gavaskar with 125 matches is the next on the list. The landmark falls at a tricky time again. England have lost their past seven Tests in Perth; the Ashes campaign is on the brink of petering out and Cook has managed to produce only 62 runs in two matches. He is not over-egging the challenge ahead when he says: “We’ve got the biggest game of our lives coming up and we’ve got to scrap unbelievably hard for five days.” The pitch at the Waca is likely to be a little more batsman-friendly than in the past: true but not quite so fast as it once was. There was a nasty run-glut between Australia and New Zealand in 2015 but in 2016 South Africa managed to win a high-scoring game. There will still be some bounce and in recent times Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins have been bowling so well this might be enough for them to take 20 wickets with the expert assistance of Nathan Lyon. Moreover Australia have taken the precaution of including Mitchell Marsh in their squad – and probably in their final XI – to ensure Steve Smith has another bowling option. England are likely to stick with the team who played in Adelaide. Mark Wood is not in contention and it would be an incredible gamble to include Mason Crane instead of Craig Overton, who began his Test career so pluckily in Adelaide. If ever England needed a special innings from Cook it is now and it would not do any harm to his plans. He has been around long enough to know his position is starting to come under scrutiny. “Four games ago I got a double-hundred. So it’s amazing how the cycle of the world goes.” Cook shuns too much technical analysis when trying to explain his longevity as an England batsman. “I try my bollocks off really; it’s as simple as that and I’ll try to do that for as long as I can.” He is also aware that there is a bit of sniping going on from outside. Mitchell Johnson, presumably doing his patriotic duty, has said: “You’ve got guys like Cook who is struggling. He can’t find form. I’d say he’s thinking about retirement.” Kevin Pietersen, for different reasons perhaps, has said Cook does not look interested. Almost wearily Cook responds to these observations: “It’s just judged on results isn’t it? The people who are saying that have had no contact with me. They wouldn’t know about the extra nets I’ve been having behind closed doors. I was with Gary [Palmer] for an hour and a half yesterday morning working on my game. That’s probably not a guy who has given in.” Oddly enough the part of his game that was faulty in Adelaide had nothing to do with his capacity to deal with the new ball. It was his batting against quality off-spin that faltered. He was moving more decisively against the pacemen than the spinner. Cook is as dedicated as they come and as a senior player he may be aghast at some of the recent antics of his colleagues but he also volunteered this information about a team who fear they are losing their connection with their fans again. “One thing I will say about this England side – and it’s even changed since I was captain – is that I’ve never seen a side work this hard. “Whether we win, lose or draw, whether we play well or rubbish, the effort from the guys is unbelievable. There is a group of men in there desperate to do well and Trevor Bayliss is cancelling practice sessions after three and a half/four hours. He’s saying: ‘You’ve go to stop now; you’re wasting energy; you’ve got to save it for the Test.’” Of course, sweat and toil on the training ground is no guarantee of success. There are never any guarantees as Cook often points out. “It doesn’t matter how many games you’ve played or what you’ve done before, you still go out on nought every time you bat whether you’re playing your first game or your 150th. It doesn’t get any easier. But that’s why it’s called Test cricket. It’s meant to be hard.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"culture/2017/dec/13/charlie-chaplin-family-join-fight-to-save-cinema-museum-london-workhouse-letter","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T07:00:13Z","webTitle":"Charlie Chaplin family join fight to save Cinema Museum in London","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/dec/13/charlie-chaplin-family-join-fight-to-save-cinema-museum-london-workhouse-letter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/dec/13/charlie-chaplin-family-join-fight-to-save-cinema-museum-london-workhouse-letter","fields":{"headline":"Charlie Chaplin family join fight to save Cinema Museum in London","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The family of Charlie Chaplin have expressed dismay over the threatened closure of the Cinema Museum in south London, which they say is “the nearest thing that Britain has to a Chaplin museum”. The museum is situated in a former Victorian workhouse in Lambeth that played an important role in the actor’s childhood. In a letter, his family write that the Lambeth Workhouse to which a young, destitute Chaplin was sent with his stepbrother and his mother – only to suffer the distress of being separated from her – is “not a celebratory piece of family history by any means, but we now recognise that this painful experience did much to mould our father’s unique creative gift”. The letter’s signatories include Chaplin’s actor daughter, Geraldine, who played Tonya in David Lean’s classic film, Doctor Zhivago. Calling for the museum to be saved, the family write: “The workhouse is a building that played a great part in our father’s early life. He and his mother and stepbrother, abandoned by their father, lived nearby, in a variety of poor lodgings, and were frequently driven to seek refuge in the workhouse. “Our father’s first encounter with Renfrew Road was when he was four … His maternal grandmother was taken there, to be transferred thereafter to a lunatic asylum. The boys were frequently given shelter when their mother was unable to look after them.” Chaplin’s time in the workhouse shaped his view of life and the characters he created, notably his screen alter ego, the Little Tramp. The Cinema Museum, a registered charity, boasts artefacts and memorabilia that tell the story of cinema from the 1890s onwards. Its collection includes more than photographs, but original posters and artwork, projectors from every era and a cane believed to be one of Chaplin’s props. The former workhouse has been the museum’s home for 19 years. The building is owned by the South London and Maudsley (Slam) NHS trust, which wants to sell it. In their letter, Chaplin’s family praise the way that the building has been “transformed” into a vital social and cultural centre, and note an “incidental reason” for saving the museum: “To show young people and future generations a survival of the ambivalent social services of the Victorian era and early 20th century.” In his autobiography, Chaplin wrote of the “shame of going to the workhouse”, recalling the “forlorn bewilderment” of being separated from his mother, Hannah, a music hall artist. “How well I remember the poignant sadness of that first visiting day: the shock of seeing Mother enter the visiting-room garbed in workhouse clothes … In one week, she had aged and grown thin, but her face lit up when she saw us. Sydney and I began to weep … Sydney and I quickly adapted ourselves to workhouse life, but in an overcast sadness,” he wrote. David Robinson, film critic and Chaplin biographer, told the Guardian: “The reaction of Chaplin’s children, that these far from happy encounters with the workhouse had much to do with the development of his unique creative power, is fascinating and I am sure correct. Any normal child exposed to the blows of his first 10 years would simply have succumbed. But this was no normal child. His gift was to survive and to transform this first-hand experience and observation of suffering and folly into an unequalled understanding of humankind.” Glenn Mitchell, author of a Chaplin encyclopaedia, said everything must be done to secure the museum’s survival. Its website notes that the lease expires in March, “implying that we can be easily evicted”. Martin Humphries, the museum’s director and co-founder, described the Chaplin family’s letter as “absolutely incredible”. The experience of coming into an institutionalised workhouse and being separated from his mother must have been psychologically traumatising for Chaplin, he said. The building, which opened in 1874 housing about 820 people, would have been a “forbidding looking” place. Humphries said the museum was among several bidders for the property. Offers in excess of £10m have been sought. The museum is working in partnership with a housing association, Family Mosaic, now part of Peabody. A Slam spokeswoman said: “As a public NHS body, it is our duty and aim to sell these properties so that we maximise the value for these assets.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/12/jack-wilshere-january-transfer-target-west-ham","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T22:31:02Z","webTitle":"Jack Wilshere a January transfer target for West Ham, says David Moyes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/12/jack-wilshere-january-transfer-target-west-ham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/12/jack-wilshere-january-transfer-target-west-ham","fields":{"headline":"Jack Wilshere a January transfer target for West Ham, says David Moyes","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"David Moyes has declared an interest in Jack Wilshere as West Ham United prepare for a transfer window he believes will be key to them avoiding relegation. Wilshere is likely to be on the Arsenal bench at West Ham on Wednesday night but his future remains unclear as he fights to earn a new contract at the Emirates and a place in England’s World Cup squad. Moyes, who is looking to build on Saturday’s shock win over Chelsea, regards the right January additions as being crucial to staying up. “You’d hope that if you took a player from another Premier League club it’d be much easier for him to go right into the team and play well,” the West Ham manager said. “Jack Wilshere would be someone who we’d have to look at if he was available. “I do believe the transfer window could be the difference between relegation and staying up. If we can get the right players, that’s the big part of it. “I also want to make sure we’re looking at players who’ve got time and who can be at the club for a long period and not just in for a short period. Then there’s also the short-term fix for me which is, how do we get enough wins between now and the end of the season? There’s a balance between that.” Moyes also sang the praises of Wilshere’s team-mate Aaron Ramsey, reiterated that he had come close to signing the Welshman for Everton. He said the practice of signing up-and-coming players had worked well during his time on Merseyside and he would like to be able to repeat such a strategy, but that it would be viable only as a longer-term approach. “I had him in my house,” Moyes said of Ramsey. “I think I had his parents in my house as well. He was coming from Cardiff and I was really trying to get him. But that was a long time ago. At that time we were always chasing the best talent, the best young and up-and-coming talent. Aaron Ramsey was certainly one of those. “I would be interested in trying something similar here. But for that strategy you need time and the spectrum in football has changed a little bit. At Everton Leighton Baines and Phil Jagielka took nearly six months to break into the team. Sometimes you buy these players for a little way down the line. “This is a window where it might not be that type of player because we need somebody who can hit the ground running. I don’t know if that’s easier said than done. “You tend to find the clubs at our end of the league are desperate to get a couple of players who can make a difference. The teams at the top end are looking for a bit of cover or something a bit extra to make sure that they don’t run out of players if they have any injuries. So you’re just never quite sure in January what players are available.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/12/cnd-wasnt-involved-in-george-blake-escape","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T19:42:24Z","webTitle":"CND wasn’t involved in George Blake’s escape | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/12/cnd-wasnt-involved-in-george-blake-escape","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/12/cnd-wasnt-involved-in-george-blake-escape","fields":{"headline":"CND wasn’t involved in George Blake’s escape","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Zoe Williams, in her review of the revival of Simon Gray’s Cell Mates at Hampstead Theatre (Review, 9 December), makes an important point about the consequences for penal reform of George Blake’s escape from Wormword Scrubs prison in October 1966. She points out that the Mountbatten report into the escape led directly to the establishment of the parole system in England and Wales. But she also quotes, and thus appears to give credence to, a statement by the documentary film-maker, George Carey, that “There were also quite a lot of people from CND who sprang him. Some … for idiosyncratic reasons, but mostly because his sentence was considered inhumane.” The first statement is simply untrue. A handful of personal friends of Pat Pottle or myself were involved, mostly after the escape had taken place, when we needed help harbouring him and getting him out of the country. Yes, they were supporters of nuclear disarmament – almost all our friends were. But CND as an organisation was not involved. Indeed initially – and understandably – its leadership reacted with consternation when the news broke. Carey is also in no position to say that some CND people acted “for idiosyncratic reasons” or indeed to make any judgment about their motivation. He never met any of them, with the exception, I believe, of the Rev John Papworth, who had publicly acknowledged his role in harbouring Blake for several days after the escape, and whose humanitarian motives are beyond question. It was to scotch speculation that CND or the KGB or prominent individuals named in the press were involved in the escape that Pat and I published our book in 1987 – The Blake Escape: How We Freed George Blake and Why. We did so knowing it would almost certainly result in our arrest and a long spell of imprisonment. Fortunately, despite the fact that Pat and I acknowledged that everything the prosecution accused us of was true and based on our book, the jury listened to our argument that the 42-year sentence on Blake was inhuman, and that the police had known about our involvement more than 20 years earlier but had taken no action at the time, and acquitted us on all counts. Michael Randle Shipley, West Yorkshire • Zoe Williams’ thoughtful article and a visit earlier in the week to see Simon Gray’s Cell Mates for the first time provoked poignant memories of my late father, who was George Blake’s official prison visitor at Wormwood Scrubs right up until his escape over the wall in October 1966. The almost farcical flit, with its distinctly Carry On elements, took Dad, who had visited him 50 times between April 1965 and 16 October 1966 (less than a week before the escape), hugely by surprise and left him hugely disappointed because Blake had been a useful antidote to the usual prison visitor diet of self-obsessed killers and robbers. “We had nearly two years of fascinating conversation,” Dad once recalled, though “never the ‘politics’ of his crime. I used to take him on each visit a small packet of Bournville plain chocolate and this modest if illegal offering (he didn’t smoke) seemed to trigger off dialogues of – at least to me – far-ranging interest.” Quentin Falk Little Marlow, Buckinghamshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2017/dec/12/strictly-inspired-alternatives-to-dad-dancing-from-harriott-hopping-to-nancy-prancing","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T16:52:45Z","webTitle":"Strictly-inspired alternatives to ‘dad-dancing’ – from Harriott Hopping to Nancy Prancing\r\n","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2017/dec/12/strictly-inspired-alternatives-to-dad-dancing-from-harriott-hopping-to-nancy-prancing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2017/dec/12/strictly-inspired-alternatives-to-dad-dancing-from-harriott-hopping-to-nancy-prancing","fields":{"headline":"Strictly-inspired alternatives to ‘dad-dancing’ – from Harriott Hopping to Nancy Prancing\r\n","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Is it time to give dancefloor dads a break? Jeremy Vine has said that the term “dad dancing” should be made illegal, as it could put off any blokes desperate for a boogie. But how would we describe that aimless-yet-adorable shuffling otherwise? Maybe some of Vine’s fellow rhythmically challenged (but much-loved) Strictly Come Dancing alumni can offer inspiration. Nancy Prancing Everyone’s favourite living Italian, Nancy Dell’Olio, made a lasting impression as she cantered and cavorted in 2011. Yes, there was a point in her tango when her partner Anton danced more convincingly with a kitchen chair, but Nancy’s ceaseless chutzpah and certainty she was the most amazing dancer ever to take the floor cast quite a spell.

While a veritable raincloud in sequins, with zero verve to speak of, for much of her torturous run in 2010, Ann did give hope to anyone out there worried they had two left feet – especially during her passionless samba in Blackpool week, where it appeared Ann had two left everything. Rinder Grin-der Grinding He may rule his courtroom, but ITV’s vampy law lord Judge Rinder was not in charge of his own face during his time on Strictly.

Picasso: Minotaurs and Matadors Gagosian, London Picasso the man, the matador, the bull and the minotaur were interchangeable presences in a show beginning with a tiny work from 1889, and ending with furious and absurd matadors and toreros painted in 1970. The core of the exhibition focused on works produced during the 1930s and 40s. Picasso’s 1942 head of a bull made from a bicycle seat with handlebars for horns, lumpen blokes on the beach, a sculpted faun with a body smaller than his erection – olé! 9. Rachel Whiteread Tate Britain, London Hot water bottles, beds, the spaces under chairs, the imprints of doors, windows and stairwells: Whiteread remakes the spaces within and around objects and places, whole rooms and entire buildings. Filling the Duveen sculpture court, and a suite of galleries opened up into one huge room, Whiteread’s show is filled with absences and solidified spaces, surfaces and volumes. The surprise is how various it all is, the constant shift of density and mass, physicality and presence. Until 21 January 8. Chris Ofili: Weaving Magic National Gallery, London Ofili turned a room at the National Gallery into an idyll. A nightclub mural of curvaceous, moustached floozies paraded and lounged around the walls in pearly grey light. The centrepiece was a large tapestry triptych, an impossible Eden before the fall. Ghanaian Italian footballer Mario Balotelli poured the drinks for a loving couple on the beach. Silent music played. This was a makeshift myth set in the tropics, liquid, languorous and lush, as vivid as a Technicolor musical. 7. Arthur Jafa: Love is the Message, the Message is Death Store Studios, London Perched on the roof of a brutalist office block, with Kanye West’s Ultralight Beam as its thundering and ecstatic soundtrack, Jafa’s exhibition sucked all the energy out of the show on the floors below. America’s iniquities, the beatings and riots, the songs and shouts of individuals and collective lives were given voice in this fierce and fractured, marvellously edited mix of found footage. A history lesson you could dance to. 6. The Boat is Leaking. The Captain Lied Fondazione Prada, Venice This has haunted me for months. Three hours was not enough in this mad melange of film, abandoned theatre sets, city corners, a church. There were control panels, there were ruins. A world out of sync, this collaboration – between Alexander Kluge, pioneer of postwar new German cinema, artist Thomas Demand, set and costume designer Anna Viebrock and curator Ugo Kittelmann – was a wonderfully nightmarish fiction. This is what Prada’s money and extreme talent can do. 5. Anne Imhof: Faust German Pavilion, Venice Biennale Imhof created a disquieting space, for her collaborators and audience alike. I haven’t a clue what this all meant – with the patrolling, fenced dogs outside, the moments of nudity and hubbub, suppressed violence and fashion posing. Small fires were lit, people were sluiced down, guitars played, people crawled about under the raised glass floor and climbed the walls. Going back every day for a week, I never saw the same thing twice. 4. America After the Fall Royal Academy, London Grant Wood’s American Gothic presided over this brilliant look at American painting from the Wall Street crash to the second world war. Enormous variety, from modernist abstraction to rural, regional romanticism, Harlem nights, gay cruising, dance marathons, lowering factories and railyards, sharecroppers in the field: it was all there. So too were Jackson Pollock and Philip Guston, painting in the wings. Meanwhile, Edward Hopper’s cinema usherette waits, for everything to be over. 3. Rodney Graham: That’s Not Me Baltic Gateshead The Vancouver-based trickster’s art filled the Baltic with images and films, as well as his own laconic music (he’s an accomplished singer and musician). But most of all, he filled the place with images of himself, as stoical lighthouse keeper, 1960s abstract painter, a camera-shop owner, and passer-by on the street. Canoeist, stilt-walking plasterer, sous chef, a dupe in a wild west bar, Graham the artist is the best guise of all. 2. Cézanne Portraits National Portrait Gallery, London Cézanne wasn’t all about the landscape, as this tough-minded exhibition shows. People in their surroundings, ordinary as rural life; people and the shapes they made, in the folds of their clothes and in the spaces on the canvas. Whoever Cézanne was painting – his wife at her sewing, his uncle in a succession of guises, a taciturn peasant, himself at work or in a bowler hat – we watch him thinking, a painting being made. 1. Wolfgang Tillmans Tate Modern, London A whole world unravelled, room after room, in this complex exhibition. Our hunger for images is insatiable and Tillmans gave us encounters with people, things, places, views, close-ups, emergencies, even the deconstructed machinery of photography itself. The exhibition dared to deal with beauty and the everyday, as well as the whole gamut of photographic manners – from street photography to formal portraiture, land and sky and seascape, the eroticism of the body and a dead colour printer disembowelled on the studio floor. It was an exhibition punctuated by interruptions and eruptions: a gigantic pair of testicles dangled; Tillmans’ own reflection looked back, blurrily and fractured, in a scarred metal mirror in Reading Gaol; a helicopter searchlight scoured the sea for survivors. Story after story unfolded, each one provoked by the connections we make as we look. Go back a second time, and the stories we tell ourselves are different. Tillmans’ exhibition was much more than a parade of passing images or a portfolio of themes unpacked. Handled with a great sense of pace and drama, scale and focus, distance and proximity, the artist paced our journey through 14 rooms. One space, filled with tables, presented his truth study centre as a kind of tabletop scrapbook of archived articles and images. It felt like an emergency room for fake news. In another, blue room, we could rest and even dance. In a third, we watched a video of Tillmans doing a boxer’s feinting dance before a mark on the wall while, on a second screen, his shadow danced across a wall in Tehran. Casting shadows and bringing things into the light, Tillmans displays an endless curiosity and purpose, a sense of responsibility and a poetic, playfulness and desire.

Now Coventry would have a chance to shout about it, said the Brookside creator Phil Redmond, chair of the city of culture judges’ panel. “Sometimes you need a visitor to come along so you can see your own city in a different way,” he said. Coventry saw off stiff competition from Paisley, Stoke-on-Trent, Swansea and Sunderland, pitching itself as a vote for the future (the average age of Coventry residents is 33, seven years younger than the national average) and filling its bid team with a diverse crowd of young people cannily backed up by a range of local businesses. Coventry Transport Museum Coventry Cathedral looms large in the city. Sir Basil Spence’s modernist masterpiece morphs seamlessly into the evocative ruins of the neighbouring St Michael’s Cathedral, destroyed during the blitz. While St Michael’s stands as a permanent memorial to Coventry’s darkest hour, its postwar replacement after the second world war became a symbol of reconciliation. Speaking to the winning bid team at the council’s offices – housed in the mock Tudor civic building built at the start of the 20th century – Redmond said it was “time to cash the cheques”. “We know these are challenging times and we can’t rely on the public purse,” he said. “But we also know that every pound invested in culture brings a return. Culture is part of the answer post-Brexit. That’s your prize, that’s what you have to go after.” A statue of Sir Frank Whittle, inventor of the turbojet engine, who was born in Coventry, and the Lady Godiva statue Having had a ride on the old Co-op sleigh into Santa’s Grotto in the Transport Museum, the arts minister John Glen said the city’s potential was one of the reasons behind its victory. “If you look at the success of Hull, it has been transformational in the sense of civic pride, but also how people view culture and the arts,” he said. “It doesn’t matter what your background is – everyone can benefit from the city of culture.” Those who have been working at the cultural heart of the city could barely contain their elation at the news. Roger Medwell, chair of the Transport Museum, said he hoped the prize would make Coventry into the destination it deserved to be – not just somewhere to pass through on the way to somewhere else. “The M45, the M1 the M6 – people go to Birmingham, but they don’t see Coventry,” he said. The Herbert art gallery “I think part of the problem is our parents didn’t like the way the city was rebuilt after the war,” said Medwell. “But it’s a wonderful city, it’s a city of fairness and fair play – and it needs to be put on the map.” Stand still long enough in Coventry and someone will tell you it was the home of the legendary Lady Godiva and played a central role in the War of the Roses. But the city’s bid also seeks to recognise more recent history, such as its postwar pedestrianised shopping area, the first to be built in the country. As part of its celebrations, it plans to put a 2.2-mile poem along its unlovely ringroad. “I loved that,” said Redmond. After the success of Hull – which has received an estimated £1bn of investment, a £60m economic boost and a huge uptick in arts participation as the 2017 city of culture – it’s little wonder that the council leader, George Duggins, looks like the cat that got the cream. “Hull has been amazing but I have promised we will do even better,” he said. “And I’m confident we can do it. Coventry is a city that delivers.” What its inhabitants will make of the installations and performance art that ensues remains to be seen, but on Friday they appeared excited about the four-year ride ahead. Khaled Dalloul, manager of Falafel Corner. “There has definitely been a more upbeat mood in the city, especially when they try our falafels, you can feel it,” said Khaled Dalloul, 22, manager of Falafel Corner. “At the end of the day, people just want to do what makes them happy, and it’s nice to be a part of the city that won the city of culture.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/08/review-to-assess-emergency-response-to-sussex-chemical-haze","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T13:50:27Z","webTitle":"Review to assess emergency response to Sussex chemical haze","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/08/review-to-assess-emergency-response-to-sussex-chemical-haze","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/08/review-to-assess-emergency-response-to-sussex-chemical-haze","fields":{"headline":"Review to assess emergency response to Sussex chemical haze","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The government has launched a review of the emergency response to the mysterious chemical haze on Sussex beaches that caused 150 people to seek hospital treatment in August. It follows criticism by MPs and victims over the failure of investigators to identify the source of the haze, which occurred at Birling Gap and Beachy Head on 27 August. Some of those affected, who reported breathing problems for weeks afterwards, said the incident exposed a lack of preparedness and potential vulnerability to more dangerous gas leaks or chemical attacks. The review has been given added urgency by a similar incident in Seaford, East Sussex, on 27 October. It will examine whether emergency responders should be required to take air samples. Dawn Whittaker, the chief fire officer for East Sussex fire and rescue, who was in charge of the emergency response at Birling Gap, welcomed the review and admitted her officers lacked the appropriate equipment. She said: “What would be helpful is something to capture an air sample in a sensible and robust way. Then the appropriate authorities could do all the testing on it. If we were in this scenario again, I wouldn’t want to be in the same position.” Whittaker said her service was willing to trial the use of specialist equipment to capture potentially toxic gases. She accepted the need to learn lessons from the incident. “In the current climate, these sorts of things could be deliberate and potentially harmful, so we just need to sharpen up,” she said. Laura Knight, a drama therapist from Brighton, had a cough and sore throat for two weeks after being evacuated from Birling Gap beach along with her partner and two young children. She said: “Given the UK has been on high alert to terrorist attacks, any response to incidents should take into account worst-case scenarios and cover all possible avenues. Had the incident affected larger populated areas such as Brighton, it would have also been dealt with differently.” A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: “The review is into the operational response and what lessons can be learned and, if it was to happen again, how that operation response would take place.” The most probable source of the haze is still thought to be fumes from a ship in the Channel illegally flushing its tanks with chemicals, but Defra has not ruled out the possibility that it could have been gas leaking from disturbed wartime shipwrecks. “Given the meteorological evidence, the most likely source was a passing ship, lost cargo or a wreck in the English Channel,” the Defra spokesman said. Stephen Lloyd, the Liberal Democrat MP for Eastbourne, who pressed Defra to launch a review, said: “We need systems in place that deal with this if it ever happens again. It should cover why there was no appropriate equipment that can hold, store and assess noxious gas.” Keith Taylor, a Green MEP, who has been lobbying for the European Maritime Agency to investigate, said: “This is not an incident that can be allowed to be brushed under the carpet. We need to find the source of the pollution and ensure similar incidents, like the Seaford episode just two months later, can be prevented and the polluters responsible held to account. “I will continue doing all I can to push for answers, and it is encouraging that the EU’s maritime agency has plans to develop drone technology to investigate more thoroughly various pollution incidents in the future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/08/top-five-the-nutcracker","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T11:37:59Z","webTitle":"Top five: The Nutcracker","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/08/top-five-the-nutcracker","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/08/top-five-the-nutcracker","fields":{"headline":"Top five: The Nutcracker","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Nothing embodies the festive season more perfectly than that colourful wooden nutcracker figure - or better yet, a trip to see the Nutcracker.

A private Downing Street poll showed support plummeting to its lowest level since Iain Duncan Smith was party leader. For more than 20 years we at Operation Black Vote (OBV) have campaigned for the parties to take minority voters more seriously, warning that the size of Britain’s black electorate shows it has the power to swing a general election. After these figures, and their likely impact on the general election result, it seems we’ve finally been proven right. Just take a glance at some of the parliamentary seats that changed hands this year, and we can begin to see that movement within a relatively small number of seats can mean a huge difference: Bedford, Bristol North-West, Derby North, Reading East, and Peterborough; in London, Battersea, Enfield Southgate, Croydon Central, and Kensington. All have significant black or Asian populations. It’s no surprise to me, then that No 10 has analysed the data, scrutinised the feedback and concluded that, if the Tories had won over the “black vote” in key marginal seats, they would now be enjoying a parliamentary majority. So what went so badly wrong for the Conservatives? For some years political leaders have recognised that with a diverse society you need to have an appeal to the whole population on the one hand, but also to specific groups, such as pensioners, young people, women, and black and minority communities. During the 2015 general election campaign, the Tory leader David Cameron went to the annual Festival of Life – and spoke to more than 40,000 black churchgoers, bringing an inclusive message: “I believe in aspiration ... I look out to this crowd and I see someone who will take my role and become prime minister for this great country.” He took the same message to other faith groups too – in one visit to a Sikh temple he wore a traditional orange patka – extolling their business and family virtues. Even without much substance, that pulpit narrative helped get him over the line to a majority government. Fast forward two years, and in a snap election Theresa May struggled to attract minority voters. On her first day as prime minister she had acknowledged: “If you’re black, you’re treated more harshly by the criminal justice system than if you’re white.” But her genuine desire to confront persistent race inequality was completely lost in the relentless mantra of “strong and stable”, “strengthen my hand” or “coalition of chaos” that marked her election campaign. By contrast, Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn had a strong message of social justice, which plays strongly among communities that face discrimination on a daily basis and bear the brunt of austerity. As a perennial outsider, Corbyn’s belief in this cause has never wavered, but this time round his masterstroke was something that mainstream politicians rarely do: that is, look beyond the 60% of people who traditionally vote. We at OBV have always argued that this untapped constituency, which is dominated by ethnic minority, working class and young voters, could render any seat winnable. Any seat. Corbyn sought to make friends and listen to a sector of society that was never on the radar of major political parties; this included black grime artists, who had hundreds of thousands of social media followers. In addition, Corbyn has a number of prominent black and Asian faces on his front bench. Thousands of young black first-time voters felt empowered, registered to vote, and voted in record numbers. So what now for May and Corbyn? May knows that the Labour leader stole a march on her, but she is responding. Last month she appointed the black activist Nero Ughwujabo as a special adviser who will work closely with her on race issues. In fact, though it was barely mentioned at this election, May has a good track record on race. She confronted the police over black deaths in custody and high levels of stop and search; and I know she’s aware that, if unchecked, race inequality will widen. That’s why she launched the historic race disparity audit; and depending how she follows it up she could have a strong platform to demonstrate a commitment to tackling burning racial injustices. But so far she’s been held back: first and foremost by her own hardline Brexiteers, who grab the headlines with a narrative that is widely perceived as anti-foreigner. Many minorities have a genuine fear that a hard Brexit will mean their equal rights protections are torn up in a “bonfire of the regulations”. For Corbyn, complacency will be the biggest challenge. For decades Labour has taken the black vote for granted, offering lip service to equality, but then continuing with business as usual. Cameron saw this and seized his opportunity in 2010 and 2015. And some early signs from Labour are troubling, such as the case of Bilal Mahmood. He twice fought as a candidate for Labour against Iain Duncan Smith in the safe seat of Chingford and Woodford Green, and made a big dent in the Tory majority. But the central party machinery then ousted him and introduced an all-women shortlist: these have historically done little for black and Asian candidates, and of course exclude Black and Asian men, who are also under-represented. In politics, as the past 18 months have shown, there are few certainties; but one of them is the growing influence of the ethnic-minority electorate that will continue to demand greater social and racial justice. Politicians ignore this at their peril. If there’s one thing we’ve learned this year, it’s that black votes matter. • Simon Woolley is the director of Operation Black Vote"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/08/michael-gove-hails-theresa-may-brexit-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T12:10:43Z","webTitle":"Gove and Johnson congratulate May on Brexit deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/08/michael-gove-hails-theresa-may-brexit-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/08/michael-gove-hails-theresa-may-brexit-deal","fields":{"headline":"Gove and Johnson congratulate May on Brexit deal","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Michael Gove and Boris Johnson have led senior Brexit supporters in congratulating Theresa May for securing a deal to withdraw the UK from the EU that promises to guarantee the rights of citizens and prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. The environment secretary, who led the Vote Leave campaign, claimed Theresa May had “won” and hailed it as a “significant personal achievement”, as he toured the broadcasters on Thursday morning in support of the deal. Johnson, who had warned that the agreement must work for the whole of the UK, added his warm words soon afterwards, saying: “Congratulations to PM for her determination in getting today’s deal. We now aim to forge a deep and special partnership with our European friends and allies while remaining true to the referendum result – taking back control of our laws, money and borders for the whole of the UK.” Their praise means May has pulled off the difficult trick of satisfying the Brexit supporters in her cabinet for now as well as EU leaders, although many thorny issues are still to be worked out at a later stage. Some of the most hardline leave supporters still had reservations but noted that “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed”, which they interpret to mean the withdrawal agreement only goes ahead if there is a wider trade deal. The prime minister made several concessions, including a divorce bill that officials estimate at £35bn-£39bn and allowing British courts to refer cases about EU citizens to the European court of justice for another eight years. But Gove insisted this was acceptable as it was “time-limited” and argued any Brexit supporter should be delighted that the UK would be free from the ECJ, the single market and customs union. He also defended the promise of “full alignment” with the EU to ensure no hard border in Northern Ireland if there were no deal, saying it was right for the UK to have the same goals on standards for issues such as the environment. Other former Vote Leave supporters also gave their seal of approval to the prime minister, including Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, Priti Patel, the former development secretary, and Matthew Elliott, who ran the main leave campaign. Senior cabinet ministers pushing for a softer Brexit – including the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and the home secretary, Amber Rudd – also expressed their satisfaction that a deal had been done, which should allow the UK and EU to move on to trade talks. Opposition parties welcomed the progress made but highlighted the time the deal had taken and the short period left to agree on trade before the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said it was good that trade talks could start but the public needed to know “the political price of compromise”. He said: “The priority for both sides now must be to agree transitional arrangements on the same basic terms as we have now. That means staying in the single market and customs union for a time-limited period. We will also need to know the political price of the deal struck and the impact any compromise that has been agreed will have on our future relationship with the EU. “As the talks now move on to a discussion about Britain’s future relationship with the European Union, Theresa May must seriously reflect on her approach to the negotiations so far. We cannot have another year of chaos and confusion or the farcical scenes we saw earlier on in the week that put jobs and the economy at risk.” The SNP leader and first minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, said the move on to phase two of talks was good “but the devil is in the detail and things now get really tough”. She said she still believed that staying in the single market and customs union was the only sensible option and argued any special arrangements for Northern Ireland must be available to other UK nations. However, some of the most hardline Brexit supporters still had some concerns. Owen Paterson, a Conservative former cabinet minister and member of the Leave Means Leave group, said it was a big improvement on the earlier text but there were “still problematic areas including clause 49 (on full alignment), the role of the European court of justice and money”. “At last we are moving to free trade discussions. Problem areas must be debated and resolved. Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,” he added. John Redwood, another former cabinet minister, welcomed the fact that the EU had agreed to talk about trade but added: “Everyone needs to remember that today’s agreement is not the agreement on the UK leaving the EU. It is an agreement to talk about all matters, and is still governed by the crucial principle that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.” Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, was less complimentary, saying the breakthrough meant it was now time to “move on to the next stage of humiliation”. Likewise, the founder of the Leave.EU movement, Arron Banks, said: “It’s confirmed, Theresa May has betrayed the country and the 17.4 million leave voters.” Banks said that “this traitorous, lily-livered embarrassment of a prime minister” had overseen “the biggest sell-out of this country” since Edward Heath took the UK into the EU in 1973. “Full regulatory alignment with the internal market and customs union? We may as well just bend over and allow the European Union to have its way with us for years to come,” said Banks. “Pledging to honour financial commitments beyond 2020? Brussels would have been lucky had we agreed to honour them up until March 2019. “Under Theresa May, we are leaving the European Union in name only. If anyone in the Conservative party has any integrity or sense of duty left, we call on them now to save Brexit by triggering a leadership contest. Tory backbenchers, get writing to the 1922 Committee and help save your country. She has got to go.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/01/north-korea-casts-nuclear-shadow-over-asias-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-01T05:00:01Z","webTitle":"North Korea casts nuclear shadow over Asia's 2018","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/01/north-korea-casts-nuclear-shadow-over-asias-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/01/north-korea-casts-nuclear-shadow-over-asias-2018","fields":{"headline":"North Korea casts nuclear shadow over Asia's 2018","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes dominated Asia-Pacific’s geopolitical landscape in 2017, and will loom large throughout the year ahead. Pyongyang is enjoying better returns on each test, with the rest of the world seemingly helpless to resist its self-sponsored application to join the global nuclear club. Its most recent launch involved a powerful intercontinental ballistic missile that, in theory, puts all of America’s major cities within range. Evidence that the regime is mastering the technology needed to guide a missile back into Earth’s atmosphere could emerge in the first few months of 2018. It’s unclear how Donald Trump’s administration intends to make good on its promise to “deny” Pyongyang the ability to strike the US mainland. In the 11 months since he took office, the president has failed to articulate a coherent plan to denuclearise the Korean peninsula – and some analysts believe he should now accept that Pyongyang’s nuclear genie is out of the bottle. Repeated attempts to cajole China into inflicting tangible economic pain on North Korea have had mixed results. Beijing has signed off on UN security council sanctions, but is unlikely to deliver what Trump believes would be the decisive blow of stopping oil supplies – a move China fears could foment regime collapse and create a vacuum filled by South Korea and its US ally. There is little to suggest that Trump has a diplomatic ace up his sleeve. The biggest test of Trump’s Asia policy will come if Pyongyang convinces the US, through more tests, that it can send a nuclear-armed missile all the way to Washington. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, declared on Monday the US should be aware that his country’s nuclear forces were now a reality, not a threat. In a live TV broadcast of his annual New Year’s Day address, Kim said the North’s nuclear forces had been “completed”, adding that the nuclear launch button was on his desk. “This year we should focus on mass producing nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles for operational deployment,” he said. “These weapons will be used only if our security is threatened.” The removal of any doubt over the North’s ability to strike the US could have profound consequences for Japan and South Korea, where fears will grow that Washington’s commitment to their security will waver if the US joins them in Kim’s crosshairs. Simply put, would the US be prepared to trade San Francisco for Seoul? A year of provocations from North Korea have played into the hands of Shinzo Abe, Japan’s conservative prime minister, who successfully fought this autumn’s general election on the “national crisis” created by the looming missile threat. Abe is expected to strengthen Japan’s security in the next 12 months through more defence cooperation with the US, and the reported acquisition of cruise missiles to take out North Korean military targets in pre-emptive strikes – a stance that sits uncomfortably with Tokyo’s strictly defensive postwar posture. Abe and his allies view their country’s postwar pacifism as an anomaly – a concession necessitated by wartime defeat but which now is an unfair constraint on its ability to defend itself against North Korea, and counter Chinese attempts to control over seas near the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. Abe is expected to put forward an amendment to the constitution that would legalise the status of the self-defence forces, which are a standing military in all but name. Abe has the votes he needs in parliament but must persuade a sceptical public to back him in a referendum. China’s president, Xi Jinping, will meanwhile play an increasingly important role on the world stage as Trump reduces US diplomatic efforts, especially in international treaties and tackling climate change. Xi is also likely to step up his overhaul of the military and the sweeping campaign against corruption. The Chinese leader secured a second five-year term in October and has signalled he wants to extend his fight beyond the ruling Communist party to 62 million government workers. Growth in the Chinese economy will continue to slow, unlike fellow Bric country India, which, according to a recent forecast, is set to replace Japan as the world’s third-biggest economy by 2028. The US is also preparing to take a tougher stance on trade policies with China, which could lead to a full-scale trade war if it retaliates. In India, Narendra Modi will continue to dominate politics but his sheen could start to wear off in 2018. How the economy fares will be crucial to the political fortunes of the Indian prime minister, as the country gears up for the biggest democratic exercise in the world, its months-long, multi-stage national polls, the results of which won’t be known until May 2019. The rivalry in the region between China and India intensified in 2017 as soldiers from the two countries engaged in a months-long standoff in territory belonging to tiny Bhutan (or to China, according to Beijing). No shots were fired and both sides eventually disengaged, but analysts said such confrontations might become increasingly dangerous as China aggressively expands its influence in south Asia. Next year will also be crucial for the more than 500,000 Rohingya Muslims who fled persecution in Myanmar to Bangladesh over the past months. The next year could see the implementation of an agreement between Burmese and Bangladeshi officials to begin repatriating the refugees – a fraught process that could see many suffer reprisals or further persecution upon their return, as well as the same systematic discrimination the community has suffered for decades."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/14862","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-26T00:00:33Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 14,862","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/14862","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/14862","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 14,862","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/12/the-silicon-valley-paradox-one-in-four-people-are-at-risk-of-hunger","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T11:00:32Z","webTitle":"The Silicon Valley paradox: one in four people are at risk of hunger","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/12/the-silicon-valley-paradox-one-in-four-people-are-at-risk-of-hunger","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/12/the-silicon-valley-paradox-one-in-four-people-are-at-risk-of-hunger","fields":{"headline":"The Silicon Valley paradox: one in four people are at risk of hunger","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Karla Peralta is surrounded by food. As a line cook in Facebook’s cafeteria, she spends her days preparing free meals for the tech firm’s staff. She’s worked in kitchens for most of her 30 years in the US, building a life in Silicon Valley as a single mother raising two daughters. But at home, food is a different story. The region’s soaring rents and high cost-of-living means that even with a full-time job, putting food on the table hasn’t been simple. Over the years she has struggled to afford groceries – at one point feeding her family of three with food stamps that amounted to $75 a week, about half what the government describes as a “thrifty” food budget. “I was thinking, when am I going to get through this?” she said. In a region famed for its foodie culture, where the well-heeled can dine on gold-flecked steaks, $500 tasting menus and $29 loaves of bread, hunger is alarmingly widespread, according to a new study shared exclusively with the Guardian. One in four people in Silicon Valley are at risk of hunger, researchers at the Second Harvest food bank have found. Using hundreds of community interviews and data modeling, a new study suggests that 26.8% of the population – almost 720,000 people – qualify as “food insecure” based on risk factors such as missing meals, relying on food banks or food stamps, borrowing money for food, or neglecting bills and rent in order to buy groceries. Nearly a quarter are families with children. “We call it the Silicon Valley paradox,” says Steve Brennan, the food bank’s marketing director. “As the economy gets better we seem to be serving more people.” Since the recession, Second Harvest has seen demand spike by 46%. The bank is at the center of the Silicon Valley boom – both literally and figuratively. It sits just half a mile from Cisco’s headquarters and counts Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg among its major donors. But the need it serves is exacerbated by this industry’s wealth; as high-paying tech firms move in, the cost of living rises for everyone else. Food insecurity often accompanies other poverty indicators, such as homelessness. San Jose, Silicon Valley’s largest city, had a homeless population of more than 4,000 people during a recent count. They are hungry, too: research conducted by the Health Trust, a local not-for-profit, found food resources available to them are scattered and inadequate. These days Peralta earns too much to qualify for food stamps, but not enough not to worry. She pays $2,000 a month – or three-quarters of her paycheck – to rent the small apartment she shares with her youngest daughter. “Even just the two of us, it’s still a struggle.” So once a month, she picks up supplies at the food bank to supplement what she buys at the store. She isn’t one to complain, but acknowledges the vast gulf between the needs of Facebook employees and contract workers such as herself. “The first thing they do [for Facebook employees] is buy you an iPhone and an Apple computer, and all these other benefits,” she laughs. “It’s like, wow.” ••• The scale of the problem becomes apparent on a visit to Second Harvest, the only food bank serving Silicon Valley and one of the largest in the country. In any given month it provides meals for 257,000 people – 66m pounds of food last year. Inside its cavernous, 75,000 sq ft main warehouse space, boxes of produce stretched to the ceiling. Strip lights illuminated crates of cucumbers and pallets of sweet potatoes with a chilly glow. Volunteers in PayPal T-shirts packed cabbages and apples that arrived in boxes as big as paddling pools, while in the walk-in freezer turkeys waited to defrost.

Photography: Talia Herman Because poverty is often shrouded in shame, their clients’ situations can come as a surprise. “Often we think of somebody visibly hungry, the traditional homeless person,” Brennan said. “But this study is putting light on the non-traditional homeless: people living in their car or a garage, working people who have to choose between rent and food, people without access to a kitchen.” He added, “You’re not thinking when you pick up your shirts from dry cleaning, or getting your landscaping done, or going to a restaurant, or getting your child cared for, ‘is that person hungry?’ It’s very easy to assume they are fine.” Matt Sciamanna is the sort of person you would assume is fine. He’s young, clever, and a recent graduate from San Jose State University. Yet here on campus, he says, food insecurity is a daily problem. Students, and even part-time professors, have been known to sleep in their cars or couch surf to save money. Sciamanna, who works on the Student Hunger Committee, says a survey of more than 4,000 students found about half have skipped meals due to the cost. His investment in the issue is informed by his own experience. With his parents unable to finance all his living costs, Sciamanna worked in a restaurant while studying full time. But at 20 he was hit with a life-changing diagnosis: multiple sclerosis, a disease that left his grandmother bedridden. Unable to keep up with the pressures of restaurant work, he took a job on campus that paid just $400 a month. Matt Sciamanna studying. Photo: Jeromy Ceseña “My weekly food budget, after other expenses, was $25-$30,” he says. Trips to the grocery store became a game of numbers: a bag of apples and bananas cost less than $5 and would last a week. A bag of frozen vegetables, another $5. “Sometimes I would see a ripe peach, and I would want it, but then I’d think, damn, they’re $1.50 each. It’s not like I’m asking for a car. I’m just talking about a peach. That feeling leaves a scar.” While Sciamanna says his food situation has improved, another fear looms: healthcare costs. His father, a garbage man in San Francisco, has already postponed retirement so that his son can stay on the family’s insurance. Without it, Sciamanna says he could face out-of-pocket costs of thousands of dollars a month for his medication. In that scenario, obtaining food would become even more difficult. His parents live in Clear Lake, three hours outside San Francisco, meaning a six-hour daily commute for his father. “You feel like you’re this dead weight, you’re trying to advance yourself but you don’t have the money. It’s a shitty feeling.” ••• Hunger and the housing crisis go hand-in-hand. In Santa Clara County, the median price of a family home has reached a new high of $1.125m, while the supply of homes continues to shrink. A family of four earning less than $85,000 is now considered low income. These realities mean food insecurity cuts across lines of race, age and employment status. On a cold, bright afternoon at an elementary school in Menlo Park, kids trickled out of their classrooms and onto the playground. A food distribution was being arranged in the school gymnasium, and adults lined up outside with strollers and shopping carts, waiting for the doors to open. Most were women, many of them mothers whose children attend the school. Once inside they moved slowly and quietly around tables filled with bags of fresh produce, milk and bread, canned goods and beans. A food distribution taking place at an elementary school in Menlo Park. Bottom right, Vicky Avila-Medrano, a food connection specialist with Second Harvest. Photography: Talia Herman The Latino community is “passing through a hard time”, says Vicky Avila-Medrano, a food connection specialist. She runs a program that sends current and former food bank users out into the community, which has been disproportionately affected by the cost-of-living crisis. “Here in Silicon Valley, we have a big problem. This is a beautiful place to live for people in the tech industry, but we are not working in that industry.” Even people who have full-time jobs can find themselves with no way to put food on the table. Outside the gym, Martina Rivera, a 52-year-old mental health nurse, explained that her troubles began when her entire building was evicted last year. (Mass evictions have swept the area as landlords seek higher-paying tenants). Issues in her personal life, which she preferred not to detail, left her separated from her two children and their father. She thought about moving in with family, but worried about the burden. “My brother was recovering from a stroke, and my mother is old,” she says. “I couldn’t put more struggle on them. So what I found was my car.” Martina Rivera, 52, originally from Peru, lived in her car for six months while working as a nurse. She told herself it was only temporary. “I work night shifts at a veterans hospital, so I would go to my mom’s house to shower, and wait until it was time to work. I waited and waited for the storm to pass.” Eventually she found a room without a private bathroom or kitchen. She shopped for food at 99 cent stores, ate mainly canned food, and cooked in a microwave. It took a toll on her health, she says; she gained weight. “I was having panic attacks. My body was like the walking dead. But I thought, I need to keep strong. And I never quit my job.” Rivera says that for many working people, pride is a barrier to admitting need. “People don’t have money to buy food, but they are shy to ask. But there is no reason to feel ashamed.” The day before Thanksgiving, Karla Peralta invited me to her home. She loves to cook, and prides herself on pulling together a healthy meal even when resources are scarce. “I have to cook with what I have. Even if I only have a piece of chicken, a little bit of this and that, I am a cook. I make it work.” Karla Peralta, who works in the cafeteria at Facebook, demonstrates in her kitchen how she cooks with ingredients she picks up from the food bank. Photography: Charlotte Simmonds That evening she worked with ingredients from the food bank: potatoes and chicken, cans of beans, corn and tomatoes. Dignified and good humored, Peralta says her current job is one of the best she’s ever had, even though she still needs help. As we sat down at her kitchen table to share a meal, we talk about her plans for tomorrow’s holiday meal. She’ll be making ham with pineapples, her daughter’s favorite. There will be turkey and mashed potatoes, and her niece is bringing bread. “And we got some rice from the food bank,” she said. “I’ll probably make that, too.” Do you have an experience of homelessness to share with the Guardian?

Greenhouse gas emissions continued to rise in recent quarters, with the most recent the second highest for any quarter since 2011, despite electricity emissions being driven down by wind generation. The government’s official public release of data on emissions is now six months behind and NDEVR Environmental’s estimations attempt to mirror that methodology. Released in partnership with Guardian Australia, the results have proven very accurate when compared with data eventually released by the federal government. The ever-increasing emissions are taking Australia further from both its carbon-reduction commitments made in Paris and the much bigger reductions demanded by the science-based targets, recommended by the government’s Climate Change Authority. NDEVR found emissions in the most recent quarter soared to levels only seen once in the past six years. That came despite massive jumps in wind-generated electricity in Victoria and New South Wales, which more than doubled, pushing down emissions from the National Electricity Market. But emissions from transport were at record levels, with jumps in the use of diesel and aviation fuel. Emissions in all other sectors either remained stable or increased slightly. Matt Drum, founder of NDEVR, said their results show carbon emissions are not going to drop until proper climate policy is in place. He said the drop in emissions from electricity was driven by market forces, not policy. “If you don’t foster renewable energy, it’s only going to get worse,” Drum said. In both 2015 and 2016, the government quietly released data showing rising emissions on the days before Christmas, with this year’s data still not released just two weeks out from Christmas. And, for the past two years, documents released under freedom of information laws have shown the government has had the data for months before releasing it. “They might drop it just before Christmas again but it’s not much of a Christmas present for Australia’s emission profile and it goes to show that Australia’s climate policy needs a lot of work,” Drum said. Last week, the Climate Council called on the government to end what it called “climate censorship”. “At a time when Australia’s federal climate and energy policy remains in limbo, it has never been more important for transparent pollution information,” the Climate Council chief executive, Amanda McKenzie, said. “Continuing to keep the information hidden just raises questions about what there is to hide. “For several years, there’s been a consistent delay from the Department of the Environment and Energy’s national greenhouse gas inventory on releasing vital emissions data. This raises serious questions over the federal government’s transparency on Australia’s pollution levels.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/08/oscars-academy-awards-weinstein-scandal-what-will-happen","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T08:01:36Z","webTitle":"'We're in uncharted territory': Oscars on edge after Harvey Weinstein scandal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/08/oscars-academy-awards-weinstein-scandal-what-will-happen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/08/oscars-academy-awards-weinstein-scandal-what-will-happen","fields":{"headline":"'We're in uncharted territory': Oscars on edge after Harvey Weinstein scandal","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Hollywood usually appreciates dramatic metaphors but when wildfires roared into Los Angeles this week no one said: oh look, just like the Oscars. It’s a bit too early in awards season to know whether sexual misconduct scandals will immolate or merely singe the film industry’s annual ritual of red carpets, speeches and gongs. But few doubt that the toxic air swirling around Hollywood will affect and potentially disrupt the 90th Oscars, starting with next month’s nominations and the event itself on 4 March. “They’re ‘deer in the headlights’ at the moment,” said Richard Rushfield, who publishes an entertainment industry newsletter, The Ankler. “They have no idea how to deal with this stuff. They should just shut down for a year or two until this blows over.” Fresh revelations this week from the New York Times this week about the “complicity machine” behind Harvey Weinstein’s predations cast a pall of questions over studio executives, lawyers, publicists, agents, managers and others who play roles in awards campaigning and voting. The cascade of exposés, showing how swaths of the industry colluded in or turned a blind eye to abuses by Weinstein and others, seemingly evokes the plot of Murder on the Orient Express: they all did it. The febrile mood and #MeToo movement leaves the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences grappling for answers: can it avoid nominating people suspected of sexual misconduct? If alleged wrongdoers are shortlisted can it rescind nominations? Can host Jimmy Kimmel avert a ratings slump when he steps on to the Dolby theatre stage? “We are in uncharted territory,” said Michele Burke, a two-times Oscar winner for makeup who sits on the Academy’s executive committee. Burke, who spoke in a personal capacity, shuddered at the prospect of nominations triggering a fresh round of allegations. “I hope not. That would be awful – to wait until someone’s been nominated.” The sooner wrongdoing was exposed the better, she said. As for possibly revoking nominations, that too was uncharted, said Burke. “I honestly don’t know.” She echoed many in predicting that women will do well in the awards. “Women in front of and behind the camera will certainly be highlighted … we are experiencing a ‘moment’, the intent of which is to shift the working relationship between men and women.” It helped, said Burke, that there happened to be a crop of very strong female-led and female-centric films. Hollywood pundits have tipped first time director Greta Gerwig’s Lady Bird, starring Saoirse Ronan, for a possible sweep. There is also speculation that Patty Jenkins’s Wonder Woman, starring Gal Gadot, could become the first superhero blockbuster to grab top gongs. A female-centric zeitgeist could lock Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk and Joe Wright’s Darkest Hour out of best picture, though Gary Oldman is a best actor frontrunner for his depiction of Winston Churchill. “Post-nomination announcements are likely to have pundits in a frenzy by the sheer number of women recognized. But remember it was a particularly robust year for women,” said Richard Licata, CEO of Licata &amp; Co, a veteran awards strategist. He cited Lady Bird, The Shape of Water, Molly’s Game and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. The Oscars may also be buffeted by another #OscarsSoWhite controversy if, as expected, few actors of colour – possibly none – are nominated. The Academy has more than 8,000 members and along with the executive committee is run by a 51-member board of governors, with three governors each from the Academy’s 17 branches. It is a largely ceremonial body, a chamber of commerce for the movie business, said Rushfield. “It was never intended to be an arbiter on hot button issues. They’ve been thrust into this role and would give anything to have it removed. They’re not a crisis PR firm that’s ready to leap into action.” After the revelations about Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, and Louis CK, and allegations against Brett Ratner, Jeffrey Tambor (which both have denied) and dozens of others, many agree that the Academy cannot simply funnel stars on to a stage to present trophies along with some songs and comedy. Already there is controversy over Casey Affleck being slated to present the best actress award. The Manchester by the Sea star has faced harassment allegations, which he has denied. “There are all sorts of whispers about people. The Academy has no precedent for how to deal with something like this. It’s endless, and they’re ill equipped,” said Rushfield. Some, however, credit the Academy, which for decades ignored controversy over Roman Polanksi and Woody Allen, with newfound responsiveness. After revelations about Weinstein broke last October it swiftly expelled the producer and established a code of conduct with “a policy for evaluating alleged violations and determining if action regarding membership is warranted”. “If a misconduct controversy rears its ugly head concerning a frontrunner, studios and campaigners will have to pivot and make responsible decisions – not just for the sake of the film or actor involved but for the reputation of their organisation,” said Licata, the strategist. The code empowered the Academy to cap any eruptions, said Sasha Stone, who runs the site Awards Daily. “If allegations were serious enough they could pull that person from the list of nominees.” Donald Trump and his supporters could pose a different challenge, said Stone, by trolling the Oscars as a bastion of perverts and abusers, an opportunity to bash liberal Hollywood despite Trump’s own record of harassment and abuse allegations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"crosswords/weekend/369","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T00:00:35Z","webTitle":"Weekend crossword No 369","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/weekend/369","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/weekend/369","fields":{"headline":"Weekend crossword No 369","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/08/rory-mcilroy-harry-diamond-caddie-2018-golf-season-masters","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T11:04:40Z","webTitle":"Rory McIlroy sticks with best friend as his caddie for the 2018 season","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/08/rory-mcilroy-harry-diamond-caddie-2018-golf-season-masters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/08/rory-mcilroy-harry-diamond-caddie-2018-golf-season-masters","fields":{"headline":"Rory McIlroy sticks with best friend as his caddie for the 2018 season","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Harry Diamond will remain Rory McIlroy’s caddie into the 2018 season, the Guardian can reveal, closing the door on one of the most lucrative and courted positions in the game. When the season begins, McIlroy’s latest tilt at a grand slam of major championships will include an unprecedented eight events before he tees off at the Masters in April. Diamond is McIlroy’s best friend and a decorated amateur player in his own right. He caddied for the four-time major champion for seven events in 2017 during widespread speculation as to where McIlroy would turn next following the ending of a long-time alliance with JP Fitzgerald. McIlroy has decided a continued and positive connection with Diamond, who is also close to the former world No1’s coach Michael Bannon, is preferable to trying to establish a new relationship with a caddie. McIlroy earlier admitted he had been inundated with offers from people looking to succeed Fitzgerald. McIlroy’s buildup to the Masters, the one major that eludes him, will mean appearances at the HSBC Championship in Abu Dhabi, the Dubai Desert Classic, the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, the Genesis Open, the Honda Classic, the Valspar Championship, the Arnold Palmer Invitational and the World Match Play Championship. The worldwide commercial appeal of McIlroy, whose campaign this season was beset by injury, was endorsed this week as he agreed an extension of a multi-year deal with Omega. TaylorMade and Nike have similarly long-term agreements with the 28-year-old Sources close to McIlroy report his core fitness and attitude as perfect, after a frustrating season when a rib injury caused recurring back pain and stunted his progress. The 2014 Open champion had expressed his desire to use this off-season to kickstart a fresh career chapter. “I’m not getting any younger,” McIlroy said before embarking on an extended break. “These three months off could give me the foundation to have the next 10 years be even better than the 10 years I’ve just had. Hopefully, that turns a great career into one of the greatest careers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"culture/2018/jan/08/how-we-made-the-swatch","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T17:09:06Z","webTitle":"How we made the Swatch","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jan/08/how-we-made-the-swatch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/jan/08/how-we-made-the-swatch","fields":{"headline":"How we made the Swatch","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Elmar Mock, co-inventor My first dream wasn’t to make a watch. It was to have an injection moulding machine. It was 1980 and I was working as a watchmaking engineer at the Swiss company ETA. That machine represented the very latest technology. The only thing was it cost 500,000 Swiss francs. Anyway, without any authority, I just put in the order. Then, at 11am one day, I got a call from the general manager, telling me to be in his office at 1pm. I knew I was close to being fired – the firm had got rid of 4,000 people in one year. I had a choice: go in crying, “Please don’t fire me,” – or say, “Hey boss, this will be interesting for you.” I had two hours to come up with a proposal. I went straight to my colleague, Jacques Müller. For a month, we had been thinking about a new watch. Jacques sketched a childlike pink and blue quartz model made of plastic. For the first half-hour of that meeting, my boss used me as a punchbag. He just kept asking if I was crazy. But it turned out that he had been looking to manufacture a cheap Swiss watch. He gave us six months. It was 15 months before we had a prototype, though. At one point, due to an engineering mistake, the hands turned backwards. By late 1981, we had five completed watches – but they stopped working after five days. Although the Swatch is now known as a fashion item, our focus was just to make it cheap. Our big innovation was to use ultrasonic welding to build the mechanism straight into the case, which was made of the same type of plastic used in Lego. We decided that every screw was a danger: if you can screw something, it can unscrew. So everything is welded, making it watertight. Since this means it cannot be taken apart, we had to produce something of the highest quality that would not need repairing. It also meant we could halve the number of parts to just 51. The result was a watch three times cheaper than any other that could be produced in Switzerland. My first production target was 50,000 watches. Swatch has now sold more than 700m. Has it made me rich? Well, a year after the product went on sale, I got 700 Swiss francs as a thank you bonus. Franz Sprecher, marketing consultant When I was brought in, the Swatch was just a plain black model that would sell for $20. The aim was to beat the Japanese. I said: “If you do that, you will sell maybe 500,000 and then it’s gone.” It was important to make a brand, not a commodity. It had initially been called Vulgaris, but I came up with Swatch, from Swiss and watch. It wasn’t sexy but we knew that, although Switzerland had lost a lot of momentum to the Japanese, anyone who owned a Japanese watch would still pretend to have a Swiss one. One slogan I was pleased with was: “You don’t wear the same tie every day, do you?” It expressed my philosophy: “This is a fashion accessory that ticks.” Funnily enough, lots of customers started complaining about the noise. They weren’t used to it. Because the mechanism was built directly into the case, it caused vibrations. People said: “Oh, they’ve made a watch that ticks! And you cannot sleep! And in a concert, everybody hears it!” So we came up with another slogan: “It’s only Swatch that ticks.” We turned it around, making the point that, if it doesn’t tick, it’s not a Swatch. In the US, people would queue up whenever a new collection came out. I remember standing in The Plaza hotel in New York and noticing that all the yuppies were wearing Swatches. It was a statement: “I don’t need a Rolex.” A lot of designers and artists wanted to design their own. Keith Haring’s were a big hit.

Richard Dawson’s latest long-player doesn’t exactly scream “Best of 2017”, but there was something in Peasant’s detailed vignettes of dark ages beggars, weavers and prostitutes that felt unexpectedly resonant in 2017, a timely work from another time. Dawson has previous on excavating the distant past to explain the present. The Newcastle singer-songwriter’s 2013 album The Glass Trunk was inspired by a search for clippings on the subject of death at the Tyne and Wear museum archive. He dug up some remarkable finds – none more than the poem that inspired live favourite Poor Old Horse, a blackly comic account of three tanners yard workers’ fruitless and exceedingly brutal attempts to put a nag out of its misery. At the same time though there was something slightly callous about the exercise, a feeling that its author was a little too in love with the notion of the past as a period of brutality and squalor. Certainly, Peasant has its own fair share of brutality and squalor – whooping cough, sex slavery, death by bog – but there’s also a sense of a world that’s lived-in and familiar. In an interview with the Guardian’s Laura Barton earlier this year Dawson expressed a growing “feeling that times are right next to each other”, and what Peasant does with such remarkable clarity is to convey the sense that its characters’ concerns, fears, hopes, failings and irrationalities are consistent with our own, even as their world of urine-soaked woad and rancid smithies remains utterly alien. Perhaps not that alien, though: shot through Peasant’s tragic kingdom is a looming sense of society frayed by the severing of relations with a foreign force (in this instance the Roman empire), of paranoia and confusion and superstition trumping reason and logic. Sound familiar? Oh and while we’re at it, find me a more prescient lyric in the age of Weinstein than the cry in Masseuse of “I am tired of men / Of kneading the knots from their bulbous backs and necks.” This heightened sense of empathy is matched by a new level of accessibility to Dawson’s composition. He has a reputation for creating music that borders on the impenetrable, comparable to Derek Bailey’s or the more outre end of Scott Walker’s output. That’s a shade unfair – his songs have always boasted a skewed tunefulness, buried though it was beneath layers of dissonant feedback – but certainly Peasant is the first Dawson album that could be described as legitimately earwormy. His melodies still zag where you expect them to zig, but in a way that feels thrilling rather than deliberately difficult. The exuberant gang vocals of Ogre could almost be mistaken for Belle and Sebastian or Los Campesinos, if either of those bands ever sang about forming a search party to locate the body of a missing child, while the delicate folk of Beggar shows off Dawson’s surprisingly sweet falsetto. Dawson began working with a voice coach last year (one of the first changes he was ordered to make was to stop knocking back several pints before performing live) and it’s notable how greatly improved his vocal performance is here. His was always a formidable baritone – capable of silencing the rowdiest of backroom bars – but here it feels deeper, richer and more versatile, a character as well defined as any he sings about on this record. Meanwhile, his gristly, Beefheart-inspired guitar lines have been firmed up by flourishes of brass, strings and harp, providing sunbursts of unexpected poignancy. No moment is more poignant than on Peasant’s standout track, Soldier. It’s sung from the perspective of a military grunt preparing reluctantly for battle, who simply wants to go home to his partner and live a quiet life. “I am tired, I am afraid / my heart is full of dread”, he sings in the song’s chorus. It’s a genuinely heartbreaking moment, but it’s when Dawson suddenly replaces “dread” with “hope” in the final refrain that his deep dive into the past becomes affectingly real. For a moment, you’re right there with him. (buy here) This article contains affiliate links to products.

The new nation in the north of Europe was created by a pragmatic first world wartime agreement between two extremely different socialist governments: Finland’s democratically elected one (the first of its kind in the world) under Oskari Tokoi, and Russia’s new revolutionary regime under Lenin, which would change the world in more violent ways. Classical music likes an anniversary, and Finland’s centenary was marked by two fine concerts on successive days in London, one in the Barbican Hall, the other in the Royal Festival Hall. Two of the most notable of Finland’s many great orchestral conductors presided over the occasions: Sakari Oramo with the BBC Symphony Orchestra in the first, Esa-Pekka Salonen with the Philharmonia in the second. It is not surprising, though it was a little disappointing, that the programmes were very similar. Both consisted entirely of Sibelius, with Oramo’s concert climaxing in an impassioned account of the first symphony and Salonen’s in an outstanding rendering of the Lemminkäinen Legends. Each programme featured a soloist, British cellist Guy Johnston with Oramo in the rarely played Two Serious Melodies, and the Norwegian Vilde Frang in a daringly fragile account of the much performed violin concerto under Salonen. Both programmes, with a certain inevitability, also began with Finlandia, which became, after it finally acquired the title by which we now know it, the musical embodiment of the new Finnish nation. Salonen’s performance was precise and brilliant, but it was Oramo who made the national warhorse really sing, giving Finlandia in its original context (where it is entitled Finland Awakes) – the finale of Sibelius’s unprepossessingly named seven-movement Music for the Press Celebrations (my journalistic heart beat faster nevertheless). By long and common consent, Sibelius remains Finland’s national composer. That accolade should not be disrespected or dismissed. But it should be examined. Sibelius is, of course, a world figure, an exceptional artist, and he was a lifelong Finnish patriot. His art is rooted in Finland’s 19th-century national cultural revival, above all in the folk epic Kalevala, which was collected and first published in 1835 by Elias Lönnrot and which would be an unfailing source of inspiration for the composer from the early Kullervo symphony to his last orchestral masterpiece Tapiola. Sibelius was also a Finnish nationalist, both politically and, for him, in the more lastingly important sense that he embraced the movement for a Finnish national consciousness in the face of Russian rule and attempts to impose Russification. Yet his status as the national composer of Finland is not unproblematic. The understandable deference that was attached to him and his achievement for so long had its oppressive side for Finnish music, as well as providing Finnish musicians with a passport to the wider world. It is worth remembering, for example, that the 20th-century image of Sibelius, much embodied in iconic late photographs and statues, as a granite, defiant patriotic northerner was to some extent and understandably a cold war image. An image shaped by Finland’s dangerous frontline position on the borders of the Soviet Union, and as a nation invaded by the Red Army in 1939-40, that lost parts of its territory back to Russia within a generation of independence. Perhaps even more importantly, as the 2009 biography by Glenda Dawn Goss makes clear, Sibelius studies have undergone a considerable and continuing period of revisionism – of which Salonen can be seen as an embodiment in the concert hall, and in which the cult of Sibelius has been deconstructed and re-examined by later generations of Finns and non-Finns in a less nationalistic and less heroic light. This revisionism asks questions that do not subvert Sibelius’s eminence, but are less hidebound and reverential than in the 20th century. Sibelius was, after all, part of Finland’s Swedish-speaking minority (as was his great early champion Robert Kajanus). He spoke Swedish as his first language, wrote his diaries in Swedish, gave his daughters Swedish names and, when interviewed by Finnish radio in 1948 at the age of 83, asked if he might speak in Swedish (the request was firmly quashed). Sibelius was 52 when Finland became independent. He lived the majority of his life under Russian rule and was much influenced by Russian music, as the first symphony shows. Every note of the works that were performed in this week’s two concerts was written during this phase of his life. In what precise way should this music therefore be described as Finnish, or as the essence of Finnishness? Indeed, the famously long compositional silence of Sibelius’s late years (he wrote almost nothing after 1926 and died in 1957) falls entirely within the period of Finnish nationhood that began in 1917. Are the two connected? The question is unanswerable. Yet Sibelius’s Finland, one can surely argue in this of all weeks, is not quite the same thing as Finland’s Sibelius. •The headline was amended on 9 December to better reflect the content of this essay, and on 14 December to change “ethnically Swedish minority” to “Swedish-speaking minority” and 1940 to 1939-40."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/08/not-much-remain-theresa-may-red-lines-brexit-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T10:23:32Z","webTitle":"Not much remains of Theresa May's red lines after the Brexit deal | Dan Roberts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/08/not-much-remain-theresa-may-red-lines-brexit-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/08/not-much-remain-theresa-may-red-lines-brexit-deal","fields":{"headline":"Not much remains of Theresa May's red lines after the Brexit deal","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"If the EU referendum was the moment the British electorate clashed with the establishment, 8 December 2017 was the day that the legal and economic consequences collided with its political promises. The joint divorce agreement hammered out in the intervening 528 days makes clear that little remains of the many red lines set out by Theresa May in her Lancaster House speech or party conference address of 2016. The first, and biggest, concession is buried in paragraph 49 of the 15-page report published early on Friday morning. Its implications will be anything but quiet in the weeks to come, for it undermines the prime minister’s previous insistence that Britain will be leaving the single market. It states clearly: “In the absence of agreed solutions, the United Kingdom will maintain full alignment with those rules of the internal market and the customs union.” In other words, the UK may not be a member of the single market, or have any direct ability to shape its rules in future, but it could yet have to play by them in perpetuity. Much will be made of the “in the absence of agreed solutions” caveat, yet what it means in practice is that the UK hopes to flesh out this pledge through a wider free trade agreement with the EU. If the other 27 members were reluctant to allow any wriggle room in the first phase of talks, they are even less likely to budge now that this principle is established as a back-stop. When the agreement was first drafted on Monday, there was much concern that the promise of maintaining regulatory “alignment” might only apply to Northern Ireland, but the Democratic Unionist party has succeeded in removing any ambiguity and forced Downing Street to spell out that alignment stretches right across the Irish sea. “The United Kingdom will ensure that no new regulatory barriers develop between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom,” says the text now – unless, by some miracle, the Northern Ireland assembly were to decide it did, after all, want to be cut off. Then there is the UK’s promise to free itself from interference by the European court of justice. Where once this seemed the most implacable of red lines, signs of continued ECJ involvement are strewn throughout the divorce agreement. Most striking is the commitment to allow EU citizens living in UK to continue to rely on the court to enforce the many legal rights that will be enshrined as a result of the agreement. “For EU citizens the ECJ will still be competent,” said Jean-Claude Juncker, as he announced the deal. The agreed text goes further, saying it “establishes rights for citizens following on from those established in union law during the UK’s membership of the European Union”. Specifically, it says “the [ECJ] is the ultimate arbiter of the interpretation of union law” and “UK courts shall therefore have due regard to relevant decisions of the [ECJ] after the specified date [of departure]” as well as consulting with it if the law is unclear. In the last few days, as compromise became inevitable, the British government had attempted to limit this ongoing role to less than five years. The final text includes a sunset clause of eight years instead. But this may just be the start of the ongoing legal alignment. A separate statement by the EU council president, Donald Tusk, on the principles of the next stage of negotiations, makes clear that the UK will be fully required to abide by ECJ rulings during the two-year transition phase after departure. “I propose that during this period, the UK will respect the whole of EU law, including new law … [and] it will respect judicial oversight,” said Tusk. Another clause allowing the UK to continue to participate in EU programmes and agencies hints that the ECJ may be a feature of British life long after the eight-year sunset clause and the two-year transition phase too: “Participation in union programmes will require the UK to respect all relevant union legal provision.” Finally there is the question of money. May had promised an end to large ongoing payments to the EU. Boris Johnson said it could “go whistle” if it wanted an exorbitant divorce settlement. Though the text includes no figures, detailed commitments by the UK to meet all the initial financial requests of the EU suggest both these promises may look increasingly hollow, with a total bill of perhaps up to €60bn or more than £50bn. In her Florence speech, May first conceded that the UK would honour all the ongoing spending commitments of the current EU budget round, even after Brexit. But the divorce agreement makes clear this extends to future spending many years beyond that too. These so-called reste à liquider (RAL) payments will be made when they fall due, rather than upfront, but this only lengthens the extent of British financial obligations. The UK has also agreed that various contingent liabilities, such as foreign loans and staff pensions, will similarly be offset by some assets it has identified in the EU books. But this means it will take more than a decade, for example, for the UK to be reimbursed for the money it has paid into the European Investment Bank. The €300m annual payments may prove scant compensation for the billions flowing the other way in financial settlements or the lasting regulatory and legal concessions that the UK has had to pay as the price of merely getting to talk about a future trade deal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/08/football-transfer-rumours-juventus-to-sign-liverpools-emre-can-in-january","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T08:44:17Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Juventus to sign Liverpool's Emre Can in January?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/08/football-transfer-rumours-juventus-to-sign-liverpools-emre-can-in-january","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/08/football-transfer-rumours-juventus-to-sign-liverpools-emre-can-in-january","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Juventus to sign Liverpool's Emre Can in January?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Liverpool’s emphatic seven-goal hammering of Spartak Moscow left Emre Can in bullish form. Hair gleaming and plastered with product after his post-match shower, with the sweet scent of Lynx Java deodorant thick in the air, the German midfielder announced that Liverpool “are not afraid of any team” in the knockout stages of the Champions League. “If you want to go through to the next round you have to win, it doesn’t matter who,” he said. Liverpool may, however, fear an Italian raid on Can in January. Speaking on Sky Sports Italy, Juventus legend Alessandro del Piero suggested that the 23-year-old is exactly what Juve need to bolster a midfield from which the injury-prone Sami Khedira is often absent. “Emre Can of Liverpool would be ideal, and he’s not even that expensive,” said Del Piero. “He could be the big name for Juve in January. They need somebody like him. He’s physically present and somebody like Emre Can would fit in very well with [Miralem] Pjanic and Khedira.” Reports in Italy suggest Internazionale are ready to go toe to toe with Juventus in the battle to lure Can, who would of course be cup-tied in Europe should he decide to leave Liverpool before his contract expires next summer, away from Anfield. Real Madrid are also believed to be interested, but the Rumour Mill reckons he’ll stay put until June at least. Following his hat-trick against Spartak, Philippe Coutinho rather drizzled on the parade of ecstatic Liverpool fans by refusing to commit himself to the club until the end of the season. “I do not know how the future is going to be,” he que-sera-sera-ed. “What will happen in January, we will know it in January. I do not know if there will be an offer.” If reports from Spain are to be believed there will be an offer of £127m from Barcelona, who haven’t been put off by their failure to sign the Brazilian playmaker during the summer. Jean Michaël Seri was expected to move to Camp Nou in the last window but ended up staying at Nice after the Spanish league leaders cooled their interest. Despite missing a month of the season through injury, the Ivorian has been scouted extensively by Manchester City and Liverpool, who are both plotting moves in January. Arsenal are also among the favourites to make a Premier League player of Seri. Chelsea want to add 20-year-old Bayer Leverkusen winger Leon Bailey to their stockpile of talented youngsters who may never play for their first team and are prepared to pay £20m for his services before loaning him straight back to the Bundesliga side. Chelsea are also making gooey eyes at 21-year-old Gremio midfielder Arthur, who is valued at over £40m, but Barcelona are reported to have the whip-hand in the battle for his heart and mind. And yesterday’s whisper that Sam Allardyce is preparing a £60m bid for unsettled Borussia Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang appears to have gathered traction. While the prospect of the Gabon striker rocking up at Goodison Park seems fairly unlikely, the manager who was capable of convincing Jay-Jay Okocha to sign for Bolton Wanderers is almost certainly capable of anything. With Aubameyang ready to leave Dortmund in January, Everton are likely to face competition from their Merseyside neighbours Liverpool in the race to secure his signature."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/live/2017/dec/08/pound-edges-higher-after-brexit-breakthrough-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T18:01:45Z","webTitle":"UK firms say 'the hard work on Brexit starts now' - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/dec/08/pound-edges-higher-after-brexit-breakthrough-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2017/dec/08/pound-edges-higher-after-brexit-breakthrough-business-live","fields":{"headline":"UK firms say 'the hard work on Brexit starts now' - as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A couple of positive political developments helped push European markets higher, while Wall Street benefitted from the stronger than expected US jobs data. The Brexit breakthrough was welcomed by investors, and even the pound losing its early gains helped the UK market, packed as it is with overseas earners which are helped by a weak sterling. In Germany, hopes that the current impasse in forming a coalition government could be resolved lifted the Dax higher. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 73.21 points or 1% at 7393.96 Germany’s Dax rose 0.83% to 13,153.70 France’s Cac closed 0.28% higher at 5399.09 Italy’s FTSE MIB climbed 1.4% to 22,773.80 Spain’s Ibex ended 0.57% better at 10,321.1 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.64% to 740.72 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 102 points or 0.42% higher. On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back next week. The early excitement in the pound following the morning’s Brexit news was well and truly short lived, and sterling is now down 0.7% against the dollar at $1.3370. In the wake of the deal news it climbed as high as $1.3519. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: At the start of the session, sterling was gaining ground on the back of the announcement that the UK and the EU had made sufficient progress in the first phase talks, so it can now move onto the discussions about trade. The early positive momentum in sterling, ran out of steam and it then the pound turned negative – which propped up the FTSE 100. Part of the reason for the fall was the EU telling the UK that trade talks would not start until February. Ratings agency Fitch has also opined on the Brexit news from this morning, and like S&amp;P, says it has no immediate effect on its AA rating and negative outlook: The agreement between the UK and the EU to move to the next phase of Brexit negotiations is a step towards a potential agreement on Brexit and trade, but the process remains lengthy and challenging, and the deal leaves many key uncertainties unresolved... The progress report’s carefully crafted language fails to clarify how the UK can achieve all three of its commitments to leave the EU single market and customs union, ensure Northern Ireland retains “unfettered access” to the UK internal market, and avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It states that “in the absence of agreed solutions, the UK will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and Customs Union which... support North-South cooperation”. This would appear to maintain the status quo if a trade deal is not agreed, but we think it would be politically very difficult for the UK government to guarantee regulatory equivalence between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic in this event. More broadly, the negotiation process leading up to today’s announcement has strained UK domestic politics, highlighting how June’s general election has weakened policy cohesion, reflecting divisions in parliament and among the UK public regarding the desired post-Brexit relationship with the EU, and meaning the final outcome of negotiations remains uncertain. Fitch concludes: Overall, today’s announcement does not alter the view we expressed when we affirmed the UK’s ‘AA’ sovereign rating in October, that the complexity of the issues, the magnitude of national interests at stake, the lack of a clear UK position, the EU’s negotiating stance, and the limited timeframe will make it challenging for the UK to secure a favourable trade agreement. The Negative Outlook on the rating reflects the uncertainty and corresponding downside economic and fiscal risks. Any bursting of the Bitcoin bubble is unlikely to have a major impact on the global economy, says Capital Economics. The consultancy’s Andrew Kenningham says: Unlike the bubbles in the tech sector in the late-1990s and in US residential property a few years later, a bursting of the bitcoin bubble should not have systemic, macroeconomic implications. The total value of bitcoin is (still) too small, and it has few links with the wider economy. ...As with many start-ups, the “true” value of bitcoin is unknown because it is unclear whether it has a long- term future. But we doubt that any cryptocurrency will become a serious rival to the dollar or other major fiat currencies, many of which have centuries of history behind them and the backing of governments and central banks. Also, technological problems, fraud or tighter regulation may undermine bitcoin. And even if cryptocurrencies in general have a future, one of bitcoin’s numerous competitors, or a central bank digital currency, could kill it off just as plenty of early rivals to Facebook and Google were sunk without trace. Given this uncertainty, it makes sense that bitcoin is often compared to the famous Dutch tulip bubble. Like bitcoin, tulips became popular “because of their strangeness and rarity” and because they were new, having arrived from the Ottoman Empire in the late 16th century. Their prices rose astronomically between 1634 and 1637 and then collapsed. But the crash apparently had little impact on the Dutch economy. There are several channels through which a bursting asset price bubble can, in principle, have macroeconomic consequences, but none are a major risk in the case of bitcoin. First, there may be a hit to household spending as people who have invested suffer losses. But bitcoin’s market capitalisation is too small for this to be a worry. It is currently around $240bn, which is much smaller than the total value of gold outstanding ($8trn) or the value of Apple ($0.9trn). If the price of bitcoin fell to zero today, the paper losses would be equivalent to a 0.6% fall in US equity prices. As most investors have bought bitcoin at much lower prices, the relevant losses would arguably be smaller. While a bursting bubble can affect the economy via the banking sector, this is not much of a risk either, precisely because bitcoin is held and traded outside the banking sector. Also, there is no evidence that people are taking out huge, sub-prime mortgages to finance their speculation in cryptocurrencies. A slump in bitcoin prices should not have much effect on wider investor and business confidence either. As we have pointed out elsewhere, there is no correlation between the prices of bitcoin and other risky assets, so a fall in its price should not affect wider financial conditions. And nor would it tell us anything about wider market sentiment. Back with Bitcoin, and JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon - a notable critic of the cryptocurrency - has been commenting again. He told CNBC: US consumer confidence has slipped back compared to last month, partly due to Democrat voters concerned about the effects of the proposed tax changes. The University of Michigan’s initial consumer sentiment reading for December has come in at 96.8, compared to November’s 98.5 and expectations of a rise to 99. The survey’s chief economist Richard Curtin said: Consumer sentiment has remained quite favorable although it continued to slowly recede in early December from its October cyclical peak. Most of the recent decline was concentrated in the long-term prospects for the economy, while consumers thought current economic conditions have continued to improve. Importantly, the largest decline in long-term economic prospects was recorded among Democrats, which reflected their concerns about the impact of the proposed changes in taxes. Perhaps the most important changes in early December were higher income expectations as well as a higher expected inflation rate in 2018. Income gains have been slowly improving during the past year, and the data indicate that trend has continued. In contrast, the rise in inflation expectations in early December was a surprise, and confidence in this finding must await confirmation in the months ahead before any inferences are drawn. Buying plans for durables have improved in early December, largely due to attractive pricing, in contrast to the rise in the expected inflation rate. Overall, the data signal an expected gain of 2.7% in real consumption expenditures in 2018. Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos is about to begin a round of talks in the US aimed at the debt-stricken country re-accessing markets next year. Helena Smith reports: After eight years of being exiled from international capital markets, Greece hopes to refinance itself for the first time in nearly a decade when its third international bailout programme expires next August. The politics of regaining market access are expected to dominate discussions Tsakalotos is to have in the US, starting today. Auditors representing the European creditors that have kept Greece afloat are also there. The Marxist economist, who has allowed pragmatism to prevail over ideology in his job as finance minister, will be the keynote speaker in the annual Capital Link Invest in Greece Forum on Monday. Interestingly, he has been selected to ring the closing bell at the NYSE on Tuesday. Insiders are interpreting the move as an incipient signal of renewed optimism in the Greek economy. As for that jobs data, it continues its record breaking run: The better than expected jobs data has seen a positive opening on Wall Street, while European markets continue to be buoyed - partly - by the day’s Brexit news. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 70 points or 0.29%, with a US rate rise next week now seen as virtually inevitable despite the weaker than expected wages growth. Meanwhile the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.37% and the Nasdaq Composite rose by 0.7% Elsewhere the FTSE 100 has climbed 0.87%, Germany’s Dax is up 1% and France’s Cac has climbed 0.44%. Over at Bitcoin, and the cryptocurrency is now down around 8% at $15,200. Back with Brexit, and S&amp;P Global Ratings says the UK’s credit rating at AA and its negative outlook is not immediately affected by this morning’s deal. It says: The EC has announced that the UK has made “sufficient progress” in the first phase of the Brexit talks, which now paves the way for the EC to formally open the next phase in its summit on December 14 and 15. The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has signalled that a final agreement will have to be reached by October 2018. This leaves only 10 months for the UK to agree with the EU a framework for their future relationship, including a trade deal, and transitional arrangements. A final agreement will have to be approved by 27 national parliaments ahead of the March 2019 exit date. While sufficient progress has been made during the first phase, many issues are yet to be fully resolved. The situation is further challenged by the UK’s slowing domestic economy, the lack of a parliamentary majority, and by the absence of consensus within the government on the shape of the final relationship with the EU. Indeed, these considerations contributed to the slow progress during the first phase of negotiations. The negative outlook reflects the continued institutional and economic uncertainty surrounding the Brexit negotiations and the UK’s future relationship with the EU after the country’s departure from the bloc in March 2019. The dollar is dipping after the weaker than expected US wage growth outweighed the stronger jobs figures. But economists believe that wage weakness will not deter the Federal Reserve from raising US interest rates at its meeting next week. James Smith at ING Bank said: For markets, a further disappointment in wage growth will be the key takeaway from today’s data. November’s growth in average hourly earnings came in below consensus at 0.2%, following a downward revision to October’s figure, although it’s still probably worth taking these numbers with a pinch of salt. Back in September, the job losses from the hurricanes were highly concentrated in low-wage sectors, and taking them temporarily out of the sample artificially boosted the average level of pay. November’s disappointment could simply be a further correction to this blip. A similar logic can probably be applied to the payrolls numbers. On the face of it, a 228,000 increase in jobs during November looks good, but at least some of this is probably down to people returning to work after the disruption. Either way though, policymakers are less bothered by jobs growth these days - they know that the rate of employment growth should be expected to slow as the remaining slack in the economy erodes. Given all the noise, the Fed will most likely write off this latest jobs report. Wage growth was disappointing, but given the sheer strength of the jobs market, we would still expect pay to accelerate gradually through next year. More broadly, we agree with the Fed’s assertion that most of this year’s inflation dip was ‘transitory’. Throw in 3% economic growth next year, as well as the hawkish rotation in regional Fed voters, and we expect a rate hike next week to be followed by three more in 2018. A stronger than expected rise in non-farm payrolls has reinforced expectations that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next week. Paul Ashwell, chief US economist at Capital Economics, gives his view: The slightly bigger than expected 228,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in November all but guarantees another 25 basis point interest rate hike by the Fed next week, particularly with the unemployment rate unchanged at an unusually low 4.1%. The 228,000 rise in non-farm payrolls last month was driven by job creation in professional services, manufacturing, and health care, the US Labor Department said. The department gave some context behind its recent revisions, which it said painted a brighter picture overall: The change in total non-farm payroll employment for September was revised up from +18,000 to +38,000, and the change for October was revised down from +261,000 to +244,000. With these revisions, employment gains in September and October combined were 3,000 more than previously reported. After revisions, job gains have averaged 170,000 over the last 3 months. Non-farm payrolls rose by 228,000 in November, beating expectations of 200,000. But the figure for October was revised down to 244,000 from an earlier estimate of 261,000. The jobless rate was unchanged at 4.1%, while average earnings increased by 0.2%, following a 0.1% fall in October. It was below expectations of a 0.3% pick-up in pay. The pound is now down against both the dollar and the euro, after rising earlier in the day against both currencies. The relief rally prompted by progress on Brexit talks appears to have faded away. The pound is down 0.5% against the dollar, at $1.3405, and down 0.3% against the euro at €1.1409. Back to Brexit, and the Institute of Directors says firms are breathing “a huge sigh of relief” after talks progressed. Stephen Martin, director general, adds: The most pressing concern for UK companies has been their EU staff, who have urgently needed certainty about their future in this country. We have grounds to hope now that our members will be able to send their employees off for the Christmas break feeling more comfortable about their status here. We call on the UK and EU to build on this positive momentum going into the new year. It is overwhelmingly in the interests of both sides to begin working on our future economic relationship - particularly in order to fully address the Irish question. And we look forward to further clarity about what the UK’s objectives are for that new relationship as well as a firm commitment on transition in the very near future. The US Commerce Department is due to publish the non-farm payrolls report for November at 1.30pm UK time. Economists polled by Reuters are predicting that the US economy created 200,000 jobs last month, down from 261,000 in October. The unemployment rate is expected to remain at 4.1%. David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, says: When it comes to the US jobs report, the devil is always in the detail so keep an eye out for revisions to previous reports. The average earnings figures will be closely watched too. On a monthly basis, average earnings are expected to jump to 0.3% from 0.0%, and on year-on-year basis it is anticipated to rise to 2.5% from 2.4%. Wage growth has been lagging behind that of job creation growth, and we will need to see a steady rise in earnings if the US economy wants to have a sustainable recovery. Britain’s trade deficit with the rest of the world widened in the three months to October, figures published earlier by the ONS show. The UK continues to import more from the EU and the rest of the world than it exports to other countries. Excluding some commodities such as gold shipped in and out of London, which statisticians say can distort the figures, the UK’s trade in goods and deficit widened by £800m to £6.9bn in the three months to October. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimates the UK economy grew by 0.5% in the three months to November. That would be an slight improvement on the 0.4% growth achieved in the third quarter, between July and September. Amit Kara, head of UK forecasting at the think tank, said growth was being driven by the services sector and industrial production, while construction remained under pressure. He added: UK economic activity has picked-up in the second half of this year and GDP growth at 0.5 per cent is somewhat higher than the economy’s speed limit. If, as we expect, the economy continues to expand around this pace and inflation remains elevated, there is a case for the Bank of England to gradually raise the policy rate to stop the economy from overheating. Consistent with that view, our latest forecast for the UK is conditioned on a 25 basis points increase in Bank Rate every six months such that the policy rate reaches 2 per cent in 2021. The pound is still up against the euro at €1.1463 after this morning’s Brexit breakthrough, but it has failed to hold on to earlier gains against the dollar, because the US currency is also performing well on tax plan hopes. Gold is another victim of the dollar’s strength: UK Finance, the banking industry’s trade body, says most of the hard work on Brexit - the aspects that will determine decisions on jobs - is yet to be done. Stephen Jones, chief executive: Today’s announcement is certainly a positive step, making important progress in the negotiations and bringing a welcome and significant clarity on the rights of EU citizens living and working in the UK. But the agreement on phase one issues is just the start - we now need to see the detail and further action on those issues that will determine the real impact of Brexit on the economy, consumers and jobs. Businesses need to see clear progress in the New Year on the future trading relationship and how we will transition to any new arrangements to ensure we can continue to meet the needs of customers. Kathrin Muehlbronner, lead sovereign analyst for the UK at Moody’s, says Brexit progress is currently panning out as the ratings agency expected, with the toughest challenges ahead: The announcement this morning that the UK and the EU have reached “sufficient” progress in the withdrawal negotiations is in line with what we expected. We expect the EU summit on 14-15 December to endorse the Commission’s recommendation, meaning that negotiations will now move on to finding agreements on a transition period and a new trade relationship. Our baseline scenario assumes that the two sides will agree on a two-year transition period beyond March 2019, that will give some additional time to find a reasonably good new free trade arrangement. But it is clear that these negotiations will likely be even more difficult than those just concluded on the principles of the UK’s withdrawal. UK construction output fell 1.7% in October, coming in well below economists’ expectations of a 0.4% rise. The fall was driven by a drop in both new work and in repair and maintenance. The ONS explains: Construction output fell by £211 million compared with September 2017. As in the three-month on three-month series, the fall stems primarily from a decrease in repair and maintenance, with non-housing repair and maintenance falling by £73 million. Private housing also provided a notable drag on output, also decreasing by £73 million. Elsewhere, private commercial work also fell sharply, decreasing for the second consecutive month, falling by £58 million in October 2017. The only positive contributions to the month-on-month construction output came from infrastructure and private industrial work, which grew by £36 million and £14 million respectively. The City of London has welcomed the breakthrough in Brexit talks, saying “Christmas has come early” for financial firms. Catherine McGuinness, policy chairman of the City of London Corporation: Christmas has come early for financial firms with the news that Brexit negotiations can now move to Phase 2. Government has made a bold but necessary step forward. But the hard work starts now. The UK’s future trading relationship with the EU will mark one of the most important pieces of legislation in a century – it is vital we get it right first time. The new trading relationship should be based on a free trade agreement, introducing a joint dispute resolution body and mechanisms for mutual market access. It would be based on regulatory alignment between the UK and EU with both parties working together to implement new global and international standards, replacing existing regulatory frameworks. It is essential that government makes clear its aim to implement a transitional deal, clarifying exact timelines of when the transition phase will begin, what rules will apply to the UK in the interim and we need an indication of when the sector can expect to adopt the new rules. Industrial production should still make a positive contribution to UK growth in the fourth quarter, despite failing to grow month-on-month in October. That’s the view of Ruth Gregory at Capital Economics, based on the sector’s rolling quarterly performance: Industrial production fell short of the stellar pace indicated by some of the surveys. Indeed, output merely held steady in October and manufacturing output posted only a small 0.1% monthly gain. Nonetheless, this was probably always to be expected after September’s strong monthly rise in both manufacturing and overall production. And the three-month industrial production growth rate remained at a still-strong 1.1%, suggesting that the sector is still on track to provide solid support to growth in Q4. The rise and fall of UK industrial production since before the financial crisis: Industrial production was flat in October, following a 0.7% increase in September. The weak performance was the result of a warmer than usual October according to the Office for National Statistics, because it resulted in a 3.3% fall in energy supply. The ONS explains: Within this sector, gas distribution and supply fell by 7.6%, the warmer than average temperature in October 2017 contributed to this fall. The Met Office reported that the provisional UK mean temperature was 11.3 degrees Celsius, which was 1.8 degrees Celsius above the 1981 to 2010 long-term average. Manufacturing output - the biggest contributor to overall production - managed to scrape growth of just 0.1%. Kate Davies, ONS senior statistician, said the longer-term picture was positive. While manufacturing was relatively subdued overall in October despite record production of cars destined for export, the longer-term picture is one of strong growth. Bitcoin dipped below $15,000, having surged ahead on Thursday. It is currently down 10% at $14,951. Piers Morgan is taking guidance on Bitcoin from veteran investor Warren Buffet: The dollar is on track for its biggest weekly rise in nearly six weeks as optimism grows that Trump’s tax bill will pass. The dollar index, which measures the US currency against a basket of currencies, is up 0.2% at 93.95. It is up more than 1% over the week, its biggest rise since late October. Reuters explains: US Senate Republicans agreed to talks with the House of Representatives on sweeping tax legislation on Wednesday, amid early signs that lawmakers could bridge their differences and agree on a final bill before self-imposed Dec. 22 deadline. Passage of the tax bill and strong data would strengthen the case for more US rate increases in the next year, a possibility which bond markets look unprepared for. The Federal Reserve is set to raise interest rates next week, but futures markets expect less than two rate hikes over the next year. Britain’s manufacturers echo the BCC’s sentiments, with trade body EEF saying there are trickier negotiations ahead: Stephen Phipson, chief executive of EEF: Companies are relieved there is progress in the negotiations. But this is one step forward in a complex and long process. So we need to pin down the transition arrangements, which will be in place after March 2019, to ensure it’s business as usual for companies for as long as it takes until a final deal is reached. Until we get to that point, many businesses will need to prepare for any and every eventuality. Many employers will be relieved that their EU employees have more certainty going forward, and government must now clarify the rights of EU citizens by Christmas so that they are not concerned about their future. The British Chambers of Commerce welcomed this morning’s breakthrough in Brexit talks, but has warned urgent progress must now be made on a trade deal with the EU, to allow UK businesses to plan for future. Adam Marshall, director general of the BCC: Businesses will be breathing a sigh of relief that ‘sufficient progress’ has been achieved. After the noise and political brinksmanship of recent days, news of a breakthrough in the negotiations will be warmly welcomed by companies across the UK. For business, a swift start to trade talks is crucial to upcoming investment and growth decisions. Companies all across the UK want absolute clarity on the long-term deal being sought, and want government to work closely with business experts to ensure that the details are right. Businesses want answers on what leaving the EU will mean for regulation, customs, hiring, standards, tariffs and taxes. The job of the UK government and the European Commission now is to provide those answers – and do everything in their power to ensure vibrant cross-border trade between the UK and EU countries can continue. Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, says the pound is benefiting from the Brexit “fudge” in Brussels: The Brussels fudge that May and Juncker have served up this morning has gone down a treat for sterling. The pound is trading up against almost all major partners, and has reached a six month high against the euro. This morning’s deal looks like a classic eurozone can kicking exercise. It’s now clear that Britain is seeking an agreement on regulatory alignment that will mean the overarching UK wide deal will satisfy Northern Ireland’s requirements. But in the plausible scenario where such a deal is not reached, today’s fudge hinges on Britain coming up with unspecified “specific solutions” that will avoid a hard border in Ireland. Regardless of any future difficulties, for now the news is very positive, and next week’s leaders’ summit will conclude in celebrations, which the pound has already kicked off this morning. The pound climbed above €1.15 to the highest level in six months after that crucial agreement on the Irish border, which paves the way to the start of trade talks. The FTSE 100 is roughly flat in early trading, lagging behind its counterparts in the rest of Europe which are all firmly higher this morning after that Brexit breakthrough. The UK’s leading index tends to take a knock from a stronger pound as the listed multinationals make a large proportion of earnings abroad. Here are the scores so far: FTSE 100: +0.04% at 7,323 Germany’s DAX: 0.8% at 13,144 France’s CAC: +0.5% at 5,413 Italy’s FTSE MIB: +0.9% at 22,669 Spain’s IBEX: +0.7% at 10,333 Europe’s STOXX: +0.7% at 389 For all the latest developments on the Brexit negotiations in Brussels, follow our politics live blog: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound has received a boost this morning from the news of an overnight breakthrough in Brussels on the Irish border talks. The European Commission said “sufficient progress” had been made in the first phase of Brexit talks, paving the way for talks to begin on Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU. The pound is up 0.3% against the euro at €1.1482, and up 0.3% against the dollar at $1.3517. So traders are not getting too carried away, and rightly so according to Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, who cautioned that phase one was the easy part: We all know that breaking up is hard. But breaking up and building a new relationship is harder. Away from Brexit talks, it’s non-farm payrolls day in the US...

Abbott was one of the most high-profile campaigners against marriage equality but a poll obtained by Guardian Australia suggests far from helping the no campaign, his unpopularity was lead in its saddle bags. Confidential campaign-tracking polling conducted by Newgate Research for the Equality Campaign found that on 12 September, Abbott had a net favourability rating of -28% when respondents were asked to rate his contribution to the marriage debate. The poll was taken after a month of campaigning and a bruising public debate between Abbott and his sister, Liberal Sydney City councillor Christine Forster, who publicly rejected his calls for people to vote no as “simplistic and inaccurate”. The campaign went from bad to worse for Abbott, when he claimed an assault against him in September was a politically-motivated act of violence from a yes campaigner. The man behind the assault later said it had nothing to do with marriage equality. Abbott’s daughter, Frances, then appeared in an ad for the Equality Campaign backing same-sex marriage, saying “you can’t help who you fall in love with”. Abbott stayed on the attack, claiming that US rapper Macklemore had inappropriately politicised the NRL grand final by playing his hit song Same Love. After that incident in early October, Abbott was less vocal in the no campaign, leading to speculation among marriage equality supporters that he had been benched. In November, Abbott re-emerged, giving a speech to the anti-gay Alliance Defending Freedom group, which is classed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Centre, saying a 40% no vote in the postal survey would be a “moral victory”. The no campaign failed even this modest target – with 38.4% of the vote in the survey. In Abbott’s electorate of Warringah, 75% of those who responded voted for same-sex marriage. Abbott – who devised the Coalition’s policy to hold a plebiscite while he was prime minister in 2015 – then took credit for the outcome. “I put this process in place. I have, in a sense, facilitated the change,” he told 2GB Radio. “I certainly intend to facilitate the passage of a bill.” He then lobbied for a conservative same-sex marriage bill, which was withdrawn – and amendments, which all failed. In debate on Thursday before the cross-party bill passed the House of Representatives, Abbott called for the views of the 5 million Australians who voted no to be respected. He targeted Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten for having pledged to protect religious freedom and freedom of conscience, complaining that the “promise made by the leaders of this parliament ... has not adequately been delivered upon”. When the vote was called, just four MPs opposed the bill but Abbott was absent from the chamber, indicating that he abstained. A spokeswoman for the Coalition for Marriage paid tribute to Abbott, saying he was “integral in securing the millions and millions of no votes that occurred during the campaign”. “He is the only prime minister or opposition leader in recent memory, other than John Howard, to have not flipped and flopped on the issue of traditional marriage and freedom of conscience,” she said. “It is this sort of consistency and message cut-through that makes Tony Abbott such a successful campaigner and leader.” Guardian Australia has contacted Abbott for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/grogonomics/2017/dec/10/are-australians-better-off-now-than-before-the-last-election","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-09T20:29:23Z","webTitle":"Are Australians better off now than before the last election? | Greg Jericho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2017/dec/10/are-australians-better-off-now-than-before-the-last-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/grogonomics/2017/dec/10/are-australians-better-off-now-than-before-the-last-election","fields":{"headline":"Are Australians better off now than before the last election?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The key question for any government is whether or not voters are better off now than they were at the last election – or, in the case of a multi-term government – when there was a change of government. Given next year is likely to see election talk heat up as a simultaneous House of Representative and half-Senate election can be held anytime from 4 August next year, it’s a question that is going to be asked with more urgency. And right now the answer is no. Yes, the government can point to very good employment growth – especially in this past year in full-time work. Full-time employment for prime-aged workers aged 25-64 grew 3.2% in the past 12 months – the best result since 2010. That’s a big tick. Business investment as well is beginning to rise – but a good portion of that is due to public sector infrastructure work. In the 12 months to June (the latest figures we have), private sector engineering construction fell 14% while such work for the public sector rose 15%. And there is nothing wrong with that – that is in fact one of the purposes of public infrastructure. Not only can it improve productivity if done properly, it also provides work for the private sector (something that those in the government, who still try to suggest that GFC stimulus spending achieved nothing, would do well to remember). But this week’s GDP figures only served to highlight that while jobs, investment and overall economic growth are ranging from a solid to very good, you would be hard pressed to say the mood in households is within that scope. The big story of the national accounts was that households had stopped spending in the September quarter. Household consumption grew just 0.1% in real terms – the worst quarterly growth since the GFC in 2008. A good guide for how households are feeling is the spending on non-essentials such as recreation and culture, hotels and restaurants, and household furnishings. In the past year our spending on such items grew just 0.2% – a level of growth more normally associated with a recession. And the reasons are obvious – the economy might be growing at a decent (if still below-average) pace, and business investment might be going great, but household income growth is putrid. The record low wages growth has fully filtered through to households, where even despite the strong employment growth, household disposable income has fallen in the past year in real terms. What we have to spend not only buys us less than it did at the time of the 2016 election, but less than it did at the 2013 election. And given the recent surge in the price of electricity, it’s little wonder that we’re not feeling flush enough to dine out or go on a holiday. The government for its part is fully aware of this dilemma – the prime minister and treasurer rarely talk of the economy without stressing their concerns for households’ cost of living. The issue of course is whether or not the situation will improve – and whether it will improve before the next election. The government is essentially betting its political life that the path to improved household living standards is through better business conditions (i.e. lower tax and regulation) which will lead to increased investment and then in turn greater demand for workers and thus higher wages. It’s a logical approach to take. If all you care about is economic growth, making life good for business is an easy way to go – after all, company profits are income that all goes into the GDP mix. And history does suggest that, eventually, higher profit growth is associated with higher wage growth. But that link is being tested. The concern is that what worked in the past no longer will. Not the least because we are experiencing wages growth lower than anything we have experienced in history. In the past, when profits rose and wages followed, they were not coming off record lows. Wages used to grow on average by around 3.5% each year. The last time workers experienced such wage growth was five years ago in September 2012. And even under the best outlook, no one thinks we’ll get back to those levels before the end of this decade. Even the budget, with its generous estimates for wage growth that helps bolster the income tax revenue, sees wage growth only returning to that level in June 2020. And yet, if that were to occur it would be eight years since we would have seen that level of growth – more than enough to suggest a change of mindset would have occurred. In the past, improved investment and profits led to better wages growth because both sides played along – you didn’t have businesses seeking to terminate agreements, and unions had much more power to undertake industrial action – a power that was limited again this week by a decision in the high court against the AWU that now sees unions being prevented from taking protected industrial action during bargaining if they breach any order from the Fair Work Commission. It was a decision which the dissenting judge, Justice Gageler, argued, could see unions and their members become “an industrial cripple and an industrial outlaw.” And in the past, 3.5% growth was considered fair in a climate in which inflation was growing around 2.9% each year – a pace it hasn’t grown at consistently since 2011. The government, business groups and the Reserve Bank will talk of strong wages growth, but once unions start achieving such growth, expect to hear talk of declining competitiveness, and the need for restraint. Expect, as well, in the intervening years – should the Liberal government win re-election – that the industrial relations system will continue to be weighted in favour of employers. In effect, the system may have once favoured a nice link between profits and wages and thus household incomes, but that relationship is rather strained right now. Private investment is growing well in the non-mining sector, but a large proportion of that is due to public infrastructure projects being undertaken by the private sector. And the longer workers go without what were once considered average wage increases, expect a strengthening resistance from businesses to give them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/08/parliament-could-pardon-its-dual-citizens-committee-hears","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T03:33:24Z","webTitle":"Parliament could pardon its dual citizens, committee hears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/08/parliament-could-pardon-its-dual-citizens-committee-hears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/08/parliament-could-pardon-its-dual-citizens-committee-hears","fields":{"headline":"Parliament could pardon its dual citizens, committee hears","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Parliament has the power to grant an “amnesty” to allow MPs to renounce foreign citizenship without going to the high court, a committee examining the citizenship crisis has heard. In a hearing in Canberra on Friday, the University of Queensland constitutional expert Graeme Orr proposed a political solution to the crisis that has seen nine senators and lower-house members quit or be ruled ineligible to sit in parliament. Orr told the joint standing committee on electoral matters that although section 44 of the constitution states that subjects or citizens of a foreign power are ineligible, the parliament has “very broad latitude” about what happens as a consequence. Under section 47, the parliament has power to determine “any question respecting the qualification of a senator or of a member ... or respecting a vacancy in either house of parliament”. Orr said the power in the section “could’ve been used earlier this year for a full audit and amnesty”, giving MPs who had acted reasonably and “not deliberately taken up conflicts of interest” time to resolve the issue by renouncing foreign citizenship. Instead, Orr said parliamentarians had been dealt with as if by a “Mexican firing squad, with the media playing a kind of gotcha role and the parties have turned on each other”. Orr said while “it would be a bad look if parliament ignored the rulings of the high court about whether a person was duly chosen”, it was up to parliament to “implement the consequences” of a disqualification. “I’m not saying it’s a politically tenable option, but it is a potentially legally tenable option,” he said. Orr said that once a parliamentarian had renounced foreign citizenship, they are no longer subject to a disqualification, potentially allowing them to rectify the problem without a referral to the high court. Orr said the high court can be “a bit unworldly” and suggested his “radical and romantic” alternative would also allow parliament to exercise leniency in cases such as Liberal Josh Frydenberg, whose citizenship status is caught up in the fact his mother fled Hungary to escape the Holocaust. Senior general counsel for the attorney general’s department, David Lewis, agreed it “should be possible” for both houses to deal with potentially ineligible parliamentarians without a referral to the court, such as through debates about whether they are qualified or a committee process to assess their case. The University of New South Wales law school dean, George Williams, was highly critical of the disqualification in section 44(i), telling the committee that in effect the eligibility for Australian parliament was set by foreign laws, which was “hardly consistent with sovereignty”. He said there was “no compelling reason of public policy” for Barnaby Joyce, who was not aware he was a New Zealand dual citizen, to have been ineligible for parliament and noted he was easily re-elected in a byelection, demonstrating the “futility” of section 44(i). Williams said section 44(i) was “not workable in its current form” and proposed a referendum to abolish it and replace it with a power for parliament to set the terms of disqualification, which would allow change with community standards. Williams criticised the “stalemate” that had developed – with Labor’s Katy Gallagher and David Feeney referred to the high court, but Labor and the Coalition refusing to refer other MPs. The University of Sydney’s Prof Anne Twomey told the committee section 44(i) could be changed at a referendum to disqualify people who have “done an act” to become a foreign citizen, rather than people who have the status, possibly unknowingly. Twomey said the court’s ruling that the election of a candidate stretches from the date of nomination until a place is validly filled had caused “a great deal of problems recently”. She pointed to the recent decision to disqualify Liberal Hollie Hughes because she took an office of profit, while National Fiona Nash had apparently won the election but held a Senate seat she was not eligible for. Twomey suggested the issue could be fixed by specifying that eligibility be relevant on nomination date, polling day, the declaration of the result or the return of writs, rather than throughout a continuing period. On Friday the high court heard there were doubts about the eligibility of former crossbench senator Jacqui Lambie’s replacement, Devonport mayor Steve Martin. Martin, the court heard, could be disqualified on the basis of holding an “office of profit under the crown”. Once a special count by the electoral commission next Tuesday confirms Martin as Lambie’s replacement, the court will then consider whether he is eligible at a hearing in January. The court also heard Nick Xenophon Team senator Skye Kakoschke-Moore, who resigned over her dual citizenship, wants to be able to contest a court-ordered special count because her former running mate Tim Storer had quit the party since the 2016 poll. Her counsel, David Jackson QC, said Storer’s election in a special count would “not reflect the choice exercised by the voters” of South Australia. A directions hearing will be held in late January. The replacement of former Senate president and Tasmanian Liberal senator Stephen Parry, who also discovered he was a UK dual citizen, will be done via a special count next Tuesday. He is expected to be replaced by former senator Richard Colbeck."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/12/abba-nirvana-holograms-des-lynam","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T09:00:29Z","webTitle":"The A to B of Abba: Nirvana, holograms and Des Lynam","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/12/abba-nirvana-holograms-des-lynam","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/12/abba-nirvana-holograms-des-lynam","fields":{"headline":"The A to B of Abba: Nirvana, holograms and Des Lynam","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Abba’s banger-strewn legacy goes on and on.

Abba, like total pop bosses, released their first greatest hits album just two years after their debut, 1973’s Ring Ring. Their definitive compilation Abba Gold is the UK’s second best-selling album of all time. Box-office blockbuster Mamma Mia! started life as a musical play, the eighth longest-running on Broadway, which has now been seen by more than 60 million people. The film adaptation became the UK’s biggest-ever DVD, selling 1.7m copies in one day and 5m after five weeks. The sequel, currently in production, HAS CHER IN IT. Between its release and the present day, SOS has been covered with varying degrees of bearability by Portishead, the Levellers and Red Hot Chili Peppers, plus crimson frock advocate and 13th-century English nobleman descendent Chris de Burgh. It’s either “one of the greatest pieces of music ever made” (John Grant) or “one of the best pop songs ever written” (Pete Townshend), or both, and influenced the Sex Pistols’ Pretty Vacant. Sid Vicious was a particularly big Abba fan, and once chatted to them in an airport lounge. Abba are currently managed by Spice Girls, S Club 7 and Jimmy Ray mastermind Simon Fuller. Abba’s “threads” remain iconic and untouchable etc, but the extent of their ludicrousness was reportedly influenced by Swedish tax laws that stated stage outfits could be tax deductible only if they couldn’t be reasonably worn in public. Björn Ulvaeus wrote The Winner Takes It All the way most of us listen to it: pissed off his head on brandy. “It’s a shame we never got to play it live,” Agnetha Fältskog later told the BBC. Apropos of nothing at all, here’s what Michael Eavis told the Guardian this year about his decision not to hold Glastonbury in 2018: “There’s one band I want to re-form; if they re-form, I’ll change my mind.” Björn Again – the Abba tribute band – performed at the 1992 Reading festival, at the “behest” of Kurt Cobain. “They stole the show,” Dave Grohl later said. Björn Again’s website features robust testimonials from Michael Stipe, Metallica, David Beckham, Robert Plant and Des Lynam. A big fan of Dancing Queen is, er, US senator John McCain, who says it’s his favourite ever song, attributing his musical tastes to a collision with a surface-to-air missile (??). The appreciation is not wholly mutual: Abba sent McCain a cease-and-desist after he used Take a Chance on Me at rallies. A total of 98 songs were released while Abba were working together. Imagine if they recorded another two songs for a round 100 and called their hologram tour Abba 100. Imagine that. Back in 1980 when Abba released their Spanish-language album it was decades before Google Translate, leaving international audiences baffled by the meaning of the title Gracias Por La Música. Being famous can be hard work and Super Trouper is one of pop’s best-ever articulations of that. Much as the title of the forthcoming exhibition builds on the accepted premise of a Super Trouper being a human of strong, resilient nature, the whole “beams are gonna blind me” business makes more sense when you realise a Super Trouper is a brand of spotlight. Abba, it is worth bearing in mind, never actually split up. “We just said we were going to have a rest,” Ulvaeus said in 1996, “and that was it.” Hiatus-watchers may conclude that 1D fans could be in for a long wait, but it surely makes Abba’s own potential comeback more likely. They don’t even have to get back together! They just have to get on with it.

For one, its account of life on the margins in a tiny city situated between Texas and Louisiana seems particularly resonant at a time when there’s such focus on Trump’s ‘forgotten man’. But this wasn’t gawk-at-the-rednecks poverty porn: its subjects, the ex-con hunting a notorious hog, the young alcoholic desperate to escape his home town, are funny and thoughtful and resistant to whatever stereotypes you might throw at them. It also made a very strong case for being the year’s most lovely doc to look at, with its almost painterly panning shots of swamps and bayous. GM The Lost City of Z If a tree falls in an unpopulated (but exquisitely shot) forest, and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? James Gray’s ravishing historical quest drama proves it does: it’s a rousing, resounding film scaled and styled like a monumental event, and even if mass audiences didn’t show up to see it land, it’s still echoing with me nearly a year later. You can feel the presence of David Lean and Werner Herzog in the sturdy bones of this epic, led by a never-better Charlie Hunnam as the doomed English explorer Percy Fawcett, his dreams of uncovering El Dorado cherished as dearly by the film as they are by its wayward hero. It’s no spoiler to say they never come true, which makes Gray’s film a uniquely broken valentine: it’s somehow a grand, transporting, heart-swelling ode to failure, and if it’s not surprising that the masses didn’t show up for that proposition, we should treasure it just the same. GL Graduation The Romanian new wave of the late 2000s – which got off to a blistering start with the abortion drama 4 Months. 3 Weeks and 2 Days in 2007 – never quite coalesced into a major cinematic movement, but its central focus, 4 Weeks’ director Cristian Mungiu, has been steadily making films since, analysing the struggles and backsliding of his home country after its emergence from the detritus of Soviet-style dictatorship. Graduation is his third film since, and though perhaps not as spectacularly gruesome as 4 Weeks, or as claustrophobic as its follow-up Beyond the Hills, it chronicles the shabby compromises of post-communist Europe with superb clarity. Adrian Titieni plays Romeo Aldea, a middle-aged doctor with a difficult home life: his relationship with his wife has collapsed, and his 18-year-old daughter is proving truculent as she prepares for the exams that might secure her a place at a university in London, and a ticket out. Then, out of nowhere, a crisis: the daughter (played by The White Ribbon’s Maria Dragus) suffers a sex assault, and is as a result far too traumatised to sit the examination. So Aldea begins the rounds, backscratching and favour-pulling, trying to get his daughter waved through, and over a hurdle she would have undoubtedly cleared anyway. Titieni is great in the role, like a large, frightened insect in a specimen bottle, scuttling from place to place trying to keep chaos at bay. Mungiu films it all with unsentimental harshness: his is as bleak a vision as they come. This s a film about a corrupt social organism, where the corruption is measured in guilt, and which perpetuates itself despite the self-hate it triggers. Graduation is both simple and complex at the same time: a rare feat, and film well worth seeking out because of it. AP The Lure Movie-musical lovers in search of something in every way the opposite of La La Land would do well to direct their attentions to Poland. That’s where Agnieszka Smoczyńska pulled off this bracingly original genre-bender, an electro-punk cover version of Hans Christian Andersen’s original Little Mermaid with a jagged feminist bite. A pair of comely mermaids land gigs at a local burlesque joint and catch the eyes of some local suitors, but differences of species test what they’re willing to sacrifice for love. The musical numbers are of particular note, an antidote to the the sanitized and overproduced spectacles coughed up every couple of years in Hollywood. Standout performance “Abracadabra” is raw and sexy and sleazy, a worthy successor to ‘Cabaret.’ Stars Marta Mazurek and Michalina Olszańska aren’t the most extensively trained dancers or singers, but their performance has an emphatic, livewire quality missing from many modern efforts. CB My Cousin Rachel If this were a just world, and 2017 has proved that it most definitely is not, then Rachel Weisz’s name would be frequently heard throughout this year’s awards season. Her performance in Roger Michell’s curiously ignored My Cousin Rachel, the second adaptation of Daphne du Maurier’s 1951 novel, is one of her best: a compelling, fiery take on a spell-bindingly unknowable literary femme fatale, disarming and enigmatic, charming and bewitching. The film around her isn’t quite so finely constructed (the direction is a tad stuffy at times) but the script keeps du Maurier’s curious cauldron of toxic masculinity and gender performance boiling over nicely throughout. Revealing its secrets would be a disservice to the many, many people who missed it (it didn’t even make $3m at the US box office) but it’s not as simple as the overwrought gothic melodrama it was sold as, instead providing a spiky and surprisingly contemporary dissection of relationships. BL Dawson City: Frozen Time On the one hand, Bill Morrison’s Dawson City: Frozen Time has had tremendous success for a found footage documentary. The story about a lost cache of early film reels buried in the Klondike played festivals from South Korea to Kosovo, and had an extended run in Los Angeles. But everyone interested in history and cinema (and the history of cinema) must make an effort to see this. Morrison’s background in the avant-garde lends adds a hazy “old, weird” patina to the forgotten, abandoned archive, told in large part with images from the materials themselves. The decaying stock and Alex Somers’ hypnotic score adds to the eerie storytelling ouroboros. There’s wonder and melancholy in every indescribable sequence, a window into the past made strangely clearer by its corrosion. Everything about this marvelous artifact is inadvertent, as if this is part of our history we weren’t meant to see. JH Inversion Inversion may take on a theme that has become familiar in recent Iranian cinema, but like the smog that gives it its title, this understated film sinks deep beneath the skin. The chemical fog choking Tehran is used as a metaphor for the stranglehold on women’s rights – and how that pervades into private life, family dynamics and romance. This isn’t a film about oppression or anger, though, but resilience. Inversion refers both to the meteorological phenomenon that traps the pollution low and close to the city streets, and the small rebellions enacted by three generations of women. Sahar Dolatshahi exudes a charismatic confidence in the lead as Niloofar, a businesswoman fighting to save her independence, hoping for love and savouring her happiness. Since I saw Inversion in the spring, I keep thinking about Niloofar, where she went next, and the music she heard as she travelled. PH Nobody’s Watching There has been no shortage of films tackling migration this year. Even so, this account of one man’s personal journey manages to bring something fresh to the theme. Julia Solomonoff’s acutely perceptive, achingly sad character study deals in downgraded dreams and the brutal realities of trying to make it as an artist. Nico (an extraordinary performance from Guillermo Pfening) comes not from desperation but a place of privilege. In Argentina, he’s an actor in a popular soap, mobbed by fans on the street. He left this life for New York and a role in an indie film which seems increasingly unlikely to happen. Having outstayed his visa, Nico is caught between two identities: the charming soap star, and a faceless member of the invisible underclass of undocumented immigrants struggling to make ends meet. The film captures New York at its most alluring and unforgiving; the lightness of touch, effortlessly credible characters and sense of place evokes the work of Ira Sachs. WI Suntan Argyris Papadimitropoulos is a Greek film-maker whose work stands a little outside the histrionic black-comic absurdism of contemporaries like Yorgos Lanthimos. But he deserves to be as well-known, and his Suntan is a superb realist study of male midlife breakdown. It is about someone who could be described as the EasyJet Gustav von Aschenbach. Makis Papadimitrou is excellent as Kostis, the plump, bald, middle-aged doctor who takes a job as a GP on a Greek holiday island. Poor, lonely Kostis one day has to attend to a gorgeous young woman who has fallen off her quad bike: Anna (Elli Tringou). She capriciously takes a shine to Kostis and invites him to come to the beach and hang out – and inevitably, Kostis embarrasses himself by falling deeply in love with her. Humiliation and worse is in store. It is superbly acted and directed and shot with great scenes, and Kostis’s agony is unbearable.

I’ve seen it happen","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"There was an extraordinary atmosphere in the House of Commons yesterday. It appeared on the surface as though the House was embroiled in a procedural debate over whether the government should hand a bundle of confidential documents to the work and pensions select committee. A very important debate, of course: those documents will give us a better idea as to the sturdiness of the foundations upon which the government’s mega-welfare reform programme is being built. But it was not quite the one I felt we were really having. It was one example from my constituency that so moved Heidi Allen MP, and as a result brought the debate to the attention of many outside the House. Very few of the points I’ve raised in the House, or reforms I’ve proposed since being elected in 1979, have been on the basis of sitting down and having a think. Almost all of them have been in response to what is happening in Birkenhead. There is no better tutorial for MPs than that which we are afforded by our constituencies. It takes time and a lot of work to keep in touch with our constituencies, but the tutorial we are then afforded remains in constant session. The next reform I’m proposing to the House is a bill to ensure no child goes hungry in the school holidays. Feeding Britain has been trying to prevent this hunger – providing free meals and activities for thousands of poorer children in Birkenhead and elsewhere – and the next stage is to marshal enough political support to get the bill through parliament. 129 MPs so far have pledged their support. Just as they have with the social evil of “holiday hunger”, it was the real-life stories from our own constituencies that electrified the House in yesterday’s debate on universal credit. Only in those circumstances does the House seem willing to put aside the barrage of statistics arguing this way, that way, and the other way, to engage fully with human plight and suffering. This is one of our many roles as MPs – to bring our constituents’ lives to the floor of the House. I’ve never experienced an occasion when a whole range of members have been able to do this, and the House not being moved in renewing its determination to act. Such movement has repercussions locally because local activists see their work being channelled into parliament and made effective. Likewise, people crushed by welfare reforms can see that their plight can affect what the House does. There is a disadvantage to being plugged into one’s constituents’ concerns. Each weekend I return from Birkenhead with so many people’s struggles in my mind, and ideas on the reforms we should be pursuing to protect those people, that I am then frustrated by not being able to put them all into action right away. My constituents teach me so much about what is going on, I’m then flooded with ideas. Here, we must learn how to prioritise the manifold injustices we confront in a way with which as many constituents as possible sympathise. Equally important is to help and support as many local action groups as possible – such as Feeding Britain – because good parliamentary performances alone don’t feed anyone. It is good to have statistics to back up how common the experience of despair and injustice has become in modern Britain. But one real case of simple horror reported faithfully to the House is worth more than a thousand pages of numbers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/07/grenfell-families-need-home-support-group","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T00:01:30Z","webTitle":"Four out of five Grenfell families still need homes, says support group","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/07/grenfell-families-need-home-support-group","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/07/grenfell-families-need-home-support-group","fields":{"headline":"Four out of five Grenfell families still need homes, says support group","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Four out of five families made homeless by the Grenfell Tower fire are still looking for homes almost six months after the disaster, and almost half face Christmas in hotel rooms, according to Grenfell United, the support group made up of families who survived the fire. Out of the 208 households that needed rehousing after the fire, 118 will still be in emergency accommodation or with friends over the holiday period, including 29 families with children. A further 48 households have accepted permanent housing offers, but have not yet moved in and are currently still in temporary homes, Grenfell United said. Days after the fire the prime minister, Theresa May, promised that families would be rehoused within three weeks. Last month, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC) promised that every survivor would have the opportunity to move into a new home before Christmas. More recently, Alok Sharma, the minister for housing and planning, said it would take RBKC up to 12 months to rehome families. Only 42 families have moved into new permanent homes, leaving 166 households still in temporary housing. Shahin Sadafi, chair of Grenfell United, said: “First it was three weeks, then six months. Now they are saying a year. For the survivors and affected families it seems like one broken promise after another. “We are talking about people who have been through the traumatic events and have lost so much, stuck in hotel rooms and make-do accommodation. No one can even start to rebuild their lives until they are in a place they can call home. It’s not too late to put this right but it needs urgent action now.” Elizabeth Campbell, leader of Kensington and Chelsea council, acknowledged that the pace for some had been too slow. “Our priority is to find permanent homes for the 209 households from the tower and [Grenfell] Walk who lost their homes in the fire. All of us sympathise with those who are still living in hotels with their children, especially at Christmas,” she said. “I have always said we can only move at the pace at which victims and survivors feel comfortable – no one should be rushed into making such an important decision about where they are going to live. However, I do accept for some the pace is too slow.” Defending the council’s record, she said: “Everyone knows it takes time to buy a house, to exchange, to complete, to paint, to furnish. It also takes time to buy a range of homes that will suit each individual and family’s differing needs. “But, in the coming months, I expect many more households will move into their new homes. We remain on course, however, to meet our target that everyone from the tower and Walk will be rehoused by June 2018.” The council came under repeated attack on Tuesday night from survivors of the fire in a tense public meeting of the scrutiny committee, the body that oversees the official response to the disaster. Tiago Alves, a 20-year-old tenant of the 13th floor, told the meeting: “You are trying to eat away at us slowly, slowly, slowly, in an attempt to break us up.” The deputy council leader and cabinet member for housing, Kim Taylor-Smith, admitted rehousing had been “desperately slow”, but said this was initially due to a lack of houses to offer survivors. The council hoped to acquire 300 houses in time for Christmas, he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/dec/12/ferryman-gielgud-theatre-royal-court-swap-tickets","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T07:00:27Z","webTitle":"What a performance, trying to swap our tickets for The Ferryman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/dec/12/ferryman-gielgud-theatre-royal-court-swap-tickets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/dec/12/ferryman-gielgud-theatre-royal-court-swap-tickets","fields":{"headline":"What a performance, trying to swap our tickets for The Ferryman","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"My husband and I were booked to attend the Royal Court production of The Ferryman at the Gielgud theatre, London, in October.

So, really, stop reading now if you haven’t caught up. The Good Place began as a sitcom about Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell), a flawed woman who had made it into heaven by mistake. But in the finale of the first series, she figures out that she has actually been in hell all along, and the illusion of heaven was merely part of a long-con psychological experiment designed by demonic Michael (Ted Danson). In a genre that doesn’t readily accept change, this revelation was groundbreaking. The show’s entire premise was turned on its head with a click of the fingers. It was the cliffhanger to end all cliffhangers – like Lost, but less silly. But it would count for nothing if the second series didn’t maximise on this momentum. And, boy, did it. Realising the game was up, Michael resets Eleanor’s memory, but she figures it out again. So he resets her memory, and she guesses again. Reset. Guess. Reset. Guess. In the space of a single glorious montage, Danson resets Bell’s memory hundreds of times, with some attempts lasting for months before she works out the truth. The episode vaults through what must be centuries in less than 10 minutes. Creator Mike Schur made his name on workplace sitcoms The Office and Parks and Recreation, so this was a leap into the unknown. It was fantastical. It was bold. It was the sort of move you can only pull off if you have total confidence in your abilities. But there’s more to The Good Place than an intriguing conceit. Despite the premise, it is relentlessly optimistic, largely thanks to ineffectual ethics professor Chidi (William Jackson Harper) – a man who takes it upon himself to teach everyone what it means to be good – and Janet (D’Arcy Carden), who is basically the walking embodiment of the internet. Janet delivers all her lines with the upbeat cadences of Siri, and this clean and bright sense of possibility ends up infecting everyone around her – even Danson’s character. In a glittering five-decade career, this may be the best Danson has ever been. He’s pushing 70 but is full of youthful vigour here, refusing to fall back on the beats and grace notes with which he made his name. Danson in The Good Place is an actor utterly liberated. He’s playing Satan having an existential crisis – not the easiest role, but he throws himself into every new twist with abandon. It’s a fun show, but nobody is having quite as much fun as Danson. The worst thing you could say about The Good Place is that it is a very, very good sitcom. In its weaker moments, when the story stalls in a morass of water-treading subplots, it’s still as funny as any traditional sitcom of the last 20 years. But when The Good Place strives for something new – when it bases an entire episode around Philippa Foot’s trolley problem thought experiment, or when it likens immortal world-building demons to TV showrunners – it hits highs that transcend the form. It is extraordinary, profound and completely special. (buy here) This article contains affiliate links to products.

Sandwiched between two busy roads in north Talpiot district in the west of the city, it is a scrubby area of dirt punctuated with litter and a few trees. Unprepossessing as it is, this plot is the most visible symbol of a controversy threatening to disrupt the Middle East after Donald Trump said he was directing the US state department to begin preparations to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to the city. The location of a barracks during the British mandate, the site was later an Israeli police base before being rented on a peppercorn, 99-year lease to the US government for $1 a year. In a city of deep divisions – claimed as a capital by both Israelis and Palestinians – this plot has suddenly found itself on a dangerous fracture line splitting not only Palestinians and Israelis, but the Middle East and international diplomatic opinion that for five decades has avoided recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital alone. On Wednesday, as Trump delivered his speech, Jerusalem had never felt more divided and anxious. In the conference hall and corridors of the city’s Waldorf Astoria hotel, where the Jerusalem Post was holding its annual diplomatic conference, Israeli ministers and leading political figures appeared exhilarated by the news. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, avoided mentioning the embassy issue but had rarely seemed more pleased, boasting about Israel’s diplomatic victories under his tutelage even as Middle Eastern leaders were delivering dire warnings about the repercussions of the embassy move. Others, however, did not dodge the issue. “This is also the time for the entire world to recognise united Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Policies should not be dictated by threats and intimidation,” said Yair Lapid, leader of Yesh Atid, a centre-left opposition party. “If violence is the only argument against moving the embassy to Jerusalem then it only proves it is the right thing to do. Now is the time to do what is right.” Outside of the Waldorf’s swish corridors, however, others were questioning the potential cost of a move that is alarming many on both sides – even those who believe the move is overdue. Among them was Aviad Kleinberg, writing in the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. “There is a good chance that this recognition, which is reasonable and justified in and of itself, will spark – if done separately from a peace agreement – waves of violence around the world. People will be killed. Is that justified?” he said. Shin Bet, Israel’s domestic security agency, too has warned of the risk of renewed violence in the city and the West Bank, while European embassies have warned visitors to avoid demonstrations and gatherings. And the complexities of Jerusalem, the reality of which seems to have gone above Trump’s head, are summed up by neighbourhoods like Shuafat refugee camp – the only one inside the city limits. Part of the Jerusalem municipality, Shuafat, is on the other side of the Israeli separation wall. In Shuafat, the speech changed everything. In a social club in the heart of the camp, young Palestinian men were playing snooker and cards in the minutes before Trump’s televised speech. The speech – translated into Arabic – was watched intensely and at first largely in silence, with the television tuned to a Palestinian channel with a new logo declaring “Jerusalem is ours”. “He’s saying he’s going to move the embassy,” added Hamdi Dyab, incredulous and growing more agitated by the minute. “This is very dangerous speech. Things don’t look good. We are calling for a new intifada. Now we can’t accept a two-state solution. We wanted Palestine from the sea to the Jordan river!” Sheikh Abdullah Alqam, coordinator of a Jerusalem committee representing Palestinian factions in East Jerusalem – a leader during first intifada – also delivered a stark warning as Trump spoke. “This will only encourage extremism. It will encourage Isis. Over one billion Muslims are asking why he is taking this step.” Then there are the settlements inside Jerusalem’s boundaries – most unrecognised by the international community. Some are simply houses occupied by settlers in the Muslim Quarter of the Old City and Palestinian neighbourhoods in the east of the city. Others comprise whole districts, like Pisgat Ze’ev on the other side of the wall from the camp in Jerusalem’s east. Among the shoppers in Pisgat Ze’ev’s sprawling mall on Wednesday were Miriam Barr and Natalya Yakoby, who although happy with Trump’s planned recognition were also nervous about what such an announcement might mean. “We are happy he is talking about doing this. This is our country and of course we want Jerusalem to be recognised as the capital of Israel. But I am worried,” said Barr. “We have young children. We made aliyah here from Russia,” explained Yakoby. “Our only thought is that our kids have a better life. And one of the kids in my son’s class was injured in an attack near here, though now he is OK.” Was the recognition of Jerusalem by Trump worth the potential risk? Barr does not answer at first, but shakes her head slightly. “They [the Palestinians] want us to give up more and more. But of course the best situation is peace.” Driving back through the city, an hour after Trump had spoken, a sense of anticlimax pervaded in the city’s rain-wet Jewish neighbourhoods. No car horns honked. Few people walked. No celebrations were visible. Only Israeli and US flags, paired and projected on the ancient walls of the Old City, suggested anything had changed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
