Age: About a month. Found in: The new Netflix remake of Lost in Space. Played by: Brian Steele. (You may remember him as the sasquatch in the Harry and the Hendersons TV series.) Appearance: Swee-eet. Excuse me? I’m just saying that the robot – known only as “the Robot” – looks really good. Well, I suppose when Netflix makes a big new sci-fi series it doesn’t skimp on the design budget. Yes, everyone agrees that the series is very sleek. But I didn’t mean the robot looked good in that way. In what way did you mean it, then? You know. There’s a certain sinuousness about the curves in the machinery that … Oh my God! Do you fancy a robot? He has many admirable qualities! Yes, he’s big and strong, and his rear end sticks out pleasingly when he pushes heavy things, but he is also gentle and protective. I don’t look at him as an object. But he literally is an object. We don’t know exactly what he is. He is an alien machine or life form of some kind, who becomes attached to the young boy of the family, Will Robinson, whom he looks after. So he’s like a space au pair? A sexy au pair, yes. Stop that! Look, I’m not the only one. The series had OK reviews after it launched in mid-April, but the shapeliness of the robot has been almost universally acclaimed. Call me repressed, but I think I’ll stick to humans. Feel free. This kind of thing is hardly new, however. I think it’s fair to say that Maria, the robot in the early sci-fi classic Metropolis (1922), was rather noticeably, er, busty. Even C-3P0 was more bootylicious than required. People, including you, are weird. Hey, the heart knows what it wants. The heart has a limited role in this, by the sound of it. I thought they had already remade Lost in Space, anyway? You must be thinking of the big-budget flop, starring Gary Oldman and Matt LeBlanc, in 1998. I’m trying not to. And, of course, the original 1960s TV series was already a remake, in a way, of the 1812 novel The Swiss Family Robinson. They were shipwrecked on a desert island, you may remember. Did they find a strangely attractive robot? They found a monkey. This conversation ends now. Good idea. Do say: “Danger, Will Robinson!” Don’t say: “Danger of mechanophilia!”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/may/02/george-michael-fans-asked-to-take-down-tributes-by-family","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T14:53:08Z","webTitle":"George Michael fans asked to take down tributes by family","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/02/george-michael-fans-asked-to-take-down-tributes-by-family","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/02/george-michael-fans-asked-to-take-down-tributes-by-family","fields":{"headline":"George Michael fans asked to take down tributes by family","bodyText":"The family of George Michael have asked fans to take down tributes left outside the singer’s homes in London and Oxfordshire, after the growing popularity of impromptu memorials that have turned into international tourist attractions began to divide local residents and conservationists. Fans of Michael, who was found dead at his riverside house in Goring on Christmas Day 2016, flocked to his two homes to create memorial gardens filled with flowers, poems, cards, framed pictures and candles. In Highgate village, north London, a prosperous area that counts A-list celebrities as residents, a triangle of land opposite Michael’s Grade II-listed house has been festooned with a growing number of offerings. In a statement on his official website, members of Michael’s family, including his sisters, Mel and Yioda, father Jack and friend David Austin, said they had been touched by the tributes celebrating and remembering Yog – their nickname for Michael. “However, we feel we cannot expect our Highgate and Goring neighbours to continue to accept as normality, the memorials so personal to you all, to remain as and where they are any longer,” they said. The statement asked Michael fans, who call themselves “Lovelies”, to pick up their tributes by 27 May and make a donation to charity instead, “so we can return both Mill Cottage and The Grove to their former simple state”. “This will take time to do properly, so we ask for your patience while trying to improve the grass and railings at The Grove,” it said. The family added that Michael liked his privacy and “would not want to disturb or change the quiet neighbourhoods he so loved, for the people in the local area who, honestly, despite reports otherwise have been gracious and very understanding”. The houses on Michael’s road in Highgate face the famous Flask pub and are one of the area’s biggest attractions. Former residents include the 19th-century poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Sting, Annie Lennox, Kate Moss and the late Victoria Wood. At the end of last year, Susan Rose, the chair of the Highgate Conservation Area advisory committee, wondered what Michael “would think of it all outside the beautiful home that he looked after so well, and right where he erected a wonderful Christmas tree every year”. No permanent memorial to Michael exists. Fans have campaigned for a lifesize bronze statue of the singer on the land outside his Highgate property. But though the campaign was backed by Michael’s record label, Sony, and local councillors, his family decided against the statue, saying he was a private person and would consider such a gesture “embarrassing”. The Highgate Society planning committee has also said proposals for a statue were “problematic”. “We are hoping, into the future, to get back to you with some more thoughts on ways and ideas to remember Yog that we hope you’ll like, and be a part of,” Michael’s family said in their statement. Annette McHail, who lays flowers near Michael’s Mill Cottage home in Goring every week, told the BBC the decision would “put the house back to how George would like it”. “He was a private person and I can appreciate what the family are saying. It needs to go back to normal now,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/03/future-sailors-what-will-ships-look-like-in-30-years","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T13:00:41Z","webTitle":"Future sailors: what will ships look like in 30 years?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/03/future-sailors-what-will-ships-look-like-in-30-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/03/future-sailors-what-will-ships-look-like-in-30-years","fields":{"headline":"Future sailors: what will ships look like in 30 years?","bodyText":"Watch out for the return of the sailing ship. After a commitment last month to cut greenhouse gas emissions from shipping by at least 50% by 2050, the race is on to find new technologies that can green the 50,000-strong global shipping fleet. Wind power is one of the options being discussed. International shipping accounts for more than 2% of global carbon dioxide emissions, roughly the same as aircraft. But the 2015 Paris agreement to fight climate change left control of the shipping industry’s emissions to the International Maritime Organisation. While environment groups applauded the agreement to cut hard and deep by 2050, they pointed out that it falls far short what is technically achievable. A report published just before the meeting by the International Transport Forum (ITF), a thinktank run by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), found that the industry could achieve up to 95% decarbonisation as early as 2035 using “maximum deployment of currently known technologies.” Low-tech solutions The good news is that easy-to-do low-tech solutions can deliver a lot. Maersk, the world’s largest container shipping line, has already discovered it can cut fuel use 30% simply by steaming more slowly. Because of the wide availability of cheap (and often dirty) fuel, shipping has traditionally been wasteful. Most merchant ships are made of heavy steel rather than lighter aluminium, and don’t bother with obvious energy-saving measures like low-friction hull coatings or recovering waste heat. More slender ship designs alone could cut fuel use — and hence emissions — by 10-15% at slow speeds and up to 25% at high speeds, says the ITF. But replacing the existing fleet would take time. The average age of today’s shipping fleet is 25 years. Rules of energy efficiency for new ships introduced by the IMO in 2013 will only fully come into force from 2030, meaning that any switch to slender ships would not apply to most ships at sea until mid-century or beyond. But much could be done more quickly by retrofitting existing ships with technology to cut their fuel use and hence emissions, according to the ITF. Here are just four: Fitting ships’ bows with a bulbous extension below the water line reduces drag enough to cut emissions 2-7%; A technique known as air lubrication, which pumps compressed air below the hull to create a carpet of bubbles, also reduces drag and can cut emissions by a further 3%; Replacing one propeller with two rotating in opposite directions recovers slipstream energy and can make efficiency gains of 8-15%, Cleaning the hull and painting it with a low-friction coating can deliver gains of up to 5%. Entirely new ships Putting together better designs and better fuel will create entirely new kinds of ships in future. And the blueprints are already being drawn up. The Aquarius Ecoship, a cargo ship devised by a Japanese company called Eco Marine Power, is driven by a phalanx of rigid sails and solar panels. The same system could power oil tankers, cruise ships and much else. It would not, the designers admit, entirely eliminate the need for conventional fuel: Even with large batteries to store the solar and wind energy, back-up would be needed. But it could cut emissions by 40 percent. Going one better, the Japanese shipping line NYK boasts that its design for a 350m-long container ship, the Super Eco Ship 2030, would use LNG to make hydrogen to run fuel cells. Backed up by solar panels covering the entire ship and 4,000 square metres of sails to catch the wind, the combination could cut emissions by 70%. Or for a completely zero-carbon option, engineers at Wallenius Wilhelmsen, a Scandinavian shipping line, offer the E/S Orcelle, a lightweight cargo ship designed to transport up to 10,000 cars (electric, we trust) on eight decks. It would be powered by electricity, half coming directly from wind, solar and wave energy, and the other half from converting some of that energy into hydrogen to power fuel cells. The company says the ship could be afloat by 2025. Today’s ships are in many respects almost indistinguishable from those of a century ago. But the IMO decision to finally get with the global climate agenda has fired the starting gun on what is set to be a race to create a new standard for low-carbon shipping that should be the norm just a few decades from now. Banishing conventional fuel Some of the biggest gains will require banishing conventional petroleum-based fuel, says the Sustainable Shipping Initiative, a progressive industry ginger group whose members include cruise lines and commodities shipping lines. Innovations ranging from biofuels to liquefied natural gas (LNG), nuclear reactors to sails to catch the wind, and hydrogen to solar panels have been proposed. Each has its benefits and drawbacks, and nobody is putting all their money on one solution. Biofuels are problematic because they take land to grow, though specially engineered crops such as algae could change that, says the ITF. While electric engines already operate on some short ferry journeys, the sheer weight and space taken up by batteries on oceangoing ships make them unviable until there are breakthroughs in lithium-ion batteries. Solar power can only augment other power sources. One innovation already underway is converting ships to run on LNG. There are already more than a hundred LNG-fuelled ships globally. A new generation of giant cruise ships powered this way and carrying up to 7,000 passengers will be launched by MSC Cruises starting in 2022. Some LNG ships claim a reduction in CO2 emissions of 15%, though that depends crucially on keeping leakage of the greenhouse gas methane to a minimum in ships and bunkers. The first LNG-powered cruise ship is the Viking Grace, operating between Finland and Sweden. This vessel has another claim to fame. As of this April it also boasts the first ship-based “rotor sail” to capture power from the wind. Rotor sails have a large spinning cylinder amidships. Wind hitting the rotor creates a vertical force that can be used to power the ship, a phenomenon known as the Magnus effect. The Viking Line says the extra power will reduce the ship’s CO2 emissions by 900 metric tonnes (1,000 tons) per year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/29/amber-rudd-letter-to-pm-reveals-ambitious-but-deliverable-removals-target","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T16:00:47Z","webTitle":"Amber Rudd letter to PM reveals 'ambitious but deliverable' removals target","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/29/amber-rudd-letter-to-pm-reveals-ambitious-but-deliverable-removals-target","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/29/amber-rudd-letter-to-pm-reveals-ambitious-but-deliverable-removals-target","fields":{"headline":"Amber Rudd letter to PM reveals 'ambitious but deliverable' removals target","bodyText":"The private letter from Amber Rudd to Downing Street in which she sets an “ambitious but deliverable” target for an increase in the enforced deportation of immigrants has been published by the Guardian in full for the first time. The letter, signed by the home secretary in January last year, states that she is refocusing work within her department to achieve the “aim of increasing the number of enforced removals by more than 10% over the next few years”. Rudd has claimed she did not set, see or approve any targets for removals. The former immigration minister Brandon Lewis suggested on Sunday this proposed increase was an ambition rather than a target. But Home Office sources have told the Guardian that it is “shame-faced nonsense” to claim the department had not been set specific targets in this area, or that these have not been regularly discussed at the highest levels. The latest furore was sparked on Friday when the Guardian published details from a separate confidential memo that was sent to Rudd in June last year. Prepared by Hugh Ind, the director general of Immigration Enforcement in the Home Office, it picked up on the new policy outlined by Rudd in her letter to Theresa May. The document stated that his agency had “set a target of achieving 12,800 enforced returns in 2017/18 … this will move us along the path towards the 10% increased performance on enforced returns which we promised the Home Secretary earlier this year”. While Rudd has denied seeing the six-page briefing note, the Guardian can now reveal that it was also sent to at least eight of the Home Office’s most senior officials, including: • Marc Owen, senior director of national and international operations in Immigration Enforcement. • Mark Thomson, the director general of the Passport Office. • Tony Eastaugh, UK director of operations at Immigration Enforcement. • Gareth Hills, director of performance and risk at the Home Office. • Stephen Kershaw, a senior director in Immigration Enforcement. • Andrew Wren, director of performance, assurance and governance at the Home Office. The disclosure will heap further pressure on Rudd, who has said she will address MPs on Monday to answer the “legitimate questions” that have been raised over the past week. On Friday night, nine hours after the Guardian first told the Home Office about the leaked memo, Rudd tweeted: “I wasn’t aware of removal targets. I accept I should have been and I am sorry that I wasn’t.” The response appears at odds with the letter she sent to the prime minister in January last year. But it also suggests that none of the other senior officials and special advisers copied into the subsequent briefing note ever discussed with her the targets which the Immigration Enforcement agency was attempting to reach on her instruction. Home Office sources have told the Guardian that Immigration Enforcement has been working all year to reach the target of 12,800 enforced returns in 2017-18. They have been bracing themselves to acknowledge to ministers that the agency has failed to do so. To meet the goal, it needed to deport 250 people a week, but it has only been able to remove about 225 a week. “At the Home Office we work in a target culture,” said a source. “The civil service is completely target based. That’s all we do. It is shame-faced nonsense for Amber Rudd to say otherwise.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/29/sainsburys-and-asda-to-reveal-details-of-shock-15bn-merger","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T18:12:52Z","webTitle":"Sainsbury's and Asda to reveal details of shock £15bn merger","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/29/sainsburys-and-asda-to-reveal-details-of-shock-15bn-merger","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/29/sainsburys-and-asda-to-reveal-details-of-shock-15bn-merger","fields":{"headline":"Sainsbury's and Asda to reveal details of shock £15bn merger","bodyText":"Sainsbury’s and Asda will confirm on Monday the details of a £15bn merger creating a new grocery superpower that would ring up nearly £1 in every £3 spent on groceries on the UK high street. The shock deal was revealed on Saturday and immediately triggered fears of thousands of job losses. The pair have a combined workforce of 360,000 people and the merged company would leapfrog Tesco to become the UK’s biggest private sector employer. Joe Clarke, the acting national officer of the United union, described the deal as an “absolute shocker” with “implications for tens of thousands of jobs”. Staff were in “utter disarray”, he said, adding: “Staff are already facing uncertainty through restructuring and changes to contracts at [Sainsbury’s]. Sainsbury’s bosses need to give workers clarity over what the future could hold and assurances over jobs as matter of urgency.” A merger of the UK’s second and third largest retailers raises huge competition concerns, with industry insiders saying the tie-up would effectively create a “duopoly”, as the enlarged Sainsbury’s and Tesco would control nearly 60% of the UK grocery retail market. The deal will trigger a major retail competition inquiry, the likes of which has not seen since Morrisons moved on Safeway in 2003. Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the proposed merger could create “even more concentrated local monopolies” and challenged Andrew Tyrie, the incoming boss of the Competition and Markets Authority regulator, to reverse a history of “spineless” inquiries by conducting a robust investigation. “This is an early test for Andrew Tyrie and an important one,” Cable said. “The CMA really needs to show some teeth after previously being soft in its remedies in the audit, banking and energy sectors.” Last year, the CMA waved through Tesco’s £3.7bn takeover of cash-and-carry group Booker despite warning by rivals it could drive them out of business Andrew Simms, the co-director of the New Weather Institute thinktank and the author of Tescopoly, said: “This is profoundly not in the public interest. It’s going to have negative consequences for consumers and all the along the grocery supply chain.” Minette Batters, the president of the National Farmers’ Union, said: “[The CMA] must take into account the impact of changes to supplier arrangements that could give rise to reductions in choice.” Sainsbury’s will publish a statement fleshing out the terms of the agreement on Monday morning at 7am. The shares-based deal is expected to create a combined company worth £15bn including debt, led by current Sainsbury’s boss Mike Coupe. It is envisaged that his opposite number at Asda, Roger Burnley, will report to Coupe. The proposed new retail giant will have 2,800 stores and annual sales of more than £50bn. The plan is to retain both retail brands because they have different heartlands and attract different sorts of shoppers. One senior industry source said that Walmart had been trying to sell the struggling Asda chain for some time. The deal brokered with Sainsbury was, he said, evidence the US retailer was “flying the white flag” after failing to conquer the UK market during the near two decades it has owned the Leeds-based grocer. Talks between the two businesses have been going on for more than a year, with the deal based on pooling buying power to offer lower prices at the checkout – rather than closing stores or cutting jobs. The Qatar Investment Authority, the sovereign wealth fund that is currently Sainsbury’s biggest shareholder, is said to be supportive of the plan. It is thought the CMA has already been in advanced discussions with Sainsbury’s and Asda as the regulator’s guidance states that “businesses are strongly encouraged to approach the CMA to discuss their merger ... on a confidential basis” before formally notifying the regulator. However, one senior supermarket executive said the deal would be a hard sell to the regulator, saying: “This will be much more difficult to get through than the Tesco/Booker deal as it will effectively create a duopoly with 60% of the UK grocery market. Last time they made it very clear that the big four [supermarkets] could not become three. It will be a long and challenging process to win approval and could force a lot of store disposals.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/apr/29/manchester-united-v-arsenal-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T17:55:57Z","webTitle":"Manchester United 2-1 Arsenal: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/apr/29/manchester-united-v-arsenal-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/apr/29/manchester-united-v-arsenal-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Manchester United 2-1 Arsenal: Premier League – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s about it for today’s blog. Thanks for your company and emails, bye! Here’s Arsene Wenger “It was a very positive performance and overall it reflects our season away from home. We looked a little tired in the last 20 minutes. It’s good to see the young players having the courage to play in this atmosphere. It was a very nice reception – it was classy. I have come here for a long, long time and next year somebody else will sit on the bench and they will get a very hostile reception!” Here’s Daniel Taylor’s report from Old Trafford Here’s Jose Mourinho “A draw wouldn’t have been unfair. They played well; the two young centre-backs did very, very well. We had a few more chances but that’s normal. We changed our approach in the second half, we had more width and we used Marouane to give us more presence in the box. I knew they were going to drop deep, and without Lukaku I felt we needed a presence in the air. I knew we would create problems that way.” We’ll have Danny Taylor’s match report shortly, and I’m expecting reaction from Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho in our Whatsapp group. Ainsley Maitland-Niles is the Man of the Match “We’re disappointed and unhappy to concede so late. You live and learn from these experiences and it was great to be out there. The manager trusts the young players and we tried to show what we could do. I’m happy playing midfield and I guess I delivered. The manager is like a father figure to me and it’s brilliant having someone like that.” United need four points from the last three games to be certain of finishing second. Those games are Brighton (A), West Ham (A) and Watford (H) That was a brilliant substitution from Jose Mourinho, even though he won’t get much credit for it. Arsenal struggled to handle Fellaini and he was by far the biggest three in the last 10 minutes. Paul Pogba speaks! “I feel very good. We played well, we had lots of chances. The perfect season would have been the league – we didn’t manage that, but we want to finish second and win the FA Cup.” Marouane Fellaini speaks! “The manager told me to get into the box. I know my quality, I know that if the ball comes in the box I can be dangerous. It was a good ball, I tried to flick it, and it’s a goal.” Russell Richardson points out that Fellaini’s goal confirms United’s place in the top four, and thus ensures they will be eliminated in the last 16 of the Champions League next season. “I thought it about time you had a comment from an old fart,” says Terry Woods, selflessly offering his services. “My memory takes me back to 1966-67, my Gooner debut season. Utd were the visitors at a packed Highbury evening game, there was I at the grand age of 11 stood at the front of the old West stand witnessing a 1-1 draw, United wearing an all white strip, in those days our shirts were an exact match: red shirt, white collar and cuffs. The North bank to my left was in good voice, the Clock end to my right was open to the night sky. There started my love affair with THE Arsenal.” That win should ensure United finish the season in second place. They could end with 86 points, a title-winning total in some cultures. Peep peep! Arsene Wenger’s last trip to Old Trafford ends in another painful defeat. It doesn’t come close to the misery of 2001, 2004 or 2011, but it will still smart because Arsenal’s young side played well and deserved a draw. Fellaini was under pressure and facing away from goal when Young’s cross reached him. He tried to guide it towards goal with the back of his appreciable noggin, and it took a deflection off the challenging Xhaka before drifting away from Ospina. One last bit of Old Trafford heartbreak for Arsene Wenger. Young’s inswinging cross is backheaded into the net by Fellaini, and United have stolen two extra points. 90 min Four added minutes. 89 min Rashford has a goal disallowed for offside. Fellaini headed Martial’s cross against the post, from where it rebounded off Rashford and into the net. He was clearly offside when Fellaini headed the ball and there are no complaints. 88 min “Very few players take shots from distance these days,” says Arthur Tee. “Teams are too concerned with possession and protecting the ball. United in particular create very few chances, relatively, but they are almost always gilt-edged.” 87 min Willock tries to slip a pass through for Welbeck, and Smalling does well to poke the ball back to De Gea. 87 min The match is petering out. Martial tries to run Bellerin, who defends solidly. 85 min Pogba, surrounded by Arsenal defenders in the area, backheels the ball into his own standing leg and away from danger. 84 min Why doesn’t Paul Pogba shoot from long range any more? 83 min The lively Young lifts a deep cross beyond the far post, where Valencia arrives late and volleys the ball into orbit. 82 min Young’s terrific cross almost finds the head of Fellaini, who appeals for a penalty after a bit of a wrestle with Mavropanos. I don’t think it was a foul. 81 min United are dominating the match without looking like they are going to score. It feels like an end-of-season friendly. 80 min “My favourite Arsenal/United memory was back in 2001,” says Xavier Pillai. “It was my first game ever at Highbury and I was 7. Two Fabien Barthez mistakes and the song ‘Give it to Barthez’ rang around the ground. After the match, we went to the side entrance on Avenell road and we continued to sing. We caught the United players coming out to their coach and there with his head nestled in Paul Scholes’ shoulder and with a few tears dripping from his eyes was Fabian Barthez. They rushed him on to the coach and there began my love affair with the Arsenal. A close second was being in the Emirates for that Henry header.” 79 min United win three corners in quick succession, and waste all of them. 78 min Talking of strangling, this picture gets more wonderful by the year. 77 min “Brian McClair strangling Winterburn has to be a favourite,” says Adam Hirst. “It got a bigger cheer at OT than most goals. Not the penalty or the Battle of OT matches, but obviously related.” 76 min Arsenal make their final change: the goalscorer Henrikh Mkhitaryan is replaced by Joe Willock. 76 min Ospina bumps into Fellaini and staggers around for a few seconds before falling over. He looks in a fair bit of pain, and Petr Cech is warming up just in case. 73 min It hasn’t really happened for Rashford since he came on. He looks rusty, which is probably because he is rusty. 72 min In-form goalgetter Chris Smalling misses a good chance, fresh-airing an attempted sidefoot from Martial’s low cross. 71 min Martial lifts a dangerous cross towards Fellaini, who is poised to apply noggin to ball when Mavropanos heads behind for a corner. Fine defending. He’s had a quietly impressive debut. 69 min Fellaini is robbed by Welbeck, who thrashes a shot towards goal from 25 yards. It’s well struck but too close to De Gea, who saves comfortably. 68 min United were so good against Spurs last weekend but this has been a pedestrian performance. It’s hard to fathom why they are quite so inconsistent. 66 min Martial enlivens the crowd by slaloming past three defenders, only to overhit a pass to Fellaini. 64 min Substitutions galore. For Arsenal, Danny Welbeck and Nacho Monreal replace Reiss Nelson and Sead Kolasinac. For United, Anthony Martial and Marouane Fellaini replace Ander Herrera and Jesse Lingard. 62 min Lingard plays a nice one-two with Pogba and has a shot blocked. This is much better from United. 61 min “As I’ve lived overseas since 1991, I don’t think I’ve ever seen Wenger’s Arsenal live,” says Adam Roberts. “I do have a vivid memory of taking my son to OT in 2001. A strange day - Craig Bellamy and John Hartson were really good for Coventry and Andy Goram was in goal for United. I was high up in the Peak District with son asleep in the car when I heard that Arsenal had lost 0-3 to Middlesbrough who had one shot on target and United had won the league. “Live, two very clear memories of Highbury, both times standing in the Clock End. 1983 - United go 4-0 up in the League Cup semi 1st leg. And secondly, the FA Cup 1988 in a perfect position to see Chocky’s penalty sailing into the North Bank. The joy of the penalty award turning to ashes in our disbelieving mouths and Winterburn giving McClair loads, the beginning of much nastiness to follow over the years.” Didn’t it begin a year earlier when Norman Whiteside and David Rocastle had a row? The Winterburn incident certainly helped, though. 59 min United are playing with a bit more urgency since the affront of Arsenal’s equaliser. It’s still not the most compelling game of association football, however. 55 min Mkhitaryan tries for his second, whacking a shot over the bar from the edge of the box. Arsenal look the likelier scores at the moment. 53 min Sanchez plays a fine pass to Valencia, whose cross eventually reaches Ashley Young. He hits a half-volley that is deflected behind for a corner. Mkhitaryan equalises against his old club! It came from a United mistake, with Herrera and Matic leaving the ball to each other in midfield. Xhaka nicked it off them and played it to Mkhitaryan, who moved into the D and drove a low shot that went through the legs of Lindelof and into the net. It wasn’t the cleanest strike but De Gea was unsighted and it drifted into the corner. 51 min “I come from a younger generation of fans who never really got to experience the rivalry in its pomp,” says Abhu Tyagi. “Yet it was those battles of those early 2000s that ignited my interest in football. My best friend as a five-year old was British and he was a United supporter who hated Arsenal. As a five-year old is wont to do, I started doing the exact same thing. Since then, I loved every moment of it; Ronaldo and Rooney running amok in 2009, that counter-attack in 2010, 8-2, RVP’s goal but perhaps my most vivid memory is more recent: the abject 3-0 defeat in 2015, where for the first time in a long time, United lost to Arsenal in a meaningful Premier League game. I saw my childhood crumbling to dust, as I received message after message from Arsenal fans, all too keen to gloat. Perhaps the worst moment (and there were many) of the LVG era.” 50 min Marcus Rashford replaces Lukaku, who is hobbling off the field. It looks like a knock rather than something that might keep him out of the FA Cup final, but you never know with these things. 50 min Lukaku is down after a strong but fair tackle from Mavropanos. I think he needs to come off. 49 min “Is it fair to single out any one Arsenal player as an example of stasis, or worse?” says Charles Antaki. “Probably not. But if you wanted to, Kolasinac is a decent candidate for the familiar trope of declining expectations. He started out as a terrific lump of muscular, marauding attacking wing-backery, and now, on today’s basis at least, he’s become just a terrific lump. But as with the game as a whole, it’s hard to care at the moment.” 48 min Maitland-Niles makes a surging run into the United area, only to mishit a left-footed shot that takes a double deflection and bounces through to De Gea. It was a lovely run though. 47 min Crikey, what a statistic this is from the folks on Sky Sports. United have led at half-time in 268 Premier League games at Old Trafford. They’ve won 253, drawn 15 and lost none. 47 min “The 2-4 at Highbury in 2005 is my favourite,” says Liam Moseley. “Arsenal were at the end of a cycle; United were at the beginning of theirs. Neither side were anywhere near winning the league yet the game so was intense and full of hatred for one another that it made a compelling and thrilling encounter. There hasn’t been a game like it in the Premier League since.” Yeah, what I like about that game is that it meant absolutely nothing and absolutely everything. Chelsea were also going to win the league, but by then Arsenal and United loathed each other so much that context was irrelevant. It was just wonderful. 46 min Peep peep! United begin the second half of this pulsating match. Half-time email “Hi Rob,” says Ted Lee. “I had to staff a computer fair the day of the 1999 semi-final replay, so I couldn’t watch the game. There were no smartphones back then, limited internet connectivity where I was, and it was still a time where to watch the I had to drive 40 minutes at 6 a.m. on a Saturday to find a sports bar carrying Setanta. But the FA Cup game was being televised, so I recorded it at home and it wasn’t too hard to avoid the result. I turned on the TV before rewinding my VCR, and the TV tuner was on the station it was recording and in that odd way you hear the TV’s audio for a couple of seconds before the video came on, I heard what was unmistakably Ferguson’s voice say ‘We got out of jail.’ I muted the TV to not hear any more and very much enjoyed the next two hours.” I bet you enjoyed minutes 69-109 a lot more than most United fans did. Peep peep! United lead through Paul Pogba’s goal in a subdued match. Arsenal’s reserves have played some nice stuff and probably deserve to be level. 45 min “I still love the 6-2 in the Rumbelows Cup,” says Anthony Perrin. “Wallace and Sharpe on the rampage. United were around 25 years without the league and Arsenal had been exchanging league titles. It made be break the tab on my VHS so it couldn’t be recorded over. That was a massive commitment in the early Nineties.” I got the worst mark of my life in an exam the next day, having been far too giddy to do any last-minute revision, or care less about the exam itself. I’d like to say I was also giddy about Thatcher resigning that day, but that would be a bald-faced one. 44 min A cross from the right is headed wide from 12 yards by the flying Nelson. It was a decent enough effort. There wasn’t much pace on the ball so he had a lot of work to do, and he couldn’t do it. 41 min Young’s mishit cross from the left smacks off the outside of the near post! 40 min Xhaka, already booked, is penalised for handball. Kevin Friend decides not to give him a second yellow, presumably because it was a misjudgement rather than a cynical handball. 39 min “Surprised you have got this far without anyone mentioning the 1979 Cup Final yet,” says Nicholas Porritt. “A vivid childhood memory made more memorable because there was so little live football back then. At that time Arsenal really were vile, barely above Leeds United in the popularity stakes and encapsulated perfectly by the Willie Young foul the following year. That Man Utd team was typical of the post-Busby, pre-Fergie United: stylish, expensive, but ultimately unreliable and disappointing. The Jaguar of the Football League. You couldn’t help falling in love with them.” Dave Sexton’s United stylish, really? It was before my time, but I’ve read one or two alternative appraisals. 38 min A bit of pinball in the Arsenal area ends with a shot from Lukaku that deflects off Bellerin and is easily saved by Ospina. 37 min Back in the year 2018, Arsenal are having an excellent spell. As Martin Tyler says on Sky, an equaliser wouldn’t be undeserved. GOAL! Manchester United 0-1 Arsenal (Wiltord 57) Arsenal are surely going to be champions now! Sylvain Wiltord has continued their record of scoring in every game and taken them to the brink of glory. Ljungberg, inevitably, was involved. He ran through a woolly challenge from Blanc and hit a shot that was pushed away by Barthez. It came to Wiltord, who slid it nonchalantly into the net with his left foot! 36 min Aubameyang misses an excellent chance, heading weakly at De Gea from 10 yards after a good cross from Bellerin. 34 min Has anyone trademarked the phrase “end-of-season feel”? 31 min “Mkhitaryan so far looks like he never left,” says Adam Roberts. “Some nice touches but rubbish at crucial points.” 30 min After a decent United break, Lingard’s long-range shot is blocked by the trailing leg of Chambers. He should have played in Valencia on the right. 27 min Maitland-Niles clips a quick pass into the area for Aubameyang, who can’t make room for a shot. Arsenal have played some lively stuff going forward. 26 min Arsenal have two unsuccessful penalty appeals in 20 seconds. The first was a Mkhitaryan dive, the second was a tackle by Sanchez on Maitland-Niles. I don’t think it was a penalty. 25 min Pogba’s free-kick hits the wall and deflects to Sanchez, who is offside. 24 min Xhaka is booked for a foul on Lingard 25 yards from goal. Pogba will want a piece of this. 23 min “One of the saddest things is that if you’d told someone 10 years ago that there’d be an Arsenal-United game in late April, with no impact on the title race, with neither team anywhere near winning the title, no one would have believed you,” says AB Parker. “This game has a look of a preseason friendly at the moment. With the team we’ve put out, United should be battering us.” 21 min “One of my least favourite footballing games in history has to be Arsenal 1-2 United in Nov 2014, in which Arsenal had about 300 shots on goal and United had one,” says Jordan Pickering. “One shot on goal and they came away with a 2-1 victory. It so encapsulates what it means to be an Arsenal supporter.” 20 min Mkhitaryan almost equalises after a fine move. Bellerin crossed low to Maitland-Niles, who flicked a dainty backheel to Mkhitaryan on the edge of the box. He took a touch and drove a low shot just wide of the far post. 19 min “My favourite Arsenal/United moment is more down to circumstance than any actual investment in the rivalry,” says Matt Dony. “I’m a Liverpool fan, who also harbours a fairly intense dislike of Wenger and Arsenal (but my word, do I respect him!) Anyway, May 2002, I spent a Monday night watching Bob Dylan in Cardiff CIA (followed by drinking in a hotel bar being bored by Ebdon’s slow slow victory, but that’s another story). I spent the next few days staying at a friend’s house, the smuggest United fan I know, still on a giddy, Dylan-induced high. I did not particularly want Arsenal to win the league that fateful Wednesday, but the fact that I got to enjoy my friend’s disappointment, anger, and dejection at Wiltord’s goal was a wonderful thing, having spent the previous few years having to tolerate his pride in Fergie’s success. Ah, magical memories. The future’s yours, the past is mine.” I didn’t find that game too distressing, weirdly. The title was gone. Losing to Leverkusen on away goals the week before; now that was pain. 17 min Sanchez’s header was actually diverted onto the post by Bellerin, an heroic and entirely futile intervention. United take the lead. Lukaku’s brilliant chipped cross was headed against the post by the flying Sanchez, and Pogba followed up to volley home from six yards. 15 min Matic sprays a superb crossfield pass to Valencia, whose good cross is headed away by Chambers. United are having a lot of the game now. 14 min “The defining match was 28 November 1992,” says Paul Hayes. “United had signed Cantona two days before and I was still reeling with shock. He was brilliant.and, let’s be honest, very tough. (He had even got me grudgingly admiring Leeds.) My father had brought me up on stories of the toughness of United players able to boss the opposition with skill and also physicality – Edwards and Stiles being his favourites. That steel had been developing – remember the United vs Arsenal brawl two seasons earlier, defining in the way that United began to compete in every aspect while not quite gelling. “But that’s not this story. In the end, Cantona wasn’t in team to face Arsenal. Instead Giggs was brilliant on the right wing and Lee Sharpe was quick on the lift and Hughes was bolshie, aggressive and bundled in an ugly goal bettering Adams after Giggs and then Sharpe had bettered Winterburn and Dixon, I think. The second half was dour, fractured and attritional but United clung on for a win this time. When I spoke with my father that evening I told him that United would win the league because they’re bloody tough physically and mentally and with Cantona in the team they’d have the flair to beat anyone.” 12 min United are slowly starting to dominate possession, though the game is still fairly flat. 10 min “Hello Rob,” says Russell George. “My most vivid memory of United-Arsenal was probably the brawl in 1990. I was 16 at the time, sitting in the main stand at Old Trafford so had a pretty good view of it all. The crowd reaction that day was positively feral, both exhilarating and frankly pretty scary. If only OT had a little bit more of that I’d probably try and go a bit more. I also remember watching Grandstand when we were losing in the cup match in 88. The reporter was doing an update when we got the late penalty so they stayed with it. When McClair hit it over I was absolutely distraught. Still, there have been more happy times than sad. After we beat them 4-1 in the Michael Knighton game in 1989 I wrote a full-length report which I sent to Patrick Barclay at the Independent. I really wanted to be a football reporter at the time, and Patrick was gracious enough to ring me up one Sunday morning to say how much he liked my writing.” 8 min Smalling pokes a pass towards Lingard, in space on the right of the box. He drills a low cross-shot that is kicked away from inside his own six-yard box by Chambers. 7 min “Hi Rob,” says Brad McMillan. “As a United fan, it was a blessing that my best mate from school supported Arsenal. During that period, 1996-2005 (age 15-24 for us both), we were almost inseparable, and there’s no way either of us would have enjoyed it as much without the other. For both of us, Utd v Arsenal means growing up: girls, (not fast) cars and alcohol. The rest of the time was obviously squandered. Anyway, when I look back, my most prominent memories are Utd losing, specifically the Old Trafford defeats in 1998 and 2002. The next, possibly my favourite, is the feeling of incredulity when John O’Shea chipped in at Highbury I’m 2005. Keane-Vieira in the tunnel would have meant nothing without that cherry. Also, it now feels like the very last blow of that era - and Utd won, even if the league was Chelsea’s by then.” 6 min United have started slowly, as they wont to do. Arsenal look much more sprightly, particularly the returning Mkhitaryan. 5 min “This may be common knowledge,” says Doremus Schafer, “but I only just now realized that Bergkamp’s saved penalty strictly speaking should have been retaken for encroachment by Paul Scholes.” That’s a good spot. Can you imagine if David Elleray had ordered a retake? Roy Keane would have been straight out of his early bath to administer advice. 4 min Matic’s mishit volley falls nicely for Pogba 10 yards out. He spins around, takes aim ... and shanks the ball well wide of the near post with his left foot. 3 min It’s been a decent start from Young Arsenal, with lots of possession in the United half. 2 min “Arsenal’s late win in 2007 over perhaps Ferguson’s greatest ever side (with the bonus addition of Henrik Larsson) always sticks in my mind, not so much for the quality of the football, which was probably excellent, but for Henry’s late headed winner,” says Matt Loten. “I’m sure he scored one or two others with his noggin over the years, but I struggle to recall any, and at such a crucial moment. Bit like Messi in the 2009 Champions League final.” That was the same game when he celebrated in Gary Neville’s face, wasn’t it? 1 min Arsenal get the match under way. Sir Alex Ferguson has presented Arsene Wenger with a special memento on behalf of United. Jose Mourinho is in the mix as well. It’s a love-in! It’s an unlikely, moving scene, and a lovely touch from Ferguson. They’ve come a long way from the days when Wenger said he would “never talk about that man again”. The players emerge from the tunnel. Arsene Wenger follows them, and is applauded down the touchline by the United fans. There will be no Champions League final for Manchester City - their former player Lucy Bronze scored the winning goal against them for Lyon in the semi-final second leg. “Some great memories,” says Yoxall. “The 4-1 on the opening day 89/90 was great; we just didn’t expect it. The 99 cup game, the game at Highbury when RVN netted, and the tide turned in the title race, the superb counter in the Champions League and the 8-2. Plus all the various “battles”! But on a personal note, my son’s first game was the 2-1 where Arsene was sent to the stand but had nowhere to go. You never forget your first time! I’m sure we’ll give him a respectful reception today.” One for the Arsenal fans “How differently does Wenger’s legacy play if Keane doesn’t do his knee at Elland Road in 1997?” says Harvey Auzorst. “Without that half of the first double you’re looking at one FA Cup in his first five years, and the idea of Wenger changing everything seems a bit flimsy.” They might have won it anyway but it’s an interesting point. There are so many ifs in the rivalry: the Treble and the Invincible season wouldn’t have happened had Bergkamp and Van Nistelrooy scored last-minute penalties. There are a few minutes remaining at the London Stadium, where West Ham are playing the champions Manchester City. You won’t believe the score! At its furious peak, the United/Arsenal rivalry brought out the Danny Dyer in almost all of us. I had to be held back at least twice. What are your favourite memories of that rivalry? It doesn’t have to be from that glorious period between 1996 and 2005. It could be before (Whiteside v Rocastle, Winterburn v McClair), or after (the late sting at Highbury in 2007, Cristiano Ronaldo scoring from a different postcode in 2009). Or it could just be 14 April 1999, the greatest game in English football history. Were you on the pitch? Were you the fan whose fag breath is one of David Beckham’s most vivid memories of that night? If you have any good tales or memories, email them in. I promise that, when I brazenly nick them for the book I’m writing on this very subject, I’ll give you a credit. The best fan story of all belongs to Barry Ferst. You might not know his name. But I bet you know his face. Pre-match reading Arsene Wenger has picked a deluxe Carling Cup team, with eight changes from the side that drew with Atletico Madrid on Thursday night: David Ospina, Hector Bellerin and Granit Xhaka are the survivors. Manchester United (4-3-3) De Gea; Valencia, Smalling, Lindelof, Young; Herrera, Matic, Pogba; Lingard, Lukaku, Sanchez. Substitutes: Pereira, Rojo, Mata, Fellaini, McTominay, Martial, Rashford. Arsenal (4-2-3-1) Ospina; Bellerin, Mavropanos, Chambers, Kolasinac; Maitland-Niles, Xhaka; Mkhitaryan, Nelson, Iwobi; Aubameyang. Substitutes: Cech, Osei-Tutu, Holding, Monreal, Willock, Welbeck, Nketiah. Referee Kevin Friend. Hello and welcome to live coverage of Arsene Wenger Day in Manchester, where a sexagenarian Frenchman says an emotional goodbye to two erstwhile nemeses: Old Trafford, the place for which he created a new word, and Jose Mourinho. Nostalgia will be rife before the game starts, with memories turning to those Homeric battles between United and Arsenal from 1996-2005. Since then, United v Arsenal has become a common-or-garden big game. Today could barely even be described as that, as there is nothing much riding on it. The two teams will almost certainly finish in their current positions of second and sixth, and Arsenal have a trip to Madrid on Thursday to consider. It’s a kind of testimonial for the glory years. And by heaven, what years they were. Kick off is at 4.30pm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/29/akala-review-shepherds-bush-empire-london-black-people-hip-hop-poet","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T11:00:37Z","webTitle":"Akala review – humility and harmony from history-making hip-hop poet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/29/akala-review-shepherds-bush-empire-london-black-people-hip-hop-poet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/29/akala-review-shepherds-bush-empire-london-black-people-hip-hop-poet","fields":{"headline":"Akala review – humility and harmony from history-making hip-hop poet","bodyText":"Rapper, musician and cultural commentator Akala is becoming one of the UK’s foremost critical thinkers, having recently spoken on everything from Grenfell and Corbyn to the entire span of human history in his televised epic poem The Ruins of Empires. This all-encompassing scrutiny is clear from the get-go of his sold-out show, with an introductory video in which he criticises western television for its propagation of negative images of black people over the course of history. Backed by his DJ and a live drummer, Akala carries the air of a civil rights orator. His energetic presentation and lyrically dense raps float with poise, are ingested by his cult following and reflected back in the form of constant mobbing. Particular fervour is whipped up as he moves through call-to-arms thriller Sun Tzu, with the help of featured guest Asheber, and the crowd’s growing appreciation for his tongue-twisting prowess crafts a raucous atmosphere. Each of the night’s peaks, from singalong anthems Roll Wid Us and XXL to curtain call Find No Enemy, are constantly topped, and these leaps do not falter as the show continues. It’s as if he finds infinite strength in rejecting gang violence, examining historical injustice towards black people, and exploring the doctrines of black leaders such as Malcolm X and Marcus Garvey. His calm demeanour is a tonic to the lyrical onslaughts, and comforting, given the tough nature of his subject matter. Akala’s mission to educate becomes increasingly obvious, and comic-book style visuals and impromptu on-stage soliloquies inject vividness into his songs about finding one’s path after being led astray. There is a genuine feeling that he is trying to make sense of the world’s injustices as he speaks, which numbs the crowd into a thought-provoking silence. He saves the night’s most powerful sequence for Visions, a detailed account of black history, from pre-civilisation to the present day, that bounces off the exceptional pounding drums that soundtrack the entire evening. He draws a line in the sand between himself and his braggadocio rap contemporaries, with anecdotes relating to discovering his own limitations, and urges the crowd to do the same. His fervent hand-waving is proof that his belief in his own work continues to burn like an Olympic flame. Akala is touring with various talks and shows.

More than 4,000 people have been displaced in the country’s northern-most state of Kachin near the border with China in the last three weeks, the head of UN’s office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs (OCHA), Mark Cutts, said on Friday. “We have received reports from local organisations saying that there are still many civilians who remain trapped in conflict-affected areas,” Cutts said. “Our biggest concern is for the safety of civilians – including pregnant women, the elderly, small children and people with disabilities. We must ensure that these people are protected.” The numbers do not include some 15,000 people who have fled since the beginning of the year, and more than 90,000 living in camps in both Kachin and Shan states since a ceasefire between the government and the powerful Kachin Independence Army rebel group broke down in 2011. OCHA has been unable to verify reports civilians have been killed in the fighting. A Myanmar government spokesman could not be reached for comment. The US embassy in Yangon said on Facebook on Friday it is “deeply concerned about intensified fighting in Kachin state, which has forced thousands of people to flee their homes”. “We urge all parties to cease fighting. We call upon the government, including the military, to protect civilian populations and allow humanitarian assistance to be delivered to those affected by the conflicts,” the post said.. In addition to the Rohingya Muslim crisis in the western part of mainly Buddhist Myanmar, the country’s conflict-hit north has also played host to clashes involving other ethnic minorities, which rarely make headlines. The Kachin, who mostly live in the country’s northern-most state , make up more than 6% of Christians in Myanmar, the second largest religious group after Buddhists, according to census figures. The country’s de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, said making peace was her priority when she took office in 2016 after decades of military rule but progress has been slow.

Kim also said there was no need for the North to maintain a nuclear arsenal if a peace treaty is formalised and relations with the US improve, according to South Korea’s presidential office. “Once we start talking, the United States will know that I am not a person to launch nuclear weapons at South Korea, the Pacific or the United States,” Kim was quoted as saying by Yoon Young-chan, a spokesman for the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in. “If we maintain frequent meetings and build trust with the United States and receive promises for an end to the war and a non-aggression treaty, then why would be need to live in difficulty by keeping our nuclear weapons?” Kim made the comments during meeting with Moon on Friday, where the two leaders signed a declaration calling for a “nuclear-free Korean peninsula”. Kim earlier said the North would halt nuclear and missile tests, but this was the first mention of inviting foreign observers. “Some say that we are terminating facilities that are not functioning, but you will see that we have two more tunnels that are bigger than the existing ones and that they are in good condition,” Yoon quoted Kim as saying. North Korea conducted all six of its nuclear tests at its Punggye-ri facility, buried deep beneath mountains, between 2006 and 2017. There had been speculation last week that the site was damaged beyond repair, a claim Kim seemed to rebuff. Little is known about the North’s military infrastructure so most intelligence is gleaned from satellite photos. “This is a small but welcome step. But, as always, we must take North Korea’s actions with appropriate caution,” said Mintaro Oba, a former US diplomat who focused on North Korea policy. “We can’t rule out that Kim Jong-un wants to be seen as a maverick. He has a clear taste for bold moves that surprise the international community, something that sets him apart from his father.” The US and South Korea still needed to maintain continuous dialogue with Pyongyang, Oba said, and he warned Kim is “a master of defining the public narrative”. A meeting between the leaders of the US and North Korea could take place within “three or four weeks”, Trump said at a rally on Saturday in Michigan. He also warned any discussions “may not work out, I leave”. Kim also pledge to align the North’s timezone with the South during the inter-Korean summit. Pyongyang time is currently 30 minutes ahead of Seoul, a change instituted by Kim in 2015. The change was framed at the time as a break with Japan’s colonial legacy on the peninsula from 1910 to 1945. “I feel sad to see that there are two clocks hung on the wall of the Peace House, one for Seoul time and the other for Pyongyang time,” Kim said during his talks with Moon. “Since it is us who changed the time standard, we will return to the original one.” The unified time zone was meant to ease communication between the South and US, Yoon said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/apr/29/super-netball-giants-v-sunshine-coast-lightning-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T05:14:08Z","webTitle":"Super Netball: Giants find redemption in grand final rematch with Lightning – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/apr/29/super-netball-giants-v-sunshine-coast-lightning-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/apr/29/super-netball-giants-v-sunshine-coast-lightning-live","fields":{"headline":"Super Netball: Giants find redemption in grand final rematch with Lightning – as it happened","bodyText":"Thankyou for reading Thanks for joining me for the grand final rematch between the Giants and Lightning, the match lived up to its hype, with the Giants impressive and the Lightning perhaps missing Laura Langman. It’ll be interesting to see how they rebound next week. Imagine those two sides might find themselves at the pointy end of the ladder come the end of the season. There’s one more match to wrap up the first round of the season – between the NSW Swifts and Queensland Firebirds. I hope we’ll be able to bring you some more netball action very shortly. Enjoy your Sunday! If you’re looking for AFL or NRL results, keep an eye on the website for a wrap-up report. I’ll be back here next week blogging some more live sport! An improved quarter from the Thunderbirds hasn’t saved them from an eight-point loss to the Fever. They lost the final quarter by just the one point (14-15), meaning they lost every quarter as well as the game. Interesting to hear the reaction to the bonus points system after that one. Jhaniele Fowler was the star for the Fever, scoring 66/68 (at an incredible 97%). She almost doubled her nearest rival, with Adelaide’s Nelson finding the net 37 times out of 42. Fowler was almost a one-woman show for West Coast, with Stanton adding three goals and Medhurst five. Medhurst registered 25 feeds for the game in a wonderful team performance from the Fever. However, it looks as if Verity Charles has injured her ankle. Not clear yet how bad that is. Drama as the Lightning get a goal on the buzzer and thus the bonus point. They take two points from the match despite the loss. The Giants’ theme song blares as the teams gather in the centre of the court. Great to see Fitzgerald’s side somewhat redeem the grand final loss from last year. Bec Bulley takes player of the match – reckon Kim Green was unlucky not to take it, while Jo Harten probably also had a claim. Bulley says Fitzgerald is the “greatest coach in the world, and truly a legend of the game”. They’re happy to get the win for her milestone game. Exciting match from both sides and a good indication that we’ll have an exciting season ahead. Q4 00:20 Giants 54 v Lightning 50 Wood again, as the Giants get a warning for time wasting. Lightning desperate for the turnover but they can’t find it and Green is superb as the Giants nearly turn the ball over and she keeps it in with a desperate dive. Pettitt in support and the Giants will win. Lightning fans are upset about New Zealand star Laura Langman’s absence (she quit the game after being a key cog in the Sunshine Coast premiership). Q4 01:40 Giants 53 v Lightning 49 Things getting frantic as the Lightning push to up the pace. Wood finds the net, while the Giants try and slow things up with all players out of the circle. They finally push the button and Harten scores. That might be the game. Q4 03:10 Giants 52 v Lightning 48 Ouch, Wood is sore after her own fall, but she’s back up and keen to get on with things. She finds Bassett and the Lightning take a one point lead for the quarter. This isn’t quite over. Big play from Pretorious with a great tip out, but the Giants take the ball back after it goes out. Harten scores again. Q4 04:30 Giants 51 v Lightning 47 Green asked her coaching staff what the score was for the quarter - so the Giants have their eyes on not only the overall win but the bonus point. McAuliffe with a nice tip out – she’s been the best on court for her side this quarter. Harten gets the goal nonetheless. She’s got 31/33 at 94%. Bassett takes one back, and Mentor makes Wood pay for her hesitation with a rare tip out from her this game. Pretorious with a great turnover and Bassett scores again. Kim Green asks for the court to be cleaned after she takes a tumble, thankfully she’s OK! Q4 06:39 Giants 49 v Lightning 44 Bassett up to 31 goals now – shooting at 86%. Harten takes the goal back with Mentor giving away an obstruction penalty. Now it’s the Giants’ turn for a timeout as their lead is clawed back to five. I’m tipping a Giants win from here – have simply been too good when it mattered most. Mentor having a down game hasn’t helped. Green reminds her side that things aren’t over – and that they need to keep pushing with effort for the win. Q4 07:30 Giants 49 v Lightning 43 Kim Green is a big part of this Giants success story – 42 feeds and 19 goal assists so far. Giants have had 63% possession this quarter – when the number up to this quarter sat at around 51-49. Wood misses but Bassett follows it up. Things looking good for the Giants, although Mikaere finds a turnover in the middle and Wood nails it. Q4 09:50 Giants 47 v Lightning 40 Liz Ellis says she reckons Geva Mentor has a gold medal hangover, failing to come out and really challenge Harten on that occasion. With a six point lead to the Giants, the Sunshine Coast are unravelling, the ball thrown over the sideline. What can they do from here? Harten makes it seven and a panicked Noeline Taurua calls timeout. Q4 11:30 Giants 45 v Lightning 40 Pettitt ensures the Giants pull ahead again with the goal from beside the post. Obstruction from Manu’a lets Wood in again, and we’re going goal for goal. Pettitt takes the penalty for contact, with a caution for Mikaere after just three penalties. Four point lead to the Giants, and Manu’a gets the turnover again! Giants go up by five. Q4 13:50 Giants 42 v Lightning 39 Manu’a with the intercept against Bassett - that’s what we’ve been waiting for! Great that her coach has backed her in despite Bassett dominating that last quarter. Giants, however, are penalised for a carry and Sunshine Coast will come again. First goal of the quarter goes to Bassett. Three-quarter-time Thunderbirds 42 v Fever 59 Nothing doing for the home team at Priceline Stadium in Adelaide. They lose the third quarter 15-20 while Fowler continues to dominate (although she has missed one to blemish her perfect record! She now has 54/55 at 98%). The final quarter is about to begin in what looks like our first eight-point game of the 2018 season. Maddie McAuliffe at centre pulls off an important intercept, and Wood scores as a result. Can they pull back the bonus point? No! Guthrie with the excellent intercept and turnover and the Giants will take the third-quarter bonus point, plus some momentum going into the final quarter. Giants win that quarter 15-13. Q3 01:30 Giants 41 v Lightning 36 We’ve had a sub for the Lightning, Scherian is off for Mikaere who takes her spot in WD. It doesn’t stop the rot, however, with the Giants taking the first goal of the resumed quarter. Harten, however, strikes back immediately for two goals in a row despite some physical checking from Pretorius. Q3 03:06 Giants 39 v Lightning 35 Some great vision of Julie Fitzgerald, incredibly it’s her 300th netball coaching appearance! Check out her impressive profile here. Looks very nervous despite her team’s lead. Smart time-out called by the Lightning as the Giants extend their quarter lead to 12-10. They need to wrest back the momentum they held earlier in the quarter. Q3 05:00 Giants 37 v Lightning 34 Bassett with a rare miss - she’s now at 26/31 thanks to some great pressure by Bulley. Can the Giants capitalise? They’re patient this time, and it’s Harten again – twice. Well done by the Giants to pull back the advantage, and lead the quarter 10-9. Q3 06:30 Giants 35 v Lightning 34 Patient build-up from the Giants this time and a penalty to Pretorius sees them pull ahead again. But it’s Bassett again to pull it back level. Guthrie has upped her game this quarter, and she sets up Pettitt. Q3 07:50 Giants 33 v Lightning 33 Ambitious attempt to find Harten doesn’t pay off for the Giants, and it’s Bassett again. Think the Giants might need another defensive switch to cull her influence. It’s all square at Qudos Bank Arena. Q3 09:10 Giants 33 v Lightning 31 Harten’s radar is back on, but the near-immediate reply comes from Bassett. Great touch from Kim Green hits up Harten again. Green’s showing no signs of having missed game time. Manu’a struggling a little bit with Bassett who has been able to find too much space for the Giants’ liking. Q3 11:10 Giants 30 v Lightning 28 Third quarter begins goal for goal, with the Giants maintaining their slender lead. Ooh, Lightning almost turn it over with Bassett deciding the shot’s out of her range, but they’re lucky to turn it back over with the Giants taking it over the sideline. Rare miss from Harten gifts the Lightning an attempt to pull the margin back, but the Giants force another turnover through the middle. It’s another miss! This time to Pettitt. Great to see some advocates for women’s sport in the crowd Ladies who league plus the wonderful Brittany Carter! Thunderbirds 26 v Fever 38 Things aren’t looking too good for the Thunderbirds, who have lost the second quarter by a similar margin to the first (12-16). They look to have no answer for West Coast’s Fowler, who is now up to 36/36 (and still shooting at 100%!) So dominant is Fowler, they’ve hardly needed Medhurst, who has just two goals (from four attempts). Nelson is doing well for the home side, with 20/22 (91%) but Fever are on track for what might be our first eight-point game (four points for the win, plus four for winning each quarter). Pettitt starting to find some space again, and nails a long-range goal before Harten follows it up with a regulation shot. Bassett with the contact on Manu’a and the Giants have the chance to score on the turnover. Guthrie, however, is sloppy with her footwork and gives away a stepping penalty. Giants have a chance to score just before the buzzer but Pretorious comes out of nowhere with the intercept. Exciting end to the quarter! Lightning take the bonus point, having won that quarter 13-12. That’s a bonus point each so far. Q2 01:39 Giants 25 v Lightning 25 Some messy play from both teams as set plays start to unravel with turnovers down both ends. Bassett goals despite the obstruction to take the Lightning in front again. Giants struggling to find space up forward, but finally draw level through Harten. Q2 03:27 Giants 23 v Lightning 24 Great quarter from the Lightning but Scherian throws the ball out of court, and the Giants have a chance to consolidate. Browne and McAuliffe stand aside, and Pettitt takes the Giants back to one. Mentor and Pretorius starting to get on top. Q2 05:46 Giants 22 v Lightning 23 11cm separates Manu’a and Bassett (who stands at 193cm). Le’ts see what impact that has as the Lightning take the lead for the first time. Feel like the Giants’ turnovers were more of an issue than any defensive shortcomings, but Manu’a does put Bassett off the shot on this occasion. Bassett has already scored more than she did in the first quarter. She’s now at 18/22 (82%). Q2 07:37 Giants 21 v Lightning 21 Uh oh, Giants with a little bit of panic creeping in, Pettitt goes for an ambitious long goal with no reward, and the Lightning pull scores back to level. Now the Giants call timeout. Poolman comes off for Manu’a, who was injured in last year’s pre-season. Let’s hope she can deliver. Here’s some live action from the first quarter: Q2 08:00 Giants 21 v Lightning 20 Lightning time-out emphasises tightening up the defence. On cue, Pretorious and Mentor combine to deny Pettitt. Teams trade turnovers and Pretorious intercepts on the stretch. That’s two in a row denied now as the timeout works wonders. Q2 09:40 Giants 21 v Lightning 17 Pretorious out with the penalty lets the Giants in again. Mentor calls time out for her team, as she senses her opponents getting on top. Guthrie also starting to have an impact, with seven goal assists, just one behind Green’s eight. Q2 10:40 Giants 19 v Lightning 17 Little separating these two now, going goal for goal, and only one extra attempt from the Giants. Bassett and Poolman get physical, with Bassett finally starting to assert her trademark dominance. She’s at 13/16 (81%). Q2 12:30 Giants 16 v Lightning 15 Really liking Kimberlee Green’s game for the Giants. She had the six goal assists, nine centre pass receives and 14 feeds at quarter-time. Scherian gets a nice pass into Bassett, who gets the first goal of the second quarter. She follows up with the second after a nice assist from Browne. Giants maintain a little breathing space with Harten beating Mentor to the pass from Pettitt. Harten has the edge over Mentor to date. Wood pulls one back with a penalty. Quarter-time Thunderbirds 14 v Fever 22 For those wondering, we have a simultaneous contest happening between the Adelaide Thunderbirds and West Coast Fever. As is perhaps not a surprise, the Fever are up comfortably, 22-14 at quarter-time. Jhaniele Fowler has a whopping 20/20 goals at 100%! Oops, Kelsey Browne takes a stumble, looks as if it was some friendly fire, but it’s quite the physical contest. Bassett with 9/12 (75%) but she really hasn’t looked comfortable in front of goal. Pettitt takes the Giants out to a three-point lead to finish off the quarter. Bonus point goes to the Giants. Q1 01:30 Giants 13 v Lightning 11 Intimidation from Mentor puts both defenders out of play and the Giants are able to get some breathing space back. They had a five point lead at one stage in this quarter, and will want to finish with at least the bonus point. Q1 02:30 Giants 11 v Lightning 10 Pettitt and Harten combining very nicely – in agreement with the commentators, think they’re better suited as teammates than opponents! Meanwhile Bassett with a critical miss, but a contact from Poolman lets her finish off the good work of her teammates. McAuliffe providing the running for the Lightning to cut the margin back to one. Q1 05:00 Giants 10 v Lightning 7 Poolman doing an excellent job on Bassett - the Lightning are hesitant to go over her head. Pretorious out of play with the contact to set up Harten, but the tip forces them to come again. Pettitt again in plenty of space as the Giants are first to hit double figures. Q1 06:00 Giants 9 v Lightning 6 Bassett eases the nerves with some steadier hands. Somewhat surprised the Lightning haven’t used the time out available yet, they look as if they could do with a break and slow down the Giants’ momentum. Bassett finds yet another wobbler as the Lightning find some fluency. Q1 08:00 Giants 8 v Lightning 4 Pettitt probably the pick of the shooters so far, even with the one miss. Looks dangerous every time she presents. On the other hand Bassett is being challenged by Sam Poolman, who has denied her more than once now. Harten going at 100% (4/4). Q1 10:00 Giants 5 v Lightning 3 Pettitt looking comfortable in goals, she puts the Giants up 4-1. Obstruction by Bulley lets Wood in, but a biiig pass from Green hits up Pettitt again. Crowd excited by Green and Pettitt’s fast passing. Bassett with another goal, but it wobbles on the rim. Looks nervous. Q1 11:30 Giants 3 v Lightning 1 Giants through Harten, twice, to take an impressive advantage. Ligthning finally on the board through Bassett. Some great pressure from the Lightning defence sees the first mistake by the Giants with McAuliffe pulling off an excellent intercept. Q1 13:30 Giants 1 v Lightning 0 First goal of the game to Susan Pettitt, great start for the Giants. Poolman with the nice tip to deny Bassett. Giants look energised, and Bassett misses her first shot on goal! Starting seven We’re not far off starting here, with players entering the arena now. Sharni Layton returns Another positive for Collingwood yesterday was the return to action of Sharni Layton after the experienced defender took time away from netball last year due to exhaustion. “My heart was warmed when I saw her take that flying intercept... I think the whole crowd lifted off their seat with that one,” Keppich-Birrell said. “She’s a spectacular athlete and it’s just a matter of, week by week, working herself back into being the best Sharni that she can be.” AAP Other rule changes “Several other rule changes were unveiled this week. As in basketball, team officials and bench players will be allowed to walk the sideline to talk to players and the number of time-outs has been doubled; from one per team, per half to two, meaning there could be as many as eight time-outs a match. The breaks between quarters have also been increased by a few minutes.” Bonus points One of the talking points of the season is the new ‘bonus points’ system. Teams are awarded a bonus point for each quarter won, so even though the Vixens won the game yesterday, they lost three of four quarters. That meant they won four points for the win, plus one for the quarter they won – for a total of five. The Lightning, meanwhile, while they lost the game, won three of four quarters, so emerged with three points. As Delahunty has written in her season preview, the game’s bosses say the system will “incentivise teams to make every quarter count” and reward closeness across the competition. One person happy with the changes this round is, predicatbly, Collingwood coach Kristy Keppich-Birrell. “I don’t think I was a massive fan of the new points system when it was first talked about but today I’m pretty happy with it,” she joked. What do you think of the scoring system, do you like it? In case you missed the news from yesterday, the Vixens won a thrilling Melbourne derby by one point against the Magpies. The Magpies led by two with less than four minutes to play after trailing by eight goals in the second quarter, but shooter Mwai Kumwenda scored three of the final four goals for the Vixens to take victory. In keeping with the new scoring system, the Magpies earned three bonus points thanks to winning three of four quarters. “I thought it was a really tough, high-quality game,” Vixens coach Simone McKinnis said after her side’s late comeback victory. “I thought both sides played exceptionally well at different times. I said to the girls at the end, I was just really proud of the way they worked right to the end until they got that opportunity (to win).” AAP Welcome Hello everyone and welcome to this blockbuster grand final rematch from 2017! The Giants will be out for redemption after Sunshine Coast won the inaugural grand final in 2017. They’ve got a very similar squad going into this season (With the addition of Kiera Austin), so there’s no reason they can’t challenge again. Lightning captain Geva Mentor says her side are aware they’ll be targeted this year. “Everyone will be after our scalp as reigning premiers but there are other teams that are a threat like Vixens and West Coast Fever with Jhaniele Fowler that will make it a really tough competition,” she said. The Lightning are without one star: Sarahpheinna Woulf will miss a decent chunk of time, after injuring her ACL in the pre-season. Kate will be here shortly. In the meantime have a read of Erin Delahunty’s preview of this season of Super Netball."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/apr/30/republicans-have-so-corrupted-epa-americans-can-only-save-it-in-the-voting-booth","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T10:00:09Z","webTitle":"Republicans have so corrupted EPA, Americans can only save it in the voting booth | Dana Nuccitelli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/apr/30/republicans-have-so-corrupted-epa-americans-can-only-save-it-in-the-voting-booth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/apr/30/republicans-have-so-corrupted-epa-americans-can-only-save-it-in-the-voting-booth","fields":{"headline":"Republicans have so corrupted EPA, Americans can only save it in the voting booth","bodyText":"Like Donald Trump and the rest of his administration, Scott Pruitt has been caught up in so many scandals that it becomes impossible to focus on any single act of corruption. It’s difficult to focus on the damage Pruitt is doing to the environment and public health when seemingly every day there’s a new scandal related to his illegal $43,000 phone booth, or use of Safe Water Drinking Act funds to give two staffers a total of $85,000 in raises (and lying about it), or his sweetheart deal on a condo rental from a lobbyist’s wife (and lying about having met with that lobbyist), or wasting taxpayer funds on first class air travel and military jets, and a nearly $3m per year security detail, and bulletproof car seat covers, and a bulletproof desk, and so on. But while Pruitt’s unprecedented corruption is staggering and would have resulted in his firing long ago in any other presidential administration, the damage Pruitt is doing to public and environmental health is a far greater scandal yet. As George W. Bush’s former EPA administrator Christine Todd Whitman wrote in the scathing explanation for why TIME included Pruitt as one of its 100 most influential people this year, If his actions continue in the same direction, during Pruitt’s term at the EPA the environment will be threatened instead of protected, and human health endangered instead of preserved, all with no long-term benefit to the economy. Scott Pruitt is terrible at his job Lately it’s been difficult to remember that EPA’s mission is supposed to be “to protect human health and the environment.” As Christine Todd Whitman alluded, Scott Pruitt has done everything in his power to instead endanger public and environmental health. He’s loosened a litany of regulations to allow more air and water and carbon pollution. Last week, Pruitt implemented a new policy that makes it much more difficult for EPA to use science to create regulations that would protect public health. It’s a policy straight out of the tobacco playbook. In fact, junk science blogger Steve Milloy, who first advocated for this policy change while working for the tobacco industry before shifting to the fossil fuel industry’s payroll, called Pruitt’s announcement “one of my proudest achievements.” As Milloy told the New Yorker, I do have a bias. I’m all for the coal industry, the fossil fuel industry. Wealth is what makes people happy, not pristine air, which you’ll never get. Wealth over health – it’s a perfect summary of today’s GOP platform. Quite simply, considering scientific evidence in crafting regulations does not favor the tobacco or fossil fuel industries, and so they have long sought to curtail its use. In Pruitt, polluters have finally found an ally who’s willing to stifle science in order to maximize their profits. And the day after he testified that EPA was “not at present” planning to revoke California’s ability to set its own vehicle emissions standards, EPA announced a plan to do exactly that. That will trigger a legal battle between EPA and California that won’t make automakers happy, but doubtless will please the fossil fuel industry. Fortunately, legal experts think Pruitt’s plan is “legally indefensible.” That would be par for the course for Pruitt, who’s been so eager to roll back environmental protections that his plans often don’t hold up in court. Republicans in Congress don’t care Few Republicans in power have called for Pruitt to resign. That’s because, as Oliver Milman wrote for the Guardian, despite Pruitt’s unprecedented level of corruption, they support his “deregulation agenda.” At last week’s congressional hearing, Rep. David McKinley (R-WV) summed up the GOP stance perfectly: People in the fossil fuel industry could see the deterioration. There is some hope we are seeing the economy start to rebound, thanks to you and the administration taking this fight on. That’s a clear admission that under Pruitt, the EPA now values polluters’ profits over American lives, and congressional Republicans approve. They’re willing to prop up the fossil fuel industry by sacrificing public and environmental health for the sake of polluters’ short-term profits. Trump reportedly refuses to fire Pruitt because the right-wing base supports him, although nobody else does – Pruitt’s dismal 29% approval rating is even lower than Trump’s. However, were Pruitt fired, he would be replaced by former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler, who every Senate Republican voted to confirm as his deputy earlier this month. Before becoming a coal lobbyist, Wheeler worked for the Senate’s leading climate denier James Inhofe (R-OK) for 14 years. He’s from the same mould as Scott Pruitt, whose main qualification for leading the EPA was his history of suing the agency 14 times, and for whom every Senate Republican save Susan Collins (R-ME) voted to confirm. Want to be healthy? Don’t vote Republican In short, while firing Pruitt would address one of the Trump administration’s many ethical disasters, it would not address the more important scandal of putting an individual who opposes environmental protection in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency. As Robert Redford put it, Pruitt should be replaced by a principled leader who will do what the EPA was intended to do: protect America from men such as Pruitt. But that’s not going to happen as long as Republicans are in charge, because GOP leaders value polluter profits over public and environmental health, as they proved by nominating and confirming both Pruitt and Wheeler. For Americans who disagree with those priorities, the only recourse is to make their preferences known in the 2018 and 2020 elections."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/29/the-sun-does-shine-review-anthony-ray-hinton","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T05:00:39Z","webTitle":"The Sun Does Shine review: death row memoir spotlights a judicial 'lynching'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/29/the-sun-does-shine-review-anthony-ray-hinton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/29/the-sun-does-shine-review-anthony-ray-hinton","fields":{"headline":"The Sun Does Shine review: death row memoir spotlights a judicial 'lynching'","bodyText":"If you think there is no reason for another book about a grave miscarriage of American justice, think again. Anthony Ray Hinton’s memoir of his wrongful imprisonment for 30 years for three murders he did not commit is a riveting account of the multiple outrages of the criminal justice system of Alabama. But that isn’t what makes this a genuine spiritual experience: that comes from the nearly biblical capacity of the author to endure, to forgive, and finally to triumph. It only takes the first two pages of the introduction by the author’s equally remarkable lawyer, Bryan Stevenson, to make the reader appalled. There was no evidence at all to tie Hinton to two of the three murders he was accused of, and he was “locked in a supermarket warehouse cleaning floors … when a restaurant manager 15 miles away was abducted, robbed and shot”. That victim survived and then misidentified Hinton as his assailant; then the state completed this travesty by providing completely fake ballistic evidence to tie a gun found in Hinton’s mother’s home to all three murders. “My only crime was being born black in Alabama,” Hinton writes, his prosecution “nothing less than a lynching” in which the white robes of the Ku Klux Klan were replaced by the black robes of justice. One of his arresting officers explained his fate this way, after the prisoner told him he could prove he had been working at the time of one of the murders: “You know, I don’t even care whether you did or didn’t do it … In fact, I believe you didn’t do it. But it doesn’t matter. If you didn’t do it, one of your brothers did. And you’re going to take the rap. You want to know why?” The cop gave Hinton “five reasons”. “Number one, you’re black. Number two, a white man gonna say you shot him. Number three, you’re gonna have a white district attorney. Number four, you’re gonna have a white judge. And number five, you’re gonna have an all-white jury.” The cop was right. Hinton was assigned an incompetent lawyer who was paid $1,000 by the state and then proceeded to hire an incompetent ballistics expert who guaranteed his conviction on fake evidence. “In Alabama,” he writes, “judges are elected based on how many people they send to death row, not on how many people they let off.” Hinton’s lawyer provides this ghastly statistic: “With 34 executions and seven exonerations in Alabama since 1975, one innocent person has been identified on Alabama’s death row for every five executions.” With the help of his co-author Lara Love Hardin, Hinton conveys all the horror of his years in solitary confinement, barely able to breath in 120F (49C) summer heat, eating food that tasted like dust. But something deep inside his character made it possible for him to make friends of everyone near him, from the white man next to him on death row who had lynched a black teenager to almost every single prison guard who met him. His lawyer writes: “Never have more guards, correctional staff and prison workers pulled me aside to offer assistance … during the many years I have worked with Ray. I have never experienced anything like it.” When Hinton convinces the prison warden about halfway through his three decades of imprisonment to allow him to receive books – besides the Bible – so that he can form a book club, the reader shares the exhilaration of Hinton and half a dozen of his fellow prisoners as they are finally able to travel outside the walls of the prison, through the words of James Baldwin and Harper Lee. But the book club is short-lived, after the prisoners who are left out of it convince the warden it is unfair to allow only some of them to become readers. The books are still passed around from cell to cell, but the meetings in the prison library are over. After every level of the Alabama court system had rejected Hinton’s appeals multiple times, his lawyer decided to take his case directly to the US supreme court. In 2015, Hinton’s 30 years of unbroken prayers were answered and the nation’s highest court ruled unanimously in his favor. Fourteen months later, the district attorney in Alabama finally abandoned the case, and Hinton went free. Since then, Hinton has been able to forgive everyone responsible for his imprisonment, “because that’s how my mother raised me” and “because I have a God who forgives”. He has become an inspirational speaker, traveling the country and the world. He has one message for everyone who will listen: “Our system is broken, and it’s time to put a stop to the death penalty. As my good friend Bryan Stevenson says, the moral arc of the universe bends toward justice – but justice needs help.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/30/weatherwatch-arid-american-west-expands-eastwards","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T20:30:21Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: arid American west expands eastwards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/30/weatherwatch-arid-american-west-expands-eastwards","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/30/weatherwatch-arid-american-west-expands-eastwards","fields":{"headline":"Weatherwatch: arid American west expands eastwards","bodyText":"Los Angeles should not exist. The explorer John Wesley Powell warned the US Congress 140 years ago that the American west was a harsh arid land and settlements should be limited to conserve scarce water supplies. The politicians rejected his advice and launched a massive programme of dam and canal construction for irrigation and settlements. In a gruelling expedition across North America, Powell had seen a dramatic transition from the lush green prairies in the east to the dry lands of the west, and the frontier of this transition was the 100th meridian, an invisible line of longitude passing north-south through North America. Powell’s evaluation has proved unerringly accurate, except for one worrying aspect. The warming climate has expanded the arid lands of the west and forced the frontier to shift 140 miles (225km) eastwards from the 100th meridian since the 1980s, according to two studies in the journal Earth Interactions. As soils have turned drier, it has become more difficult to grow thirsty crops such as maize and added to the huge problems of supplying water for irrigation on western farms. As for Los Angeles and many other western cities, water supplies are becoming more precarious. Powell’s advice rings more true today than ever before. • A panel of Weatherwatch contributors will be taking part in Freak Weather in History, at the British Library on Wednesday 2 May, at 7pm"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/29/newport-south-wales-four-pedestrians-hit-by-car","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T13:55:40Z","webTitle":"Man, 18, arrested after four taken to hospital in Newport hit-and-run","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/29/newport-south-wales-four-pedestrians-hit-by-car","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/29/newport-south-wales-four-pedestrians-hit-by-car","fields":{"headline":"Man, 18, arrested after four taken to hospital in Newport hit-and-run","bodyText":"Four pedestrians have been taken to hospital, two with potentially life-changing injuries, after being struck by a vehicle in Newport, south Wales. Police said the incident was not believed to be terrorism-related. Three women and a man were injured during the incident outside the Courtyard nightclub, which involved a blue Ford C-Max, at 5.30am on Sunday, police said. Footage circulated on social media appears to show people screaming as a car drives into a crowd. In a clip, the car reverses and drives forward twice as people attempt to stop it by hitting the windscreen and driver’s window. Iftekhar Haris, manager of the Courtyard, told WalesOnline that the car appeared to be trying to get through the busy road when it allegedly hit a person, and the crowd “turned into almost like a mob” and were “attacking the vehicle because the vehicle had actually hit someone”. He added: “Then the unbelievable happened, where the driver actually went across on to the pavement and hit two girls, two innocent girls, who were just sat there at the end of the night.” He claimed the vehicle reversed, and hit a person a second time. “It was horrific. It’s something that you don’t want to see on any street.” An 18-year-old man was later arrested on suspicion of causing injury by dangerous driving. The car was found burnt out about two miles away. A spokeswoman for Gwent police said: “Following the incident this morning on Cambrian Road in Newport involving a car and four pedestrians, an 18-year-old man from the Newport area has been arrested on suspicion of causing injury by dangerous driving. Investigations are ongoing.” Earlier, Supt Glyn Fernquest said: “This is a shocking incident for everyone involved.

A review chaired by businessman David Gonski found Australia needs to overhaul its “industrial model” of school education, declaring it no longer helps students maximise their learning growth. The new report, titled Through Growth to Achievement, makes 23 recommendations around assessment and reporting regimes for federal, state and territory governments. Its chief insight is that Australia needs to shift away from a year-based curriculum to a curriculum expressed as “learning progressions”, independent of year or age. It says Australia’s industrial model of school education, which reflects a 20th century aspiration to deliver mass education to all children, is detrimental to individual student outcomes because it focuses on trying to ensure that millions of students attain specified learning outcomes for their grade and age before moving them in lock-step to the next year of schooling. • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “It is not designed to differentiate learning or stretch all students to ensure they achieve maximum learning growth every year, nor does it incentivise schools to innovate and continuously improve,” the report says. “Australia needs to review and change its model for school education,” it says. The report was commissioned by Simon Birmingham, the federal education minister, after the Turnbull government’s “Gonski 2.0” school funding plan was passed by parliament last year. Birmingham will meet state education ministers on Friday to discuss the report. Gonski will brief ministers. On Monday the New South Wales education minister, Rob Stokes, said he welcomed the report’s finding that the current Naplan regime in particular is “limited by its focus on achievement rather than growth”. “The report observes that the best school systems are moving from standardised testing to a mix of more sophisticated evaluation measures,” Stokes said. “We are shifting from an industrial model of school education that was fit for purpose last century to new, personalised teaching practices to ensure students are equipped to be productive and engaged 21st century citizens.” Birmingham told Guardian Australia he thought the report laid out a “comprehensive blueprint for change in the way we look at teaching and school operations”. The report’s recommendations lean on education researcher John Hattie’s calls for a “year’s growth for a year’s input” in learning. Rather than focusing on assessment measures that focus on high achievement, Hattie says children should receive a year’s learning no matter what developmental level they are at. The idea has implications for Australia’s model of school assessment because it places less emphasis on the idea that students should be achieving a certain year-level average. The Gonski report says teachers and educators have long recognised problems with the Australia’s industrial education model, but schools’ attempts to address the issue have been hampered by curriculum delivery, assessment, work practices and the structural environments in which they operate. “This is compounded by a lack of research-based evidence on what works best in education, the absence of classroom applications readily available for use by teachers, multiple calls on the time of teachers and school leaders, and a lack of support for school principals to develop their professional autonomy and prioritise instructional leadership,” the report says. It recommends introducing new reporting arrangements with a focus on learning attainment and learning gain, to provide meaningful information to students and their parents and carers about individual learning growth. It recommends the structure of the Australian curriculum be revised progressively over the next five years to build a roadmap that sets out the steps required in learning for each subject. It also recommends establishing an independent institution – such as a national evidence institute – to improve the evidence base for educational methods to spread the best teaching practices and programs between schools, states and systems. The Productivity Commission identified the need for a national education evidence base in a 2017 report that concluded it would “turn best practice into common practice”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/29/protesters-in-australia-and-israel-call-for-end-to-live-exports","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T05:26:27Z","webTitle":"Protesters in Israel call for end to Australian live exports","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/29/protesters-in-australia-and-israel-call-for-end-to-live-exports","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/29/protesters-in-australia-and-israel-call-for-end-to-live-exports","fields":{"headline":"Protesters in Israel call for end to Australian live exports","bodyText":"Animal rights activists have marched in Israel against live exports, seeking to maintain pressure on both governments to end the “cruel industry”. Protesters gathered in Tel Aviv to call for an end of live animal imports from Australia. Animals Australia said about 3,000 people attended the rally. Video posted to the Israel Against Live Shipments’ Facebook page shows protesters marching in the streets. A demonstration was also held in Melbourne, where activists gathered on the steps of the state library on Saturday night. The protest was not specifically aimed at live exports, but rather sought to shine a light on industrialised animal abuse in general. • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The protests follow whistleblower footage captured from the Awassi, a live export ship travelling from Fremantle to the Middle East. The footage showed the horrible conditions of filth and extreme heat in which 2,400 sheep died. Another rally is scheduled to take place in Fremantle on Sunday afternoon. The Fremantle protest will coincide with the loading of sheep on to another vessel chartered by the same Perth-based livestock export company exposed by the whistleblower earlier this month. “Don’t let this ship slip away unnoticed,” Animals Australia urged its supporters in a Facebook post. “We MUST keep the spotlight on this exporter and on this cruel industry for as long as it takes.” The public protests continue pressure on governments across the world to act on live exports. Israel imported 118,377 Australian sheep in 2016. Sara Netanyahu, wife of the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said she was “appalled” by conditions on board live export ships and would speak to Lucy Turnbull about it. “It really breaks my heart,” she said. “I turned to the PM, my husband, who will do all he can to stop this tremendous cruelty. I also addressed the minister of agriculture, Uri Ariel, and I have no doubt he will do all he can.” Last week, Ariel said on Facebook he had expressed concerns to his Australian counterpart David Littleproud. “I explained that there was an intention to significantly reduce the transport of livestock from Australia to Israel,” Ariel wrote. “I cannot interfere with a delivery while outside the territorial waters of Israel, but there will be an Israel intervention on animal welfare as soon as it reaches the territorial waters of the state of Israel.” In Australia, Labor has promised to suspend the trade, while the Greens want a more urgent ban and transition to local processing. The Australian government’s review of the regulation of the industry, being conducted by the former integrity commissioner, Philip Moss, is due to be handed down within weeks. Littleproud also pledged to create a whistleblower hotline. Earlier this month, the Guardian revealed that Australian regulators had habitually failed to penalise live exporters despite multiple mass animal deaths and reported breaches of welfare standards. No punishments were meted out by federal authorities despite 70 mortality investigation reports showing a number of cases where conditions were contrary to live export standards. Animal welfare groups say the agriculture department is conflicted due to the competing roles of promoting Australian business and regulating the industry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/29/caster-semenya-the-obvious-target-in-iaaf-changes-that-only-create-a-legal-minefield","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T22:38:49Z","webTitle":"Caster Semenya the obvious target in IAAF changes that only create a legal minefield | Hannah Mouncey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/29/caster-semenya-the-obvious-target-in-iaaf-changes-that-only-create-a-legal-minefield","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/29/caster-semenya-the-obvious-target-in-iaaf-changes-that-only-create-a-legal-minefield","fields":{"headline":"Caster Semenya the obvious target in IAAF changes that only create a legal minefield","bodyText":"It was with little shock this week that the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), led by Lord Sebastien Coe, attempted to once again curtail the career of a once in a generation athlete. Caster Semenya has done nothing wrong, unlike many of her contemporaries both male and female she has never failed a drug test and has never even had the spectre of such allegations hanging over her head. Instead of attempting to rid the sport of drug cheats, with many current competitors having served multiple suspensions, the IAAF has instead decided to go after an athlete who has simply committed the crime of being different. Semenya has hyperandrogenism, a condition where the body produces more testosterone than would be usual. The IAAF argues that her elevated testosterone levels provide her an unfair advantage over other female athletes, however this argument when looked at in the wider picture of elite sport is ridiculous. Should we now do away with 7-foot basketball players as well? Make no mistake, the IAAF’s new policy, stating that a woman must have a testosterone level of 5.0 nanomols per litre of blood will almost certainly be ruled illegal the minute it is put before any form of human rights commission; although with the IAAF based in Monaco it’s hard to know what the process for that to happen is. It’s fair to say though that if Athletics Australia tried to enforce such a rule to domestic competition it would be highly illegal once challenged federally. Complicating matters further would be different state laws, in the ACT it is illegal to exclude trans or intersex athletes based on such grounds, while in Victoria the current laws would likely provide enough wriggle room to be enforced. To her credit Semenya has taken it on the chin and has flagged a shift to the longer 5000m and 10,000m events to continue her career. She refuses to suppress her testosterone, and so she should. This is an attack on her and her alone from those who simply don’t like that she doesn’t fit into their neat box of what a woman is. The fact that these new limitations only apply to the events she has dominated for so long means that the IAAF’s attack on her isn’t even subtle, such is the arrogance with which the organisation operates. Despite not competing in athletics, as a trans athlete these new rules wouldn’t actually affect me in the slightest if I was - this is something which largely effects intersex athletes alone. My personal testosterone levels are far below the IAAF’s new requirements, as are most trans athletes. However what the IAAF has done is back itself into a corner in any future debates when it comes to transgender athletes - a topic they are yet to adequately face - while exposing the absurd hypocrisy society as a whole has demonstrated when dealing with those who are transgender. The IAAF has clearly decided that a drop in testosterone significantly effects performance, and so it only stands to reason that when a trans athlete whose testosterone is suppressed finally reaches the top level of the sport they will allow them to compete without question. Or so you would think, however I very much doubt it would be the case. For while society seems to understand the effects of what would happen if you reduced an intersex athlete like Semenya’s testosterone by only a fraction, people still seem to think a trans athlete who produces no testosterone would somehow maintain their previous abilities. But paradoxes like that aside, this exposes the prejudice which still exists in what has typically been a very exclusive and elite sport in the way it is run. I can’t for a second imagine the IAAF taking such action against a male runner with naturally occurring elevated testosterone. Nor can I imagine them doing it to a white runner for that matter. Even if on an unconscious level, racism and more so in this instance, sexism, is clearly very much still a factor in how certain athletes are treated. If the specific targeting of Semenya couldn’t be clearer, the fact that the IAAF ignored research that showed other events were more likely to benefit from elevated testosterone than the 400, 800 and 1500m can only seal the deal. Hammer throw was one such event, however the IAAF chose to not impose any restrictions on those athletes for reasons only known to them. Semenya has known this has been coming for a while though, and I’m sure her legal team would be well prepared. I remember being told a year ago now the IAAF was going to introduce this change, and it’s hard to imagine this information wouldn’t have reached her then either. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is the real unknown in this, and it will be over to them to show some sort of leadership where it is clearly lacking in athletics."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/28/local-election-battles-where-brexit-could-hurt-the-tories","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T19:30:22Z","webTitle":"Local election battles – where Brexit could hurt the Tories ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/28/local-election-battles-where-brexit-could-hurt-the-tories","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/28/local-election-battles-where-brexit-could-hurt-the-tories","fields":{"headline":"Local election battles – where Brexit could hurt the Tories ","bodyText":"Will Labour punish the Conservatives on Thursday? These local elections will be the first electoral test for the main parties since last June’s general election. Midterm local elections tend to be painful for governments, with the opposition gaining ground. But although Theresa May and the Tories are divided over Brexit and in turmoil over the Windrush migration crisis, Jeremy Corbyn and Labour have a big challenge if they are to make huge strides this week. This is because they are already dominant in many of the places up for election this year, which limits the scope for further gains. Labour already has crushing majorities in many of the English cities where the elections are taking place; it already controls 27 of the 34 metropolitan boroughs holding elections, as well as 21 of the 32 London boroughs. Which are the key battles to watch? There are several big symbolic victories within Labour’s grasp. The party could take control of Trafford, a traditional pillar of Conservative strength in the north-west, for the first time since 2003. In London, victories for Labour in traditional Tory strongholds such as Wandsworth and Westminster would be cause for celebration, but may be a stretch even given the Conservatives’ current troubles. Takeovers in Swindon and Plymouth would help Labour demonstrate strength in critical English swing areas. Won’t a collapse of Ukip’s vote rescue the Tories? Outside the big cities, the collapse of Ukip will provide a rich harvest of seats for both main parties. Ukip is likely to lose nearly all of the 163 seats it gained when it surged in 2014, and the pattern of its fall will be instructive. If Theresa May retains the faith of the Brexiters, then the Conservatives should gain the bulk of Ukip’s seats. Labour will be hoping that its obfuscation on Brexit and strong anti-austerity message will renew its appeal in areas where Ukip surged, particularly northern towns with a lingering distrust of the Conservatives. What about the Lib Dems? The Liberal Democrats’ presence in local government was all but wiped out during the coalition government. The party will be hoping that a clear anti-Brexit appeal will help it begin the process of recovery. Its best prospects lie in the London boroughs of Richmond and Kingston upon Thames – retaking these while successfully defending Sutton council would be a big boost. What wider message will the election send about the electorate’s mood? While headlines will be driven by seats gained and lost and councils changing hands, we will learn a lot from shifts below the surface. Swings in the most diverse wards will give us a hint as to whether the Windrush scandal has cost the Conservatives support in ethnic minority communities, while an under-performance by Labour in Barnet, home to one of Britain’s largest Jewish communities, could point to fallout from the party’s high-profile rows over antisemitism. What about Brexit, will it play a part? Keep an eye on the local authorities in outer London and the south east where large numbers of Tory Remain voters congregate. The Conservatives are so dominant in much of this area that seat changes will be limited, but an erosion of Tory support in places such as Tunbridge Wells, Elmbridge, and South Cambridgeshire will suggest that the party’s embrace of Brexit is hitting its appeal in its heartlands. Will the politics change much after Thursday? There may be a few headline-grabbing results but the broader story will most likely be entrenchment of the status quo. Labour will extend its dominance in England’s big cities and among migrant and minority communities. The Conservatives will lose some ground, as governments usually do, but will continue to reign over most of middle-class suburbia. The collapse of Ukip will reinforce the resurgence of two-party politics, which the Lib Dem recovery will be too feeble to challenge. There is unlikely to be anything to threaten the party leaders. Instead, the results will confirm the country is deeply divided by age, geography, ethnicity and views of the EU, and there is no sign of a breakthrough to resolve these divisions.

Aras Amiri, a 32-year-old Iranian national, was visiting her home country to see her ailing grandmother before the Persian new year, in March, when she was detained, said her cousin, Mohsen Omrani. Amiri’s detention is the latest in a string of recent arrests involving British dual nationals or Iranians linked with British institutions. Last week it emerged that Abbas Edalat, a professor at Imperial College London, had been arrested in April by the hardline Revolutionary Guards. The Foreign Office said it was also “urgently seeking information from the Iranian authorities” after being asked about the arrest of Mahan Abedin, an Iranian-British dual national and UK-based analyst and writer. Mahan Abedin’s publisher, Michael Dwyer from Hurst Publishers, said they were worried that he might have run into trouble during a recent visit to Tehran. “While we heard from Mahan by email on Monday, we have no way of verifying that his messages are genuine, and his long radio silence till then had puzzled us, given the recent arrest of other British citizens of Iranian descent,” he said.The new cases are a worrying development for Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British woman who is serving a five-year jail sentence in Tehran on alleged spying charges and whose family insists she is being punished as a tool of diplomatic pressure. Speaking on Wednesday, Omrani confirmed his cousin’s arrest in Iran. In a public post on Facebook he wrote: “Aras has been jailed by forces belonging to Iran’s ministry of intelligence. They arrested her before the Eid [Persian new year] and it’s now nearly 50 days that she is being kept in [Tehran] Evin prison’s ward 209.” Omrani said Amiri had been accused of colluding and acting against the national security, a vague charge used by Iran’s intelligence apparatus against a wide range of activists, journalists and other Iranians arrested for political reasons. Her lawyer has not yet had any access to her, according to her cousin. Before her arrest Amiri had been living in London for 10 years. She has a residence permit and is studying for a postgraduate degree in philosophy of art at Kingston University. “Simultaneously she has been working for the British Council,” wrote Omrani. “She has worked on film festivals and cultural exchanges between UK and Iran, and more importantly some of her activities have been in cooperation with the artistic department of [Iran’s] cultural ministry.” Omrani said Amiri had visited Iran frequently in the past without any issues. “She never had any problems before,” he said. “She went to Iran this time for a brief visit to see her grandmother who is in hospital in [the city] of Amol.” The British Council said Amiri had not been on a work assignment during her visit to Iran. A spokesperson said the Council was aware that “one of our staff has been detained in Iran while making a private family visit, the colleague is an Iranian national”. The spokesperson added: “The British Council does not have offices or representatives in Iran. We work remotely to develop long-term people-to-people cultural links with Iran as we do in over 100 other countries.” Iran has a history of hostility towards the British Council, which is a UK charity governed by royal charter and a UK public body, but receives a 15% core funding grant from the UK government. In 2009, Iran closed the British Council offices in Tehran in reaction to the launch, in London, of BBC’s Persian service, which is loathed by the Iranian establishment. In June 2009, following unrest in the aftermath of a disputed presidential election, Iran arrested several local staff working for the British embassy in Tehran. The new arrests, which signal that Iran is intensifying a crackdown on British dual nationals or those linked with British institutions, deals a blow to the UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, who visited Tehran last year to lobby the Iranian government over Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s continued imprisonment. Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s case has become intertwined with Johnson’s political career since he made an erroneous statement last year which appeared to complicate her legal battle. Johnson has since apologised for mistakenly saying that she had been training journalists in Iran, while in fact she was on holiday. Richard Ratcliffe, Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s husband, said his heart went out to all those newly arrested in Iran. “It is a cruel business, and a disorienting one. For Nazanin, we had hoped that the foreign secretary’s trip to Tehran in December and follow-up measures would have improved relations between the UK and Iran, and helped make things better for Nazanin and the others held,” he said on Wednesday. “Instead they seemed to stall in the spring, even get worse. It is an uncertain time between Iran and the West at present. The foreign secretary does not have an easy job.” An FCO spokeswoman said: “We will continue to approach each case in a way that we judge is most likely to secure the outcome we all want. Therefore we will not be providing a running commentary on every twist and turn.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/03/women-only-charities-lose-out-in-funding-from-tampon-tax","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T10:15:23Z","webTitle":"Women-only charities lose out in funding from tampon tax","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/03/women-only-charities-lose-out-in-funding-from-tampon-tax","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/03/women-only-charities-lose-out-in-funding-from-tampon-tax","fields":{"headline":"Women-only charities lose out in funding from tampon tax","bodyText":"Only two in 10 charities awarded funding from the government’s controversial tampon tax are specialist women’s organisations, despite a pledge to dedicate £15m a year raised from the levy to “women’s health and support charities”. Rape Crisis and Women’s Aid were the only two organisations specifically serving women funded from the annual tampon tax disbursement, receiving just less than £3m between them. Other groups funded included UK Community Foundations, the mental health charity Mind, Brook Young People and two housing associations. The situation was repeated in the distribution last month of £600,000 to celebrate the centenary year of women’s suffrage, when two of the eight organisations funded focussed solely on women’s needs. Vivienne Hayes, the chief executive of the Women’s Resource Centre, a national umbrella group for the women’s sector, said the government had political reasons for overlooking women’s charities. “They know we are the ones that will critique them and hold them to account,” she said. “The general charities don’t always have that strong analysis of structural inequalities, so I think it’s not surprising that the women’s sector has been sidelined and the mainstream organisations that say ‘we work with women’ have been given the money.” The government promised to use the money raised by the 5% VAT on tampons and sanitary towels to fund the women’s sector after activists led a campaign against the levy in 2015. In response to demands for its abolition, George Osborne, then the chancellor, pleaded impotence against EU regulations. He pledged the government would try to change the rules, and said: “Until that happens, I’m going to use the £15m a year raised from the tampon tax to fund women’s health and support charities.” Hayes said the women’s sector was starved of resources, on its knees and suffering a “slow drip of a death”. Generalist charities offering services that target at women could not replace specialised providers with well-trained and experienced staff. “We are the experts. Even when the going gets tough, we’re still in there doing what we’re doing,” she said. UK Community Foundations received £3.4m to fund its Tribewoman project, to help women with “building skills and confidence, improving health and wellbeing, and building social networks”. Mind received £1.8m to provide mental health peer support for women, and Brook Young People received £1.5m to address period poverty. Tracey Crouch, the minister for sport and civil society, said: “The money generated from sanitary products is being invested in good causes that tackle the serious issues that women of all ages face. It will be used to support vulnerable women and girls and help build a Britain fit for the future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/may/02/sheis-womens-sports-gender-equity","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T12:12:07Z","webTitle":"Women's sports can't afford to bench men in the gender-equity fight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/may/02/sheis-womens-sports-gender-equity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/may/02/sheis-womens-sports-gender-equity","fields":{"headline":"Women's sports can't afford to bench men in the gender-equity fight","bodyText":"When I saw Tuesday’s official launch of the SheIs initiative – a group of eight professional women’s sports leagues coming together to increase resources, viewership and attendance – I thought to myself: That’s sweet. But it didn’t move me. It’s not because I’m in disagreement with the movement. I’m all for women supporting other women. It’s needed and in step with the trend. I mean, girl power is everywhere, and we’ve somehow ended up with the terms “Shero” (get it? It’s hero, but with a she!) and She-EO (like CEO, but again with a she!) Now, in a less punny attempt to help advance gender equity in sports, women’s leagues are taking it upon themselves to attempt to bridge the gap. As a sports writer who often focuses on pay disparity, I welcome solutions that will help women find equal footing. However, I don’t believe this initiative will make much a difference. Why? Because women’s sports won’t grow without the men’s leagues supporting them and, secondly, the lack of exposure that women have had to sports is going to be tough to make up for to gain traction with an older female audience. The eight organizations involved in the SheIs initiative include the WNBA, US Tennis Association, National Pro Fastpitch, Canadian Women’s Hockey, the Women’s Professional Lacrosse League, Canada Basketball, the National Women’s Hockey League and the Ontario Women’s Hockey Association. “This collective sports voice has never been heard,” says Canadian Women’s Hockey League commissioner Brenda Andress, who first spearheaded the initiative. “I wanted to create some type of program or challenge to bring women together that was born out of positivity. So I thought of SheIs. When I thought of myself, she is a grandmother with young kids. She is a commissioner. She is a hockey player. She is anything she wants to be. That’s where SheIs came from.” These are great sentiments. And the goal to attract more women to female sports events is one I broadly support. But no matter how much kumbaya takes place among these leagues, it simply won’t drum up enough interest among women who are working full-time and who already have other hobbies and interests to suddenly start caring about women’s sports. Consider espnW, the worldwide leader’s women’s sports portal. (Full disclosure: I am a contributing writer there.) Only 28% of espnW’s audience is female according to a 2017 comScore report. While it was created with the intention of serving a female readership, it continues to struggles to connect with them. Why? Because they’re targeting the wrong audience. Trying to reach women who don’t play sports and who weren’t given equal opportunity to play sports growing up is a misguided strategy. Title IX, which was passed in 1972, mandated that girls would be given equal access to sports in federally funded schools in the US. Before Title IX, one in 27 girls played sports. Now, two of five girls play sports. That means close to 20 million girls in the United States under the age of 18 are active athletes. That is your market: not the women who didn’t play sports growing up. Get those 20m girls to women’s sports events and you’ll have an audience who will become lifelong fans, because loyalty to a sports team is about engendering a connection early on. Secondly, we need men’s sports leagues to support women’s sports. Can you imagine if the NBA devoted the same amount of money into marketing the WNBA as it does the NBA? When NBA commissioner Adam Silver said part of the WNBA’s problem is that not enough young women support the league, Washington Mystics star Elena Delle Donne fired back a perfect response: “We absolutely do not get promoted as our counterparts do. When you put millions of dollars into marketing athletes and allow fans to get to know players on the court they develop a connection ... How is anyone going to get to know me or any of my colleagues if we aren’t marketed nearly as much?” This latter point is salient for this particular reason: I’ve been attending a lot of women’s sports media events recently, many of which focus on how to advance one’s career as a woman in sports or how to otherwise change the narrative about female athletes. No men have served on any of these panels or been part of the discussion. This is problematic. First, it puts the onus on women completely to change the landscape without holding men accountable or having them be part of the discussion to learn how to be better allies. Secondly, we’re co-opting women’s empowerment with the implication that women should support women, and that men aren’t responsible in doing so also. How can progress be made if we don’t include and encourage half of the population to support us? Isn’t exclusion the very thing we are trying to dismantle anyway? The SheIs initiative is no doubt important and needed, but its collective energy would be better focused on the group of girls who are currently playing sports and by also calling on the traditional men’s organizations, like the NBA, NFL, MLB, PGA et al, to pledge their support in meaningful ways. Regardless, I’ll show support by doing what the SheIs initiative wants me to do: go to games and support my local teams.

As many as 270 women may have died because of the 2009 computer error, he said. Families now face the distressing possibility that loved ones who have recently died from breast cancer may have missed opportunities for early diagnosis. Women receiving breast cancer treatment, including those with a terminal diagnosis, may also receive letters informing them of missed screenings in the coming months. The government has ordered an independent inquiry into the scandal, which Public Health England (PHE) only unearthed in January after almost a decade of errors, Hunt said. He said between 135 and 270 women “may have had their lives shortened as a result” of the missed letters, which were due to be sent out automatically to older women registered with their GPs. He said the numbers may be considerably lower, but that statistical modelling suggested there were “likely to be some people in this group who would have been alive today if this had not happened”. Hunt told the House of Commons that because of a computer algorithm failure an estimated 450,000 women aged between 68 and 71 were not invited to their final breast screening between 2009 and the start of 2018. He said the error was a serious failure of the screening programme. He apologised “wholeheartedly and unreservedly for the suffering caused”, and said: “Tragically there are likely to be some people in this group who would have been alive today if this failure had not happened.” Of the women who missed screenings, 309,000 were still alive and would be contacted before the end of May, and the first 65,000 notifications would be sent out this week, Hunt said. The letters will tell women under 72 that they will automatically be sent an invitation for a catchup screening, and those 72 and over will be given access to a helpline to decide whether a screening is appropriate, he said. Hunt said his department would contact the families of women who had died of breast cancer and who believed they had missed a screening, to apologise, and offer a process to establish whether the missed scan led to shortening of their life. “We recognise this will be incredibly distressing for some families,” he said. Family members would have their concerns investigated and compensation may be payable if the error is found to have led to an earlier death, he said. The regular screenings offered to women who are most at risk of developing the disease mean signs of early cancer development can be picked up before women notice the symptoms. Many families will be “deeply disturbed by these revelations,” Hunt said, especially those recently diagnosed with breast cancer or those who were recently bereaved. “For them and others, it is incredibly upsetting to know that you did not receive an invitation to screening at a correct time and totally devastating to hear you may have lost or be about to lose a loved one because of administrative incompetence.” The issue came to light because of an upgrade to the IT system for the breast screening invitation programme. Dr Jenny Harries, PHE’s deputy medical director, said the body was “very sorry for these faults in the system”. She said: “We have carried out urgent work to identify the problem and have fixed it. Additional failsafe systems have been introduced to ensure the problem does not reoccur,.” The problem was identified during a review of the progress of a major NHS trial designed to find out whether extra screening would protect older women from breast cancer. Set up in 2009, the AgeX trial now runs in 65 breast cancer units across England. After it was noticed that women in the trial had not been invited for their final routine screenings before their 70th birthday, it emerged that this had also happened to women in the routine NHS breast screening programme, affecting an estimated 450,000 women, according to Public Health England. The inquiry is likely to raise questions for Labour, under whom the IT errors occurred, as well as for the Conservatives as to why the glitch was not picked up sooner. Hunt said the inquiry would establish how many people were affected, why the error occurred and how it could be prevented in future. It will also examine why it took nearly a decade to pick up the problem and whether ministers were informed early enough. The inquiry will be chaired by Lynda Thomas, the chief executive of Macmillan cancer support and Prof Martin Gore, consultant medical oncologist at the Royal Marsden. It will review the entire breast screening programme and report back in six months. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said Hunt must give assurances that checks were being carried out to make sure that no one was missing out on screenings for other cancers. “Eight years is a long time for an error of this magnitude to go undetected,” he said, adding that ministers must investigate whether early warning signs were missed. Labour MP Lisa Nandy said she had concerns about whether overstretched NHS screening services would be able to meet the extra demand. Hunt said new resources would be found where scans and treatment were needed “to make sure other people are not disadvantaged”. It is unclear whether those resources would require extra funding. A government spokesman said it had delayed making the errors public in order to make sure resources were in place to cope with a spike in demand. The Royal College of Radiologists said the catch-up test would place considerable strain on screening units already stretched. “Ultimately, we need funding for more training posts for radiologists to ensure the screening programme – and the NHS as a whole – has the vital imaging doctors it needs,” said Caroline Rubin, its vice-president. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, also said she was shocked by the implications of the error, saying more than 18,000 cancers were detected as a result of the breast screening programme which might not have been detected as early otherwise. Stokes-Lampard said it was vital there were “enough resources in the system to cope with any additional demand that might follow as a result; and steps taken to ensure this never happens again.” Cancer charities expressed deep concern about the revelations. The chief executive of Breast Cancer Now, Delyth Morgan, said it was beyond belief that the error continued for almost a decade, calling it a “colossal systematic failure”. Cancer Research UK Emma Greenwood said they were “very concerning”.

For many residents of the township – one of Myanmar’s poorest and most populous – life continues as usual: mothers feed their babies in small huts on the fringes of the dump; packs of dogs roam the plastic wasteland, searching for something edible among the soft-drink bottles. Hlaingthaya residents say the dump catches fire most years, but the blazes have never been this big or lasted so long. More than two dozen people were hospitalised for smoke inhalation and injuries linked to the fire between 20 April, when it broke out, and 3 May, when authorities finally declared the situation under control. Landfill fires are not uncommon in the developing world. When India’s largest rubbish dump, at Deonar in Mumbai, caught fire in January 2016 it burned for two months and could be seen from space. It burned again this year. The Cerro Patacón landfill in Panama burned for several days in 2008 and again in 2013. In the Bahamas, the New Providence site has caught fire three times in the past 12 months. In the case of the Htein Bin fire, most coverage quotes authorities as saying the cause is being investigated and there is no sign of foul play. Almost no reports mention the causes or solutions common in academic articles on waste management. Many Yangon residents – like those of Mumbai and Panama City – are left wondering why city authorities continue to ignore textbook solutions to a slow-burning disaster. City authorities sprang into action the day after the fire started, dispatching hundreds of firefighters, soldiers, and police with trucks and hoses to rain water over the burning trash, hoping some of it would reach the fire’s subterranean source before evaporating. “For now there is nothing else we can do,” says Kyaw Min, a retired firefighter and a member of Myanmar’s national parliament. The literature on landfill fires, though, reveals they are often caused by heat and gas emitted by decomposing organic waste. According to Julius de Jong, managing director of waste management company Orgaworld Asia, there are simple and well-known measures that can prevent and control landfill fires like the one at Htein Bin. “What they’re doing with the water is only creating a bigger problem for the future,” he says. “You want to take the oxygen away from the fire. That’s the real solution.” The most effective measure, he adds, is to separate organics so they are treated elsewhere and do not go to the landfill at all. For Yangon, where an estimated 2,000 tonnes of organic waste is produced every day, this potential fire-starter could instead be harnessed to produce fertiliser and energy. Even for landfills that do include organic waste, there are lines of defence. Fire-safe landfills around the world are built upon a layer of concrete or metal, preventing organic waste from entering the ecosystem. Some also include a mineral layer on top of the waste to keep out moisture. Keeping organic waste dry and contained slows decomposition and mitigates the release of heat and gases. The Htein Bin landfill has neither of these safeguards. In the event a landfill does catch fire, the most effective solution is to smother it with sand or soil. In Yangon – where the fire was thought to be burning 50 feet below the surface in places – authorities dismissed this approach because it “would not reach the fire”. De Jong says this betrays a lack of knowledge. Instead, city authorities bought biofoam from Thailand. Like water, foam may put out surface fires. Unlike sand, foam will not cut off the fire’s oxygen, he says. Anthony Quick, an adviser for Myanmar Free Ambulance, which has been providing first aid at the scene, says firefighters were further hampered by a dangerous lack of equipment. He described an emergency call from a fire chief who was on the brink of suffocation a third of a mile into the landfill’s smoky interior. Several ambulances responded, but turned back when they could not find him. Quick persisted, eventually spotting the man and administering a life-saving dose of oxygen. “There’s very thick smoke and lots of hazardous substances in the air,” he said. “They don’t have oxygen tanks or anything. They’re just out there with basic masks, which are not enough.” Aware of the resource shortages hindering the firefighting effort, people from all over Yangon stepped up to contribute. Hla Thein, a lawmaker in Yangon’s regional parliament, commended the donations of snacks and drinks that piled up on the landfill’s edge. “This is just something Myanmar people do,” he said. “As soon as they hear about a natural disaster, they spring into action.” Quick, though, bemoaned the lack of equipment. “Snacks are great, but [the firefighters] have plenty of snacks now,” he said. “What they need is breathing apparatus.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"games/2018/may/04/harry-potter-hogwarts-mystery-review","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T06:00:15Z","webTitle":"Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery review: a shameless shake-down","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/may/04/harry-potter-hogwarts-mystery-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2018/may/04/harry-potter-hogwarts-mystery-review","fields":{"headline":"Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery review: a shameless shake-down","bodyText":"There’s about an hour of magic at the beginning of Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery, when an owl arrives from Dumbledore with a letter bearing your name and you’re whisked off to Diagon Alley to prepare for your wizarding education. Like a lot of smartphone games, Hogwarts Mystery looks a bit basic, but it’s not lazy; it’s colourful and gently humorous. Fan-pleasing touches come in the form of dialogue voiced by actors from the Harry Potter films, cameos from beloved characters and allusions to nuggets of Potter trivia. The enchantment fades when you get to the first story interlude, where your character becomes tangled up in Devil’s Snare. After a few seconds of furious tapping to free yourself from its clutches, your energy runs out and the game asks you to pay a couple of quid to refill it – or wait an hour or for it to recharge. Sadly, this is absolutely by design. From this point onwards Hogwarts Mystery does everything it can to stop you from playing it. You cannot get through even a single class without being interrupted. A typical lesson now involves 90 seconds of tapping, followed by an hour of waiting (or a purchase), then another 90 seconds of tapping. An outlay of £2 every 90 seconds is not a reasonable ask. Between story missions the wait times are even more egregious: three hours, even eight hours. Hogwarts Mystery pulls the old trick of hiding the true cost of its purchases behind an in-game “gem” currency, but I worked out that you’d have to spend about £10 a day just to play Hogwarts Mystery for 20 consecutive minutes. The interruptions prevent you from forming any kind of attachment to your fellow students, or to the mystery at the heart of the story. It is like trying to read a book that asks for money every 10 pages and slams shut on your fingers if you refuse. Without the Harry Potter trappings the game would have nothing to recommend it. The lessons quickly become dull and the writing is disappointingly bland, though it does make an effort with character dialogue. Duelling other students and casting spells are fun, but most of the time you’re just tapping. Aside from answering the odd Potter-themed question in class, you never have to engage your brain. The waits would be more bearable if there was something to do in the meantime, like exploring the castle or talking to other students. But there is nothing to find at Hogwarts, and no activity that doesn’t require yet more energy. Harry Potter is a powerful enough fantasy to override all that, at least for a while. The presence of Snape, Flitwick or McGonagall is just enough to keep you tapping through uneventful classes and clear effort has gone into recreating the look, sound and feel of the school and its characters. But by the time I got to the end of the first year I was motivated by tenacity rather than enjoyment: I WILL play this game, however much it tries to stop me. Then came the deflating realisation that the second year was just more of the same. I felt like the game’s prisoner, grimly returning every few hours for more thin gruel. What is sad is that it’s so unnecessary: Harry Potter fans would need little encouragement to spend a few quid here and there on clothes or wands to customise their characters, and there are countless examples of free-to-play games that offer players the option to spend money without ruining the experience (Fortnite, Pokémon Go and Dandy Dungeon, to name three). Hogwarts Mystery’s best chance for redemption would be if developer Jam City pulled back on the absurd timers in an update – but you get the dispiriting sense that the game was designed around them. But even if the time restrictions were removed, it wouldn’t fix the paucity of things to do in virtual Hogwarts. Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery is a dull game with a great concept, made borderline unplayable by its hyper-aggressive monetisation. This article was amended on 8 May 2018 to note that the game interrupts your play rather than refuses to let you play."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"cities/2018/may/09/quiz-can-you-guess-the-city-from-the-literary-quote","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T10:00:44Z","webTitle":"Quiz: can you guess the city from the literary quote?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/may/09/quiz-can-you-guess-the-city-from-the-literary-quote","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/may/09/quiz-can-you-guess-the-city-from-the-literary-quote","fields":{"headline":"Quiz: can you guess the city from the literary quote?","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/may/02/talking-horses-mendelssohns-draw-offers-a-clear-run-or-early-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T10:18:36Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Mendelssohn's draw offers a clear run or early disaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/may/02/talking-horses-mendelssohns-draw-offers-a-clear-run-or-early-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/may/02/talking-horses-mendelssohns-draw-offers-a-clear-run-or-early-disaster","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Mendelssohn's draw offers a clear run or early disaster","bodyText":"Wednesday’s best bets, by Chris Cook Those of you rooting for Mendelssohn and Ryan Moore in Saturday’s Kentucky Derby might like to know that their draw in stall 14 represents both an opportunity and a potential disaster in the eyes of local punters. It is the outermost stall in the main stalls unit, meaning there is quite a big gap between it and stall 15, with two sets of tyres in between. If you can break quickly from 14, you should have a nice bit of room to run into for the first 100 yards, thanks to that gap on your outside. On the other hand, the horses drawn to your outside will be heading your way, towards the inner; if you can’t get out quickly and get in front of the beast from stall 15, you may get clobbered. That’s what happened to the horse in stall 14 a year ago, Classic Empire, who was fancied after winning at the previous year’s Breeders’ Cup. You can see here how he was shunted sideways by early contact with a horse on his outer, yet ran on to be fourth. His Preakness run, in which he was beaten only a head, suggested he had indeed been a shade unlucky at Churchill Downs. I should note that the main stalls unit contained 16 stalls as recently as three years ago, so long-term stats aren’t going to give you an insight into the trickiness of stall 14 under the current setup. Anyway, I’m sure Ryan Moore is alive to the situation and will do his utmost to preserve Mendelssohn’s chance through the first furlong. Watching from afar, it looks to me like a race in which you need plenty of luck, like an even more prestigious version of the Chester Cup. Perversely enough, my main interest in Ascot’s quality card today is in the apprentice handicap at the end, when Love And Be Loved (4.55) looks too big at 12-1. She came good after being switched to turf in the second half of last year, winning her last three, including two under today’s pilot. Rain-softened ground seemed to be good news for her, so today’s soggy weather at the Queen’s track is welcome, for those of us watching on telly. This is her toughest assignment but I think she still has scope to be well ahead of her rating and it’s encouraging that her small yard has been among the winners lately. Eirene (3.45) is also enticing at 13-2 for the Pavilion Stakes, in which she may benefit from already having had a run, when outperforming her odds of 20-1 to be third in the Nell Gwyn. The last furlong didn’t help her that day and this return to sprint trips looks the way forward. She nearly won a Group Three at Salisbury in September, when headed close home by Anna Nerium, who has since won the Free Handicap. You can get 9-1 the nap, Short Work (4.30) at Pontefract. He took time to rediscover his best form after joining David O’Meara last year but won four times in the autumn, with blinkers seeming to help. They were left off in favour of cheekpieces for his seasonal return under a 7lb claimer a fortnight ago. O’Meara having since hit form, it’s interesting to see the blinkers back on and Danny Tudhope back in the saddle. Short Work was a non-runner at Thirsk two days ago in a race worth half as much."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/may/02/serena-williams-should-be-seeded-wimbledon-tennis-baby","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T10:26:07Z","webTitle":"Serena Williams should be seeded at Wimbledon for the good of the game","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/may/02/serena-williams-should-be-seeded-wimbledon-tennis-baby","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/may/02/serena-williams-should-be-seeded-wimbledon-tennis-baby","fields":{"headline":"Serena Williams should be seeded at Wimbledon for the good of the game","bodyText":"There are a few good reasons Wimbledon should break with precedent and offer a player ranked 449 in the world a seeding at this year’s championships. The overriding one is the fact that the player has won the tournament seven times and is called Serena Williams. Given the state of flux in the women’s game, the finest women’s player of the modern era might well be the best player in the 2018 draw – certainly nobody in the top 32 would relish playing her in the first round if she came at them from outside the seedings. That said, her comeback at 36 years of age has yet to pick up pace in four matches since she stepped gingerly back on the tour this year after a difficult childbirth in September. She is still reaching for full fitness after early losses in Indian Wells and Miami, so things could get messy before the opening day at Wimbledon on 2 July. Although Williams has almost slipped from view in the rankings after her long absence in 2017, as the owner of 23 slam titles, the former world No 1 has a protected ranking to get into the majors. However, when asked on Tuesday if this would be good enough for her to be placed into the cosseted zone of the top 32, the chairman of the All England Club, Philip Brook, and the club’s chief executive officer, Richard Lewis, were momentarily wrong-footed. It said, correctly, that the wording of the rule book was vague and ambiguous. The men’s seedings were fixed according to the top-32 rankings of the ATP Tour – which deprives Andy Murray of a discretionary seeding on his return – but there was no mention of 32 in provisions for the women’s draw. It took a phonecall to the WTA headquarters in Florida to open the door: Wimbledon did indeed have the discretion to offer Williams a precious seeding, and they issued a quick clarification to that effect. The ball, in every way, is in their court. The odds are it will do the right thing. It usually does. If there is one instinct that drives the administration and stewardship of the championships it is probity. For the 150 years of its existence, Wimbledon has batted away controversy with the untroubled ease of Roger Federer planting his back-hand down the line on the clipped lawns of Centre Court. Now the quiet powerhouse of tennis has been lumbered with a problem not of its own making, but definitely in its gift to solve. It will be a test of its class and wisdom when the seedings committee meets on 26 June. The other reasons? Natural justice, locker-room sympathy and the good of the game. As Williams pointed out this week, it seems unfair to deny the privilege of a seeding to great players who have been away to have a baby. One tennis insider ludicrously described Williams’s decision to have a baby as, “a lifestyle choice”, as if having a baby is somehow dialled up from a glossy magazine poll. The players, largely, are behind her. After Williams went out early at Indian Wells the world No 1, Simona Halep, said the American should have been seeded No 1 in the draw, and the Miami tournament director, James Blake, agreed that leaving her out of the seedings looked like “punishment” for being a mother. The counter argument to giving Williams preferential treatment is that other players have slogged away on the tour to make the top 32 at the home of tennis, and one of them will have to be bounced. Well, that precarious outer territory of the seedings exists anyway. Williams, the most decorated player of the Open era, has earned her right to be regarded as special. If she were to trip and lose to a seed in the first round, the draw would instantly be a poorer attraction. There is also, of course, the seeming unfairness of the two-time champion and home favourite Murray possibly having to play Roger Federer in the first round in his comeback slam. However, it is unlikely he will complain. He lost his coach, Amélie Mauresmo, in May 2016 when she said she could not juggle motherhood and coaching, among other things. But Murray, who has championed equality in the game more than any other male player, won Wimbledon that year, not to mention taking Olympic gold and reaching No 1 in the world. Last year Maria Sharapova spared the All England Club the embarrassment of offering her a wildcard by refusing to request one when returning from a 15-month absence after failing a drug test. She ultimately postponed her return to the big time until the US Open, where she was embraced with the warmth of a homecoming queen. She played four matches – all of them dramatic three-setters – on the tournament’s Arthur Ashe showcourt, the clearest possible signal that Sharapova was its go-to star of the fortnight. If it was good enough for the Russian to be given a red carpet in New York, it is good enough for the American to get the same welcome at Wimbledon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/may/03/mary-and-the-witchs-flower-review-japanese-animation-hiromasa-yonebayashi","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T11:00:40Z","webTitle":"Mary and the Witch's Flower review – charming Japanese children's adventure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/03/mary-and-the-witchs-flower-review-japanese-animation-hiromasa-yonebayashi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/03/mary-and-the-witchs-flower-review-japanese-animation-hiromasa-yonebayashi","fields":{"headline":"Mary and the Witch's Flower review – charming Japanese children's adventure","bodyText":"‘Innocence has a catalytic effect on the absorption of magic.” These words, from the worryingly named Doctor Dee, are a very good description of the film’s ethos. This Japanese animation is from director Hiromasa “Maro” Yonebayashi, who made When Marnie Was There for Studio Ghibli. It is another example of that remarkable way in which Japanese animation is reviving the memory of classic English children’s literature from the 1960s and 70s – otherwise forgotten in its native land. Mary and the Witch’s Flower is adapted from the 1971 novel The Little Broomstick, by the prolific popular author Mary Stewart. A little English girl called Mary (voiced by Hana Sugisaki in the original, and by Ruby Barnhill – from Spielberg’s The BFG – in the dubbed version) is a lonely child living with her great-aunt in the countryside while her parents are away. She encounters a local boy called Peter (Ryonosuke Kamiki/Louis Serkis) whom she dislikes at first for his nasty, teasing ways. But Peter’s cats Tib and Gib lead Mary to what are supposed to be magical flowers and then to a mysterious broomstick entombed in a tree trunk – all of which takes her to an extraordinary school for witches, governed by Madame Bumblechook (Yuki Amami/Kate Winslet) and her sinister associate, Doctor Dee (Fumiyo Kohinata/Jim Broadbent). And so a magical adventure of discovery and rescue has begun. The film has charm as well as a certain deja vu for audiences, although for me it didn’t quite have the distinction of Marnie."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/may/04/modern-life-is-rubbish-review-flaccid-90s-era-romdram","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T05:00:15Z","webTitle":"Modern Life Is Rubbish review – flaccid 90s-era romdram","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/04/modern-life-is-rubbish-review-flaccid-90s-era-romdram","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/04/modern-life-is-rubbish-review-flaccid-90s-era-romdram","fields":{"headline":"Modern Life Is Rubbish review – flaccid 90s-era romdram","bodyText":"‘Modern” isn’t exactly the word; this is a well-meaning but flaccid and cliched 90s-style relationship dramedy clearly inspired by Nick Hornby’s 1995 novel High Fidelity and the resulting Stephen Frears movie with a young John Cusack playing the gloomy, lovelorn record-shop owner. There is, however, no mention of these pop-cultural elephants in the living room. The title is taken from the name of Blur’s second album – an LP of great significance to wannabe rock star, romantic and nerd connoisseur Liam (Josh Whitehouse), who is given to shrill, tiresome rants about the horrible soullessness of the modern world with its downloads and its “skinny decaf lattes”. One day, while browsing in an old-fashioned vinyl store, Liam gets talking to the beautiful Natalie (Freya Mavor), an artist with an interest in doing album covers, of all the quixotically old-fashioned things. They fall in love and the drama intercuts between the glorious beginning of their affair and the grim breakup, the moving out, the deciding whose CDs are whose. Ian Hart contributes a wacky but wholly unbelievable cameo as Curve, a guy whose job is to be a freelance “groove consultant” to struggling bands, including Liam’s group, whimsically named Head-Cleaner.

It’s got the wonderfully easy, unforced naturalism and calm that distinguished his last two films, Weekend (2011) and 45 Years (2015). Things are taken mostly at a walking pace, a measured, controlled tempo, like someone carefully leading an injured horse. That doesn’t mean to say there aren’t some dramatic and violent moments, including a fateful highway incident, fabricated brilliantly but unobtrusively with digital effects, that had me clasp both hands over my mouth in shock. A lonely teenage boy, Charlie (Charlie Plummer) finds himself one summer in a dilapidated house in Portland, Oregon, having been uprooted from his Washington state hometown, where despite his poor background he had been a good student and promising track star. He’s right back to square one now, and the move evidently has something to do with a broken home. His mom is no longer in the picture and his handsome wastrel of a dad, Ray (Travis Fimmel), is a shiftless guy who brings home a different woman every night. Charlie finds transient work at a nearby racecourse, working for a seedy and unscrupulous horse trainer called Del (Steve Buscemi) who is too bad tempered and cynical to be even an ironic father figure. Charlie is entranced by the excitement and exotic rituals of horse training; he befriends Del’s jockey, Bonnie (Chloë Sevigny), and mutely sympathises with her stoic complaints about this corrupt and misogynistic scene. Both Bonnie and Del are amused and yet worried about Charlie becoming so infatuated by a world that can only end for him in the heartbreak and failure they see in their own lives. And Charlie finds himself falling for Del’s sweet-natured and biddable racehorse Lean on Pete. This equable beast is very good for teaching newbies like Charlie – Del brutally calls him a “pussy”. But he is also, ominously, getting slower. Losers like Lean on Pete get sold to horseflesh dealers in Mexico, a fate that doesn’t need to be spelled out. And when Pete becomes injured one afternoon – Charlie abbreviates his name in a way that poignantly emphasises reliability and strength – horse and boy become runaways. The movie takes us across some classic American landscape but it isn’t quite in the tradition of Larry McMurtry or Cormac McCarthy – nor is it like, for example, Chloé Zhao’s recent film The Rider. Importantly, Charlie can’t and won’t ride Lean on Pete. In fact, the theme of the poverty-stricken youngster finding friendship, love and transcendent dignity in the company of a martyred animal is part of a different tradition – the British social realist line stretching from Ken Loach’s Kes to Clio Barnard’s The Selfish Giant. In some ways, the British film-maker Haigh has exported this style to the American West. Lean on Pete has an alt.socialrealist twang. But where his movie departs from that style is in the construction of narrative, and the unexpected way in which the relationship of horse and boy is perhaps not as central and dominant as we might otherwise expect. The meaning and presence of Lean on Pete is mysterious. I found myself thinking about the donkey in Robert Bresson’s Au Hasard Balthazar (1966). Haigh has a masterly way with mood and moment, with the play of light on a scene, and with a robust shift from fierce sunshine to sombre night-time. Everything looks scuffed, worn, broken down; perhaps the only things that are cared for are the furniture and fittings of the diners that Del and Charlie show up in. Del’s horses are trained by being made to walk in a circle attached to a rotating maypole contraption that looks ironically like one of the rides at the tatty old fairground races where Lean on Pete usually runs. Plummer gives an excellent performance: watchful, sensitive, delicate and yet possessed of a survivor’s impassive quality. Fimmel is also very good in a role that is perhaps smaller than I expected. Buscemi is as robust and confident as ever and Steve Zahn is also strong in a small role as a homeless alcoholic guy. My only slight reservation is that Lean on Pete, though running to an affecting conclusion, maybe doesn’t deliver the final sting or narrative turn that marked out his previous film, 45 Years. Yet perhaps its simplicity and plainness is the whole point."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/03/tim-hammonds-exit-leaves-labor-and-the-liberals-scrambling","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T22:40:43Z","webTitle":"Tim Hammond's exit leaves Labor – and the Liberals – scrambling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/03/tim-hammonds-exit-leaves-labor-and-the-liberals-scrambling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/03/tim-hammonds-exit-leaves-labor-and-the-liberals-scrambling","fields":{"headline":"Tim Hammond's exit leaves Labor – and the Liberals – scrambling","bodyText":"Tim Hammond’s resignation from federal parliament came not only as a shock, it has caught both major political parties on the hop, with the Liberals still considering whether they will even contest the seat of Perth. Labor had not considered having to replace Hammond; the former lawyer was considered a surety for the seat for at least a decade. The party is now scrambling to find a suitable candidate. The WA state Labor secretary, Patrick Gorman, a former staffer for Kevin Rudd, was one of the first hats thrown into the ring, but others were cautioning his candidacy was not set in stone. Gorman was considered an early frontrunner, having led the party to its most decisive state win in decades, after Labor not only defeated the Barnett Liberal government, but did so in a majority. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The Liberals were only in the early stages of their federal WA preselection motions, and the party is now preparing to talk to the Perth branch about whether that process should be expedited. But despite winning just over 42% of the primary vote at the last general election, the Liberal candidate, Jeremy Quinn, still lost the seat because the Greens, who won 17% of the vote share, sent that vote to Labor. To come anywhere near winning the seat, the Liberals would have to win more than 50% of the primary vote. While Bill Shorten has visited the west 13 times since the last election, Malcolm Turnbull has been a much rarer sight, particularly since the Liberal state election loss and reignition of the GST debate. With a general election due early next year, and Hasluck, Canning and Pearce to protect, a byelection is considered a costly distraction with no guarantee of success, particularly if the Greens run. Which early inquiries suggested they would. They are in the final stages of their own preselections across the state, including for Perth. Greens sources said Tim Clifford, who had previously contested the seat, was the most likely to win the preselection, but others questioned why he would leave his WA upper house spot for an unwinnable seat. Other political insiders wondered whether Scott Ludlam, who left the Senate as the first section 44 casualty, would seek to return. Other Greens members said preselection processes had finished, but would not say who the winning candidate was. There is thinking within the Liberal party to let Labor and the Greens spend their resources battling it out, as they did in Batman, the seat of Perth having been in Labor’s hands since 1983. A boundary change shortly before the 2016 election shifted the electorate into slightly more marginal territory for Labor than it had been before. Hammond won the seat after Alannah MacTiernan stepped down after one term, with a 3.3% margin. MacTiernan returned to state politics. Others are also questioning whether the Perth byelection will be held in isolation, with the high court ruling on Katy Gallagher’s eligibility to sit in the Senate having the potential to set off a domino effect for Labor MPs Susan Lamb, Justine Keay and Josh Wilson. That would see Labor fighting two byelections in Western Australia, as well as one in Queensland and one in Tasmania, as well as South Australia if the Centre Alliance MP Rebekha Sharkie is also made to resign under the Gallagher ruling. With discussions over preselections only just starting, Labor has not begun to consider who will take Hammond’s place on the frontbench, although Terri Butler and Kristina Keneally were both touted as early contenders. Hammond resigned on Wednesday, announcing his decision on Perth radio after admitting he could no longer balance his work and family life. “I don’t want to dig into the really personal particulars of how that has unfolded, particularly in the last six to two months, other than to say we have tried everything we can to keep all of this together in a way that isn’t going to compromise the strength of what we all have as a family,” he told 6PR in an emotional interview. “I just can’t risk the consequences of delaying this for another almost 12 months, even if it means going to the backbench, even if it means really scaling back my role, and all of those things have been offered.” Hammond has not yet formally resigned, meaning no writs for a byelection can be issued. That is expected to happen some time in the next parliamentary sitting week, when the government will also hand down its pre-election budget."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"community/2018/may/02/the-most-farcical-day-yet-with-brexit-your-best-comments-today","type":"article","sectionId":"community","sectionName":"Community","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T12:21:46Z","webTitle":"'The most farcical day yet with Brexit': your best comments today","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/community/2018/may/02/the-most-farcical-day-yet-with-brexit-your-best-comments-today","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/community/2018/may/02/the-most-farcical-day-yet-with-brexit-your-best-comments-today","fields":{"headline":"'The most farcical day yet with Brexit': your best comments today","bodyText":"Reaction to the live blog’s updates on what the best EU customs proposal looks like provoked some of the most interesting discussion on site today. We’re also looking at your views on tiny living spaces for milennials and whether driving licences should be revoked from older drivers whose fitness to drive is questionable. To join in the conversation you can click on the links in the comments below to expand and add your thoughts. We’ll continue to highlight more comments worth reading as the day goes on. Rees-Mogg claims Tory Brexiter customs partnership warning will help May - Politics live Today’s politics live blog has generated a lot of conversation below the line about how much time has been wasted discussing custom deals that have already been rejected by the EU. ‘Today is possibly the most farcical day yet with Brexit’ Today is possibly the most farcical day yet with Brexit. The customs partnership and streamlined approach have both been turned down by the EU as feasible approaches. Davis may call this an “opening position” but so far it seems pretty clear that neither of them will work. They are both moot. Yet, here we have the Conservative party tearing itself apart about one of these options still being pursued. Not because the EU won’t accept it, but because the Brexiters won’t accept it. It would be like a couple arguing over whether they are still considering buying a Porche, instead of a Lamborgini, when in fact they would be lucky to afford a 20-year-old Fiesta. Neither of the options is viable, stop wasting time arguing about them and think of something new, anything. jezf ‘Utter, utter stupidity on display for the world to see’ Are they that stupid that they still think that after two years they have time to debate which of the two proposals to put forward to the EU, even though both have already been rejected? Are they too stupid to realise that they wasted 18 months pursuing the cake-and-eat-it deal and wasted precious time when they could have been planning to effectively and competently leave the EU? Now it’s crunch time and if we don’t stay in some kind of customs union the UK will face economic turmoil. Runningblade Don’t worry, we millennials don’t need living rooms anyway Elle Hunt discusses the suggestion that young people should live in “centrally located but smaller” housing. You’ve been sharing your own views below the line. ‘The problem is storage for other stuff’ There is a case for the minimum to be reduced. I lived for a year in a 23m2 apartment, perfectly OK when I was single. The problem is storage for stuff; bicycles, camping gear etc. The space is sufficient to live in, but we should adopt the continental idea of a storage cupboard or similar, not necessarily in the apartment. madridpunch ‘Encouraging housing spaces with no communal areas seems a depressing step backwards’ When we have frequent articles and public concerns over loneliness, and articles on the effects that gadgets and TVs have on sleep if used in the bedroom, to encourage housing spaces with no communal areas seems a depressing step backwards. Not to mention the fact that constantly being out of your house socialising is very expensive, especially in a city like London. To be able to have friends over rather than go out for another overpriced cup of coffee or inflated bottle of wine would help a lot in terms of keeping costs down- for those millennials who can even afford to be constantly out of the house socialising. latenightreader Should I revoke the licence of an older driver or not? There’s no easy answer You’ve been sharing thoughts on Ranjana Srivastava’s piece on whether older drivers should have their licences revoked if their fitness to drive is in question. ‘I hope I will recognise when my days of having the privilege of driving are over’ A toughie. I live in a sea-side community where it is near imperative to drive to live your life. It has its share of elderly people who obviously should not still be driving. I know the day is not too far away when it will be me in that position. It will be hard but I hope I will recognise that my days of having the privilege of driving are over, that it is my responsibility to care for the wellbeing of other road uses and pedestrians and to hand my licence in. It is one of the reasons we are planning to relocate in the next couple of years to somewhere we can live without driving. We will be leaving our beautiful home of many years, but the elderly are not immune to the responsibilities of citizenship and should plan for not being able to drive as they plan for other contingencies. venusplutomoon ‘The rules are quite clear on this with very little wriggle room’ In New South Wales the Roads and Maritime Services has strict guidelines for fitness to drive that MUST be followed. As a doctor if someone technically meets the requirements but I have concerns I refer them for a practical driving assessment. If they don’t meet the minimum requirements the decision is simple to make and explain but often difficult for the patient to accept especially in a rural area where there is no public transport. It always makes me very sad when I have to break bad news like this but the rules are quite clear on this with very little wriggle room. dtm1966 Comments have been edited for length.

Both items find their place in the House of European History, an EU-funded museum that aims to tell the story of a continent. HEH, which opened a year ago at a cost of €55.4m (£47m), is probably the EU’s boldest cultural project. “There are tens of thousands of museums in Europe, but they all have a national, regional or local perspective,” says Constanze Itzel, the museum’s director. A museum dedicated to pan-European history, rather than individual countries, has never been done before, she adds. National objects are jumbled together, so visitors can see common themes about nation-building, war or consumerism. A copy of the first Norwegian constitution is next to a decorative flask featuring the hero of Italian unification, Giuseppe Garibaldi. But those seeking details on the French Revolution, or the life and times of Winston Churchill, will be disappointed. “The harshest criticisms comes from those who expected to see their national heroes,” says Itzel. Although run by a team of independent curators, an EU-funded history museum was always going to be controversial. Some of the earliest critics were British tabloids and Ukip MEPs, who described the museum as a “house of horrors” and “an expensive, wrong-headed palace of propaganda”. More recently, Poland’s nationalist government has gone on the attack: the deputy prime minister, Piotr Gliński, who is responsible for culture, complained that the HEH played down famous Poles and showed the country as complicit in the Holocaust. Historians think this critique is rooted in the same ultra-conservative “politics of memory” that has led to managers and international experts being forced out of Poland’s Museum of the Second World War in Gdańsk. “Anything that makes Poland exceptional in Europe and anything that puts Poland into international context … makes [the government] uncomfortable,” said Włodzimierz Borodziej, the Polish academic who chairs the HEH academic committee. However, the Law and Justice party government failed to force changes in Brussels. MEPs said they would not interfere and referred Warsaw to the curators. Polish officials say they are in “constant dialogue” with the museum. Those looking for a temple to EU propaganda will be disappointed. A visitor has to climb to the fourth floor before seeing the blue and gold EU insignia. The display on the founding of the European Coal and Steel Community is modest, surrounded by exhibits about US-inspired consumerism and Soviet tanks rolling into eastern Europe. Objects can mean different things to different people. A tin of canned beef emblazoned with the EU flag dropped into Sarajevo during the 1995 siege could be seen as a testament to humanitarian interventionism. But locals remember remember this offering “as worse than dog food”, says the curator, Martí Grau Segú, while the EU was criticised for doing nothing to avert humanitarian catastrophe in the Balkans. Likewise, the EU’s 2012 Nobel peace prize is displayed near a replica protest banner against the award that condemned the bloc for “crisis, chaos and unemployment”. Some critics think the focus on colonialism, war and, more recently, the migration crisis, means a positive story has gone missing. “The museum is like an empty shrine,” says Jakub Jareš, a historian at the Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes in the Czech Republic. The museum is “quite German”, he adds, because of the focus on reckoning with the traumatic past. Jareš, a museum specialist, thinks the 10-year development time was not enough for the museum to “achieve the goal they wanted … a European narrative”. A decade in the making, this was the third attempt to create a European history museum. When lawmakers embarked on the current project in 2007, the EU was reeling from the rejection of the constitution by French and Dutch voters. Hans-Gert Pöttering, a former European parliament president who proposed the museum 11 years ago, said it would be a means to “cultivate European unification and memory of European history” at a time when the bloc was struggling to connect with voters. “All three [projects] have suffered from the same problem, namely: what do you put into a museum of European history,” says Sir Norman Davies, a British historian, who has taken part in discussions, on and off, since 1991. “The past is simply too big. There is too much of it for everything to be shown,” says Davies, who has written his own take on the history of Europe and is now a member of the HEH academic panel. The outcome “is not perfect” but “much better than I feared”, he says. Although deploring Polish government “propagandists”, he thinks they have a point. The academic committee wanted to ensure that “European history was not seen as the sum total of national histories, but an overarching view of developments”. Now Davies wonders if there ought to have been more concessions to national history – corners of the museum dedicated to great Europeans. “Most visitors will have learned their history in a national context. There is a disconnect between the exhibition and what visitors want to see,” he says. The museum will evolve – many pieces are on loan and will have to be replaced. The top floor is half-empty and the director plans an exhibition of visitor comments. “They are also part of the debate,” Itzel says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2018/may/02/6500-jobs-to-be-lost-in-modernisation-of-uk-courts","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T12:06:44Z","webTitle":"6,500 jobs to be lost in modernisation of courts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/may/02/6500-jobs-to-be-lost-in-modernisation-of-uk-courts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2018/may/02/6500-jobs-to-be-lost-in-modernisation-of-uk-courts","fields":{"headline":"6,500 jobs to be lost in modernisation of courts","bodyText":"About 6,500 courthouse and backroom jobs in England and Wales are being lost and more courts closed under the government’s drive to modernise the justice system through online pleas and remote video hearings. Details of the ambitious extent of the £1bn programme launched in 2016 emerged from a consultation process circulated by the senior judiciary on Wednesday. The job loss figure underlines the radical nature of the transformation envisaged by HM Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS). The justice secretary, David Gauke, recently appointed Tim Parker, a former boss of Kwik-Fit and the AA, as chair of its board. Parker was once nicknamed the Prince of Darkness by trade unions for reportedly driving to a factory in a Porsche to announce mass job losses. The senior judiciary has sent around four large documents explaining how the switch to digital working will affect the criminal, civil and family courts as well as tribunals. Feedback is being sought from judges. There will be more remote video hearings, online pleas for minor offences, video replay facilities for jurors in their retiring rooms and fewer physical courtrooms. The 6,500 job losses will be spread over the period from 2016 to 2022. The cuts are likely to cause further alarm in the public-funded branch of the legal profession as they come at a time when criminal barristers are refusing to handle new legal aid cases because of cuts to fees, and when the Law Society is warning that criminal solicitors are becoming extinct. commitment to provide sufficient ushers in court, and “digital support officers” will be on hand to support judges in the courts of the future, it says. “The 460 buildings that made up the court estate has been reduced to 350 so far, with more reductions due to come.” In the foreword, the lord chief justice, Lord Burnett of Maldon, says: “These reforms will deliver savings – a necessary condition for securing the financial support of the government – but they will transform the way we operate the system of justice for the benefit of the public and enhance the administration of justice. “Our approach to this modernisation must be rooted in our shared commitment and dedication to improving the administration of justice and access to justice so that we continue to uphold the rule of law.” HMCTS has begun piloting virtual hearings, including in tax tribunals in which claimants can participate from their homes via webcams. The single justice procedure, introduced in 2016, will eventually apply to as many as 840,000 cases a year. Under this procedure, if defendants plead guilty either online or in writing, or do not engage with the court, the case will be judged on the papers by a single magistrate working with a legal adviser, and the decision and sentence will be recorded digitally. It will apply to summary, non-imprisonable offences where there is no identifiable victim. Some contested hearings may be conducted via videolinks. A computer system is being introduced for all criminal cases in magistrates and crown courts, although national security cases will not be stored on it. Non-judicial staff will be authorised to complete “routine box work” currently done by judges, such as applications to extend time for compliance with an order when there is no risk to the trial date or uncontested special measures applications. There should be clear procedure rules for those accessing justice online “with limited legal advice”, the documents state. “Processes will be consistent, predictable and easier to understand, especially for litigants in person.” There are comments from other senior judges in the documents, highlighting concerns over funding and disrepair in the courts. Sir Brian Leveson, the head of criminal justice in the courts, writes: “I appreciate that first thoughts will challenge the reduction of public funding in many different parts of the system but we have to persuade the government that, consistent with our fervent belief in access to justice and in the maintenance of excellence, we have done all that we can to be as efficient as possible.” An HMCTS spokesperson said: “We are investing over £1bn to modernise the justice system – making it more convenient, easier to use, and providing better value for the taxpayer. “As we increase the use of digital services, it makes sense to consider the role for court buildings and assess whether some are still necessary to provide effective access to justice. “Since April 2016 we have raised £115m from the sale of underused court buildings – over £34m more than forecast, and every penny of this will be reinvested as part of our modernisation plans.”The HMCTS workforce is 16,313, of whom just over 2,000 are agency staff. The shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, said: “More staff cuts and court closures are yet another consequence of the government’s reckless decision to impose on the Ministry of Justice the deepest cuts of any department. “The government should halt all further cuts and closures, at least until it has published its long awaited courts bill so that its worrying plans for the future of our courts system can be properly debated.” The general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union, Mark Serwotka, said: “Our court system is in meltdown … Any further cuts will make their job impossible and those seeking to access justice will suffer as a consequence.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/may/02/romeo-and-juliet-review-rsc-gender-fluid-tragedy-of-youth","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T10:38:53Z","webTitle":"Romeo and Juliet review – RSC's gender-fluid tragedy of youth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/02/romeo-and-juliet-review-rsc-gender-fluid-tragedy-of-youth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/may/02/romeo-and-juliet-review-rsc-gender-fluid-tragedy-of-youth","fields":{"headline":"Romeo and Juliet review – RSC's gender-fluid tragedy of youth","bodyText":"In 1845, the American Charlotte Cushman toured Britain playing Romeo to her sister’s Juliet. Erica Whyman’s new Royal Shakespeare Company production doesn’t go as far as that, but casts women in five traditionally male roles, including Mercutio, and is multicultural and youth-oriented. The result is a swift, lively show that went down hugely well with the audience but that doesn’t solve the problems inherent in the play itself. Whyman, in the programme, describes Juliet as “the agent of her own destiny”, but that is precisely what she isn’t. Shakespeare took his plot from a didactic poem by Arthur Brooke and created a spirited Juliet who doesn’t fit into its framework. Where later Shakespeare heroines such as Rosalind and Imogen seize the initiative, Juliet submits to the machinations of a bungling herbalist. Karen Fishwick does all she can to suggest youthful defiance, beating her bedroom pillows in rage as she takes the old pusher’s drugs, but you feel this strong-willed Juliet would have followed Romeo into exile. Meanwhile, Bally Gill plays Romeo as an impetuous young hothead. They make an engaging couple, but their modernity only highlights the manufactured nature of a tragedy that depends on the erratic Italian postal service. The casting of Charlotte Josephine as Mercutio raises a host of issues. Josephine, who has written and performed a play called Bitch Boxer about a 21-year-old pugilist, plausibly plays Mercutio as a tough, crop-haired female bruiser always ready for a scrap. The performance is perfectly enjoyable, but left me faintly puzzled. Even if Mercutio aspires to be part of a laddish culture, would she engage in such rancid sexist abuse of Juliet’s Nurse or react with such hostility on being told that she “consorts” with Romeo? I welcome gender-fluid casting but, since Shakespeare’s play is an attack on the destructiveness of male violence, is there any gain in casting one of the key knife-wielders as a woman? Whyman’s flexibility pays off handsomely, however, in the casting of Beth Cordingly as the angry Veronese prince, Escalus, who berates the city’s men for their tribal warfare. Many of the other roles are also strongly played. Ishia Bennison suggests the Nurse enjoys a giggling intimacy with Juliet, only to be pained by her later exclusion. Michael Hodgson makes Capulet a violently abusive figure reminding us how often in Shakespeare fathers are seen as raging domestic tyrants (think of Lear and Leonato in Much Ado About Nothing). Andrew French as Friar Laurence speaks the verse better than anyone on stage and Josh Finan makes a real character out of Benvolio by suggesting he is hopelessly smitten by Romeo. Tom Piper’s design, deploying the same kind of rotating cube he recently used in The Great Wave at the National, is oddly nondescript. It is significant how many of the best versions of this play, from Franco Zeffirelli’s seething Italian production to Baz Luhrmann’s California-based film, have a socially precise setting. Even if Whyman hasn’t solved all the problems the play poses, she reminds us of the truth of Harley Granville-Barker’s observation that “this is a tragedy of youth”. Not only is the cast supplemented by schoolchildren, but Fishwick and Gill as the lovers vigorously convey a doomed innocence. • At the Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 21 September.

Bercow’s former private secretary alleged in a TV interview that the Speaker was prone to angry outbursts and obscene language. May’s spokesman told journalists: “The prime minister has been very clear from the start that there is no place for bullying or harassment in the workplace including parliament. It’s a matter for parliament to decide how to proceed, but the latest allegations are concerning and should be properly investigated.” The former private secretary, Angus Sinclair, told Newsnight on Tuesday that Bercow was prone to “over-the-top anger” and that he was “not sure he was completely in control of it”. He claimed Bercow had undermined him in front of other staff and once smashed a mobile phone over his desk. “There was a tirade of how I’d let him down and it was the worst thing ... There was a lot of bad language and suddenly his mobile phone, which he’d been holding, was flung on the desk in front of me and broke into a lot of bits,” he said. Sinclair also claimed the Speaker had told him he was no longer needed after the 2010 general election and that he was given compulsory early retirement with an £86,250 payoff conditional on a non-disclosure agreement. His successor, Kate Emms, has also alleged that Bercow had bullied her. After the prime minister intervened in the row, the leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, suggested the ongoing inquiry into the treatment of parliamentary staff, being carried out by Dame Laura Cox, could be expanded to consider the new allegations. Leadsom said: “It is for Dame Laura Cox QC to consider whether the terms of reference of her independent inquiry need to be expanded, to allow for individual investigations to take place. I’m sure she will be looking very carefully at how best to respond to these latest developments.” She added: “We must call out unacceptable behaviour and stand by the House staff who do so much for us.” That call was echoed by the top civil servants’ union, the FDA, which represents dozens of parliamentary staff who claim to have been mistreated by MPs. Its general secretary, Dave Penman, said: “If justice is to be served, then all of those who have been denied it need access to an independent complaints process, not only those who may make a complaint against the Speaker. “All staff in the House need a consistent and fair approach to the investigation of both past and current cases. There can be no clean slate for past perpetrators of bullying and harassment. “The prime minister now has the opportunity to demonstrate to the staff who support the vital work of parliament that she is interested in their welfare, not just the pursuit of a narrow political agenda,” he said. Maria Miller, the Conservative chair of the women and equalities committee, directly challenged Bercow about the allegations in the Commons, asking him: “What steps will you be taking to staff both current and former that they can speak out about wrongdoing experienced whilst working in this place?” She also called on him to make a personal statement about the latest claims “given your involvement in these allegations, and that they are further allegations which potentially have the effect of undermining the reputation of this House”. The Speaker insisted he had no personal involvement in drawing up the “compromise agreements” signed by departing staff, which he said did not prevent staff making complaints. But he refused to comment on the specific allegations, saying: “I have made a public statement, to which I have nothing to add.” Bercow then irritated some MPs by accepting a supportive intervention from the Conservative MP Julian Lewis, who asked him to confirm that most of his staff were long-serving. “I have a superb team,” he said. “I am also happy to confirm that the great majority of people who have left my service have done so on perfectly amicable terms.” Bercow was defended by other MPs, some of whom regard him as a moderniser who has ruffled feathers in shaking up the way parliament works. Labour MP Barry Sheerman tweeted: “I have known John Bercow since he came into parliament. He is not a bully but a small group of House officials hated his determination to shake up and modernise the House of Commons.” A spokesman for the Speaker’s office said Bercow “strenuously denies that there is any substance to any of these allegations”. Leadsom published a report this year on plans to toughen up protection for Commons staff. Complaints would spark a confidential inquiry by the parliamentary commissioner for standards, with harsher sanctions for those found to have behaved inappropriately."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/02/arrested-development-the-remix-can-netflixs-rehash-gamble-work","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T10:24:45Z","webTitle":"Arrested Development: the remix – can Netflix's rehash gamble work?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/02/arrested-development-the-remix-can-netflixs-rehash-gamble-work","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/02/arrested-development-the-remix-can-netflixs-rehash-gamble-work","fields":{"headline":"Arrested Development: the remix – can Netflix's rehash gamble work?","bodyText":"Mitch Hurwitz’s decision to ‘remix’ the fourth series of Arrested Development is one of the most interesting things to happen in TV for years. The results will either be a curate’s egg of colossal proportions or a bold new way forward for all imperfect shows. If you saw it, you’ll know that the most recent series of Arrested Development was a bit of a mess. Almost without exception, the cast had become hugely successful in the years since the show went off air, and piecing together a Netflix revival looked like a brain-breakingly difficult nightmare of logistics and scheduling. As a result, Hurwitz essentially had to abandon the form altogether. For two great years, and then a slightly dodgy third, Arrested Development had been a traditional ensemble full of awful characters driven to their worst impulses by their close proximity to one other. But because the fourth series had to be taped together atom by atom – including plenty of infuriatingly conspicuous greenscreen inserts – Hurwitz was forced to adopt a Rashomon structure, with each episode focused on a different main character. And it was draining to watch. Without the whole gang all in the same place at the same time, Arrested Development suddenly became lumpen and belaboured. Scenes that would have once been tight and bulletproof dissolved into directionless mush. For anyone who loved Arrested Development – and anyone who loved Arrested Development loved Arrested Development – the disappointment was palpable. But Hurwitz has been quietly re-editing the series. On Friday, Netflix will debut something called Arrested Development Season 4 Remix: Fateful Consequences. All the footage from series four’s 15 episodes has been painstakingly reordered into 22 new episodes. Better yet, rather than focus on one character per story, every Bluth will now appear in every episode. It’s going to be chronological and interwoven. In short, it’s going to be more like the Arrested Development you remember. I’m fascinated by this. Not only is the remix’s existence a rare admission of error by a showrunner, but I’m eager to see if it will actually improve the viewing experience. After all, the scenes are still the same. The characters are still the same. The jokes are all still the same. Hurwitz is still working with the same raw material that he always had, but the difference could be night and day. If it works – if he pulls a lost classic from the ruined fuselage of what we’ve already seen – it could change television. It might prompt other showrunners to go back and tinker with their own unsatisfactory blips. Matthew Weiner could go back to alter the second series of Mad Men so that it didn’t sag under the weight of Peggy’s boring family. The weird first series of Parks and Recreation could be rejigged to make the characters as likeable as they would eventually become. Lost could erase, like, half the episodes from series three. A little work here or there would improve these shows immeasurably. Then again, it’s worth pointing out that this rarely works. Creators have retroactively buggered about with their work before, but all the notable examples are from film and music. George Lucas going back and slathering the original Star Wars trilogy in godawful CGI was little short of a crime against culture. Francis Ford Coppola’s Apocalypse Now Redux is an objectively worse film than the original, a masterpiece of botched structure and abandoned vision. Let It Be is nothing like the best Beatles album, but Let It Be Naked is woeful. And when Kanye West refused to stop tinkering with The Life of Pablo long after its release, he was effectively taking a hammer to songs that people already loved. There is an argument – a strong and clear argument – to leave things alone once they’re done, however well they turned out. But this might still work. The Arrested Development remix might be the comedy equivalent of the Blade Runner Director’s Cut; the moment when a flawed piece of work suddenly clicks into place. And, if it isn’t, there’s always series five to look forward to. And if that’s still a mess, we always have series two. For the love of God, nobody mess around with series two."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/30/amber-rudd-theresa-may-lost-job-home-secretary-obsession-removals-home-office-investigated","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T08:36:45Z","webTitle":"May has cost Rudd her job – but we haven’t seen the last of her | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/30/amber-rudd-theresa-may-lost-job-home-secretary-obsession-removals-home-office-investigated","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/30/amber-rudd-theresa-may-lost-job-home-secretary-obsession-removals-home-office-investigated","fields":{"headline":"May has cost Rudd her job – but we haven’t seen the last of her","bodyText":"The Home Office has long been the valley of the shadow of death. Even Amber Rudd’s ability and closeness to Theresa May could not protect her from a policy that her prime minister had insisted she enforce and defend. By Sunday night, the only victor was the English language. “We don’t have targets for removals” crashed head-on into “a target of achieving 12,800 enforced removals”. It was no contest. Rudd was a popular and able minister. Her supporters have been grasping at linguistic niceties. They protested that ambitions and aims were not targets, that local was not national, and that ministers could not read every email. But the Windrush scandal has made the entire removals policy toxic. Politics has a way of wiping slates clean. It shouts: “You are responsible – go.” May must have known from the start that Rudd’s statement to the home affairs committee last week was untrue. Immigration targets were her policy and removals were built into them. Targets of all sorts were her obsession. She campaigned on them at two general elections. She lived and breathed them. Their populist appeal enabled her to survive at the Home Office longer than anyone this century. Now they have come back to haunt her and she must, in some shape or form, answer for them, as she gazes at the wreck she has made of her friend’s career. The prime duty of a new home secretary – and it should be explicit – is to end the “hostile environment” specifically to encourage removals, which is a separate target from immigration. As anyone with experience of its hostility will attest, it employed bureaucratic persecution – in effect flagrant maladministration – as a way of getting rid of so-called “low-hanging fruit”. That such Kafkaesque devices should be used by British civil servants goes far beyond “policy”. Not just ministers but Home Office officials have also indulged in unprofessional and unethical behaviour. They should be investigated. May has now lost a key supporter as she approaches the most delicate year of her already delicate time in office. Home secretaries can be replaced, but Rudd was more important to May as a leading backer of “flexible” Brexit. Within the year, there has to be a showdown over some form of customs union. There is no alternative and no evidence that a rejection of open borders with the EU is what the public wants. Yet May appears trapped, almost mesmerised, by the Brexit wing of her cabinet and parliamentary party. Rudd’s resignation could yet be seen as a move from headquarters to rally May’s troops at the parliamentary front in the storms that lie ahead. British politics is almost impossible to read, but I sense we have not seen the last of Amber Rudd. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/30/windrush-scandal-institutional-racism-amber-rudd-discrimination-black-britons","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T08:08:04Z","webTitle":"The Windrush scandal is institutional racism, pure and simple | Hugh Muir","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/30/windrush-scandal-institutional-racism-amber-rudd-discrimination-black-britons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/30/windrush-scandal-institutional-racism-amber-rudd-discrimination-black-britons","fields":{"headline":"The Windrush scandal is institutional racism, pure and simple","bodyText":"The home secretary is politically dead: long live the home secretary. Amber Rudd having sinned, and having in recent days performed her duty as a lightning rod for a perennially sinful prime minister, has been cast aside. Her successor will seek to draw the line on Windrush. The prime minister, as far as she is able, will huddle down in her safe room. The basic narrative in this disturbing soap opera is so gripping and fast-moving that we risk missing the underlying themes and lessons. One is that today, the cost-benefit analysis ratio of government changed. Rudd may claim to have known nothing about the migrant deportation targets – and if that is so, her own position damned her as unfit to do the job – but we know for sure that some officials in her department knew of the policy and the disproportionate effect it was having on black Britons of long-standing and positive contribution. Someone did the cost-benefit analysis and decided that the risk that the Windrush victims would be in a position to make a fuss, or that anyone would help them or listen to them, was outweighed by the benefit of making a government hurtling towards Brexit, with an immigration-fixated prime minister, look tough. That calculation, having cost Rudd her job and any pretensions she may have had to lead her party, will now be revised. The Windrush victims did make a fuss, people – alerted by our own reporter Amelia Gentleman – did help them. And the public did listen. Today’s Commons debate was triggered by a protest petition that quickly amassed 100,000 signatures. In terms of community cohesion, this is good news. Not perhaps the unequivocal embrace of diverse Britain some would like, but a clear indication that an argument abut fairness, properly framed, can supersede even the post-Brexit vote hostility to difference. Whitehall might bear that in mind before embarking again on schemes to further disadvantage the disadvantaged. But now might also be a moment to think about how we got here. On the 25th anniversary of the death of Stephen Lawrence, it is worth pondering on what William Macpherson said in part two of his inquiry about institutional racism. It’s the most controversial element of his findings. People who like the rest, about dodgy coppers and vicious cowardly killers, tend to shy away from, or become hostile to, his warning that otherwise good people, unwittingly biased, can in their collective actions disadvantage and discriminate against people of colour. There is, I think, a deliberate misunderstanding from individuals and pundits who cry: “How dare you call me racist!” The then-commissioner of the Metropolitan police, Paul Condon, at the Lawrence inquiry itself, refused to accept the phenomenon might apply to his force. Just recently, one of the most senior officers in the Lawrence case again dismissed the idea of collective institutional bias as rubbish. But to look at the Windrush scandal is to vividly see institutional racism at work. Theresa May, Rudd, Brandon Lewis, who admits he did know of the deportation targets, all the officials involved; they may be good people. They may have good intentions. They may, in part, be liberal in intent. But together they pursued and defended a policy that in its application, discriminated – not wholly but in large measure – against black Britons. Their lack of empathy or care at worst, lack of peripheral vision at best, resulted in what is pretty much a textbook example of institutional racism from the department that commissioned Macpherson in the first place. Given the convulsions, there will almost certainly be an inquiry into Windrush and by following the paper trail, we should pretty easily be able to find out exactly what has happened. But that will not be enough. Behind the scandal were questionable philosophies, assumptions and attitudes, and it is those we need to unearth. • Hugh Muir is associate editor of Guardian Opinion"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/30/coalitions-energy-guarantee-modelling-assumes-liddell-power-plant-retired-by-2023","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T18:00:19Z","webTitle":"Coalition's energy guarantee: modelling assumes Liddell power plant retired by 2023","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/30/coalitions-energy-guarantee-modelling-assumes-liddell-power-plant-retired-by-2023","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/30/coalitions-energy-guarantee-modelling-assumes-liddell-power-plant-retired-by-2023","fields":{"headline":"Coalition's energy guarantee: modelling assumes Liddell power plant retired by 2023","bodyText":"Technical work undertaken for the Turnbull government’s national energy guarantee assumes the ageing Liddell power plant will be out of the system by 2023 – a development that will help drive the emissions reduction requirements of the Coalition’s new energy policy. While the Turnbull government has applied extraordinary public pressure to AGL Energy to extend the operating life of Liddell, including encouraging the Hong Kong-owned Alinta Energy to make an offer for the asset, technical work done for the Neg suggests retirement is already factored into the new system. The 58-page modelling work conducted for the Energy Security Board on the Neg, obtained by Guardian Australia, says Liddell’s retirement is one of three factors material to whether the proposed emissions reduction target for the electricity sector of 26% below 2005 levels by 2030 can be met. The other two factors are falling demand forecasts and the entry of a large proportion of renewable energy capacity already contracted into the system. The modelling did not examine the impact of plant upgrades as a mechanism to meet the emissions reduction target because of time constraints. The modelling, done by Frontier Economics, indicates that no new coal enters the system either under the Neg, or on a business-as-usual scenario, and the Neg will drive a rising share of renewables at the expense of coal, which is forecast to fall from 73% of output in 2020 to 60% in 2030. While the government has been keen to highlight the risks of rising power prices for consumers in the event Liddell exits the system, the modelling, which assumes the power plant retires, says wholesale energy prices under the Neg will be 30% lower than under business as usual by 2030. It says the lower prices forecast as a consequence of the Neg “reflect the combination of policy certainty and a more competitive bidding process in the spot market from a higher level of contracting under the guarantee”. It suggests Liddell’s retirement after 2022 will reduce supply, which will increase prices, but the government’s policy mechanism will ameliorate at least some of the negative consequences. The modelling suggests the Neg will ensure a smoother transition than in a business as usual scenario “as bidding from existing dispatchable plant is more competitive under the guarantee” – with the policy leading to price reductions when the impact is measured over the decade. The modelling emerged after AGL Energy confirmed on Monday it had received a non-binding and “highly conditional” $250m cash offer from Alinta and its Hong Kong-based owner, Chow Tai Fook Enterprises, for the Liddell power station and site. Despite months of public pressure from the government, AGL has made it clear it does not want to sell the ageing plant. The company wants to close the facility and replace it with a mix of renewables, batteries, gas power, upgraded coal power and demand response. After it received the bid from Alinta on Monday, AGL told the ASX that “no assurance can be given that any transaction will result from the offer”. “AGL has not sought to sell the Liddell power station as it requires Liddell to provide energy to its customers until 2022 and for repurposing as part of its NSW generation plan post 2022,” the company said in a statement. Alinta has signalled it is interested in a quick acquisition, and has tried to sweeten its offer by signalling it would be happy to sell power back to AGL to allow it to proceed with its own transition plans. The company is interested in expanding its market share in New South Wales. While both the competition watchdog and the Australian Energy Market Operator have argued that more competition in the NSW energy market would be beneficial to consumers, the federal government has no power to force AGL to do anything with the asset it acquired from the state government in 2014."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/30/scott-morrison-refuses-to-guarantee-budget-surpluses-of-at-least-1-gdp","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T08:45:50Z","webTitle":"Scott Morrison refuses to guarantee budget surpluses of at least 1% GDP","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/30/scott-morrison-refuses-to-guarantee-budget-surpluses-of-at-least-1-gdp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/30/scott-morrison-refuses-to-guarantee-budget-surpluses-of-at-least-1-gdp","fields":{"headline":"Scott Morrison refuses to guarantee budget surpluses of at least 1% GDP","bodyText":"Scott Morrison has refused to guarantee that the government will run budget surpluses of at least 1% of GDP, leaving room open to grant larger personal income tax cuts in the May budget. With a dramatic improvement in revenues allowing the government to increase infrastructure spending and ditch the planned $8bn Medicare levy increase, the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, has accused the government of attempting a “desperate pre-election cash splash”. At a doorstop in Canberra on Monday, Morrison said the budget would be “very responsible” and the government had been “very cautious in our forecast”. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Deloitte Access economics’ budget monitor found that the company tax take has risen by $36.2bn since this time last year and income tax is $10.6bn higher, causing the rolling annual cash deficit to shrink by $15.4bn in the last four months alone. Asked if the government would stick to its commitment of budget surpluses of at least 1% of GDP in the medium term, the treasurer said the budget’s trajectory would be set by “ensuring taxes do not rise more than 23.9% of the economy”. “Ensuring that you have a guard rail on how much you tax and having a clear understanding of how much you can spend, that is how you manage a budget and stay in the middle,” he said. While the government still plans to return to surplus in 2020-21, Morrison made no commitment as to the size of planned surpluses, promising only that 10-year projections would be included in the 8 May budget. Morrison warned that Labor’s pledges at the 2016 election would have resulted in taxes rising to 25.7% of the economy, the highest in Australian history. In addition to confirming the Coalition’s commitment to the second tranche of the 10-year company tax package, the budget is expected to contain income tax cuts which the Australian Financial Review has reported will start slow and rise over the decade. Morrison was also asked if the government had discussed holding the superannuation guarantee at 9.5% rather than allowing it to rise to 12%. Both the revenue and services minister, Kelly O’Dwyer and the Grattan Institute warned that raising it to 12% would hurt wages and could also hurt low-income earners’ retirement savings. Morrison deflected the question, saying he would not go into deliberations of the cabinet or government. He said the superannuation guarantee “hasn’t been an issue that we have been proposing any changes to”, without stating what level was preferred. In a statement the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said Morrison’s remarks suggested the Turnbull government had “waved the white flag on budget repair”. “As [Deloitte Access Economics’] Chris Richardson says, the rivers of gold are running again and yet we are set to see another budget where a 1% of GDP surplus will be nowhere to be seen,” he said. With the Coalition seeking to cast Labor as the party of high taxes at the next election, Shorten has has sought to set the test of the 2018 budget as its commitment to funding services. At a speech to the McKell Institute in Sydney, the opposition leader said there had been a a “marvellous surge in revenue, a tremendous improvement to the bottom line, just in the nick of time for a desperate pre-election cash splash”. He said what really counted was “not what the budget does for the job security of a prime minister and a treasurer ... it’s what a budget does for your family and for our nation”. “Does it invest in your child’s school? Your daughter’s university? Your son’s Tafe? Does it guarantee that you can afford to see a doctor when your loved one needs to?” Shorten said Labor was committed to social spending because there was “a dividend from this investment in our fellow Australians”. Labor planned to pay for these commitments by targeting tax concessions such as negative gearing, which redistributed national income against the interests of the less well off, he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/30/a-comedian-is-being-held-to-higher-standards-than-the-president","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T08:00:15Z","webTitle":"A comedian is being held to higher standards than the President! | First Dog on the Moon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/30/a-comedian-is-being-held-to-higher-standards-than-the-president","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/30/a-comedian-is-being-held-to-higher-standards-than-the-president","fields":{"headline":"A comedian is being held to higher standards than the President!","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/30/kent-and-surrey-braced-for-a-months-rain-in-one-day","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T16:15:38Z","webTitle":"Man dies in Ramsgate harbour as heavy rain batters England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/30/kent-and-surrey-braced-for-a-months-rain-in-one-day","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/30/kent-and-surrey-braced-for-a-months-rain-in-one-day","fields":{"headline":"Man dies in Ramsgate harbour as heavy rain batters England","bodyText":"A man died on Monday after being washed off a harbour wall in Ramsgate, Kent, as strong winds and heavy rain battered parts of Britain. Kent police said they were called to the scene in the Royal Harbour, Ramsgate, at around 11.30am on Monday reacting to reports three people were in the water. A force spokeswoman said: “Three men were recovered from the water, but one was later pronounced dead at the scene. The other two were taken to hospital for treatment. The death is not being treated as suspicious. Inquiries are ongoing to identify next of kin.” It came as Kent and Surrey were forecast to receive more than a month’s worth of rain and as swaths of the country faced a cold, wet and windy start to the week. The windy, wet weather affected east, south-east and central England, the Met Office said. It warned of floods, power cuts and damage to trees and other structures. Temperatures were expected to remain low with a high of 8C (46F) forecast for London, 12C in Manchester and 6C in Norwich. Nearly 40 “be prepared” flood alerts were active on Monday afternoon, mostly for south-east England, while two “flooding is expected” warnings were in force in north-east England and Anglia. “It’s the south-east portion of the UK that will be getting the worst of the weather,” the Met Office meteorologist Becky Mitchell said. The North Downs between Kent and Surrey could receive up to 80mm of rain, compared with the April average for the area of 50mm. In the Channel, force nine gales and rough seas were delaying shipping, with P&amp;O Ferries reporting three-hour delays in departures from Dover. Flooding at the Crooked Billet underpass in Walthamstow, north London, caused long delays for rush-hour motorists and one lane remained closed, Transport for London said. Pictures posted online showed fallen trees blocking roads in London, with tree surgeons disposing of one that had crashed through a wall in Ealing. A man was trapped when a tree fell on to his car in Herne Bay, Kent. Firefighters cut the roof off the vehicle before the man received treatment from medical staff, Kent fire and rescue service said. In Southampton, the Essex and Hampshire cricket teams took to the pitch at the Ageas Bowl wearing woolly hats, watched by just a smattering of fans. Clare Dinnis, the flood duty manager for the Environment Agency, said: “Widespread heavy rain from Sunday evening and through Monday could lead to flooding from surface water and rivers in parts of south, south-east and central England. Strong winds will also lead to large waves and spray in exposed coastal areas and we encourage people to take care in these locations.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/01/finals-narratives-carry-a-league-beyond-ordinary-football","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T22:02:17Z","webTitle":"Finals narratives carry A-League beyond ordinary football | Jonathan Howcroft","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/01/finals-narratives-carry-a-league-beyond-ordinary-football","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/01/finals-narratives-carry-a-league-beyond-ordinary-football","fields":{"headline":"Finals narratives carry A-League beyond ordinary football","bodyText":"Storytelling is at the heart of how we understand the world. Our brains have evolved to mould complex information into convenient narratives, creating and reinforcing themes to establish order among chaos. It’s an important evolutionary device, and explains why the A-League felt so good on the weekend. We were served two compelling tales, each with their own plot twists, emotional hooks, and moments of “did you see that” exhilaration, all heightened by the jeopardy of sudden death. The strength of the narratives carried us beyond what was at times pretty ordinary football, immersing us in a pair of gripping contests that provided a timely reminder why it is we all bother. The finals format is not without its flaws but it guarantees matches with context, making the job of storytelling that much easier. For comparison, only four weeks ago Newcastle Jets hosted Melbourne City for premiership points at a two-thirds empty McDonald Jones Stadium. There was little at stake; the Jets were near guaranteed second place on the ladder, City all but assured of third, and the 90-minutes came and went leaving only a modest footprint. Countless regular season matches suffer a similar fate. The familiarity of just 10 teams breeds contempt, but only in a rare few instances enough to spark a meaningful rivalry (and even then attendances this season point towards having too much of a good thing). How does one begin to sell the third meeting of the season between two also-rans in a competition without the threat of a trapdoor? There are too many run of the mill games devoid of meaningful storylines, it’s so often just football for football’s sake. When there’s a story to tell things begin to change. The anticipation in Newcastle last week rippled through the city like raspberry through ice cream. Friday night couldn’t arrive quickly enough for the latest chapter in this bust to boom adventure. It was about the Jets, sure, but it was becoming something much bigger, it was about the city and the region. Ticket sales begat ticket sales with Lawrie McKinna filling the boots of PT Barnum. There was a story for a community to tap into. Within the master narrative there were subplots aplenty. Were the Jets bold enough to stick to their aggressive game plan? Would Lazarus Boogaard be a lynchpin or a liability? After promising so much for so long could City finally deliver on the big occasion? There was meaning everywhere you cared to look. Ninety minutes later the A-League’s fairytale was one step nearer a fairytale ending. In this landscape Riley McGree’s gobsmacking improvisation soars to even greater heights. Retelling of the goal shouldn’t simply recount the backheel but the situation in which it occurred: an equaliser, in a semi-final, the first in Newcastle in a decade, in front of a rollicking home crowd (phantom attendees of which are likely to emerge in years to come like patrons of the Sex Pistols gig at Manchester’s Lesser Free Trade Hall in 1976). All of that supplementary information is important in how memories crystalise and legends flourish. If the same goal had been scored with a 10th of the TV audience and nothing at stake would it still be so cherished? It matters too that matchwinner Jason Hoffman is a Novocastrian, that striker Roy O’Donovan was pilfered from local rivals, and that club icon Joel Griffiths was responsible for his recruitment. These threads all contribute to the rich tapestry of what a football club is and how it can connect with fans on a level outsiders could never comprehend. The Big Blue is one of the few contests that requires little augmentation. Sydney v Melbourne is spicy enough in any discipline, but throw in the recent history between the two largest swinging appendages in Australian football and you have a barn waiting to burn. On Saturday this was heightened by an unfamiliar status imbalance. Back-to-back premiers Sydney FC did not shy away from suggestions they could be the greatest A-League outfit of all time. Melbourne Victory, fourth after the home and away season and battling an eight-match streak without a win over the Sky Blues, found themselves in the unfamiliar role of underdog, a perception reinforced when Rhys Williams succumbed to injury during the pre-match warm-up. But the hardship only steeled the resolve with Victory somehow overcoming two own goals to record one of the greatest victories in the club’s history. As the A-League collectively regroups in readiness for some degree of change we have been offered a tantalizing glimpse at how bright the future could be. We just need to find the right stories to tell."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/live/2018/apr/30/sainsburys-asda-merger-biggest-supermarket-tsb-banking-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T16:14:12Z","webTitle":"Sainsbury and Asda agree merger, but MPs warn that jobs are at risk - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/apr/30/sainsburys-asda-merger-biggest-supermarket-tsb-banking-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2018/apr/30/sainsburys-asda-merger-biggest-supermarket-tsb-banking-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Sainsbury and Asda agree merger, but MPs warn that jobs are at risk - as it happened","bodyText":"Time for a recap: Sainsbury’s is on track to become Britain’s biggest supermarket after agreeing a deal with Asda’s owner, Walmart. Under the deal, Walmart will own 42% of the combined company, which will control around a third of supermarket revenues. The two companies have agreed that prices could fall by up to 10% on some popular items if the deal is approved. They have also pledged not to close stores or lay off store staff - however, analysts believe some stores will be sold off to rivals. My colleague Sarah Butler explains: The merger of the UK’s second and third largest retailers is expected to trigger a major inquiry which analysts predict will result in at least 75 stores having to be disposed of. It would be the biggest shake-up in the market since the merger of Morrison and Safeway in 2003 when dozens of stores changed hands. Sainsbury’s takeover of Asda is not expected to complete until the second half of next year as regulators crunch the numbers on potential overlap between the two groups’ stores. Mike Coupe, the Sainsbury’s chief executive who plans to lead the merged business, said the deal was a “transformational opportunity to create a new force in UK retail, which will be more competitive and give customers more of what they want now and in the future”. Shares in Sainsbury’s have surged 15% today, closing at their highest level since the summer of 2014. MPs have warned that the deal could cost jobs, hurt competition, and lead to store closures - despite Sainsbury and Asda’s promises. Labour are calling for an full, urgent probe into the deal. Government minister Andrew Griffiths, though, has argued that the retail sector is going through tough times - and that Sainsbury and Asda are trying to get ahead of the curve. In banking, TSB customers are still struggling to access their accounts after more than a week of disruption. Lloyds Bank has also suffered from IT gremlins today, with some users unable to get its app to work. The Treasury Committee has announced that it will question TSB’s chief, Paul Pester, on Wednesday. That’s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Back in the City, shares in Sainsbury have closed 15% higher, as traders welcome its proposed takeover of Asda. That adds some £858m to Sainsbury’s market capitalisation, pushing it up to £6.78bn. Asked again about the future of stores, minister Andrew Griffiths repeats that Sainsbury and Asda are pledging that no stores will close, and no jobs within stores will be lost. But Labour MP Justin Madders isn’t convinced - he says workers will pay the price of the £500m of efficiency savings planned under the deal. Q: Attacks on terms and conditions are inevitable; what will the minister do in two years when that has happened? Griffiths replies that his powers were laid out in the Enterprise Act 2002 -- the decision on whether to allow the deal now rests with the CMA. And that’s the end of the urgent question. Jack Dromey MP, a former top official at the Unite union, tells the House that supermarkets are powerful, as employers and across their supply chains. They must not be allowed to abuse that power, Dromey tells fellow MPs. Does the minister understand the “dismay” among employees about this deal, which came “out of the blue” at the weekend. Dromey accuses Griffiths of ‘waxing lyrical’ about Sainsbury and Asda’s promises (for example...); will he act to ensure that these are not just Day One guarantees, but can be counted on in years to come? Griffiths replies that it is ‘early days’, and points out that the current government brought in the Groceries Code Adjudicator to protect farmers and other suppliers. Q: How long will workers and customers face uncertainty over this deal, and what impact will this have on portfolio investment? Andrew Griffiths says that Sainsbury and Asda hope the CMA will hold a ‘fast-track’ review. If that happens, then the detailed Phase 2 investigation could be completed in six months. Labour MP Susan Elan Jones asks a straight question -- does the minister think this is a good deal or a bad deal for British farming? But she doesn’t get a straight answer. Minister Andrew Griffiths says the deal must be considered by the shareholders of Asda and Sainsbury’s – so it’s not appropriate for the government to pass judgement. Labour’s Chris Matheson is also worried that jobs will be lost among the distribution chain that serve Sainsbury and Asda stores today. Matheson points out that many distribution centres were sighted to replace lost manufacturing jobs; what guarantees can the government give to those “difficult areas”? Andrew Griffiths says his constituency, Burton, contains some distribution jobs (it’s in the middle of the country). However, he makes two points: First of all... the number of supermarkets served will be the same if the deal goes through, so the number of lorries and goods will be the same Second, the issue of job losses is not one that the government can consider under the Enterprise Act. Philip Hollobone, Conservative MP for Kettering, says his constituency currently has a large Sainsbury’s and a large Asda. Workers and shoppers want to know - will we still have both stores in two years time? In reply, minister Andrew Griffiths says that Kettering shoppers and workers want to know they have choice and competition, and that those jobs are protected. If they are both “thriving supermarkets”, either the CMA will decide there isn’t a competition issue and allow the combined company to keep running both, or it will say there are competition issues, and one will be sold, Griffiths explains. Conservative MP Stephen Kerr says the concentration of supermarket power could have a “potentially devastating effect” on suppliers. Will their voices be heard? Griffiths replies that suppliers will be included in the CMA’s investigation. The CMA will consider what happens in constituencies where there currently Sainsbury and Asda stores close together, Andrew Griffiths says. If they believe it will be anti-competitive for both supermarkets to be there, they will force a sale to a competitor. Conservative MP Mark Menzies says he worked in Asda’s head office for 11 years. He doesn’t believe “that place” will be there in a few years, so there’s no point the government trying to make promises about jobs. Menzies also criticises the government for calling the deal a merger - it’s a takeover by Sainsbury’s, he insists, so “lets stop using false terminology”. Finally, Menzies urges the government to protect workers in distribution centres across the country; otherwise, they will be “absolutely hammered” if this deal goes ahead. In response, Andrew Griffiths says it is a merger legally. There will be efficiency savings, he says, but Sainsbury and Asda have assured the government that they will continue to operate as different businesses. Labour’s Rachel Reeves says workers at Asda’s headquarters in Leeds (in her constituency) will be ‘incredibly concerned about their future’ given the lack of assurances about jobs. Q: The industrial strategy is about rebalancing the economy away from London - what assurances can the government give that this deal won’t rebalance jobs away from Yorkshire? Business minister Andrew Griffiths points out that many high street names have been lost in recent years, due to the changing retail climate [ie, competition from Amazon] Today’s deal shows “two businesses trying to get ahead of the curve and future-proof themselves in a vey challenging market” he adds. That’s quite an endorsement from the government bench - Sainsbury’s and Asda must be delighted. Labour MP Hilary Benn asks whether jobs are at risk at Sainsbury’s headquarters. Minister Andrew Griffiths says he doesn’t yet have any reassurances, beyond the promise that both company’s HQs will be kept open. Conservative MP Robert Halfon suggests that Sainsbury’s could break its commitment not to eliminate store workers, once the merger has gone through. Griffiths encourages Halfon to engage with the CMA and both companies over his concerns. Conservative MP Andrew Selous says his Dunstable constituency has an Asda and a Sainsbury’s close to each other, with a clutch of other supermarket outlets - and an Amazon fulfillment centre - close by. What might the Competition and Markets Authority think about this situation? The honourable member is spoiled for choice, minister Andrew Griffiths replies. Over in parliament, the government is facing an urgent question on the Sainsbury-Asda deal. Labour’s Rebecca Long Bailey is putting the question now, asking whether the deal will lead to job cuts. She also warns that the merger will “radically alter the whole grocery sector”, affecting suppliers and farmers as well as customers and staff. The government urgently needs to needs to broaden out the public interest test applied to takeover teals, Long Bailey says, to protect these people. Business minister Andrew Griffiths responds, saying he has spoken to the CEOs of Sainsbury and Asda this morning, and told them that it was important to treat suppliers fairly. Griffiths tells the House that he told the companies the important of engaging with the unions..... and that he had received assurances that both head offices will remain open. But... Griffiths also points out that the retail sector is in a period of huge flux - the way people are shopping is changing fast, so retailers must change and adapt. Griffiths also cited Sainsbury’s claim that prices will be cut, by up to 10% for popular items. Retail analyst Mark Brumby has a few thoughts on the Sainsbury-Asda deal: You can usually rely on the Bank of England’s chief economist for an eye-catching speech with a few choice quotes. And today, Andy Haldane has argued that music streaming site Spotify and online game World Of Warcraft can teach economists a few lessons on how to handle data. To be honest, Haldane actually made these comments more than a week ago, to King’s College Business School. But the Bank of England has only just released the text, so they’re worth looking at now. Haldane’s theme is “Big Data”, and the way that central bankers can use the explosion of data in recent years to get a better picture of the economy’s moving parts. He says that a major breakthrough is close: In time, it is possible these sorts of data could help to create a real-time map of financial and activity flows across the economy, in much the same way as is already done for flows of traffic or information or weather. Once mapped, there would then be scope to model and, through policy, modify these flows. This is an idea I first talked about six years ago. Today, it looks closer than ever to being within our grasp. Haldane argued that behavioural economists could explore “non-traditional means” when trying to forecast how people will behave.... To give one recent example, data on music downloads from Spotify has been used, in tandem with semantic search techniques applied to the words of songs, to provide an indicator of people’s sentiment. Intriguingly, the resulting index of sentiment does at least as well in tracking consumer spending as the Michigan survey of consumer confidence. And why stop at music? People’s tastes in books, TV and radio may also offer a window on their soul. So too might their taste in games. Indeed, I am interested in the potential for using gaming techniques, not just to extract data on people’s preferences, but as a means of generating data on preferences and actions. Haldane also suggests that today’s massive multiplayer online games could work as a sandbox for economists to examine behaviour -- to aid forecasting the next time there’s a crisis. A gaming environment could be used to understand behaviour in a way which placed fewer restrictions. People’s behaviour would be observed directly in the act of game-playing which, provided this behaviour was a reasonable reflection of true behaviour, would give us new data. Because this is a virtual rather than real world, with shocks controlled and regulated, that could make it easier to address issues of causality and identification in response to shocks, including policy shocks. There are already multi-person games with primitive economies attached to them, which allow goods and monies to change hands between participants. These include EVE Online and World of Warcraft. The speech is online here. The Press Association have published a Q&amp;A on the Sainsbury-Asda deal. Q: What will it mean for shop prices? The two supermarket giants have pledged to invest the cost efficiencies generated from the merger into lower prices. Sainsbury’s expects to save £500m from merging with Asda, and has said it will lower shop prices by 10% on everyday products. However, this could have more widespread implications for shop prices if discounters Aldi and Lidl decide to cut their prices even further to stay ahead of their main-market rivals. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The executives of other supermarkets will have their heads in their hands at the prospect of another price war.” Q: What will it mean for stores? The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will soon start its investigation of the proposed merger, raising the prospect that Sainsbury’s and Asda will be forced to sell off stores if they directly compete in local areas. However, Sainsbury’s insisted on Monday that it does not expect to shut any stores. The supermarket says its store footprint is more focused on the south, and Asda has more stores in the north. Q: What will happen to Argos? Sainsbury’s bought Argos in 2016 and already has more than 200 Argos outlets within its supermarkets, having rapidly expanded over the past year. It is expected that Argos will now start appearing in Asda’s stores, with Sainsbury’s chief executive Mike Coupe saying this morning that the deal “brings scale in clothing and general merchandise”. Q: Why are the two companies joining forces now? All retailers are having to take drastic action to stay competitive during a critical time for the sector. With Amazon eyeing up the UK food market with its Amazon Fresh delivery service, food retailers will be nervous about its sprawling logistics network and buying power. Sainsbury’s and Asda also have to fend off price competition from Aldi and Lidl. As a value supermarket, Asda has been under significant pressure as the German discounters have grown their market share. Tesco’s recent merger with wholesaler Booker Group, which was cleared with minimal fuss by the CMA, will also have given executives at Sainsbury’s and Asda confidence about the possibility of joining forces. TSB chief Paul Pester has warmed up for his looming parliamentary grilling by updating MPs about the bank’s IT crisis. He’s written to Nicky Morgan MP, answering her questions about the technology failings. Pester says the TSB have launched a “proactive customer redress programme”, to meet his pledge that no customers are left out of pocket. He also claims that TSB has made significant progress in bring its internet banking and mobile app back into use, saying On Monday 23rd April we were only able to serve c.200,000 sessions via our website versus an expected level of c.450,000. As of Thursday 26th April, we were able to serve c.450,000. This is consistent with the number of sessions we would expect to serve. On Monday 23rd April approximately 72% of customers attempting to access the mobile app were successful on first attempt. As of Friday 27th April this had risen to approximately 93%. This is typical of the proportion we would have seen pre-migration. Pester also confirms that more than 400 customers saw another customer’s account details - because the two accounts were linked: TSB, like many other banks, enable customers to nominate a third party to have access to their accounts - these are called nominee accounts. Typically this will be a parent having access to a child’s account or a grown-up child managing an ageing parent’s account. The ability for the third party to see the customer’s account information is usually limited to branch and telephony channels. However, on the evening of Sunday 22nd April access was provided via digital channels. In addition, as well as enabling the third party to see the customer’s data, the customer was able to see the third party’s data. Therefore, in the “parent and child” example, the parent could see the child’s transaction data but the child could also see the parent’s transaction data. This explains some of the comments in social media where customers expecting to be overdrawn (the “child”) could see large credit balances (the “parent”). No personal data was visible, just account balance data. Finally, Pester also admits that customers faced an average wait of one hour if they tried to phone TSB a week ago; by Thursday, this had dropped to 30 minutes (although some customers have reported much longer waits). The full letter is online here. Get the popcorn in! Britain’s Treasury Committee will be grilling Paul Pester, TSB’s chief executive, and the bank’s chairman Richard Meddings, on Wednesday. The committee will demand answers about exactly how TSB’s IT systems collapsed more than a week ago, and how they will compensate affected customers. Committee chair Nicky Morgan MP says: “The Treasury Committee is extremely concerned by the problems at TSB, and by the apparent miscommunication to customers about the extent and nature of these problems. “It’s been reported that services such as online banking have been down for some TSB customers for over a week. Many individuals and businesses will have made arrangements for the planned outage, but not for the additional time that the systems have been unavailable. “We will take evidence from TSB and Sabadell representatives to find out how they got into this mess, who is responsible, and how they are putting it right.” Just in: The Labour Party are calling for an urgent investigation into the Sainsbury-Asda merger. Rebecca Long Bailey MP, Labour’s Shadow Business Secretary, says the deal has “significant competition risks”, and the Competition and Markets Authorities must take a proper look (ie, a phase 2 investigation) Long Bailey says the CMA must secure “concrete assurances.” to protect workers and suppliers. “There are risks to jobs by potential reorganisation and store closures and risks to the wider grocery industry as a Tesco/Sainsbury’s-Asda duopoly emerges with unrivalled power to dominate, dictating choice and prices for consumers which in time may prove detrimental. “This unrivalled power also poses immense risk to suppliers with unprecedented bargaining power to drive suppliers prices and payment terms down which could cause instability and damage to the food and grocery manufacturing industry. The IT crisis at TSB Bank has dragged into its second week. Some customers are still unable to get into their accounts, 10 days after TSB tried to migrate to a new technology platform. Experts from IBM have been working at TSB since last Thursday, to try to get its Internet banking and mobile app online. But clearly the ‘meltdown’ isn’t over, given these tweets from UK businesses and retail customers: Alarmingly, TSB isn’t the only bank facing complaints today. Lloyds Bank (which spun out TSB in 2013) has suffered ‘intermittent’ problems this morning. Its Halifax division is also caught up in the outage, as these tweets show: News of Sainsbury’s tie-up with Asda has driven Britain’s stock market to its highest level since the start of February. The FTSE 100 has gained 37 points, or 0.5%, to 7539 this morning. Sainsbury’s is leading the way, up 17% at a four-year high right now. Advertising giant WPP is close behind, gaining 8% after reporting better-than-expected results this morning, and saying it could sell some assets. David Madden of CMC Markets says: Sainsbury’s shares are up 15% after the company announced plans to merge with Asda. The move is subject to regulatory approval, but should it go ahead it would be worth £7.3 billion. Increased competition from Aldi and Lidl is main motivation behind the proposed deal. The deep-discounters have disrupted the UK supermarket sector severely, and now have a combined market share of approximately 12%. Sainsbury’s and Asda are the second and third-largest supermarkets by market share, and should the deal go ahead, it would put them in first place. Sainsbury’s predict it will save £500 million through synergies. The retailer also updated the market with its full-year figures, as underlying pre-tax profits rose by 1.4% to £589 million, which was comfortably ahead of the £559 million expected. WPP shares are in demand this morning after it released better-than-expected sales figures, while the advertising giant also stated a strategic review was underway. First-quarter net sales dropped by 0.1%, while analysts had expected a decline of 1%. The company also said it would take a ‘fresh look’ at business in light of Sir Martin Sorrell stepping down earlier this month. There is talk WPP could spin off assets, but nothing has been confirmed, and no timeline has been stated. Simran Jagdev, companies analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, says Sainsbury’s decision to tie-up with Asda is a surprise, partly prompted by the threat of Amazon: The deal points to the highly competitive UK grocery market, which has long been concentrated in the hands of the top four players— Tesco, Sainsbury, Asda, Morrisons - but is now facing an onslaught from new challengers. Sainsbury’s seems to be continuing the offensive against online players such as Amazon and discount grocery retailers such as Aldi and Lidl that Tesco started last year with its merger with Booker. The deal will help Sainsbury fend off this new competition. It will also mark Walmart’s operational exit from the UK, as part of its strategic decisions to instead work through partnerships in international markets. Amisha Chohan, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot, says the deal is a “masterstroke” - as long as the CMA approve it. It would result in the company becoming the biggest grocer in the UK, ahead of Tesco. Its guided net synergies of over £500m seem prudent and we believe it could be significantly in excess of this. Sainsbury’s experience from the Argos acquisition should enable it to deliver ahead of the synergy guidance. Although this news is not ideal for Tesco, we remain positive on the UK’s current largest retailer due its recent takeover of Booker, and the wholesale opportunities this will bring.” Paul Mumford of Cavendish Asset Management believes Sainsbury’s and Asda will be forced to sell some stores to get this deal “through the hoop”: Store disposals could naturally be offered to others in the sector with M+S and Morrisons being the most likely tenants, but it’s hardly the best climate to be a net seller of large retail space. There will of course be some management synergies too, so a proclamation of no job cuts will no doubt be reversed soon enough. This will obviously create a mighty force. But the big questions now are what influence will Walmart have on the group? And where does this leave other players? Sainsburys already has a big challenge to show that the Argos acquisition is bearing fruit, and now it’s faced with driving cost synergies from Asda. The indicated 10% lower prices on regularly bought products will have raised eyebrows amongst the food producers who will fear another squeeze on margins. Britain’s competition watchdog have confirmed they are likely to review the Sainsbury-Asda deal. In a statement, the Competition and Markets Authority says: This merger is likely to be subject to review by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The CMA adds that it will assess whether the merger is bad for customers. During a Phase 1 review, the CMA would assess whether the deal could reduce competition and choice for shoppers. After this first phase, the merger could be cleared or, if a potential reduction in competition is identified, it would be referred for an in-depth, Phase 2 investigation lasting up to 24 weeks - unless the merging parties offered immediate proposals to address any competition concerns identified. The surge in Sainsbury’s shares this morning is a blow to speculators who have been betting against the supermarket. Some major hedge funds have been ‘shorting’ Sainsbury’s shares recently, by selling borrowed shares and hoping to buy them back cheaper in future. That bet seems to be unravelling, as Sainsbury’s shares hit their highest level in almost four years. As The Times explained this morning: A little over a tenth of Sainsbury’s shares were being shorted going into the weekend, with investors betting on a drop in the supermarket’s share price. Large London-based hedge funds such as Odey Asset Management, GLG and Marshall Wace have short positions in Sainsbury’s amid investor anxiety about the future facing traditional retailers. Andy Brian, head of retail at Gordons law firm, also believes store closure are inevitable if this deal isn’t blocked by the competition authorities: “One thing is clear; despite what is being said officially, stores would have to close. That’s not necessarily a bad thing for the brands, although it would of course be a bad thing for those store employees. Moving forwards, one theory is that this deal could allow Sainsbury’s the freedom to compete hard against M&amp;S Food and Waitrose at the top end of the grocery market and leave Asda to compete further on price against the other mid-market players, as well as Aldi and Lidl. Research group Edison have estimated that around 70 Asda stores could be vulnerable to sale or closure, as they’re rather close to a Sainsbury’s outlet. The Federation of Small Businesses is concerned that small suppliers will be treated roughly if Sainsbury’s and Asda are allowed to form a new retail titan. FSB chairman Mike Cherry says regulators must demand firm commitments before green-lighting the deal, as Sainsbury is already talking about £500m of cost savings and a boost to earnings. “A merger of this size will concentrate a lot of power in the hands of one giant company, and it’s important that power isn’t misused to coerce small suppliers into accepting unfair contracts and poor payment terms. “Those at the top of Sainsbury’s and Asda should explain how they plan to merge these two supply chains fairly, and give reassurance that cost savings won’t be achieved simply by milking their small suppliers for all they’re worth. “When investigating this proposed merger, the Competition and Markets Authority should be looking for cast-iron commitments that a positive standard will be set for working with smaller suppliers. Data firm Allies has created an interactive map, showing exactly where Sainsbury’s and Asda’s stores are today. It also shows Argos outlets (Sainsbury’s acquired Argos in 2016), so it gives a good idea of where there might be competition issues. Here are the vital statistics about today’s merger - showing how a combined Sainsbury’s and Asda will leap-frog Tesco: Sainsbury’s chief executive, Mike Coupe, has been speaking to journalists. He says he’s 100% confident that stores won’t need to close following the merger with Asda. However, the regulators may insist that some stores are sold off. There are scores of places where Sainsbury and Asda stores are close by, giving the combined company a dominant position. Britain’s unions are demanding guarantees for workers at Asda. Tim Roache, general secretary of the GMB, fears that staff at the supermarket will pay the price as Sainsbury pursues the £500m of cost savings promised this morning: “Hundreds of thousands of workers stand to be affected, and all know such announcements tend to be followed by management speak like ‘rationalisation’ in the name of ‘efficiency’. What that usually means is job losses or cuts to pay, terms and conditions which would be wholly unacceptable. Not least because ASDA workers have already voluntarily agreed to change their contracts to be more flexible in order to play their part and help their employer be more profitable.” “It is quite right to be asking now in whose interests this proposed merger is being tabled. Is it workers and customers or the shareholders and speculators not happy with the hundreds of millions they already make in a year?” Roache is also unhappy that the deal leaked over the weekend, leaving staff worried about their future: “Imagine turning up to your Saturday afternoon shifts only to learn this news, with no word from your employer at all - just speculation in the media. Our members are concerned for their futures and angry they’ve been kept in the dark.” “ASDA is hugely profitable supermarket, posting hundreds of millions in profit and backed by hundreds of billions from their US parent company, Walmart. Asda’s success has been built on the back of its workers and it is they who now need and deserve answers and reassurances about their futures - that’s the least they deserve, and the very least their union will be demanding.” This deal will lead to job cuts and a painful squeeze on suppliers, warns John Colley, professor at Warwick Business School. Colley predicts that staff will be “rationalised” (ie, laid off) at Sainsbury and Asda’s headquarters, in their regional management, and in their distribution operations. “Ultimately there has to be job losses and the suppliers will have to pay through lower prices for the larger volumes they may see. Customers will see reduced choice and the current price war is likely to persist. Colley also expects some stores will be sold off to rivals, although the largest supermarkets may not be in demand, and could close instead. He also warns that the task of completing the deal could be a “significant distraction” for both companies. This will not entirely be bad news for the competitors who should make share gains as a consequence.” Richard Lim, chief executive, Retail Economics says this deal would create a powerful new competitor: The combined retail group would create significant scale. It would enable better buying terms, the integration of Argos within Asda and drive operating efficiencies expected to deliver cost-savings of at least £500 million. “If given the green light by the CMA [Competition and Markets Authority], it would be a game changer in the industry. The potential tie-up could deliver price reductions across a range of products, putting it in a position to challenge Tesco and the discounters head-on. That’s why Sainsbury’s shares are going like a rocket this morning, while Tesco is under the cosh. Boom! J Sainsbury’s shares have jumped by 20% at the start of trading, to their highest level since 2014. That’s a huge move, suggesting that the City believes Sainsbury’s is getting an excellent deal -- as long as regulators don’t block the merger with Asda, of course. Shares in rival supermarkets are falling in early trading. Morrisons, currently Britain’s 4th largest supermarket, are down 3% at the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. Tesco is close behind, down 2.5%. Labour MP Barry Sheerman is concerned that this deal will damage competition: Graham Hiscott of the Daily Mirror says the promise of big price cuts will rock the retail sector: Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, reckons the deal is a win-win for Sainsbury and Walmart (which acquired Asda almost 20 years ago) City traders like the sound of this deal.... there’s chatter that Sainsbury’s shares will jump once the stock market opens at 8am. Asda’s CEO, Roger Burnley, is also dangling the promise of price cuts, once his business has been folded into Sainsbury’s: “The combination of Asda and Sainsbury’s into a single retailing group will be great news for Asda customers, allowing us to deliver even lower prices in store and even greater choice. Asda will continue to be Asda, but by coming together with Sainsbury’s, supported by Walmart, we can further accelerate our existing strategy and make our offer even more compelling and competitive. The PR war is already underway, with Sainsbury’s chairman David Tyler arguing that the deal is good for the UK: As one of the largest employers in the country, the combined business will become an even greater contributor to the British economy. The proposal will bring together two of the most experienced and talented management teams in retail at a time when the industry is undergoing rapid change. We welcome Walmart as a significant shareholder and look forward to working closely with them.” A few more key points: The combined company will own more than 2,800 stores (Sainsbury, Asda and Argos), and several of the UK’s most visited retail websites Sainsbury claims the deal will “deliver substantial value creation” for its shareholders. It estimates that earnings per share will grow by “double digits” in the second year after the deal goes through. Asda will continue to be run from Leeds with its own CEO (Roger Burnley), who will join the board of the combined business This deal will deliver cost savings of around £500m per year, Sainsbury’s estimates. That will fuel concerns that jobs will be lost, and suppliers will be squeezed hard. However the company claims that that there are no plans to close stores. Instead, it estimate that “buying benefits, opening Argos in Asda stores and operational efficiencies” will all cut costs. Sainsbury and Asda are promising to cut prices on popular products by up to 10%, if their merger goes through. They claim the deal will: ...enable investment in areas that will benefit customers the most: price, quality, range and creating more flexible ways to shop in stores and through digital channels, across Sainsbury’s, Asda and Argos. We expect to lower prices by around 10% on many of the products customers buy regularly. That’s a very bold commitment; good news for customers, but a real headache for rival retailers. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The big news this morning is that supermarket chains Sainsbury and Asda have just agreed to merge, in the biggest shake-up of Britain’s retail sector in years. The deal will create Britain’s biggest supermarket chain - leapfrogging Tesco - with combined revenues of around £51bn. In a statement released to the City, the two companies claim the merger will be “a great deal” for customers, staff, suppliers and shareholders of both businesses. The retail sector is going through significant and rapid change, as customer shopping habits continue to evolve. This has led to increased competition across grocery, general merchandise and clothing, as customers seek ever greater value, choice and convenience. Bringing Sainsbury’s and Asda together will result in a more competitive and more resilient business that will be better able to invest in price, quality, range and the technology to create more flexible ways for customers to shop. However...it’s likely that suppliers will be worried that they could be squeezed by such a powerful new player. Staff, too, will have a lot of questions -- both in the stores, and in the back-offices and HQs. Regulators will also have questions about whether the merger is in customers’ best interests. Although it’s billed as a merger, Sainsbury’s is in the box seat. The deal values Asda at roughly £7.3bn, and Walmart (Asda’s current owner) will end up owning 42% of the combined business. Walmart are also receiving £2.975bn in cash as part of the deal. More details and reaction to follow....

So Hutton did something which, following the release of the second Gonski report nine years later, is being treated as radical. Hutton abolished year groupings at the school, switching Templestowe College from a traditional “horizontal” structure where students learn based on age groupings to a “vertical” one, where 15-year-olds work alongside 17-year-olds based on their own subject choices and level of ability. The benefits, Hutton says, were dramatic. Enrolments lifted from 300 students in 2010 to 1,009 in 2017, while parent satisfaction and student engagement numbers all rose dramatically. Other unexpected benefits also appeared. Hutton says bullying disappeared from the school in part because competition was taken out of the learning equation. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Templestowe’s story has increased relevance following businessman David Gonski’s call for an end to the “industrial model” of school education and a shift to a curriculum based on “learning progressions” independent of year or age groupings. The states, unions and federal Labor’s education spokeswoman, Tanya Plibersek, have all said that while the call for change is welcome, the increased focus on individual learning proposed in the report will mean the commonwealth will have to lift funding. But Hutton says the opposite is true. He says doing away with year groupings increases efficiency because teachers are no longer required to waste time trying to teach a rigid curriculum to a class full of students at varying developmental levels. It is referred to as “differentiated” teaching in education circles and Hutton says it is a deeply flawed concept. “It’s well supported by research that if you take the top and bottom achieving 10% of kids out of a class you still have an academic span of around five to six years in the middle of most classrooms,” Hutton told the Guardian. “How can one teacher possibly be expected to differentiate to that extent? “Differentiation is something we in the teaching profession have put out there to placate parents [and] on a good day you can do it if you’ve given up your weekend to plan a lesson, but when push comes to shove you teach to the middle and that’s the reality.” But it is not enough to abolish year levels. Hutton points out that simply replacing one level of stratification with another based on ability would formalise the stigma attached to students who find themselves in remedial classes. He says the way to avoid that is to move to an elective curriculum, where students are given responsibility for their own learning. At Templestowe, Hutton allowed students to choose subjects based on their own areas of interest and gave them a broader remit to move through the curriculum at their own speed. That, he says, is also more financially efficient because it allows schools to run classes based on need. “You can basically just run the electives that are financially viable and it frees up teaching resources so that there is greater choice for students,” he said. “Rather than having to run two half-empty year 9 and 10 drama classes, you can run one and redeploy the extra teacher to do theatre studies.” Hutton ended his time at Templestowe last year and now heads up the Future Schools Alliance, an education consultancy firm that is in the process of helping another 50 schools across Australia and New Zealand to roll out his model. And while he thinks the Gonski panel has gotten some things right, he is deeply critical of the review’s terms of reference, which explicitly called for strategies to “improve student outcomes and Australia’s national performance, as measured by national and international assessments”. He said that the focus on literacy and numeracy measures had a detrimental impact on education and said international rankings such as Pisa were “the Olympic Games of education”. “It’s an overly simplistic measure because politicians are obsessed with it because they just want to stand on the podium but it’s just not going to happen,” he said. “Kids aren’t widgets, you can’t tweak them until you get the results you want. We only ever used to be higher up because Pisa measured a smaller group that didn’t include Asian nations. “We’re never going to catch up to countries like Singapore and we shouldn’t try to. “The irony is that countries such as China all look at Australia and laugh at us trying to move up the Pisa rankings while they look back at us trying to imitate our creativity and innovation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/01/melbournes-water-supply-at-risk-due-to-collapse-of-forests-caused-by-logging","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T19:00:20Z","webTitle":"Melbourne's water supply at risk due to 'collapse' of forests caused by logging","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/01/melbournes-water-supply-at-risk-due-to-collapse-of-forests-caused-by-logging","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/01/melbournes-water-supply-at-risk-due-to-collapse-of-forests-caused-by-logging","fields":{"headline":"Melbourne's water supply at risk due to 'collapse' of forests caused by logging","bodyText":"Melbourne’s water supply is at risk because decades of logging and forest loss from large bushfires has triggered the imminent collapse of the mountain ash forests in Victoria’s central highlands, ecologists have said. The Victorian government was warned of the likelihood of ecosystem collapse by Australian National University researches in 2015. New research led by Prof David Lindenmayer of ANU, published in PNAS journal on Tuesday, has found the ecosystem has already begun to undergo a “hidden collapse”. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A hidden collapse meant that while the ecosystem may appear superficially intact, the lag time in recovering old-growth mountain ash forests — the linchpin in preserving mountain ash ecosystems — “means that collapse is almost inevitable”. Even if there were no additional logging and no significant bushfires for the next 50 years, modelling by Lindenmayer and his co-author, Chloe Sato, showed the number of hollow-bearing trees in 2067 would be at best less than 10% than the number of hollow-bearing trees in 1997. The number of hollow-bearing trees had already more than halved since 1997, the modelling showed, while numbers of greater glider had declined 65% and numbers of critically endangered Leadbeater’s possum had halved. Guardian Australia revealed this month that the Victorian forest agency VicForests had begun logging Barjag Flat, a nationally significant hotspot for greater gliders. Lindenmayer said if drastic measures were not immediately taken to halt or greatly reduce native logging operations in mountain ash forests, the forest may not be able to recover from the level of projected collapse in 2067 and would instead be replaced by an open acacia woodland. Either option — a young and growing mountain ash forest or an acacia woodland — would be potentially disastrous for Melbourne’s water supply, he said. The majority of Melbourne’s water catchments are in mountain ash forests, which are either protected in national parks or in state forests where logging is either allowed or has previously occurred. If those forests have been damaged or are still growing, Lindenmayer said, they draw 12 megalitres more water per hectare per year than forests that are more than 100 years old. More than 98% of the mountain ash forest in Victoria is no more than 80 years old, and most of those in key catchment areas are less than 80. In the Upper Thomson catchment, which feeds Melbourne’s largest water supply dam, the Thomson reservoir, about 61% of the trees have been logged. “That’s a serious issue because two-thirds of all the rainfall in that catchment falls on one-third of the area and that’s the ash forest … that’s called an own goal,” Lindenmayer said. “The value of the water that flows into the water catchments is about 25.5 times higher than the value of the timber cut from those same catchments.” An economic analysis published by the Threatened Species Recovery Hub found that economic contribution of the water supply to the Victorian economy was $310m, compared with $12m from the native timber industry. “My hope is that at some stage people will wake up and say, ‘Oh my god, that’s the water supply for 4.5 million Melburnians,’” Lindenmayer said. “Is it appropriate to compromise the water supply of soon-to-be Australia’s largest city?” He said the situation would be worsened if the federal government introduced new Regional Forestry Agreements to replace the rolled-over short-term agreements, which are due to expire in March 2020. “The new RFAs are going to be even more disastrous because what they will do is lock in a guaranteed level of saw long supply … which isn’t really sustainable,” he said. “The RFAs don’t take into account other values like water or tourism ... it’s nonsensical. It doesn’t make any sense to me.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/30/sidelined-china-seeks-to-maintain-influence-as-ties-between-north-korea-and-us-improve","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T06:06:44Z","webTitle":"'Sidelined' China seeks to maintain influence as ties between North Korea and US improve","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/30/sidelined-china-seeks-to-maintain-influence-as-ties-between-north-korea-and-us-improve","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/30/sidelined-china-seeks-to-maintain-influence-as-ties-between-north-korea-and-us-improve","fields":{"headline":"'Sidelined' China seeks to maintain influence as ties between North Korea and US improve","bodyText":"During North and South Korea’s historic summit on Friday, China was notably quiet. Chinese officials and state media focused instead on president Xi Jinping’s meeting with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi and a visit by Xi to China’s Yangtze river. After the summit, China’s ministry of foreign affairs released a short statement saying Beijing “welcomed” the results of the talks. “China stands ready to continue to play its positive role to this end,” it added, according to Xinhua news agency. Then, on Monday, China’s foreign ministry announced it was sending its top diplomat, foreign minister Wang Yi, to visit North Korea this week. The visit comes as China, North Korea’s most powerful ally, moves to reassert itself in quickly moving peace talks with the formerly isolated Korean state. China has long said that North Korea’s nuclear programme is for Washington and Pyongyang to work out between themselves. But now warming ties between North Korea and the US could dramatically alter the power structure in the region, leaving Beijing on the outside. Kim said on Friday he is willing to give up nuclear weapons if the US promises not to invade and commits to a formal end to the Korean War that ended with an armistice in 1953. Kim and US president Donald Trump could meet within the next month. “It can be argued that China has chosen to be ‘sidelined’. However, the quick warm up of [the Pyongyang-Seoul] relationship and possible denuclearisation and reunification could change regional power structures and have long-term impacts on Chinese foreign policy,” said Weiqi Zhang, an assistant professor focusing on North Korea at Suffolk University in Boston. China, which accounts for more than 90% of North Korea’s trade, has seen relations with its communist brother fray over the last several years. When Kim visited Beijing last month for an “unofficial visit” it was the first time the North Korean leader had met Xi. China has implemented crippling sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear bomb and missile tests. In the ongoing talks, China has been relegated to the background. Zhang Liangui, a Korea expert at China’s Central Party School, said this was inevitable. “The stance of China’s foreign ministry has been that [the North Korean nuclear crisis] is none of its business and that North Korea and the US should be communicating directly,” Zhang told the South China Morning Post. “So now things are out of China’s control and it is no surprise that it is being excluded from the discussions.” While talks between North and South Korea and Washington fit China’s interest in stability on the Korean peninsula, Beijing is also worried about an unfavourable regional strategic balance unfolding. “[Beijing] doesn’t want Washington and Pyongyang to get too close, and doesn’t want unification on purely South Korean and US terms,” said Michael Kovrig, a senior adviser for north-east Asia at the International Crisis Group, an independent conflict-prevention organisation. China will still be part of any discussions over a formal peace treaty to replace the armistice signed by China, the US and North Korea in 1953, ending more than three years of fighting between the North and the South. A trilateral summit in May between Japan, South Korea, and China will also provide Beijing another chance to exert influence, according to Kovrig. “Politically, I think China is being careful to give North and South Korea the space to advance the diplomatic process, because that’s in Beijing’s interest. Watching closely and working behind the scenes to position itself,” said Kovrig."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/apr/30/abc-to-cut-20-newsroom-jobs-in-digital-led-restructure","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T03:11:29Z","webTitle":"ABC to cut 20 newsroom jobs in digital-led restructure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/apr/30/abc-to-cut-20-newsroom-jobs-in-digital-led-restructure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/apr/30/abc-to-cut-20-newsroom-jobs-in-digital-led-restructure","fields":{"headline":"ABC to cut 20 newsroom jobs in digital-led restructure","bodyText":"Another 20 journalists will lose their jobs at the ABC as the broadcaster restructures its eight capital-city newsrooms for digital and multi-platform journalism. ABC management says the cuts are not to save money but are driven by the growth of web and mobile audiences and the decline in broadcast TV and radio audiences. In the past two years the audience for ABC news on mobile and on the web has grown by 12% to almost five million a month, while the smartphone audience has grown by 30%, the broadcaster has said. The director of news, analysis and investigations, Gaven Morris, announced 20 roles would be made redundant in the city newsrooms but there would be “no cut to job numbers” as “new senior editorial roles” would be introduced. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon It is expected the traditional television and radio journalists will be made redundant to make way for digital-first employees. “As Australia’s major public broadcaster, the ABC is continuing to provide news on traditional platforms at the same time as developing our digital presence to be as accessible as possible for all Australians,” Morris said. “While our newsrooms do great work, the current structures do not fully support our people to meet modern audience needs. “Reshaping our newsrooms involves challenges. Overall, it is anticipated around 20 positions would become redundant, and we know this would be painful. Against this, new senior editorial roles would be introduced to add to the expertise and skills in the newsroom. At the end of this process we anticipate having the same number of editorial employees.” The cuts follow the ABC’s decision to halve current affairs radio programs The World Today and PM in 2018 to fund other projects in news, including specialist and investigative reporting. Morris said the new newsroom structure would provide a “faster breaking-news service” across TV, radio, web and mobile. The management and structure of the newsrooms will also be changed. The last significant job cuts at the ABC were announced in March 2017 when the managing director, Michelle Guthrie, cut 200 jobs in the TV news, television and content divisions. In 2016 the ABC slashed the Radio National staff ranks and schedule, losing more than a dozen staff and several programs. On Monday, the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance said the majority of those being tapped for redundancy were senior, experienced journalists. The journalists who produce and report for the main 7pm news bulletins are particularly affected. They will be put in a “pool” and chosen for redundancy according to their skills. “Staff who are on the chopping block are local journalists dedicated to local storytelling,” the director of MEAA media, Katelin McInerney, said. “Despite assurances from management that local coverage will not suffer, it is difficult to understand how axing senior, experienced journalists out of state newsrooms is not going to have an impact.” But Morris said the restructure is about equipping the newsroom for coverage that suits the way the audience is consuming news. The average audience for the 7pm bulletin is in their 60s and young people are consuming news on mobiles and around the clock. “The end game for me here is about journalism,” Morris told Guardian Australia. “I am not always convinced the standard of reporting is always as strong as it could be. “I don’t think people look to us as much as they once did to cover the day’s events because there are so many places they can get that type of news coverage from. “We need to be providing a point of difference in the media by doing a stronger brand of journalism.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/30/michelle-wolf-sarah-sanders-whcd-critics","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T06:00:04Z","webTitle":"Michelle Wolf has nothing to apologise for.

Her critics do, though","bodyText":"Let me tell you a few deplorable things that happened in America this weekend. Nearly 43 million people woke up in poverty in the richest country in the world. And more than 30 million Americans woke up without health insurance. A further 36 people died because of gun violence, bringing the total number of gun deaths in the US this year to 4,627. All of that is deplorable. What is in absolutely no way deplorable or shocking or outrageous or unacceptable is a joke about eye shadow. You probably know what I mean – it was headline news on Sunday. But if you missed the controversy, the summary is that a comedian called Michelle Wolf made a gag about Sarah Sanders at the annual White House correspondents’ dinner in DC. “I think [Sanders is] very resourceful,” Wolf said about the White House press secretary. “Like, she burns facts, and then she uses the ash to create a perfect smoky eye.” Wolf was referencing Sanders’ well-documented history of defending Trump’s brazen lies. Earlier this month for example, Sanders defended Trump’s racist claims that women from Central America are raped at “levels that nobody has ever seen before”. She also justified Trump’s entirely unfounded claims that “millions and millions” of illegal votes are cast in America’s elections by saying that the president “strongly feels” that is the case. Sanders lectures the press about accuracy but spends her days helping Trump fuel racism and hate with shameless lies. Sanders, in brief, is a morally bankrupt person and Wolf was holding her to account. Sanders may be a morally bankrupt person but guess what? She’s also a wife and mother and it is really very mean for Wolf to stoop so low as to mention Sanders’ eye shadow. Can you imagine the devastating psychological impact of having a comedian reference your affinity for a smoky eye? Can you imagine how damaged her kids must be by the reference to their mum’s makeup? Personally, I can’t imagine any of this, but it seems plenty of other people can. MSNBC’s Mika Brzezinski, for example, tweeted: “Watching a wife and mother be humiliated on national television for her looks is deplorable. I have experienced insults about my appearance from the president. All women have a duty to unite when these attacks happen and the WHCA owes Sarah an apology.” Maggie Haberman, the New York Times’ White House correspondent, similarly tweeted: “That @PressSec sat and absorbed intense criticism of her physical appearance, her job performance, and so forth, instead of walking out, on national television, was impressive.” Haberman made sure to tag Sanders in the speech so that the press secretary would be sure to know just how outraged she was. Andrea Mitchell from NBC also tagged the press secretary in a tweet stating that an apology is owed to Sanders. Insulting someone’s appearance is never a good look, no matter how awful a person they may be. But nothing in Wolf’s routine could possibly be construed as “intense criticism of [Sanders’] physical appearance”. And absolutely nothing in Wolf’s routine demands an apology to the press secretary. If anything, the likes of Haberman, Brzezinski and Mitchell owe America an apology. They’re all incredibly smart women with extremely important jobs. They’re supposed to be holding power to account, not sucking up to it. Rushing to defend Sanders under a veil of faux-feminism is beneath all of them. What’s more, urging Wolf to apologize for what should have been an uncontroversial joke sends an incredibly dangerous message. It suggests that it’s not OK to criticize the president and his people. And it lends credence to Trump’s repeated claims that the mainstream media is out to get him. Last week the US dropped two places in the Reporters Without Borders 2018 World Press Freedom Index, with Trump’s continuous attacks on the media cited as a reason for the decline. We live in a very worrying time for free speech. Indeed, on Sunday it was reported that the US Department of Justice removed a section about the “need for free press” from its internal manual. Now more than ever, journalists need to be courageous. The media needs to make sure it is speaking truth to power, not kowtowing to the powerful. However, as Wolf mentioned in her speech, even the liberal media is under Trump’s spell. “You pretend like you hate him, but I think you love him. I think what no one in this room wants to admit is that Trump has helped all of you. He’s helped you sell your papers and your books and your TV. You helped create this monster, and now you’re profiting off of him.” Wolf is absolutely right. We all ought to do a lot more soul-searching about how we’re covering the Trump administration. That should have been the headline that came out of Wolf’s speech; not controversy about eye shadow. Wolf’s words should have inspired introspection amongst the press, not a liberal backlash. So, please, spare me the faux feminist outrage about Sanders. It was just a joke. The response to it, however, has been no laughing matter. •This article was amended on 1 May 2018 to correct the number of Americans without health insurance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/30/gold-coast-to-host-international-cricket-for-first-time-in-2018-19","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T01:01:20Z","webTitle":"Australia eye pink-ball Test against India at Adelaide Oval","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/30/gold-coast-to-host-international-cricket-for-first-time-in-2018-19","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/30/gold-coast-to-host-international-cricket-for-first-time-in-2018-19","fields":{"headline":"Australia eye pink-ball Test against India at Adelaide Oval","bodyText":"Cricket Australia is still hoping it can persuade India that the opening match of their four-Test series in Adelaide should be a day-nighter. CA released its full summer international schedule on Monday but could not confirm it will continue its recent tradition of pink-ball Tests in the clash at Adelaide Oval from 6 December. The powerful Board of Control for Cricket in India has been opposed to the day-night Test innovation started by Australia in 2015 However, a report from India last week indicated they may play one of two home Tests against West Windies in October under lights.

Perth Stadium will host a Test match for the first time when it host the second Test against India from 14 to 18 December. With Melbourne and Sydney hosting India for the traditional Boxing Day and New Year Tests, Brisbane misses out on the summer’s most high-profile series and loses its status as the season-opening Test venue.

Billing themselves as “the counterweight” to the pro-coal power Monash Forum, the North Shore Environmental Stewards have held at least two recruitment functions at which attendees were urged to tap into their networks of environmentally conscious people to join the Liberal party branches in Abbott’s seat of Warringah and on the lower north shore. The NSES has a Facebook page that says the group “supports clean energy and a healthy environment, and believes in traditional Liberal party values of environmental stewardship”. • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But some participants believe its objectives appeared to be aimed at candidate change. “I was asked to participate in an initiative to have a representative in Canberra who acknowledges climate change,” said one person who attended the meeting in Seaforth on 25 March. Exactly who is involved in the group remains a matter of conjecture. Certainly, Liberals have attended. Several high-profile figures in the moderate faction of the Liberal party, including the powerbroker Michael Photios and his wife, Kristina, attended the lunchtime gathering of the NSES at Seaforth in March. Also attending were the New South Wales MP for North Shore, Felicity Wilson, and David Begg, a longtime Liberal party member who ran against Abbott for preselection in the 1990s. Photios addressed the meeting and, according to one attendee, put the case that the Liberals were the party that would tackle climate change – and that they should join. He highlighted his own record of defending the environment when in state parliament. . “At the meeting I soon realised that the NSES was ... seeking to recruit people concerned about the lack of action on climate change to join the Liberal party in order to block the preselection of Tony Abbott to stand in Warringah at the next federal election,” the attendee claimed. One invitation for the Mosman meeting said: “We have a real opportunity be a force for good in the party, a voice for the environment right here in the electorate of the Monash Forum’s figurehead – Tony Abbott. Come and learn about how we can shift the politics here in Warringah at our info session this Sunday!” Photios told Guardian Australia he had attended the Seaforth meeting because his wife, a passionate environmentalist, had been asked to speak. She ultimately didn’t speak but Photios did and was the main speaker at the event. He said there was “zero involvement” of the Liberal party or the moderate faction in the formation of the NSES. Kristina Photios quit the Liberal party in 2016 because she was appalled by its stance on climate change but has since rejoined. A year ago, the Photios couple formed a spinoff from Photios’s lobbying firm, Premier State, to represent clean energy companies. The firm, Clean Energy Strategies, describes itself as “a boutique corporate advisory firm specialising in energy”. Until a few years ago Photios held several senior positions in the state executive of the NSW Liberal party and was head of the moderate faction, known as the Group, which has been locked in a long-running power struggle with the right. Abbott is one of the leading members of the right faction. As prime minister, Abbott pushed through rule changes in the Liberal party to ban registered lobbyists from holding party positions. Several members of NSES are also members of the activist group GetUp. A GetUp spokeswoman said the NSES “was definitely not a GetUp project but the environmental justice team knows of it ... and think they’re great”. The official organiser of NSES, Rob Grant, told Guardian Australia the group was no more than “a group of like-minded people on the north shore who want to see action on climate change, and who believe in driving change from inside the tent”. Grant, a businessman who had a company in the renewables sector, is also a member of the Liberal party’s Neutral Bay branch. Senior figures in the moderates scoffed at the idea that Abbott was in any danger of losing his northern beaches seat in a preselection. They said he had a firm grip on the numbers and that to take part in a preselection members must have joined at least six months earlier. There is no firm date for federal preselections but they are likely to take place by the end of the year or earlier, if an early election is called. But figures closer to the machinations in Warringah warned the seat could be vulnerable to an attack by Young Liberals, whom they described as marauding across NSW.

Chelsea, who went down 3-1 in the first leg at Kingsmeadow and needed a minimum of three away goals to make the final, were denied what looked like a good shout for a penalty in the first half, when Eniola Aluko was brought down by a Lena Gössling challenge. However, Pernille Harder put the tie to bed in the 69th minute when she slotted past Hedvig Lindahl after a nicely timed run into the box. The final nail in Chelsea’s coffin came from Ewa Pajor, whose late header added to the Wolfsburg tally. No English side have managed to reach the final since Arsenal’s triumph in 2007. However, this season has proved to be positive for the English clubs as it is the first time two of them have reached the final-four stage. Chelsea, who are top of the Women’s Super League One and three points clear of second-placed City, will face Arsenal in the FA Cup final on 5 May. Domestically, an Ellen White hat-trick earned Birmingham City a 3-0 win over Arsenal in the WSL. The England striker chipped in the opener after 11 minutes and then added another before the half-time whistle, when she successfully diverted a cross beyond Sari van Veenendaal. The goalkeeper later saved an Aoife Mannion penalty but it was not enough for Arsenal as White put the result beyond doubt late on with a first-time finish. Liverpool hosted Everton at Prenton Park in the Merseyside derby but both sides cancelled each other out in a 1-1 draw. The Reds dominated proceedings but it took until just seconds after the break, when Laura Coombs converted from distance, for them to make an impact. Everton drew level in the 65th minute when a substitute, Jodie Brett, scored from close range. Reading were barely impacted by their goalkeeper being dismissed during the second half as they defeated Sunderland 2-0 away. Fara Williams opened the scoring in the 39th minute when she drove towards the box before calmly finding the back of the net. Just two minutes later Rachel Furness doubled the lead when she struck a powerful shot from 25 yards. Mary Earps saw red for handling the ball outside the box, but it did little to aid Sunderland."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/may/01/ovarian-cancer-diagnoses-will-rise-55-in-the-next-20-years","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T23:01:24Z","webTitle":"Ovarian cancer diagnoses 'will rise 55% in the next 20 years'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/01/ovarian-cancer-diagnoses-will-rise-55-in-the-next-20-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/01/ovarian-cancer-diagnoses-will-rise-55-in-the-next-20-years","fields":{"headline":"Ovarian cancer diagnoses 'will rise 55% in the next 20 years'","bodyText":"Ovarian cancer diagnoses are set to rise worldwide by nearly 55% in the next two decades, according to a global coalition that says more must be done to improve the poor outcomes. Global survival rates range between 30% and 50%, says the World Ovarian Cancer Coalition, which brings together patient organisations. Ovarian cancer has the lowest survival rate of all the female cancers. In contrast, 10-year breast cancer survival in England and Wales is now 78%, having nearly doubled in 10 years. There have been far fewer breakthroughs in diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer. More women are being diagnosed with ovarian cancer around the world, mainly because they are living longer – the disease mostly affects women over 50 who are post-menopausal. In the developing world especially, many women die earlier than that, usually of infectious diseases. Rapid population growth is increasing the numbers of women of an age to get ovarian cancer. A third factor is the shift from rural into urban areas, which has been identified as an influence but is as yet unexplained. Ovarian cancer rates in the UK are expected to rise by 15% in the next 20 years. There has been a slowing of the rate of diagnosis, partly due to large numbers of women having gone on the pill in their earlier years, which is known to have a protective effect. The global rise is a finding from the coalition’s 2018 Every Woman study. It includes a review of global ovarian cancer statistics, interviews with women and clinicians in a range of countries and a survey of women with ovarian cancer. More than 1,000 women in 39 countries have taken part. Annwen Jones, the chief executive of UK charity Target Ovarian Cancer and co-chair of the study, said: “The projected rise in incidence of ovarian cancer is especially concerning because we still lack the means to diagnose it early and treat it effectively. This is a global problem that requires a global solution.” Elisabeth Baugh, the chair of the coalition, said: “This study tells us that unfortunately ovarian cancer continues to lag far behind the many other cancers that have made good progress in recent years, like breast cancer.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/30/music-downloads-can-gauge-consumer-vibe-bank-of-england","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T12:49:18Z","webTitle":"Spotify trends could help us gauge the public mood – Bank of England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/30/music-downloads-can-gauge-consumer-vibe-bank-of-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/30/music-downloads-can-gauge-consumer-vibe-bank-of-england","fields":{"headline":"Spotify trends could help us gauge the public mood – Bank of England","bodyText":"Central bankers seeking to understand what’s really happening in the economy might want to forget about market research surveys and get hip to the number of Taylor Swift downloads instead, the chief economist at the Bank of England has suggested. Andy Haldane said researchers were increasingly looking at music download sites such as Spotify and studying the lyrics of songs to gauge the public mood. In a speech about the possibilities created by big data, Haldane said it was “devilishly difficult” to work out how people felt because traditional surveys of market participants or the general public tended to be “biased in their sampling and framed in their responses”. He said researchers were using non-traditional methods in an attempt to understand consumer behaviour. “To give one recent example, data on music downloads from Spotify has been used, in tandem with semantic search techniques applied to the words of songs, to provide an indicator of people’s sentiment.” Haldane said the results were at least as good at tracking consumer sentiment as the monthly Michigan University survey, which is considered by economists to be a good guide to how confident Americans are feeling. “And why stop at music? People’s tastes in books, TV and radio may also offer a window on their soul. So too might their taste in [computer] games,” Haldane added. Multiplayer online games such as World of Warcraft already had “primitive” economies attached to them that economists were studying, not only to gauge the public mood but also to assess how individuals would respond to policy changes such as moves in interest rates or tougher regulations. “Indeed, in the latter role, the game could serve as a test bed for policy action – a large-scale dynamic, digital focus group.” Haldane noted that not all attempts to harness online searches have been successful. Google tried to predict flu outbreaks based on online searches with little success after a promising start. But he expressed confidence that big data would fulfil its promise and help the Bank of England “to create a real-time map of financial and activity flows across the economy, in much the same way as is already done for flows of traffic or information or weather. “Once mapped, there would then be scope to model and, through policy, modify these flows. This is an idea I first talked about six years ago. Today, it looks closer than ever to being within our grasp.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/30/rudds-resignation-and-british-attitudes-to-immigration","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T17:21:56Z","webTitle":"Rudd’s resignation and British attitudes to immigration | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/30/rudds-resignation-and-british-attitudes-to-immigration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/30/rudds-resignation-and-british-attitudes-to-immigration","fields":{"headline":"Rudd’s resignation and British attitudes to immigration","bodyText":"The Windrush affair continues to expose the fault lines in British society and immigration policy (Rudd quits over Windrush scandal, 30 April). The government has defended the hostile environment policy as primarily targeted at “illegal immigrants”. A person as opposed to an action, however, cannot be illegal. And it is unwise to use harsh, derogatory language about people. To promote constructive dialogue among more than 700 people from 50-plus countries at the first World Congress on Migration, Ethnicity, Race and Health being held in Edinburgh (17-19 May), we have recommended using “irregular migrant”, defined as: “A person who, owing to unauthorized entry, breach of a condition of entry, failure to gain asylum, or the expiry of his or her visa, lacks legal authorisation to reside in the country where they find themselves.” Such a change would be a step towards rebuilding the tarnished reputation of this country in relation to immigration policy and race relations. Professor Raj Bhopal Chairperson, First World Congress of Migration, Ethnicity, Race and Health • So another piece of political theatre comes to its denouement with Amber Rudd’s resignation. Conservative Home Office scandals are as predictable as pantomimes and come with their own time-honoured tropes including: cruel heartless and usually racist Tories and their selfless Labour opponents championing the underdog. Behind the scenes the reality is rather different. The underlying driver of the Home Office’s enduring difficulties is that the views of our political, media and judicial establishments on crime and immigration are fundamentally at odds with those of the majority of the British people. The public want firm but fair control of immigration. In the case of the Windrush scandal, we expect a speedy and fair resolution for people who have long integrated into British life, whether they are technically citizens or not. It is time that all elements of the establishment grasped that control of immigration – the issue that determined the result of the Brexit referendum – really matters to the British public. Otto Inglis Edinburgh • The Windrush generation are not the only immigrants who have fallen short of the increased hostility of the UK government to migrants. After I married a Japanese national in 1992, we moved to the UK. Within 12 months, she was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK. Similarly, in 1995 we returned to Japan for my work and I was soon granted indefinite leave to remain. However, when we came back to the UK in 2010 (in order for me to establish what has become a flourishing biotechnology company) the UK government’s attitude to foreigners had hardened to the extent that, despite 25 years of marriage, my wife still does not have indefinite leave to remain in the UK and we have paid thousands in exploitative visa fees and undergone numerous stressful tests. A British citizen should have the right to live with their long-term foreign spouse in either of their countries of birth. However, the government would rather hit its arbitrary immigration and deportation targets than see decent people treated decently. Michael Jones CEO, Cell Guidance Systems Royston, Hertfordshire • The elation among Labour party activists who helped bring down Amber Rudd will be short lived. It was obvious when the liberal media and Tory neoliberal globalists worked lock-step to ensure her resignation that the entire Windrush scandal was a well set up ploy designed to get rid of a home secretary who actually wanted to fulfil the wishes of the British public and control our borders, particularly after Brexit. Labour politicians will celebrate for now but in short order will face again the question of what immigration policy they will present to the public. They will be forced to explain why so many of them want continued open borders. Hopefully it will also become clear that the unknown number of Windrush deportees, plus all those Caribbean people now worrying about their citizenship status, were simply pawns in a much bigger game. Philip Duval Manchester • There is a correlation between the appalling treatment the Windrush generation has suffered and the unaccompanied asylum-seeking children (Dubs children) promised safety and sanctuary but denied it by the Home Office. In May 2016 parliament voted to amend the immigration bill to allow some of the “most vulnerable” children already in Europe to come to the UK. But the implementation was at fault because this government did not honour parliament or our obligation as fellow humans. Earlier this month, Rudd said she was “worried the Home Office has become too concerned with policy and strategy and sometimes loses sight of the individual”. Too right. These are children fleeing war with no adult to look out for them. They have no voice against the hostility of the UK towards immigration, and they need our help.

A foul-mouthed skewering of the morass that is modern society, and France in particular, the book is translated by Frank Wynne with such dynamism and verve that the reader can barely keep pace. Set in 2014, shortly before the leading lights of the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine were murdered during their weekly editorial meeting, the novel’s most obvious contemporaneous comparison is with Michel Houellebecq’s Submission, itself published just after the Charlie Hebdo attack. Yet Despentes has a compassion and a comic timing that Houellebecq lacks, as her antihero Vernon, the Peter Pan-like former proprietor of hip Parisian record store Revolver, finds himself nearing 50 and barely subsisting. A relic from the 80s, Vernon, along with the vinyl bootlegs he flogs on eBay, has become a dismal casualty of the digital revolution. “Vernon is still trapped in the last century, when people still took the trouble to pretend that being was more important than having.” With his unemployment benefit stopped, his recent survival has only been due to the generosity of an old friend, global pop star Alex Bleach. As the novel opens, Alex has been found dead of an overdose, instantly cutting off Vernon’s supply of cash. Thus begins a saga of sofa surfing, boozing and coke-snorting, buoyed along by an eclectic 80s soundtrack. The hyperactive cast of characters ranges from the Hyena, a woman who makes serious money out of anonymously trashing reputations online, to rookie journalist Lydia Bazooka, frustrated screenwriter and childhood friend Xavier, former porn star Pamela Kant and transwoman Monica, with whom Vernon falls in love. As Vernon runs out of options and downgrades to living on the streets, he is unaware that a chance remark about being in possession of Alex’s last recorded interview tapes has made him urgently sought after by figures whose intentions are not necessarily good. At once a novel of the internet age and a withering examination of France’s political polarisation and the evisceration of leftwing intellectualism, Vernon Subutex 1 scrutinises misogyny, pornography, poverty, religion, race, neo-fascism and gender issues. Its hipness recalls the films of Jean-Jacques Beineix and Leos Carax, making for an intoxicating blend of the retro and au courant. • Vernon Subutex 1 is published by MacLehose.

Paul Pester, along with the bank’s chair Richard Meddings and a representative from Spanish parent group Sabadell, will be hauled in front of the Treasury committee on Wednesday to explain how TSB’s IT systems collapsed more than a week ago, and how they will compensate affected customers. Committee chair and Conservative MP Nicky Morgan said: “We will take evidence from TSB and Sabadell representatives to find out how they got into this mess, who is responsible, and how they are putting it right.” The botched IT transfer from TSB’s former owner Lloyds to Banco de Sabadell was designed to reap cost savings of £100m a year but Pester admitted last week that the bank was “on our knees”. TSB said on Monday its online banking services were “available again but some customers may still have difficulties accessing and using these services”. A week after problems first emerged, TSB’s online services continued running significantly below capacity, with some customers reporting they were still blocked from their accounts. All TSB mortgage customers have been prevented from viewing any details of their account online for more than a week. The committee hearing is likely to focus on what TSB will do to compensate customers and if Pester will still receive a bonus. Morgan said: “The Treasury committee is extremely concerned by the problems at TSB, and by the apparent miscommunication to customers about the extent and nature of these problems.” Pester has until now refused to answer questions about his £1.6m bonus, which was due to be paid once the IT migration is complete, along with bonuses for 30 other senior managers. In a letter to Morgan released ahead of the hearing, Pester admitted that on the first day of the IT chaos on Monday last week: “We were only able to serve c.200,000 sessions via our website versus an expected level of c.450,000.” Pester also admitted that as customers tried to ring the bank instead, “average wait times were close to one hour; by Thursday this had remained high at approximately 30 minutes”. TSB admitted that only six in 10 of its branches had technology that was fully functioning even by the end of the week. Pester’s letter said the “issues started to occur after TSB’s migration onto a new platform built for TSB by our parent company, Sabadell, and operated by Sabadell’s technology subsidiary, Sabis”. But the banking software at the heart of TSB’s troubles was doomed to failure from the start, an insider with extensive knowledge of the systems involved told the Guardian last week. TSB has promised to repay customers left out of pocket. “I want to reassure the committee that we are working around the clock to put things right for our customers,” Pester wrote in his letter to Morgan. “As I have said publicly, no customer will be out of pocket as a consequence of these problems.” Tuesday will be another crucial test for the bank’s IT, with the first day of the month a popular time for monthly salary payments, direct debits and standing orders. TSB insisted that “fundamental record keeping and account management functions within the platform are working as designed. This means that the fundamental components of the bank, such as regular payments, debit cards, credit cards, and ATMs, are all working as normal”. However, Twitter users continued to post images of their accounts which show payment instructions dated 2099. Fraudsters have also tried to cash in on the IT meltdown, prompting the bank to warn customers to be wary of emails and tweets claiming to be from TSB."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/shortcuts/2018/apr/30/why-im-organising-a-drag-protest-to-welcome-donald-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T15:32:09Z","webTitle":"Why I’m organising a drag protest to welcome Donald Trump | Cheddar Gorgeous","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2018/apr/30/why-im-organising-a-drag-protest-to-welcome-donald-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/shortcuts/2018/apr/30/why-im-organising-a-drag-protest-to-welcome-donald-trump","fields":{"headline":"Why I’m organising a drag protest to welcome Donald Trump","bodyText":"Despite claiming on the campaign trail to be “gay friendly”, the Trump administration has unleashed a barrage of policies and amendments that demonstrate the contrary. From reinstating a ban on transgender military personnel and rescinding legal protections for trans workers and students to arguing in favour of a homophobic cake shop, the actions of the US president have been decidedly unfriendly to LGBTQI people. People of colour, migrants and women have also been the subject of controversial policies, offensive remarks and ill-thought-out tweets. It feels as if the Trump administration seeks to use diversity as the scapegoat on which America is apparently made great again … and, to top it off, he failed to recognise pride month.When Donald Trump visits the UK on 13 July, I am helping to coordinate a group who will stage a protest in drag. This is to increase awareness of the way Trump’s administration has systematically attacked the LGBTQI community and to stand in solidarity with the many other groups who feel marginalised along lines of race, class and gender. To not object to the visit would seem like a betrayal of the tolerant society that the UK as a whole strives to be. When diversity is attacked, it is imperative that marginalised people stay visible, stand up to bullies and engage satirically with what is going on. New York activists in the 90s used the slogan Silence = Death to protest against the way the US government ignored the impact of the Aids crisis on gay men, and the phrase remains pertinent today (particularly given that Trump’s first budget proposal included a roughly $800m cut to bilateral HIV/Aids efforts). One of the things that makes drag so powerful is the way we make ourselves visible in a particularly spectacular way. There is a long history of drag kings and queens getting involved with political and social issues. From their role in the Stonewall riots to the work that they have done raising money for HIV charities, drags are not scared to put themselves forward when there is a need to show up and speak out. By pushing the way that we look to the extremes, we are showing that we are not ashamed to be different – we are proud of our differentness. Most important of all, we are showing that the UK is a place that is not ashamed to celebrate the diversity of its people. If we can be accepted as the extreme glittery spectacles that we are, then it just might make it easier for everyone else to be themselves, too. We are eager to join with the many other protests that will take place when Trump arrives in the UK. It is important that we stand with others who feel similarly outraged at the way the UK government is failing to stand up to Trump. It is about more than just one group’s interests and needs, and it is vital to stand in solidarity with all marginalised groups who are affected by Trump’s administration and the rhetoric of intolerance that fuels it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/01/paris-student-protesters-raid-1968-uprising-antoine-gerard-guegan","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T04:00:31Z","webTitle":"France's 1968 uprising, 50 years on: 'It's harder for the youth today'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/01/paris-student-protesters-raid-1968-uprising-antoine-gerard-guegan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/01/paris-student-protesters-raid-1968-uprising-antoine-gerard-guegan","fields":{"headline":"France's 1968 uprising, 50 years on: 'It's harder for the youth today'","bodyText":"When French riot police raided the Paris 3 University campus in Censier at dawn on Monday morning, evicting student protesters, the ghost loomed large of the student uprisings of May 1968. Emmanuel Macron, the first French president born after that civil unrest, has faced several protests this spring. These have ranged from student sit-ins against the introduction of more selective entry requirements for university admissions, to train strikes over changes to state railways, and opposition to a new immigration law. Macron has said the demonstrators are in a minority and vowed to press on with his planned liberal overhaul of the economy. But 50 years on from the student protests, the month of May is especially loaded with historic symbolism, which the government has brushed aside and trade unions would like to capitalise on. One student protester, Antoine Guégan, knows better than most that comparisons are not clear cut between protests this year and the events of May 1968, which also saw a massive, nationwide general strike against a global backdrop of protests from Prague to the US. Guégan, 27, was part of the Censier campus student takeover that was raided by police this week. His father, Gérard Guégan, staged sit-ins at the same campus, aged 27, in May 1968. For three weeks, Guégan had sat up into the early hours debating how to fix society from behind the student barricades at Censier. “It’s terrifying to see that this is becoming the norm for riot police to be sent into universities,” said Guégan, who is doing a doctorate on representations of slavery in American cinema and teaches at the campus while studying at another university in Paris’s suburbs. He will join labour day protests against Macron in the French capital on Tuesday. “If there’s one thing in common between 1968 and today, it’s young people’s despair,” he said. “But it’s a different kind of despair, because the social and economic context is not the same. In 1968, there was a global movement, there was rock music, new sexual freedom, a different culture and a desire to change the old world. Today’s youth is facing a moment of stagnation, with little to lean on, which makes the struggle harder.” One key difference, he said, was unemployment. In 1968, the French joblessness rate was less than 2%. Today, it is hovering near 9%, but youth unemployment, which is above 20% on average, can top 40% in many deprived areas. “It’s about feeling there aren’t prospects and, at the same time, seeing the government taking away social protections,” Guégan said. Economic crisis and climate change also weigh heavily on this generation. “I remember when I was five or six, I had a schoolbag with the planet Earth on it and showing the hole in the ozone layer,” he said. “We’ve grown up with talk of environmental crisis, economic crisis, and now we’re looking for answers and solutions.” A major concern is what Guégan called “police repression” in France. “Anyone today can be teargassed at a demo or hit by truncheons,” he said, adding that many were angered by police identity checks targeting non-white people and police evictions of migrants from tents in Calais. It was the police evacuation of Sorbonne University on 3 May 1968 that brought Gérard Guégan, a leftwing writer, into the student uprising. From a working class communist family in Marseille, with a father who had been in the French resistance during the second world war, Gérard Guégan was living in banlieue outside Paris. He had recently been sacked from a job at a publisher after setting up a trade union, and was taking a book manuscript to a publisher in Paris’s Latin Quarter when he saw police dragging student leaders from Sorbonne and putting them into vans. “What surprised me were not the arrests by police – we’d seen plenty of those during demonstrations over the Algerian war years before,” he said. “It was the fact that the passersby stood up against them. As the police vans drove off, stones were thrown at them. It was passersby and people in the street who were doing that.” He stayed in Paris and joined the protests at a time when he felt strangers were suddenly striking up conversations in the street, rules were being broken and there were running battles between police and students wearing motorcycle helmets with bin lids as shields, some throwing not just stones, but petrol bombs. Disillusioned with communism, Gérard Guégan’s group of ultra-left thinkers inside the occupied Censier campus used the name Nous sommes en marche [We are on the move] – almost 50 years before the centrist Macron called his new political movement En Marche. Gérard Guégan will speak this week at an anniversary symposium held at the Nanterre campus where the May 1968 student revolt began. The site is currently barricaded by anti-Macron students. “What interests me is whether we’ll be heckled by today’s student protesters – I’m all for that, I’m all for dialogue,” he said, adding that it was right young people were “ticking off” the president. One of Gérard Guégan’s favourite slogans from May 1968 was “Be realistic, ask for the impossible”. He said: “We were constantly thinking of what we called dreams, and what could be called utopia … Everyone was convinced that something massive was happening.” His son, although “an eternal optimist”, said the current mood is more subdued. “There is something inaccessible about the notion of a dream. Today is about profound convictions, how it’s possible to live in a nightmare, but to think about how we can and should be doing things differently,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/apr/30/art-on-the-bbc-the-genius-of-leonardo-da-vinci","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T21:00:22Z","webTitle":"Art on the BBC: The Genius of Leonardo da Vinci – the man, his art and his TV career","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/30/art-on-the-bbc-the-genius-of-leonardo-da-vinci","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/30/art-on-the-bbc-the-genius-of-leonardo-da-vinci","fields":{"headline":"Art on the BBC: The Genius of Leonardo da Vinci – the man, his art and his TV career","bodyText":"Janina Ramirez, the art historian, is walking purposefully towards me, along a corridor.

While I am moaning, here is another little one that is specific to art on TV and also on show here: the slow pan over a work. You don’t look at a picture in a gallery like that, do you, unless you are drunk? You look at the whole thing, then you might focus on areas or details. And that is fine, if the camera zooms in for the expert to point something out or explain something. But the slow pan is meaningless. Both of the above, I think, are about television’s fear of stillness. Everything has to keep moving or, they seem to think, people will get bored. There is a similar fear about a different kind of stillness – a lack of noise – which is why silence must be filled with music. But stillness – both kinds – can be powerful and make you sit up and listen. Moan over. Ramirez is talking about Leonardo, his insatiable curiosity, his quest for knowledge and his use of light and shade. There is time spent on his technical innovation and his revolutionary anatomical research. In short: his genius. “Genius, genius, genius …” echo a chorus of critics and art historians and presenters from the ghost of television past. Ramirez’s journey takes her not just along the corridors of Blenheim, but also deep into the BBC archive, to see how television has influenced our understanding of the man and his work. A kind of TV history of L da V. So here is Kenneth Clark in the seminal series Civilisation talking about that curiosity, and timelessness (see, Clark’s not walking, but sitting, and I am listening). And Robert Hughes bringing some antipodean early-70s cool, and excellent hair, to the table. And, most tantalisingly, Henry Moore from a 1978 Arena programme – caressing what seems to be the leg bone of a large animal, but may be one of his own creations – talking about Leonardo’s unending childlike quest for knowledge and his desire to share what he felt about life through his work. I would like to have seen more of that one, artist on artist; that is the problem with this hooked-on-snippets approach. Here is reconstructed Leonardo (did Mark Rylance really need to do flickery candlelit recon?) in 2003. And Fiona Bruce on the search for lost works. And Andrew Graham-Dixon being taken under the skin of the Mona Lisa by a man named Pascal and his magic wavelength machine, to find another woman ... The best things in this show have all been on other programmes, but that is the nature of it. And Ramirez turns it into something coherent and interesting that says something about the man himself, his timelessness, and about his TV career. To be honest I am surprised he didn’t pre-invent the television. I bet there is a sketch of something that looks very like one in a lost notebook somewhere; Bruce should get on the hunt. Another good thing about Ramirez: she is a she. Whereas everyone else, in all the past BBC art programmes, has either been a he or Fiona Bruce. That is progress. Speaking of progress, she doesn’t do the walking thing too much. Why Blenheim, though? Is there a little-known Leonardo hanging in Oxfordshire? No, but there is a James Thornhill ceiling, painted as the Renaissance in Europe was drawing to a close. That is a bit tenuous, isn’t it? I am wondering if, as my own painstaking research has discovered, it might have something to do with the fact that Woodstock, the town outside Blenheim’s gates, is also Ramirez’s hometown? No travel, flights to Florence or Eurostar to Paris, even bus tickets required. Just a short – purposeful – walk. Coupled with the use of the corporation’s own archive, this must have been pretty cheap TV."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/12/too-much-of-one-thing-reading-plays-short-stories-bim-adewunmi","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T05:00:21Z","webTitle":"Is too much of a good thing a bad idea? | Bim Adewunmi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/12/too-much-of-one-thing-reading-plays-short-stories-bim-adewunmi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/12/too-much-of-one-thing-reading-plays-short-stories-bim-adewunmi","fields":{"headline":"Can you ever have too much of a good thing?","bodyText":"There was a brief window of time, when I was about nine years old, when I became obsessed with one dinner alone. On my sixth day of asking for – and getting – yam and eggs exclusively, my mother laid down the law. “Too much of any one thing is a bad idea,” she said. Of course, as an adult, I realise this isn’t strictly true. For example, I have learned that a) one simply cannot have too much sleep, especially as you edge closer to 40; and b) ice-cream and cheese are absolutely worth the pain of lactose intolerance, so just accept your fate and have some lactase pills handy. I will grudgingly concede that the modern pastime of TV bingeing, so diametrically opposed to my mother’s teachings, is generally a bad idea. I’d fallen into a bit of a play-reading spiral in the last few weeks: Nottage led to Albee, which led to Shepard, and then the alternate universes of Payne. “The joy of repetition really is in you,” sang Hot Chip on Over And Over. And it is. But there is a secondary type of joy to be found in breaking out of a repetitive cycle. So I put down the play I was rereading (Tennessee Williams, because I am a cliche) and picked up a book of short stories. Heads Of The Colored People by Nafissa Thompson-Spires is the kind of collection that makes you shake your head in delight. Her voice is fresh-laundry-clean: I have not read anything like it in years. The prose is cunning. It appears simple, but the overall effect is powerful. Her stories feel simultaneously like the poke of a stick and a comforting balm; a smack followed by a kiss. I’m so into it. Reading plays begat reading short stories, which may beget reading novels again. Who knows? The joy of repetition."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/30/india-fully-electric-after-last-village-connected-claims-government","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T14:46:38Z","webTitle":"India fully electric after last village connected, claims government","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/30/india-fully-electric-after-last-village-connected-claims-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/30/india-fully-electric-after-last-village-connected-claims-government","fields":{"headline":"India fully electric after last village connected, claims government","bodyText":"Electricity has reached every Indian village after the establishment of a connection at the weekend to Leisang, a tiny hamlet in the remote state of Manipur, the government has announced. Opposition parties have been sceptical of the achievement, calling it a political ruse ahead of important state and national elections. Indian media have also highlighted cases of villages supposedly electrified but where power appears to be non-existent, intermittent or available only to a few. The Indian government considers a village to be electrified if basic infrastructure such as schools are connected to the grid as well as at least 10% of households. About 270 million Indians, more than one-sixth of the population, are estimated to live without electricity, according to a World Bank report last year. The prime minister, Narendra Modi, tweeted at the weekend that Saturday would be “remembered as a historic day in the development journey of India”. “We fulfilled a commitment due to which the lives of several Indians will be transformed forever”, he said, announcing every village in the country was “powered and empowered”. Efforts to provide electricity to every Indian have historically been hampered by poorly designed and implemented schemes that encouraged contractors to do the bare minimum to make sure a village qualified as electrified. However, Surjit Singh Ningthoujam, who runs computer literacy programmes in the remote district of Manipur, where the last village to receive electricity is located, said progress in the area in the past three years had been impressive. “When electricity comes, people usually buy a TV and that totally changes their lives,” he said. “It is also a hilly area, so with lights they can go from house to house at night-time.” Still, he said, the supply in many villages remained unreliable and he often had to run his computer training courses using solar energy, which has reached some villages before government power lines. In Rajghat, a village in Rajasthan, solar panels are all that power the few lights in the community. Dilip Kumar, a resident, greeted Modi’s announcement bitterly. “I have shifted my brother and children from this village so they can study,” the farmer, 26, said. The government had refused for years to connect the village to the grid because it is legally considered to be on forest land, he said. “And now we have to use mustard oil to light our lamps, since the government banned kerosene because it is too polluting. But mustard oil is too expensive.” A spokesman for the opposition Congress party, Randeep Singh Surjewala, tweeted that the previous government led by his party had electrified 97% of the country’s nearly 700,000 villages but “did not boast”. He said Modi had only needed to connect 18,452 villages to declare full electrification. Modi promised in his independence day speech in 2015 that every Indian village would be electrified within 1,000 days. Saturday, when Leisang was connected to the grid, was 988 days since that promise. The government has said all of India’s 180m rural Indian households will have electricity by 2019. About 82% have electricity as of Monday, according to its real-time progress tracker."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/may/02/social-care-sway-local-elections-not-windrush-antisemitism","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T06:30:05Z","webTitle":"Social care should sway the local elections – not Windrush or antisemitism | David Brindle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/02/social-care-sway-local-elections-not-windrush-antisemitism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/02/social-care-sway-local-elections-not-windrush-antisemitism","fields":{"headline":"Social care should sway the local elections – not Windrush or antisemitism","bodyText":"When voters go to the polls in the English local elections on Thursday, many will be swayed by national issues such as the Windrush scandal and Labour’s problems with antisemitism. It is a perennial frustration to local politicians that they risk getting booted out of the town hall on such considerations, regardless of how well they have served their community. Even when local concerns are a factor, they tend to be the usual hobby horses of bin collections, potholes or street sweeping. The biggest issue facing local government, now accounting for 53% of all spending by the 152 councils responsible for providing it, rarely gets a mention. This week’s elections should really be seen as the social care elections. It is now six years since Barnet council’s “graph of doom” projected a future in which the north London borough, and authorities like it, would have no money for anything except statutory adult social care and children’s services. Without radical change, the pincer effect of austerity and increasing demand under those two budgets would bring about doomsday by the early 2020s. While the graph was never intended to be taken too literally, it is proving alarmingly prescient. Between 2010-11 and 2016-17, the National Audit Office says, English councils cut planning and development by 53%, highways and transport by 37%, cultural services by 35%, and environmental and regulatory services by 17%. Even adult social care itself took a hit of 3%. Children’s services was the only budget to show growth, of slightly more than 3%. But as repeated cuts in government grant slashed councils’ spending power by more than 28% in real terms. Adult and children’s social care have absorbed a rising share of a shrinking pot. Grant cuts – which the NAO says by 2019-20 will amount to a 56% reduction on 2010-11 – have given rise to a second phenomenon: social care is not only increasingly what councils do, it is also increasingly funded through council tax. English local authorities now depend on council tax for 60% of their income – in 2012, that figure was 41%. Since 2015, all councils responsible for providing social care have been allowed to levy an extra tax precept to pay for it. This year, almost all have done so, making the average total council tax rise just over 5% – almost twice both the rate of inflation and growth in earnings. The wonder is there hasn’t been more protest. Perhaps people haven’t understood or perhaps there is more public support for paying an earmarked tax for social care than is commonly supposed. But it can’t go on: half of all councils will be unable to levy the social care precept next year because they are already at the 6% cumulative limit imposed by ministers for the three years from 2017 to 2020. So concrete proposals in this summer’s green paper on funding older people’s care are vital. Long-term reform will take years to agree and implement. We need an interim solution that turns the Whitehall cash tap on again – preferably as part of the 10-year settlement for the NHS that Theresa May has promised. As viewers of the superb BBC documentary series Hospital saw last week, when a beds gridlock in Nottingham in January was broken only by the NHS buying 120 places in local care homes, to which patients were transferred even if they were waiting to go home with a social care package, the system gets by on short-term fixes. This has to stop. Helen Jones, Nottingham council’s director of adult social services, told the cameras it was the toughest she had ever known it: for the first time in her career it was hard to see the future; and her fear was that in 12 months’ time things could be even worse. “The danger is, this is just being accepted as the norm – and that frightens me,” she said. It should frighten us all. • David Brindle is the Guardian’s public services editor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/may/01/communist-manifesto-graphic-novel-martin-rowson-marx-filth-fury-gags","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T15:53:11Z","webTitle":"Filth, fury, gags and vendettas: The Communist Manifesto as a graphic novel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/01/communist-manifesto-graphic-novel-martin-rowson-marx-filth-fury-gags","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/01/communist-manifesto-graphic-novel-martin-rowson-marx-filth-fury-gags","fields":{"headline":"Filth, fury, gags and vendettas: The Communist Manifesto as a graphic novel","bodyText":"Karl Marx and I go back a long way. Like a lot of children growing up in the 1960s, I was obsessed with the Soviet Union and its unreachable otherness. What’s more, my father had actually been there to attend scientific symposia. I have a clear memory, aged about six, of standing in our back garden and him saying to me: “What do you mean, you don’t know who Karl Marx is?” I replied, rather tearfully: “But I know who Lenin is.” As I grew older, the obsession continued. At about 15, I finally read The Communist Manifesto and it made complete sense. I instantly got the Dialectic, the inexorable, tectonic grindings of All History Hitherto, the Class Conflict and all the stuff about the inevitability of the ultimate victory of the downtrodden over their oppressors. Moreover, in its compelling combination of reason and romanticism, I was entranced not only by the manifesto’s universal scope but also its playfulness. Parts of it are very funny. Soon I’d devoured Edmund Wilson’s To the Finland Station, visited the Soviet Union and, aged 19, wrote a thankfully unpublished novel that hinges round a fictitious Marxist uprising. As a student, I joined the Communist party, although I only hung around for a week. After I graduated I sold a cartoon series to New Statesman titled Scenes from the Lives of the Great Socialists, based on hideously contrived puns on the defining dicta of Marxism. A typical example shows Friedrich Engels standing on a toilet seat peering into the flush mechanism and saying: “Hey Marx, there’s a couple of those antique Stradivarius fiddles in here!” To which Marx replies: “Clearly the violins inherited the cistern!” When these cartoons came out as a book in 1983, there were calls for it to be banned from Collets, the old leftie bookshop in London. This was one reason why I hadn’t bothered making a fist of it in the CP: I’ve always subscribed to Orwell’s line about every joke being a tiny revolution, though a lot of people believe that None of This Is a Laughing Matter. Obviously, as a professional satirist, I disagree. And I reckon Marx would have done so, too. Not nearly enough people struggling through Theories of Surplus Value give themselves a break by reading, for instance, Marx’s journalism from the 1850s for the New York Tribune, which matches Simon Hoggart, and occasionally even Jonathan Swift, in its scathing hilarity. Anyway, Marx stuck with me in the following 30 years: I illustrated a couple of books by the Australian Marxist Kevin Killane, and Marx himself made cameo appearances in my comic-book adaptations of TS Eliot’s The Waste Land and Laurence Sterne’s Tristram Shandy. It was after that last book was reissued in 2010 by SelfMadeHero that the publisher commissioned me to adapt Francis Wheen’s wonderful 1999 biography of Marx. I’m a hack at heart and, like Marx, I dice with deadlines. Marx, then aged 29, knocked off The Communist Manifesto over a weekend in Brussels at the end of January 1848 after he received an ultimatum from the Communist League in London, who had commissioned the work from him the previous autumn and were still waiting. It had also been my practice to eschew storyboards and make it up as I went along. But confronted by the Wheen book, I decided to pay my son to write the script. He did an excellent job, but it left me with nothing to do except draw to his direction. I got bored. I felt like nothing more than a machine. I was, in fact, alienated from my labour in a textbook Marxist way and, in line with pure Marxist theory, I rebelled. Having taken seven months to draw just five pages of finished artwork I gave up and returned my advance. So now I had unfinished business with Marx, and occasionally images would flash into the back of my mind of great geological slabs of History grinding against massive clumps of the Dialectic. Then SelfMadeHero asked if I fancied adapting The Communist Manifesto as a comic book for Marx’s 200th birthday. The whole thing came instantly into my head. I clearly envisioned the manifesto as a kind of rolling tsunami, made up in equal parts of blood-and-iron industrialised steampunk, apocalyptic John Martin and mounting fury that builds up to a climax at the end of Section One: Bourgeois and Proletarians, before breaking on the beach of History and turning into straightforward standup comedy. It’s leavened throughout with private gags, personal score-settling and the kind of Rabelaisian filthiness Marx would have enjoyed, I hope that is what I’ve achieved. The former Tory home secretary Kenneth Baker, with whom I (and Steve Bell) sit on the board of London’s Cartoon Museum, insists on calling me a hardline Marxist-Leninist. I’m not. If anything, I’m a kind of William Morris anarchist, all for equality and down with hierarchies so we can all have some fun. Stripped of the doctrinaire dogma, that’s how I read Marx, too. The most important part of The Communist Manifesto remains its analysis of how the amoral mechanics of capitalism commodify human beings and reduce them to meat machines existing solely to be milked to make the already rich even richer. Which by anyone’s reckoning is no fun at all. And 170 years after he wrote The Communist Manifesto when, by the latest count, 43 individuals possess as much wealth as half of the rest of humanity, I reckon Marx still has a lot to say, and I hope I’ve helped him say it yet again.

Though it might have seemed a remote prospect when the US president was tweeting boasts about the size of his nuclear button four months ago, the question has been posed with increasing sincerity since an historic meeting between the leaders of North and South Korea last week. The South Korean president Moon Jae-in said he believes Trump should win the Nobel. The Republican senator Lindsey Graham thinks so too. One can only speculate on whether Trump deems himself worthy of the accolade. So when it came up on Monday night’s politician-free episode of Q&amp;A on the ABC, it was not without context. But the panel – made up of journalists including Masha Gessen, NBC’s Katy Tur and New York Times critic Wesley Morris – seemed to think not. • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Gessen, famously critical of Russian leader Vladimir Putin, summed it up thus: “Well if Trump’s claiming complete success [then] let’s give him the Nobel peace prize. “Come on, he has tweeted insults and now we’re supposed to think that has made an actual policy difference in the world? How idiotic is that conversation,” she said. But what about Trump’s role in bringing about the meeting and its result, a promise for “lasting peace” and “complete denuclearisation” on the divided peninsula? “How much is Trump responsible for that? Maybe a little bit, it’s very hard to tell. One of his potentially great qualities is his ability to keep the other side off balance,” journalist and Lowy Institute senior fellow Richard McGregor said. Tur, who covered the Trump campaign in the lead-up to the 2016 election and is in Australia for the Sydney writers’ festival, agreed to be the “idiot of the bunch” by indulging the idea. But she said it was a mistake to ascribe too much motive to the president who “operates in a moment-to-moment basis”. “I think it’s a little ridiculous to ascribe a madman strategy to him, I don’t think he intended to keep people off balance and that’s his big negotiating tactic,” she said. “I can’t say definitively though that whatever he’s done by tweeting about big buttons and calling [North Korean leader Kim Jong-un] little rocket man [wasn’t effective]. “Maybe that worked, I don’t know. I think its too early to tell, even in the best of circumstances. Remember you had Arafat and Rabin on the White House lawn in 1993 shaking hands for an historic peace agreement between the Palestinians and Israel and look what happened after that? There was another intifada.” “They did get Nobels, though,” host Tony Jones helpfully pointed out. Following comedian Michelle Wolf’s headline-grabbing act at the White House Correspondent’s Dinner, the all-journalist panel was also asked to engage with the question of whether it was the media’s fault that Trump was in the White House. Wolf’s routine included a critique of the media’s relationship with Trump, stating: “He has helped you sell your papers and your books and your TV. You helped create this monster and now you are profiting from him”. Gessen, who wrote in the New Yorker that Wolf’s speech was “the most consequential monologue so far of the Donald Trump era” because it “burst the bubbles of civility and performance” playing out between the press and the president, said the media “dropped the ball” in its coverage of Trump during the campaign by “treating him as a normal candidate”. “I think the media covered Donald Trump exactly the way the media have covered elections for at least the last several election cycles which is horse race kind of coverage, it’s not about policy, it’s full of false equivalencies and its completely entertainment orientated,” she said. While Tur said that US voters decided they liked Trump “regardless of whether or not he was on cable news”, Morris said the media “created” Trump well before he ran for office. “There’s never been a person in any aspect of American politics this fluent in the television linguistic art,” he said. He said television networks, and by extension its viewers, found Trump “fascinating” because they were so used to seeing conventional politicians “operating in a certain mode of behaviour”. “We thought it was a joke and then increasingly it became less funny,” he said. “One of the things that’s astounding to me is, trying to figure out what to do with all the things we’ve never seen before. I think it just confused everybody.” But Gessen said that Trump “sailed to the White House on all the free air time he got”. He got plenty on Monday night."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"membership/2018/apr/30/how-the-windrush-scandal-showed-the-guardian-holding-power-to-account-katharine-viner","type":"article","sectionId":"membership","sectionName":"Membership","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T13:47:04Z","webTitle":"The Windrush scandal shows why we must hold power to account | Katharine Viner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2018/apr/30/how-the-windrush-scandal-showed-the-guardian-holding-power-to-account-katharine-viner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/membership/2018/apr/30/how-the-windrush-scandal-showed-the-guardian-holding-power-to-account-katharine-viner","fields":{"headline":"The Windrush scandal shows why we must hold power to account","bodyText":"The resignation of the British home secretary, Amber Rudd, over the Windrush scandal marks an important moment for independent, investigative journalism, demonstrating how it can hold power to account in order unequivocally to change people’s lives for the better. The Guardian reporter Amelia Gentleman has spent the past six months exposing the truth of the suffering of the Windrush generation, who arrived in the UK after the second world war from Caribbean countries at the invitation of the British government. Through her reporting, she has revealed case after case of cruelty to citizens who have lived and worked in the UK for decades, yet faced homelessness, destitution and detention, lost their jobs or been denied NHS treatment because they were unable to prove they were British – stemming from a policy, set out by the prime minister, Theresa May, when she was home secretary, to make the UK “a really hostile environment for illegal immigrants”. Amelia went on to exclusively report that the Home Office destroyed thousands of landing cards recording Windrush immigrants’ arrival dates in the UK, despite staff warnings, and that Downing Street rejected a diplomatic request to discuss the issue at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting. Nick Hopkins, our head of investigations, followed this by exposing how Rudd misled parliament, publishing leaks shared with him by people who trust the Guardian to expose the truth. The Guardian’s Windrush revelations have had such a big impact because they work on two powerful levels: the heart – where our reporting exposed so many deeply upsetting stories of people’s lives utterly ruined by the government’s immigration policies – and the head, where our political exposés finally forced accountability on the home secretary. Thank you to our readers, who worked with us to have this impact – by reading our stories, sharing them with your friends and family, getting in touch with us to share your views, expertise and experiences, offering and acting to help the Windrush generation, and by supporting our journalism financially. You’ve helped to ensure that even greater numbers of people hear about these stories, which has driven public debate and scrutiny up to the highest levels of government. We could not have done this without you. As Guy Hewitt, the high commissioner for Barbados, wrote in a letter to the Guardian: “In less than a week, a story that was for too long begging for attention became front page news and in the process won the hearts of a nation and engaged the mind of a government.” I’ve a feeling this isn’t going to be the end of the story – and we will remain committed to it every step of the way.

Our young people are some of the most overweight in Europe, are recording increasing levels of mental health issues, and are more likely to live a shorter life than their parents – a point I raised last week in the House of Lords. They’re also less likely to lead a financially stable life. Last Wednesday the leaders of the Labour, Scottish National, Lib Dem and Green parties sent a letter to the prime minister, coordinated by Jamie Oliver, calling for “a comprehensive strategy to tackle childhood obesity”. It included 13 recommendations, but there were two glaring omissions from the list: the role of physical activity, and improving mental health and wellbeing – a decision I find deeply disheartening in a “comprehensive” strategy. I recognise the positive impact that many of the recommendations could have, such as banning free offers for junk food and restrictions on advertising, and using tax incentives to make healthy food cheaper. But you cannot have a comprehensive strategy that looks only at diet, and ignores wider factors such as physical activity and mental health. Indeed, I was staggered to read the phrase “you can’t outrun a bad diet”. Factors that can support the health of a child shouldn’t be pitched in competition with each other, and to continue to peddle this tired cliche is both divisive and counterproductive to the ambition we share across all sectors: for every child to have the chance to live a happy, healthy life. The first step in winning this battle is to acknowledge a critical truth: the most important intervention to tackle obesity is to recognise that there is no magic bullet. Obesity is a complex disease, influenced by a multitude of factors. Any strategy, policy call or future manifesto should not view a child’s health through the narrow prism of what they eat, but put diet on an equal footing with mental health and physical activity. This August will mark the two-year anniversary of the government’s childhood obesity plan, which was an opportunity to put children’s health at the heart of policymaking and practice. But by focusing on calories in and calories out are we missing the bigger picture? Children are seldom the main decision-maker on the factors in their life that promote weight gain; they rarely choose what they eat (at home or at school); their activity levels are often subject to the depth of a parent’s purse; and they largely exist in educational settings that are forced to place more emphasis on standardised testing than on health and wellbeing. Isn’t it time to develop a plan for action that really supports these decision-makers and key influencers to promote and support health in a child’s life? A plan that helps parents to ensure that their children who get free school meals during term time carry on getting access to the right nutritional intake during school holidays; a plan that supports schools to embrace active curriculums by rewarding commitments to health and wellbeing; and a plan that directs revenue from initiatives such as the sugary drinks tax to those that need it most: the high-need communities disproportionately affected by obesity. At ukactive, we champion the physical, mental and social benefits that come from an active, healthy life. I have seen first hand the vital role that the physical activity sector – with its widespread workforce of coaches, youth workers, activity professionals, play workers, health mentors and community activators – has in helping to tackle childhood obesity. But we also recognise that our sector cannot achieve its ambitions for a healthier Britain alone. We cannot afford to waste any more time on isolated approaches. We must seek consensus across all political parties that obesity is a complex disease for which no single cause or cure exists. It’s never been clearer that we need to develop a cross-party strategy that drives an integrated approach to this fundamental issue. The diet and physical activity agendas are of equal importance, and both sectors have to work together. To shun a collaborative, holistic approach would be to jeopardise the future health and prosperity of the UK. • Tanni Grey-Thompson, a five-time Paralympian, chairs ukactive, promoting physical activity for children.

It is about a burning injustice that stretches from 10 Downing Street into the lives of thousands of British citizens. At its heart the Windrush crisis is about an immigration policy that was allowed to – even designed to – dehumanise, demonise and victimise British citizens. It is right that Amber Rudd has gone. She had lost control of what was going on in the Home Office and lost the confidence of her own civil servants. But the real issue is the hostile environment policy that caused this crisis in the first place, and her resignation must not distract from this fact. Each Windrush story is the hostile environment policy personified and writ large. Each case is directly linked to a policy that ignores the principle of habeas corpus by imprisoning innocent people without reference to a judge, jury or evidence of guilt. It is this policy that barred British citizens from accessing the public services and benefits that they themselves built with their own hands, staffed and paid for. It is this policy that turned employers, doctors, landlords and social workers into border guards. Described from the outset by its architect and champion, our current prime minister Theresa May, as “deport first, appeal later”, the hostile environment was aided and abetted by a hateful dog-whistle emanating from our tabloid press, reinforced by government ministers and politicians too craven to speak the truth about immigration, too weak and cowed to stand up for the rights of minorities. Toxic, anti-immigrant rhetoric created the demand for the hostile environment and then served to reinforce policies that addressed largely non-existent problems, pandered to the basest of prejudices and cowardly blamed immigrants for the failures of successive governments. As I previously said in the House of Commons, when you lay down with dogs you get fleas, and this government is in need of fumigation. There has been a desperate attempt on the right to separate race from immigration. But they are inseparable. The same prime minister who established a race disparity audit to reveal “difficult truths” also gave us the hostile environment. It is no coincidence that ministers and Whitehall mandarins in a government that failed to recruit a single black Caribbean person on to the civil service fast-stream programme last year saw black British citizens with Caribbean heritage as low-hanging fruit and easy targets. When the 2014 immigration bill passed through the House of Commons for its second reading, I described it as a stain on all that we have achieved as a democracy, ignorant of our history as a nation and harking back to the period when my father arrived in this country as a Windrush citizen to be met by “No Irish, no blacks, no dogs” signs. It is a tragedy that so many British citizens have had to suffer at the hands of this government before they took notice. In an effort to change the subject, cabinet ministers have been touring the studios trying to conflate the treatment of British citizens at the hands of their government with the issue of illegal immigration. Not only is this completely wrong and demonstrative of a worrying lack of understanding of the law, it is frankly insulting to those citizens who have been treated like criminals in their own country. Last Thursday during the last of her statements to the House of Commons the home secretary said “illegal” 23 times, but did not even once say the word “citizen”. Last Wednesday the prime minister said: “We owe it to them [the Windrush generation] and the British people.” This is the point the government still doesn’t understand. The Windrush generation are the British people – their citizenship is, and always has been, theirs by right. This is symptomatic of how the hostile environment operates. It blurs the lines, and raises questions about the status of Commonwealth British citizens, refugees and asylum seekers so that anybody who looks as though they could conceivably be an illegal immigrant is seen as such. Let’s not let government ministers change the subject to illegal immigration. At root the hostile environment is a policy rooted in pernicious cruelty designed to make life so difficult for people who are here legally that they simply give up and, as suggested by Theresa May’s vans, “go home”. I see the human impact of the policy every week in my constituency surgery. Tottenham has long been proud of its history as an open, diverse and multi-ethnic community so it was inevitable the hostile environment would flex its muscles there. Asylum seekers are banned from working, denied access to legal aid and unable to claim benefits so they seek legal support from a migrant support centre and sustenance from a soup kitchen run by a local church – both of which are in turn raided by Home Office enforcement. Increasing leave to remain fees for people who are here legally by 238% in four years is not about tackling illegal immigration. Changing the terms of asylum seekers’ “immigration bail” – itself an explicit attempt to blur the lines between seeking asylum and being a criminal by your very existence – so that they are barred from studying is not about illegal immigration. For every horrific case of detention and the denial of rights there is a public policy decision that delivered the hostile environment in which such injustices thrive and become normal. A minister falling on their sword is usually an attempt to draw a line under a scandal and encourage the media to move on. But the person sat in the hot seat at the Home Office makes no difference to the thousands of people suffering as a result of the hostile environment policy. An unjust law is no law at all. The Windrush generation will not get justice until it is the law that is changed, not just the home secretary. • David Lammy is Labour MP for Tottenham and the former minister for higher education"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"stage/2018/apr/30/michelle-wolf-the-unstoppable-rise-of-americas-provocative-political-comic","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T12:27:04Z","webTitle":"Michelle Wolf: the unstoppable rise of America's provocative political comic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/30/michelle-wolf-the-unstoppable-rise-of-americas-provocative-political-comic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/apr/30/michelle-wolf-the-unstoppable-rise-of-americas-provocative-political-comic","fields":{"headline":"Michelle Wolf: the unstoppable rise of America's provocative political comic","bodyText":"When Michelle Wolf arrived at the Edinburgh festival in 2016 she was the latest in a long line of bubbling-under US standups to use the fringe to hone their craft and build an international audience. She returned home with a nomination for best newcomer, and a reputation firmly established for smart, sly, social commentary – laughing in the gaps between political principle and personal weakness. Suffice it to say that, in the last 48 hours, that reputation has extended its reach thanks to her caustic routines about senior figures in the Trump administration at the White House correspondents’ dinner. I saw her perform twice at Edinburgh – in her own show So Brave, and then supporting Louis CK during his short run. What marked Wolf out, at a festival where more and more comics trade in storytelling or emotional intimacy, was the leanness and efficiency of her comedy. She was, in short, a pro – giving us just enough personal revelation and no more, alongside sharp and steely gags about modern feminism, abortion and dating. In light of this weekend’s hoo-ha, it’s interesting to note that – just as the storm clouds of a Trump presidency were gathering – her material on The Donald was strictly limited. “It’s hard to make a joke out of someone that’s a joke,” she told the Guardian in 2016. “After a while you’re like, ‘This is just sad.’” She was already well established as a political comic – having risen vertiginously through comedy since quitting investment banking in 2011. Wolf’s first regular TV gig was on Late Night with Seth Meyers, on which she appeared as Grown Up Annie – the joke being she looks like the orphan with the hard knock life. In April 2016, she flitted to The Daily Show, as a writer, correspondent and soon behind-the-desk sidekick to host Trevor Noah. Some cite as a breakthrough moment for Wolf the Daily Show broadcast immediately following 2016’s presidential election, when, discussing Hillary Clinton’s defeat, her voice cracked with tears. Wolf claims to be embarrassed that it happened, and she certainly doesn’t spare Clinton in her standup. “Women everywhere,” she joked in her Edinburgh set, “will look at Hillary Clinton as president and think, you can do anything you want to do. As long as your husband does it first.” She has continued to cultivate a UK profile, guesting on Frankie Boyle’s American Autopsy and Live at the Apollo. Many of the gags in So Brave ended up in the HBO special, Nice Lady, that Wolf released last year – the rave reviews for which established her ever more firmly as US comedy’s rising star. A New Yorker review of that broadcast went out of its way to praise Wolf’s overt feminism, in contrast to what the writer identified as standup’s default mode in the age of Louis CK: self-deprecating, self-loathing, morally null. It’s worth remembering that in light of the White House correspondents’ dinner furore, Wolf is not just some cheap shock merchant. Indeed, she’s on record as despairing of the trashiness of Trump-era discourse: “I would kill for a really boring policy thing,” she recently told the Hollywood Reporter, “that we had to work really hard to make funny, instead of just being thrown all of this, essentially just junk food.” This weekend, she took the junk food, and made mincemeat of it – opening herself up to the criticism that she’s gone as low (to paraphrase Michelle Obama) as Trump himself. It’s not really a criticism that sticks. For a start, this was a roast – not a tradition with which Brits are familiar, and certainly one that’s far removed from the moral high ground. Love it or loathe it, the point is to be outrageous. Then there’s the fact that Wolf is a comedian – who, far more so than a president, is licensed (expected, even) to provoke and transgress. Had Wolf been a man, the outcry might not have been quite so loud: Ricky Gervais has been getting away with this sort of thing for years. But Gervais saves his abuse for celebrities, whereas Wolf’s (contrary to the dubious accusation that she was criticising press secretary Sarah Sanders’ appearance) was explicitly political, underpinned by real moral outrage. Anyone who’s seen her standup won’t be surprised by it, nor by the sharpness of the jokes through which it expresses itself. Netflix will be licking its lips: it recently announced a new vehicle for Wolf, The Break, which premieres next month – the first trailer for which was released this weekend."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/30/hamburg-launch-their-greatest-bundesliga-escape-attempt-of-all","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T11:29:02Z","webTitle":"Hamburg launch their greatest Bundesliga escape attempt of all | Andy Brassell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/30/hamburg-launch-their-greatest-bundesliga-escape-attempt-of-all","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/30/hamburg-launch-their-greatest-bundesliga-escape-attempt-of-all","fields":{"headline":"Hamburg launch their greatest Bundesliga escape attempt of all","bodyText":"Teetering on the edge of the precipice might be a near-annual occurrence but this time, they’re balancing on one leg, juggling and eating fire at the same time, all while wearing their most spangled leotard. Not for nothing are Hamburger SV known as Der Dino, the only ever-presents in the Bundesliga since it began in 1963 but even so, their latest escape attempt is stretching the boundaries of credibility. Saturday’s 3-1 victory at Wolfsburg, themselves a storied name struggling to avoid a humiliating fall from the top flight, was simply “incomprehensible”, according to Hamburger Morgenpost. “Titz, Tore, Tiki-Taka,” was the far dizzier description from Bild. The Tore, the goals, are perhaps even the most surprising aspect of a genuinely arresting story, but while coach Christian Titz – their third of the season – and the manner of Hamburg’s upsurge in form both deserve note, it’s worth first taking stock of the fact that they’re in the conversation at all, rather than already being dead and buried. Just a fortnight ago, HSV were staring squarely down the barrel, after a 2-0 loss at Hoffenheim left them eight points adrift of safety with four games left. If they were to complete the great escape, it would be the greatest of all, statistically at least. No other team in Bundesliga history has been that far adrift and made it out. Having given themselves the smallest glimmer of hope with last week’s win over another struggling team in Freiburg (in all honesty, it would have barely raised an eyebrow from any other club without HSV’s formidable background in escapology), this was something else. Granted, Wolfsburg had been wobbling like an all-day drinker making their way out of the Bierkeller at closing time, and they were abject in last week’s thrashing at Borussia Mönchengladbach. They might have been there for the taking, but the 3,000 travelling fans who followed Hamburg to Lower Saxony would still have been erring on the side of hope rather than expectation. Despite the upturn under Titz, HSV were going into a must-win game having failed to triumph in an away game since the visit to Köln – and we all know how their season turned out – in August. Yet they attacked the occasion with real vigour from the off, with their urgency making Die Wölfe looks nervous and, in comparison, largely pedestrian. Former Hamburg coach Bruno Labbadia had shaken up the home side’s line-up, with his front three comprised of Divock Origi and Renato Steffen – both starting for the first time since February – and Jakub Blaszczykowski, making his first appearance since early November. For the bulk of this campaign HSV have, to paraphrase Big Daddy Kane, made a butter knife look like a machete, as the Bundesliga’s least prolific scorers. It all clicked here, though, for Titz, and the goals came. Bobby Wood showed great nerve in opening the scoring from the penalty spot towards the end of the first half, having not scored since August, a dry spell lasting 1,293 minutes. Tatsuya Ito, the diminutive winger who has at last added stamina to his flair in recent weeks, won the penalty and soon created the second for Lewis Holtby. After Josip Brekalo pulled one back for Wolfsburg in the second half, a blast from relegation escape past sealed the deal. “Lucky” Luca Waldschmidt smashed in the rebound after Koen Casteels stopped Filip Kostić’s stoppage-time penalty – his second Bundesliga goal, 11 months after his first, the late winner which condemned Wolfsburg to last season’s relegation play-off. “It’s time again,” he had smirked prophetically in the pre-match press conference. That’s exactly what it is. Having endured the play-off in two of the last four seasons and escaped it on the final day last time, this is the moment when the worries about HSV’s cyclical self-destructive behaviour take a backseat and we just focus on what they do – avoiding the worst by the skin of their teeth. “I always believed,” said midfielder Aaron Hunt, and why wouldn’t he? They always find a way, and they seem to be doing so again. Rather than dwelling on the myriad shortcomings of the season, HSV have hunkered down and installed an in-house mindset of being in their own World Cup. “Wolfsburg was our quarter-final,” said Titz afterwards, “and now we are in the semi-finals in Frankfurt”, referring to next Saturday’s trip to Eintracht. Should that be safely negotiated, all eyes will shift to the ‘final’, the last-day encounter with Europe-chasing Gladbach at the Volkspark. Titz deserves enormous credit. When he was promoted from the reserve team to replace Bernd Hollerbach in March, it felt like he was a cheap caretaker to preside over inevitable relegation and reconstruction, especially coming days after chairman Heribert Bruchhagen and director of football Jens Todt were removed. Instead, he had stoked belief from nowhere, with the revived Holtby the embodiment of it. “It’s the first time in [my] four years in Hamburg that we’re playing football,” he enthused the midfielder. Holtby was rebuked for that by Titz, who thought it disrespectful of recent HSV employees and blamed it on his player’s post-match “euphoria”. Quite honestly, though, it’s difficult to argue with Holtby’s conclusions – and the honesty that has awoken something inside what looked like a shell of a team. Labbadia, who saw HSV through the play-off three years ago, can only hope he might find something similar to steer Wolfsburg away from the plughole. Talking points • Wolfsburg ended the weekend alone in that relegation play-off place after Mainz’s win over tailspinning Leipzig. The 05ers’ victory was capped by a goal from debutant Ridle Baku, diverted en route to the reserves’ game at Freiburg towards the Opel Arena. Köln’s relegation was finally confirmed after their late defeat at Freiburg – it came at the end, however, of a generally positive week in which Jonas Hector and Timo Horn committed to staying and joining in next season’s promotion push. • Bayern limbered up for the Champions League return against Real Madrid with wholesale changes against future coach Niko Kovac’s Eintracht Frankfurt. Jupp Heynckes started with three teenagers and 20-year-old Niklas Dorsch – who looks likely to move on this summer – opened the scoring in a 4-1 win. • Schalke and Dortmund fell short in their attempts to secure Champions League football, held by Gladbach and Werder Bremen, respectively. BVB were kept out by goalkeeper Jiri Pavlenka, described as “world-class” by Marco Reus. There was bad news for Germany as Gladbach’s Lars Stindl ruptured ankle ligaments and will miss the World Cup, and the thigh muscle injury sustained by Serge Gnabry in Hoffenheim’s 3-1 win over Hannover might means he follows suit, though Julian Nagelsmann’s side moved into the top four. • Just behind, it’s all going wrong for Bayer Leverkusen, with Lucas Alario missing a penalty as they lost at home to Stuttgart, with Mario Gómez telling Sky: “We were Real Madrid today.” That might be stretching it, but they are European contenders as they continue their soaring form under Tayfun Korkut."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/01/new-juice-range-made-from-wonky-fruit-and-veg-aims-to-cut-waste","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T05:01:32Z","webTitle":"New juice range made from wonky fruit and veg aims to cut waste","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/01/new-juice-range-made-from-wonky-fruit-and-veg-aims-to-cut-waste","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/01/new-juice-range-made-from-wonky-fruit-and-veg-aims-to-cut-waste","fields":{"headline":"New juice range made from wonky fruit and veg aims to cut waste","bodyText":"‘Wonky’ fruit and vegetables that would have been thrown away are now being used to make a new range of juices, in one of a number of assaults on food waste. One of the UK’s largest fresh produce growers has teamed up with a Spanish fruit supplier to create a new product, Waste Not, which will stop edible but visually ‘imperfect’ ingredients such as fresh celery, beetroot and oranges from being dug back into the soil, or used for animal feed. The new juices will go on sale in branches of Tesco. The move is one of a growing number of innovations to reduce food waste throughout the supply chain, following criticism of supermarkets and suppliers that perfectly good food is being thrown out while UK consumers are relying increasingly on food banks. Supermarket chains have been selling ‘wonky veg’ ranges for some time, at discounted prices to make them more appealing to consumers. In April, Morrisons added wonky chillies to its misshapen fruit and veg range – the same heat and flavour but costing 39% less than standard chillies. Defects include missing stalks, imperfect colour and extreme curves. Meanwhile, companies such as Rubies in the Rubble specialise in making chutneys and sauces from surplus ingredients that would otherwise go to waste, and in May is launching a new range of ‘vegan-friendly mayonnaise’ (made from aquafaba, the liquid in tinned chick peas) through Ocado. Soft fruit, root vegetables and salad are particularly prone to waste. One in 10 strawberries in the UK ended up as waste according to a recent study by the government’s food waste reduction advisory body Wrap – equivalent to 10,000 tonnes and valued at £24m. And one in five lettuces were unharvested, with 38,000 tonnes lost with a value of £7m. Celery is one of the worst areas. Mike Bullock of Waste Not found that half all celery grown in the UK was discarded before it even gets past the farm gate. “It’s the same with oranges that are ‘ugly on the outside but still beautiful and juicy on the inside. We couldn’t sit by and watch all this healthy produce be put in the bin.” In the US the problem is even worse. Americans throw away almost as much food as they eat because of a “cult of perfection”, inflicting a heavy environmental toll. UK suppliers may have advanced forecasting and ordering systems, but they often have to manage crop flushes, or ‘bumper crops’. “We can literally go from feast to famine and back again with huge surpluses to deal with,” said Mark Haynes, commercial director for G’s, which has teamed up with Spanish fruit grower AMC to create the new Waste Not range of juices. All the fruit and vegetables in the drinks will be cold-pressed – which involves squeezing the juice in small batches instead of heat-pasteurising it. Putting the juice under high pressure in this way maintains freshness. At £1.50 per 250ml bottle, the range will undercut the premium prices typically charged in the ‘trendy’ cold-press juice drink market and it is hoped that within the first 12 weeks of going on sale will save around 3.5 tonnes of surplus or waste fruit and vegetables. “These juice drinks are the latest way that we are helping tackle food waste by ensuring as much of the crop as possible gets used,” said Tesco prepared fruit buyer Jo Batty. “The fruit and vegetables being used in the range fall outside the specifications for fresh produce and offer shoppers a great taste.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/may/02/the-computer-glitch-that-led-to-the-breast-screening-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T18:18:22Z","webTitle":"The computer glitch that led to 450,000 cancelled breast screenings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/02/the-computer-glitch-that-led-to-the-breast-screening-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/02/the-computer-glitch-that-led-to-the-breast-screening-disaster","fields":{"headline":"The computer glitch that led to 450,000 cancelled breast screenings","bodyText":"Up to 450,000 women in England were not called for their last mammogram before they turned 70 because of a computer failure that goes back to 2009, health secretary Jeremy Hunt has told the House of Commons. He said some women will have avoidably died as a result. Not everybody agrees with him. Up to 80,000 of these women were enrolled in AgeX, a major NHS trial designed to find out whether extra screening would protect older women from breast cancer. When the trial began in 2009, the records of the women taking part had a “flag” on the NHS system, which meant they did not receive any more routine invitations for screening. Half of those taking part in the trial would have been screened as part of the trial, but the other half would not, enabling researchers to work out whether screening beyond the age of 70 actually saves lives or not. Hunt told the House of Commons it has taken 10 years for the mistake to be recognised. Some cancers that could have been picked up early and treated will have been missed, he said. As many as 207 women may have died unnecessarily, a tragedy for the women and their families. Women are called for breast screening in the UK every three years between the ages of 50 and 70. Not all choose to go, in the light of global findings from researchers that the x-ray screening, called a mammogram, can pick up very small cancers and benign growths that will never cause the woman harm – especially in older people. Last year had the lowest breast screening uptake ever in England, at 71%. In some areas, it was even lower – the lowest was 55.4%. But at the same time there has been pressure from breast screening advocates and patient groups to extend it to both younger and older women. The AgeX trial was set up in 2009 to test whether cancers could be usefully picked up, without undue harm, in those aged 47 to 49 and those aged 71 to 73. Across England, 65 breast cancer units recruited women in these two age groups. A computer program selected at random half of the extra women to be screened and half not to be screened. All the women in the older group, aged 71 to 73, should have had a last routine scan three years after their last mammogram and before their 70th birthday. But the NHS screening computer program appears to have cancelled it. That will have meant that some women entering the trial had their final screening aged 67 or 68. Half the participants were randomly assigned to extra screening. It is the 80,000 in the other arm, the control group, who were first identified as having had their final screening cancelled. It then emerged that this had happened not just to women in the AgeX trial but across the NHS breast screening programme, affecting an estimated 450,000 women, according to Public Health England. Hunt spoke of a disaster and apologised to women, but although he and the breast cancer charities talked in apocalyptic terms, not everybody shared that interpretation of what had happened. Since January, Public Health England has been investigating and talking to experts, some of whom say it is not as clear cut as Hunt made it appear. Sir Richard Peto, professor of medical statistics at Oxford University where the AgeX study is run, said what has not been understood is that the screening system works on a three-year cycle. That means some women have their last mammogram at 67, some at 68, some at 69 and some at 70. That’s how the screening system was set up. They have never been offered a last screening specifically in the year of their 70th birthday. “That automatically means there is going to be a three-year variation. It is misleading to describe this as a disaster,” he told the Guardian. The randomised trials in AgeX have not yet been concluded, so there is no good evidence as yet even as to the benefits of screening women over 70. “There is substantial uncertainty as to whether screening is appropriate for older women because although it will pick up some cancers, it will also lead to quite a lot of unnecessary surgical treatment and worry,” said Peto. The age of last screening is also somewhat random. There is little difference in risk - as far as anyone knows - between the age of 67 and the age of 70 or 71. The health secretary also acknowledged several times in his statement to the House of Commons that there is no consensus among experts as to whether the benefits of screening for older women outweigh the harms. But there may still be women whose cancers could have been caught at an early stage and dealt with before they could do serious harm, who have died instead. An inquiry chaired by Lynda Thomas, the chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support, and Prof Martin Gore from the Royal Marsden cancer hospital will look into each case to find out whether a system that was supposed to help women, actually let some of them down and led to avoidable deaths.

Co-op Funeralcare reports growing interest in direct cremations – a cheaper and more basic option than the normal service, with no mourners present, typically followed by a scattering of ashes or memorial service at a later date. The plan is revealed as the Co-op prepares to hold a large-scale national study into dying in the UK, in an effort to break taboos around bereavement preparations and ensure the wishes of the deceased are followed. The survey aims to engage with at least 20,000 adults over the next few weeks, as an initial poll by the Co-op showed 50% of respondents saying that more open conversations about death would have helped them cope with bereavement. The Co-op is working with a number of charities, including British Red Cross, Child Bereavement UK and Dying Matters, to find solutions. “We know that talking about death is one of the hardest conversations people have to have and many choose to avoid it,” said David Collingwood, director of funerals at Co-op Funeralcare. “But having to make lots of decisions under pressure can add to the stress and pain of bereavement. We would really encourage people to discuss or write down their wishes.” Collingwood said many people did not ask for “direct cremations” because they were not aware they existed. But following the death of the musician David Bowie, there has been growing interest in this no-frills option. Bowie, who died in January 2016, was cremated with none of his family or friends present after telling his loved ones he did not want a funeral service (his ashes were scattered in Bali). Co-op Funeralcare is the UK’s largest funeral director with a network of more than 1,000 funeral homes, which conduct almost 100,000 funerals each year. It is aiming to offer “direct cremation” for between £1,000 and £1,500. A standard funeral could cost between £2,500 and £3,000, with prices rising with inclusions of expensive flowers, cars and catering. Jeff Brazier, a life coach, presenter and author of The Grief Survival Guide, said: “Having experienced the impact of death and bereavement firsthand I can’t stress enough how important it is to talk about the topic, and you’re never too young for it to impact you. The more we talk about it the less a taboo it becomes – helping us become more comfortable with one of life’s inevitabilities.’’ •This article was amended on 3 May 2018 to add a reference to Child Bereavement UK and amend the planned cost of a Co-op “direct cremation” which the article originally gave as £1,400-£1,500."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/may/06/othello-liverpool-everyman-flawed-adaptation","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T06:00:13Z","webTitle":"Othello review – a contemporary conundrum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/06/othello-liverpool-everyman-flawed-adaptation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/may/06/othello-liverpool-everyman-flawed-adaptation","fields":{"headline":"Othello review – a contemporary conundrum","bodyText":"Since a play is a world of make-believe, gender-blind and colour-blind casting seems to me all of a piece with the pretence. Similarly, altering the time and place of the action is not intrinsically problematic. After all, the fiction has life because of our collective agreement to suspend our disbelief. So that is no reason why a woman should not play Othello. In director Gemma Bodinetz’s new production for her repertory company, however, Othello is not just played by a woman: she is a woman living in our present time. For me, this raises a problem. My reservations have nothing to do with the performance by Golda Rosheuvel, who is magnificent in the title role. The problem is one of coherence. The world that Shakespeare creates in this tragedy is one where honour is defined by behaviour and practices that are collectively recognised in a way not common today and where the lives of men and women were more separate and therefore more mysterious to one another. All of the relationships in the play are affected by these facts. Othello’s desperate resolution to kill Desdemona (Emily Hughes) once Iago (Patrick Brennan) has convinced him of her infidelity with Cassio (Cerith Flinn) is taken not only because he is jealous, but also because he believes his honour has been tainted by his wife’s behaviour; his honour is restored by her death. Here, the changes mean that the tragedy springs from Othello’s emotional state, disconnected from social pressures. While the character Rosheuvel presents is credible, the world she inhabits, therefore, is not. • At the Everyman, Liverpool, until 10 July.

There was a compelling proof of concept in USA 94, which set a World Cup attendance record that still stands with nearly 3.6m spectators (for only 52 matches), auguring record-smashing profits for the expanded 48-team, 80-match tournament in 2026. There was a nod toward the fiscally responsible, infrastructure-ready leanings of the moment: the US is one of the few countries on the planet with enough world-class stadiums and airports to host the World Cup tomorrow if it needed to. Perhaps most crucially there was the weakened field of potential hosts, with Europe and Asia sidelined under Fifa’s continental rotation system and no other major player in the race and none on the horizon. There were even preemptive measures seemingly designed to temper concerns over the incendiary politics of the recently inaugurated Donald Trump, whose calls for a wall on the Mexican border had heightened tensions in the region. The fine print made it clear this was an American bid dressed up as a joint enterprise: the United States would host 60 games, including every match from the quarter-finals onwards, with Mexico and Canada splitting the remaining 20 fixtures equally. But the enlisting of the United States’ neighbors as junior partners, when a single-country bid would have been easily achievable, lent overtones of inclusion to the enterprise. “We have the full support of the United States government in this project,” then-US Soccer president Sunil Gulati said. “The president of the United States is fully supportive and encouraged us to have this joint bid. He is especially pleased that Mexico is part of this bid.” Apparently not even the divisive America First bluster of Trump could get in the way. Even when Morocco announced a bid only hours before the August deadline to deny the United States an unopposed victory, the North American bid felt like a stone-cold lock. But with less than six weeks until the host country is decided at the 68th Fifa Congress in Moscow, a constellation of factors have narrowed the race and left the North American bid looking as vulnerable as ever – with no shortage of blame at the foot of Trump. At things stand 206 of Fifa’s member nations are eligible to vote in the one-country, one-vote contest and Trump has managed to complicate America’s path to victory significantly. There are the administration’s foreign policies, which include the controversial travel ban against mostly Arab nations. There was the global shock prompted by Trump’s rhetoric in describing poorer countries, including the “shithole countries” in Africa who incidentally account for 54 votes, more than half of the 104 necessary to win. And that was before this week and Trump’s thinly veiled quid pro quo appeals to foreign nations to support the bid, which appear to run afoul of Fifa guidelines barring the use of political influence during the bidding process. Trump’s Twitter threat last week warning nations mulling a vote against the North American bid prompted the gentlest of admonishment from the worldwide governing body. And then came Monday’s joint White House press conference with Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari, where Trump doubled down. “I hope all African countries and countries throughout the world, that we also will be supporting you and that they will likewise support us in our bid, along with Canada and Mexico, for the 2026 World Cup,” he said. “We will be watching very closely, and any help they can give us in that bid we would appreciate.” Trump appeared to tie the issue to trade, saying the United States hopes “to be the economic partner of choice for nations across the continent and all around the world”. “You see what’s happening with respect to trade and the United States. We are being respected again,” he added. The mafia undertones were unmistakable: We’ve got a nice deal here. It would be a shame if something were to happen to it. Throw in lingering resentment over the US department of justice investigation into Fifa corruption and it’s no surprise the race, where for the first time balloting will be made public, has gotten hairy. Morocco for its part has put together a compelling underdog bid, casting perceived weaknesses as strengths. The proposal offers a more compact experience relative to North America’s sprawling three-country plan. And a time zone closer to Western Europe and Africa will be of no small consequence. As the bid literature reads: “Morocco’s sweet spot location will allow the majority of fans to watch (World Cup) games in prime time, driving Fifa’s TV revenues.” And the North African country is also a compelling bridesmaid, having fallen short in four previous bids (1994, 1998, 2006 and 2010). Three years ago, the Telegraph reported that Morocco had, in fact, won the vote to host the 2010 competition – even though Fifa awarded the tournament to South Africa. There’s no question anything but a North American win in June would be a major surprise, the magnitude of upset that requires a constellation of factors to align correctly. Yet, one by one those tumblers appear to be falling in place. Which means the United States, less than a year after suffering the most stunning humiliation in the history of the national team, could face an even bigger shocker off the pitch."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/02/pmqs-verdict-corbyn-delivers-broad-attack-but-may-scores-on-detail","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T14:26:30Z","webTitle":"PMQs verdict: Corbyn delivers broad attack but May scores on council tax","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/02/pmqs-verdict-corbyn-delivers-broad-attack-but-may-scores-on-detail","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/02/pmqs-verdict-corbyn-delivers-broad-attack-but-may-scores-on-detail","fields":{"headline":"PMQs verdict: Corbyn delivers broad attack but May scores on council tax","bodyText":"Key points Both Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn paid tribute to the former Speaker Michael Martin, who has died aged 72. Corbyn kicked off his six questions by asking May whether she felt guilty about Amber Rudd having to resign for failures of her predecessor at the Home Office. May suggested she update the house on what actions the government was taking to help the Windrush generation. She announced a review into what went wrong, which will report before parliament’s summer recess. Corbyn moved on to say the economy was another government failure – with Britain the slowest-growing economy in the G7 and growth figures the worst in five years. May said day-to-day spending was in surplus for the first time in years, net borrowing was the lowest in more than a decade and exports and employment were at record highs. Corbyn said more people were in debt, more used food banks and more slept on our streets while more children lived in poverty. The NHS was suffering the longest funding squeeze in history. Will May apologise to NHS patients waiting longer than ever? he asked. May said there were more people in work, and fewer children in absolute poverty. She said the chancellor had announced £10bn extra for the NHS but that it was also about how you spent that money and reformed the NHS. Corbyn said March was the worst month on record for A&amp;E and cancelled operations. There were thousands of NHS vacancies. But May intervened personally to stop the NHS hiring from abroad. He said the education secretary used to say there would be no cut in schools funding. Last week, he refused to repeat that pledge. Will May admit schools budgets are being cut? he added. May said there was more money for schools. It was not just a question of how much money you put in. She said 1.9 million children were in good or outstanding schools. Corbyn said the UK Statistics Authority said budgets were being cut. Yet May was in denial. And police budgets were an issue too. Home Office civil servants said there was a link between budget cuts and rising crime. May said she had protected police budgets while Andy Burnham proposed cuts when he was shadow home secretary. Corbyn said the shadow police minister was pointing to a cut in police budgets. He said about 21,000 officers had lost their jobs since 2010; violent crime was rising; and deaths from knife crime were going up, especially in London. The government was making a complete shambles of Brexit, damaging the NHS, damaging schools, and yet they claimed to be strong and stable. With council tax rising by more than 5% all over the country, wasn’t the truth that with the Tories you pay more and get less? May said there was more funding going into the NHS, schools and social care. If Corbyn wanted to talk about council tax, he should go to Hazelbourne Road in Clapham. On one side, houses in Labour Lambeth pay about £1,400 a year. On the other side, in Conservative Wandworth, people pay about £700. Snap verdict That wasn’t really a PMQs at all; we just had two PPBs (party political broadcasts) blaring away in tandem, doing little to enlighten anyone. Corbyn’s PPB was better on passion, and it covered wider ground – in fact, there was little area of public policy where he failed to castigate the government – but May probably did better on specific, memorable detail (her Hazelbourne Road anecdote). The local elections take place on Thursday, and so perhaps this wasn’t surprising. Corbyn did start with a neat, sassy question about Windrush. But May’s announcement about an inquiry into what went wrong disarmed him, and also helped to explain why the Tory whips felt comfortable about ordering their MPs to vote against the Labour motion calling for all confidential government paperwork on Windrush to be disclosed later this afternoon. The government clearly feels that this will be enough to contain demands for the full disclosure of documents, although the inquiry she announced sounded very minimalist. She described it as a “full review of lessons learned” rather than a proper inquiry, and it does not sound as if it will be especially independent. (She talked about “independent oversight and external challenge”, which is not quite the same as having an independent person in charge.) It will also concluded before the end of July, which means it may be one of the shortest inquiries on record. Memorable lines Jeremy Corbyn on Amber Rudd’s resignation: Did the prime minister feel the slightest pang of guilt when the home secretary was forced to resign due to failures of her predecessor? Theresa May on council tax increases: If he wants to talk about council tax … I suggest he goes to Hazelbourne Road in Clapham. On one side of the road in a typical home someone will pay nearly £1,400 in council tax. That is in Labour-run Lambeth. On the other side of the road, someone in a typical home will be just over £700 in council tax. That’s in Conservative-run Wandsworth. No clearer example can there be that Conservative councils cost you less."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/02/windrush-scandal-lawyers-prepare-compensation-claims","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T16:51:58Z","webTitle":"Windrush scandal: lawyers prepare compensation claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/02/windrush-scandal-lawyers-prepare-compensation-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/02/windrush-scandal-lawyers-prepare-compensation-claims","fields":{"headline":"Windrush scandal: lawyers prepare compensation claims","bodyText":"Lawyers have begun preparing group compensation claims on behalf of members of the Windrush generation who were denied services, wrongfully detained or forced out of work. The threat of legal action comes as the Home Office develops an official redress scheme that it hopes will be seen as sufficiently generous to prevent cases coming to court. The injustices were intensified, according the Law Society, by deep cuts to legal aid that deprived individuals of advice and support over their residential status at the moment they most needed it to cope with the government’s “hostile environment” policy. Support for immigration claims was withdrawn by the coalition government’s Legal Aid Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders (Laspo) Act. Figures since then record a dramatic decline. Legal aid for immigration was granted for 22,496 cases in 2012-13, but number had fallen to three by 2016-17. The London law firm Leigh Day is already working on compensation claims on behalf of people who lost their jobs or were denied entry to the UK after they went on holiday to the Caribbean. It has not yet lodged papers with the courts. Jamie Beagent, a solicitor at the firm, said most would be brought as unlawful discrimination but some could top the higher legal threshold of degrading treatment outlawed under article 3 of the European convention on human rights. “We have one case where someone who had been on holiday in Jamaica was detained on his return at the airport and deported,” said Beagent. “In another case, someone was escorted from their workplace by immigration officers. “Most of them were born in the Caribbean, but a couple are Canadians who came here in the 1960s before the 1971 Immigration Act.” Commonwealth immigrants who arrived before 1971 acquired, without the need for documents, an automatic indefinite right to remain. Many had been invited to Britain to help rebuild the economy after the war. “We would be aiming to bring in test cases to establish that the ‘hostile environment’ discriminated against the Windrush generation. “Whilst we welcome the news that the government intends to set up a compensation scheme for these British citizens, we know very little more. We are also sceptical that such a scheme will adequately recompense our clients for what they have been through and what they have lost, and seems to be a failed crisis-management ploy. “Whilst Amber Rudd may have resigned, it was the current prime minister who made this policy real for many thousands of British citizens.” Beagant said compensation claims for wrongful detention usually amounted to as much as £12,000 a month from when an individual was first wrongfully held. Theresa May said last week that the Home Office would “set out the details of that compensation scheme in due course”. The Law Society, which represents solicitors across England and Wales, said the Windrush scandal highlighted the dangers posed by government cuts to legal aid for immigration issues. “As far too many people who came to the UK as children now know, an immigration issue can quickly spiral out of control with disastrous consequences. Jobs are lost, health and social services denied, in the worst cases people are detained and face deportation, despite having every right to call this country their home,” said Joe Egan, the Law Society president. “When the fallout can be so catastrophic, we believe that legal aid is essential so anybody facing such an unjust scenario can get legal advice right at the outset, whatever their circumstances. “The results of the government’s long-awaited review of the impact of cuts to legal aid are urgently needed. Thousands of people who were eligible for legal aid on one day – 31 March 2013 – became ineligible the very next day. When people cannot access advice or protect their rights, effectively those rights do not exist.” Half of the Home Office’s immigration decisions were overturned when reviewed by a judge, Egan pointed out, saying this provided clear evidence the system was broken. “Legal aid is a lifeline for the vulnerable. Early legal advice can help people resolve problems quickly and prevent them from having to rely on welfare support or involve the courts. This makes a real difference to the individual and saves taxpayers money.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/may/02/loyalty-to-navy-shirts-means-monagamous-relationshps","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T11:50:02Z","webTitle":"Is a man who wears the same thing every day more likely to be monogamous?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/may/02/loyalty-to-navy-shirts-means-monagamous-relationshps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/may/02/loyalty-to-navy-shirts-means-monagamous-relationshps","fields":{"headline":"Is a man who wears the same thing every day more likely to be monogamous?","bodyText":"My partner only wears navy T-shirts and jeans on weekdays. Is his fashion monogamy a good sign for us, or is he going to have a midlife crisis and buy a pair of cerise jorts? Helen, London I’ll be honest, Helen, I hadn’t previously considered the correlation between fashion and fidelity, but I do think you have a point here. After all, in my experience, contrary to all those women’s magazine/Daily Mail headlines of the “What every woman should know to keep their man!!!” variety, most males are deeply monogamous in nature. Buckle up, everyone, while we enter the galaxy of … Sweeping Gender Generalisations! From my vantage point, at the coalface of gender observations, the majority of men, once they’re in a relationship for the long haul, just want to bed in. By which I mean they don’t want to have to make the kinds of efforts they once made when they were single. They get a bit fat, they go a bit bald, and that’s just fine with them because they’ve had enough of the hassle that they think goes into impressing prospective paramours. They’ve got their partner so can they just get some takeaway, watch Netflix and let their bellies flop over their jeans with secret elasticated waist, please? This explains why, over the age of 35, men tend to settle into a daily uniform, whether that’s a suit or (bad) jeans, (worse) khakis and neutral – meaning blue, white or tartan – shirts (men, for some reason, consider tartan to be a neutral on a button-down shirt, similar to the way women think of leopard print as a neutral when it’s on anything). This also explains why often the most untrustworthy men are the ones with the most inconsistent dress sense. I mean, look at Gavin Rossdale: one day a sexually ambiguous goth, the next a grunge rocker, the next a trendy Silverlake dad. Anyone could see which way this was going and, allegedly, it was going straight to shagging the nanny. Or Ben Affleck, who for years couldn’t figure out if he was a hunky leading man or an edgy indie director, and his oscillating clothing choices reflected that. He is now nicely settled into a T-shirt-wearing, fortysomething-dad groove but, alas, it allegedly took dating the nanny to find it. True, Donald Trump has been wearing suits since he was three years old and has probably grabbed the pussy of every pussy-possessing person who crossed his path. But then, there’s a consistency to that, as much as there is in his wardrobe. So what I’m saying, Helen, is I see nothing but promise in a partner who settles into a work uniform pretty much two minutes after getting married. He has found his thing and he’s sticking with it; and I’m afraid that by “thing”, in this instance, I mean both the navy T-shirts and you. But, as we’ve already discussed, blue T-shirts are pretty much man’s greatest invention in many men’s eyes, so take it as a compliment. I think there are a lot of advantages to being with a man who wears the same thing every day, beyond the reassurance of fidelity. The primary one is with the time he saves in the morning by not having to decide what to wear, he can bring you tea in bed. But I would suggest he reassure his colleagues he’s not wearing the actual same clothes every day. Perhaps you could get some cards printed up for him to hand round the office. As for your fear of cerise jorts, I understand the concern, but I think it is misplaced. For a start, I strongly suspect a man who wears navy every day doesn’t even know what cerise is, let alone jorts, so this would be like worrying about him running off with Dua Lipa. He would need to Google just to get started here, so let’s not waste time worrying about the non-existent. At most, he might dally with what I call “man ‘fashion’”. These are fashion twists that conservative men allow themselves to indulge in because they think they are fun and they convince themselves they don’t threaten their masculinity. Absurd shoes are very much man fashion, as are watches, oddly patterned button-down shirts and waistcoats. Do not worry: this is just the sartorial equivalent of your partner getting a harmless little hobby, like fly fishing, or Dungeons &amp; Dragons. At heart, he’s still your navy T-shirted guy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/06/celebrity-species-leonardo-dicaprio-water-beetle-barack-obama-spiders","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T05:59:12Z","webTitle":"Celebrity species: from the DiCaprio water beetle to Obama spiders","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/06/celebrity-species-leonardo-dicaprio-water-beetle-barack-obama-spiders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/06/celebrity-species-leonardo-dicaprio-water-beetle-barack-obama-spiders","fields":{"headline":"Celebrity species: from the DiCaprio water beetle to Obama spiders","bodyText":"Leonardo DiCaprio A new species of water beetle, discovered by scientists in Borneo, has been named after the Oscar-winning star of The Revenant.

Tourists are promised safety, comfort and the ghoulish thrill of visiting the site where, at 1.23am on 26 April 1986, an explosion at the nuclear plant’s reactor No 4 created the largest peacetime nuclear disaster in history. The adjacent city of Prypiat, which grew up around Chernobyl, is a latter-day Pompeii. It has remained uninhabited since the Soviet authorities belatedly ordered the evacuation of its population 36 hours after the plant first began spewing lethal radiation into the atmosphere. When, in 2015, the Ukrainian parliament ordered the removal of all Communist party statues from the country’s streets and squares, Prypiat and the 18-mile radius exclusion zone around Chernobyl became a “time capsule” and a “communist preserve”. There, Lenin and co still gaze down triumphantly on the desolation. In this compelling history of the disaster and its aftermath, Serhii Plokhy presents Chernobyl as a terrifying emblem of the terminal decline of the Soviet system. The turbine test that went catastrophically wrong was not, he argues, a freak occurrence but a disaster waiting to happen. It had deep roots in the party’s reckless obsession with production targets and in the pliant nuclear industry’s alarming record of cutting corners to cut costs. Plokhy’s well-paced narrative plunges the reader into the sweaty, nervous tension of the Chernobyl control room on the fateful night when human frailty and design flaws combined to such devastating effect. Men with dozens of years’ experience in the nuclear industry were confounded when they found themselves unable to arrest the rising temperature in the reactor and an enormous explosion rocked the plant. After crucial hours passed in confusion and denial, they acknowledged that the core of the reactor was on fire and that it was emitting radiation into the night sky through a gaping hole in the roof. The authorities’ subsequent attempts to contain the fire were a signature Soviet mix of improvisation, heroism and ineptitude. Exposing themselves to lethal levels of radiation, helicopter crews made repeated flights over the burning reactor, dropping 5,000 tonnes of sand, clay and lead in an ultimately successful bid to extinguish the fire. In so doing, they prevented the very real possibility of a second much larger explosion that might have rendered the entire European continent uninhabitable. Woefully misjudging the scale of the disaster, the Kremlin insisted that the Ukrainian authorities go ahead with the organisation of the May Day parade in central Kiev just as radiation levels in the city were spiking. Crowds lined the streets to cheer the achievements of Soviet socialism while their leaders, who knew of the explosion only 80 miles away, looked down on families oblivious to the danger. With both radiation readings and the demand for information in western Europe rising and Ukrainian hospitals admitting hundreds of patients suffering from radiation sickness, the Kremlin finally broke its silence almost three days after the accident. The public clamour for detailed information about the threat to health quickly proved unstoppable. On the brink of glasnost, Chernobyl helped prise open the vice of Soviet censorship, forcing the regime to publicly confront its failings and their dreadful consequences for the country. If the Soviet command economy was the ultimate villain at Chernobyl, it came into its own in the Herculean clean-up operation. Close to 600,000 Soviet citizens, many of them army reservists, were mobilised at great personal risk to gather up radioactive debris scattered by the explosion, demolish irradiated villages and move contaminated soil. The military buried the “Red Forest”, a four-square-mile expanse of pine trees that had turned red after absorbing radiation. The clean-up was crowned by the construction of a metal and concrete “sarcophagus” over the entire reactor. Plokhy gives a balanced and sympathetic account of the experiences of the senior scientists, engineers and politicians who extinguished the reactor fire, organised the evacuation of the region and contained the radioactive contamination. Yet the firefighters, reservists, teachers, farmers, doctors and schoolchildren caught up in the disaster have only walk-on roles in his narrative. The Belorussian Nobel laureate Svetlana Alexievich’s harrowing symphony of interviews about the disaster Chernobyl Prayer: A Chronicle of the Future contains a rich trove of sources that here go mostly untapped. Plokhy’s most penetrating chapters deal with the political fallout. Attempts by Moscow to downplay design flaws in the reactor and to make scapegoats of a handful of managers and operators failed to reassure public opinion in a new era of open discussion. Chernobyl, Plokhy writes, “ended one era and initiated another”. It helped to transform the slow-burn of Soviet environmental protests into an explosive form of eco-nationalism. Where Ukrainian intellectuals had once embraced nuclear power as an emblem of modernity, they now shunned it as a baleful symptom of Soviet imperialism. The poet Ivan Drach, one of the leaders of the democratic movement Rukh, later recalled that “Chernobyl roused our souls, showing us in real terms that we were on the edge of an abyss”. The only way to safeguard Ukraine from a repeat of the disaster was independence from Moscow. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 was powered by a wave of popular revolts in the non-Russian republics.

I doubt the word “migrant” conjures up images of Cristiano Ronaldo, Kate Winslet or Albert Einstein. That’s not what people mean when they talk about migrants. But it should be. The most successful football player in the world, an actor in the second most successful film of all time, and one of the smartest people in history are technically all migrants. I’m not cherrypicking here either. My own research shows that 55% of international footballers, almost half of the best actor and best actress Oscar nominees since 2000, and about one third of Nobel prize nominees since 1901 were migrants. The UN migration agency defines a migrant as “any person who is moving or has moved across an international border or within a state away from his/her habitual place of residence, regardless of legal status; reason/cause for the movement; or length of the stay in the destination country”. The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs counts as “international migrants” people who are living in a country outside of the place where they were born or the country where they hold a passport. The UN recommends that anyone staying in another country for longer than three months can be considered an international migrant. Ronaldo, Winslet and Einstein would definitely make the cut. Ronaldo is a Portuguese citizen who has been employed in England and Spain for most of his career; Winslet, who is British, has been working in the US and living there for long stretches throughout her career; German Nobel prize winner Einstein worked at Princeton University for more than 20 years and acquired US citizenship in 1940. The UN estimates that there are approximately 258 million international migrants in the world – that’s 3.4% of the world’s population. But it’s a lot more common in football, acting and academia than on average around the world. People do not often associate migration with the rich and famous, but the data tells a different story. My analysis based on Fifa 2017 statistics reveals that 55% of all active players who played for a national team in 2017 played for a club outside of the country where they hold citizenship. More than 90% of players for the national teams of Colombia, Belgium, Ireland, Sweden and Switzerland played for a club abroad; 87% of the Argentinian national team and 83% of the Brazilian national team earned their money outside of their country of citizenship. The average is lower for the larger European teams: 48% of Spanish national players, 39% of French and German, and 13% of Italians were de facto migrants. Out of the 100 best-rated players in 2017, 72 were migrants. These stats do not even include players who were born in a different country to the one they were raised in, and later acquired citizenship. Browsing through data on all Academy Award nominees for best actor and best actress since the year 2000 shows that, on average, 41% of those beautiful and talented people are or were migrants. Either they were born abroad and moved to Hollywood or they have at least worked in the US for an extended period of time. Either makes them a migrant. There are more female migrants in Hollywood than males: 45% of female nominees were born outside the US or hold a non-US passport compared with 33% of male ones. Most of them may well be British, Australian or Canadian, but just because the majority of “foreign” actors speak English as their mother tongue does not make them any less of a migrant. Based on analysis of all Nobel laureates since 1901, it turns out that 29% of all those nominated for a Nobel prize in their respective discipline were migrants. “Migrant” in this case means that they were nominated for their work at an institution that was based outside of their country of birth (regardless of border changes). The percentage varies over time between 0%, for example, in 1922, 1965 and 1976, and 75% in 1957 and 1971. There does not seem to be a clear upward or downward trend over time, which suggests the brainiest people have been international since the Swedish and the Norwegians started handing out the prizes. Yet, despite migrants being over-represented among some of the most successful, privileged people in the world, hostility towards migration remains. Ipsos Mori found that, in many western countries, people overestimate the number of migrants who live in their country by a large margin. This suggests that we may also have a twisted idea of who is actually a migrant, and what they bring to the table. Perceptions matter. They can affect general attitudes towards migration policy and shift elections. Maybe a lot of what’s wrong with the way we think about migration is reflected in the question of why we would not think of successful, rich, smart and beautiful people as migrants. The 258 million international migrants that the UN estimates are worldwide are a diverse bunch: footballers, actors, Nobel laureates, but no less importantly they’re nurses, farmers, mechanics, cooks, entrepreneurs and spouses – and they all deserve to be valued. • Dr Jasper Dag Tjaden works at the International Organization for Migration’s Global Migration Data Analysis Centre"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"stage/2018/may/02/creditors-review-strindbergs-scintillating-tale-of-passion-and-possession","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T19:00:20Z","webTitle":"Creditors review – Strindberg's scintillating tale of passion and possession","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/02/creditors-review-strindbergs-scintillating-tale-of-passion-and-possession","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/may/02/creditors-review-strindbergs-scintillating-tale-of-passion-and-possession","fields":{"headline":"Creditors review – Strindberg's scintillating tale of passion and possession","bodyText":"If the men’s rights movement is looking for a spokesman, it could do worse than Gustav in August Strindberg’s three-hander, adapted in 2008 by David Greig and given a scintillating revival by Stewart Laing. He is the spurned lover who wheedles his way into his ex-wife’s new marriage while pushing a doctrine of male superiority and female deference. It’s not exactly that the arguments are persuasive (in the age of #MeToo, they raise the occasional laugh), but Stuart McQuarrie’s Gustav is slimily plausible. Looking like the playwright himself, complete with quiff and buttoned-up jacket, he remains cool and moderate as if to suggest his views about emasculation and the dangers of free-thinking women are the consequence of reasoning not vested interest. He is both creepy and charismatic. Certainly, Gustav impresses Adolph (Edward Franklin), all boyish optimism and dark mood swings, whose easy conversational manner is offset by McQuarrie’s restraint. His real match is Tekla (Adura Onashile), her sharpness of mind and emotional intelligence as powerful as her erotic desire. Performed straight through in three brooding encounters, with nobody entirely right or wrong, the play anticipates the irreconcilable conflict of David Mamet’s Oleanna. Laing pushes the archetypal nature of the conflict further by setting it in a symbolist landscape, his arresting summer house set full of distorted perspectives and odd angles. Scene divisions are marked by a procession of four Girl Guides, mechanically waving semaphore flags and making fires, seeming familiar yet strange. Likewise, the final scene, played out on film, has the twin effects of being emotionally revealing and theatrically distancing. For all of the misogyny, the arguments about passion and possession, partnership and dependency, rage on. • At the Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh, until 12 May.

With the tough new General Data Protection Regulations coming into force on 25 May, companies around the world are being forced to notify their users to accept new privacy policies and data processing terms to continue to use the services. But Giovanni Buttarelli, the European data protection supervisor (EDPS), lambasted the often-hostile approach of the recent deluge of notifications. “If this encounter seems a take-it-or-leave it proposition – with perhaps a hint of menace – then it is a travesty of at least the spirit of the new regulation, which aims to restore a sense of trust and control over what happens to our online lives,” said Buttarelli. “Consent cannot be freely given if the provision of a service is made conditional on processing personal data not necessary for the performance of a contract.” “The most recent [Facebook] scandal has served to expose a broken and unbalanced ecosystem reliant on unscrupulous personal data collection and micro-targeting for whatever purposes promise to generate clicks and revenues. “The digital information ecosystem farms people for their attention, ideas and data in exchange for so called ‘free’ services. Unlike their analogue equivalents, these sweatshops of the connected world extract more than one’s labour, and while clocking into the online factory is effortless it is often impossible to clock off.” While data protection and privacy has become a hot-button issue in part thanks to the Cambridge Analytica files, Buttarelli is concerned that it is simply being used as part of the “PR toolkit” of firms. He said that there is “a growing gulf between hyperbole and reality, where controllers learn to talk a good game while continuing with the same old harmful habits”. A new social media subgroup of data protection regulators will be convened in mid-May to tackle what Buttarelli called the “manipulative approaches” that must change with GDPR. “Brilliant lawyers will always be able to fashion ingenious arguments to justify almost any practice. But with personal data processing we need to move to a different model,” said Buttarelli. “The old approach is broken and unsustainable – that will be, in my view, the abiding lesson of the Facebook/ Cambridge Analytica case.” MPs threaten Mark Zuckerberg with summons over Facebook data"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/30/lafc-first-home-game-seattle-sounders","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T08:00:07Z","webTitle":"Los Angeles FC mark arrival with Hollywood ending to open new stadium","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/30/lafc-first-home-game-seattle-sounders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/30/lafc-first-home-game-seattle-sounders","fields":{"headline":"Los Angeles FC mark arrival with Hollywood ending to open new stadium","bodyText":"On a grimy corner of downtown Los Angeles, LAFC were selling a dream from the unpromising surroundings of a warehouse adjacent to a freeway underpass. Construction had only just begun on the 20-month project to create a new 22,000-seater stadium on the site of the former LA Memorial Sports Arena, and the freshly-launched club needed something to show potential supporters other than a building plot. A couple of miles away from their home ground in-the-making, LAFC created their Experience Center. The surroundings were underwhelming, but the message was overwhelming. Visiting Angelinos received a thorough briefing on the club’s plans and were able to envisage the new $350m home ground through 3D models and virtual reality films. “I took the tour and I was hooked. I paid my $100 deposit straightaway,” fan Hector Marrujo reminisces as he took his inaugural journey to the Banc of California Stadium on Sunday. “I’m Mexican so I’ve always supported Club America, but I never liked the Galaxy – even the name ‘Galaxy’ has always seemed lame to me – and LAFC are actually in the city. I don’t have to travel to Carson, there’s an LA zip code. But what really got me was this is something new and exciting. There’s a vision with young, exciting players.” The 17,500 season ticket holders who took that leap of faith were rewarded on Sunday evening, as the LAFC dream became a reality. Downtown Los Angeles’ first professional open-air sporting venue since Dodger Stadium opened its doors in 1962 was not graced by a classic opening fixture, although there was an ear-splitting finale after captain Laurent Ciman’s stoppage time free-kick was haplessly spilled by Seattle Sounders keeper Stefan Frei. It may have been a slightly comical opening goal at the stadium after LAFC had largely huffed and puffed in their attempts to break down the 2016 MLS Cup winners. But that’s five wins out of seven Western Conference games now. There has been no teething period for Bob Bradley’s side. “It’s nice not to inaugurate the stadium with a 0-0. Maybe someone was looking down on us!” said a beaming Bradley afterwards. However, this was about more than 90 minutes. After playing their opening six games away from home (although one of those was the LA derby), this was the day where it felt that Major League Soccer’s newest franchise had truly arrived. Well, it was more touchdown than take-off after Navy Seals parachuted onto the turf carrying the match ball. The expected pre-match palava continued with fireworks, a fan-led rendition of the national anthem and, oh yes, co-owner Will Ferrell carrying a trained falcon called Olly onto the pitch sporting an LAFC headdress. The gold and black clad fanbase didn’t need any fancy gimmicks to capture their attention, though. Whether it’s the geographical advantage that LAFC possess over neighbors Galaxy (who are 10 miles away in the outlying city of Carson) or the idea of a new, fresh and exciting venture, supporters have become instantly invested in a team boasting a history of just seven competitive games. The rowdy safe standing terraced North Stand had an air of the Bundesliga to it, as members of the ‘3253’ supporters group bounced and waved frantically to the rhythm of a bass drum orchestra. Although there was little slickness on show against Seattle, LAFC’s open, attacking philosophy will surely attract even more supporters after Bradley’s men have averaged more than two goals per game during the season’s formative stages. It comes at the cost of defensive rigidity. Yes, LAFC registered a third clean sheet of the campaign, but they shipped 13 in the other four games. There is a definite air of susceptibility to the back three: the Sounders spurning two glorious opportunities within the opening 10 minutes to silence the excitable home crowd. But in a front three of Diego Rossi, Marco Urena and Carlos Vela, LAFC possess an attack arguably good enough to rival reigning MLS champions Toronto. Vela, in particular, shines bright in his ability to persistently find pockets of space and dictate proceedings in the final third. Bradley said: “We’re not Barcelona yet. Our football’s not perfect, but we go out every game and try to play. Every team has to come up with its identity and its way of playing, but I think it’s clear we’ll try to continue going in that direction.” General manager John Thorrington deserves enormous credit for putting together such an attacking line-up. LAFC’s 30-strong ownership group of Hollywood and Malaysian business, sporting and entertainment heavyweights have clearly shown their acumen in building the club from scratch over the last four years after the collapse of Chivas left a gap in the southern California market. But Thorrington, the former US international, crucially avoided the temptation to follow Galaxy’s example of bringing household names to Los Angeles. Instead, this is a project more akin to Atlanta United, with young, hungry, accomplished players from Central and South America. Although Galaxy’s star turn Zlatan Ibrahimovic has proved to be a media darling since arriving in California and inflicted such a memorable wound in the inaugural derby between the two clubs, LAFC already boast the infrastructure to challenge their neighbors in the long-term. Encouragingly, they’re only at the start of the journey."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/30/kabul-explosions-hit-city-centre-attack","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T14:11:54Z","webTitle":"Ten journalists among 36 killed in Afghanistan attacks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/30/kabul-explosions-hit-city-centre-attack","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/30/kabul-explosions-hit-city-centre-attack","fields":{"headline":"Ten journalists among 36 killed in Afghanistan attacks","bodyText":"Ten journalists have died in Afghanistan in a coordinated double suicide bombing in Kabul and a shooting in the eastern Khost province, on the deadliest day for media workers in the country since the fall of the Taliban. Nine journalists died in the Afghan capital when they gathered at the scene of the first of two blasts. Ahmad Shah, a BBC reporter, was shot dead in a separate incident in Khost province, near the border with Pakistan. In Kabul, a suicide attacker riding a motorbike blew himself up in the Shash Darak neighbourhood, near the Nato headquarters and the US embassy, at about 8am on Monday. A second bomber, holding a camera and posing as a journalist, struck 20 minutes later, killing rescue workers and journalists, including an Agence France-Presse photographer, who had rushed to the scene. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the Kabul attacks, which left at least 25 people dead and 45 injured in total. Hours later, a suicide bomber targeting a Nato convoy in southern Kandahar province killed 11 children at a religious school located near where the explosion occurred. At least 16 people, including five Romanian Nato soldiers, nine civilians and two police officers, were also wounded. AFP paid tribute to its chief photographer in Kabul, Shah Marai, who was among those killed in the capital. “This is a devastating blow, for the brave staff of our close-knit Kabul bureau and the entire agency,” AFP’s global news director, Michèle Léridon, said. “We can only honour the strength, courage, and generosity of a photographer who covered often traumatic, horrific events with sensitivity and consummate professionalism.” Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty said three of its journalists were also killed. They were named as Abadullah Hananzai, Maharram Durrani and Sabawoon Kakar, a photojournalist and camera operator, who was wounded at the scene but died in hospital. A camera operator from the local network Tolo TV was also killed. “This terrorist attack is a war crime and an organised attack on the Afghan media,” read a statement by the Afghanistan Federation of Journalists, demanding an investigation by the UN. “The attack in the heart of Kabul and in the Green Zone indicates a serious lack of security by the government.” Saifulrahman Ayar, a journalist who was at the scene, told the Guardian the second attacker was disguised as a journalist and held a camera. “I was near the blast site when the office called me and [asked me] to cover the incident. It was minutes after the first explosion, I was metres away when the second explosion occurred among the journalists,” he said. “The second attacker was acting like a journalist and had a camera. I am injured in my leg, I was confused, then I saw that I’m in hospital. I told them to let me go because I want to cover the attack on my colleagues.” Elyas Mousavi, a journalist, was crossing the checkpoint to report on the attack when the second attacker blew himself up. “After the second explosion no one could go near the site, because they were afraid of another explosion. And then ambulances arrived. I saw also some security personal dead,” he said. Shahhussain Murtazawi, spokesperson for the Afghan presidency, condemned the twin attacks, saying that “the criminal terrorists once again hit Kabul and Nangarhar and committed crimes against humanity, during which a number of civilians have been martyred and injured”. The US embassy in Kabul also condemned the double suicide bombing. “Where media are in danger, all other human rights are under greater threat,” it said. The Paris-based Reporters Without Borders said Monday was the deadliest for journalists in the country since the fall of the Taliban in 2001. At least 34 journalists and media workers have been killed by Isis or the Taliban in Afghanistan since 2016, according to RSF. A string of deadly large-scale bombings and assaults have struck the capital and other Afghan cities this year. Isis claimed responsibility for Monday’s attack on its Amaq propaganda news agency. The Afghan affiliate of the Isis militant group calls itself Khorasan Province, an archaic name for a central Asian region that includes modern-day Afghanistan. It posted an urgent statement on an Isis-affiliate website saying two of its martyrdom seekers carried out the double bombing targeting the headquarters of the “renegade” Afghan intelligence services in Kabul. Security officials have warned of the risk of increased attacks in the run-up to parliamentary elections planned for October. The attacks underscore the struggles Afghan security forces have faced to rein in the militant groups since the US and Nato concluded their combat mission at the end of 2014. Like the more well-established Taliban, the Isis affiliate is committed to overthrowing the US-backed government and imposing a harsh form of Islamic rule. But while the Taliban mainly target government officials and security forces, the Isis affiliate tends to favour large-scale attacks on civilians from Afghanistan’s Shia Hazara minority, who it views as apostates. Last week, an Isis suicide bomber attacked a voter registration centre in Kabul, killing 60 people and wounding at least 130. There were 22 women and eight children among the fatalities. In March, an Isis suicide bomber targeted a Shia shrine in Kabul where people had gathered to celebrate the Persian new year. That attack killed 31 and wounded 65.

In a speech to the Australian Industry Group policy conference on Monday, the workplace relations minister signalled the government would propose further legal changes and called for employer support in convincing their workers to back the Coalition. He said unions “have perfected the art of organising as a political tool”. “They are smart operators and we have let them take over the industrial relations field unchallenged,” he said. “Enough is enough. This is a call to action from me to every one of you ... You need to organise the way the unions do.” Laundy said employers should use their trust and friendship with their workers to explain that they face either “a more secure, positive future or one where their jobs are at risk”. Labor’s workplace relations spokesman, Brendan O’Connor, accused Laundy of a “thinly veiled assault on the performance” of the jobs minister, Michaelia Cash, by implying she had vacated the field. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Laundy said the Turnbull government had “made significant steps towards improving our system” but he was “determined to push ahead with reforms to do even more”. Laundy cited Coalition bills to introduce new penalties for deliberate underpayment of wages, allow courts to disqualify union officials and add a public interest test for union mergers. “I am also keen to make life easier for small and family businesses to navigate our complex industrial relations system,” he said. On Friday the small business ombudsman, Kate Carnell, released a position paper calling for penalties for unfair dismissals to be halved from 26 weeks to 13 weeks’ pay and to require small businesses to repay underpaid wages but protecting them from further penalty where they have made a “genuine effort to comply”. Laundy warned of a “dark future” if Bill Shorten became prime minister, claiming that the Australian Council of Trade Unions secretary, Sally McManus, would in effect become the workplace relations minister. “The effects would be devastating for your business and for your employees,” he said. Laundy argued that McManus’s plan for the Fair Work Commission to gain powers to rectify underpayments infringes on the constitutional separation of powers. Laundy said the ACTU’s plan for industry-wide bargaining would “paralyse entire industries” and its aim to increase the minimum wage would “drive hundreds of thousands of small and family businesses to the wall”. In contrast to Laundy’s call for employers to muscle up to unions, the Australian Workers Union secretary, Daniel Walton, told the conference that industrial relations had become “too aggressive” in Australia. He cited the Australian federal police raid on the AWU headquarters to investigate a political donation and the alleged politicisation of regulators the Australian Building and Construction Commission and Registered Organisations Commission. Walton argued that some employers were prepared to join the Coalition in “relentlessly hammering unions” rather than look for other ways to find common cause on issues such as reducing gas prices. Walton warned that “hyping-up conflict” would “create the conditions for extremism”. He noted that the Australian Election Study has found that, since 1996, the proportion of voters identifying as on the left is up, in the centre is down and on the right is steady. “So the polarisation we are seeing develop is mostly on the left ... Do you think it’s a coincidence that this shift has happened at the same time that insecure work has expanded?” Walton – who leads the historically moderate AWU – urged employers to “deal with a reasonable, relatively centrist union movement”. The alternative was “a far more disruptive, brutal, winner-takes-all version of industrial relations”, he said. “We believe Australia’s national interest is best pursued through cooperation between labour and management,” he said. “But how long does that centrist, cooperative view of industrial relations last if the total war between business and the traditional union movement continues?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/30/20m-study-to-investigate-collapse-risk-of-major-antarctic-glacier","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T10:00:09Z","webTitle":"Boaty McBoatface leads £20m mission to melting Antarctic glacier","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/30/20m-study-to-investigate-collapse-risk-of-major-antarctic-glacier","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/30/20m-study-to-investigate-collapse-risk-of-major-antarctic-glacier","fields":{"headline":"Boaty McBoatface leads £20m mission to melting Antarctic glacier","bodyText":"The precarious state of a vast, remote Antarctic glacier will provide an inaugural mission for the British vessel once dubbed Boaty McBoatface, as scientists from the UK and US set up a new £20m research operation. Scientists from both countries are to collaborate on the five-year project to examine the Thwaites glacier in west Antarctica, a major structure that drains an area about the size of the UK. Any firm indication that the glacier could be responding to a warmer climate with faster icemelt could presage disaster for coastal areas of the globe, with the potential for sea-level rises some scientists put as high as 1.5m by the century’s end. One of the principal research vessels will be the RSS Sir David Attenborough, the £200m research ship originally voted to be christened Boaty McBoatface in an online poll two years ago. The joke name lives on in the ship’s remotely operated submarine. Scott Borg, deputy assistant director of the US National Science Foundation, said the expedition was of global significance. “This is critically important to all of us, no matter where we live. What happens in the Antarctic does not stay in the Antarctic. We do not know how quickly [the glacier] will contribute to sea level rises, and whether we have decades or centuries to prepare for it.” He warned of possible changes to global ocean circulation, as well as sea-level rises, that could result from more rapid melting. Scientists have grown increasingly concerned over the effect of melting ice, from the polar ice caps and glaciers on land, on global ocean currents, with a recent study showing the Atlantic’s gulf stream at its weakest for 1,600 years. In a nod to climate sceptics in the US, Borg said: “Some people say this is expensive. But our coastal cities and economies are at stake.” He called the five-year project, to begin this October, “international cooperation at its best, and in keeping with the Antarctic treaty” that would “yield unprecedented understanding of the future of this critical part of Antarctica”. The participation of the US was seen as particularly significant, given the withdrawal from the Paris agreement on climate ordered by president Donald Trump, who has also put forward plans to cut climate science budgets. Duncan Wingham, chair of the UK’s Natural Environment Research Council, described the Thwaites glacier as “one of the least explored parts of the Antarctic continent”, making the investigation crucial to studying the state and future of the region. Sea-level rises are a hotly contested area of climate science. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has forecast that average sea-level rises could be held to roughly 25cm to 40cm if governments take strong action on greenhouse gases. However, this does not take account of the potential for rapid melting or collapse of glaciers in Antarctica. Satellites already show the Thwaites glacier is changing rapidly, but only by putting researchers close to the glacier itself will it be possible to measure the rates of ice volume and ice mass change. Remote submersibles such as Boaty McBoatface will be essential: recent research showed that the undersea melting of Antarctic glaciers is more of a problem that had been thought. If the expedition discovers stability in the Thwaites glacier, it could assuage some of the worst fears of climate experts. Changes in global ocean circulations have also fallen under the spotlight as scientists warned only weeks ago over the effects on the Gulf stream, which brings temperate weather to Europe. The potential effects of climate change and melting ice on ocean currents are still poorly understood, requiring intensive and often expensive scientific research involving ships, buoys, satellites and complex computer models.

Cracksman, the Champion Stakes winner last season, filled it magnificently on Sunday as he routed his field in the Prix Ganay and it was easy to picture him doing the same this autumn if he returns to line up for the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe. Cloth Of Stars, last year’s Ganay winner and then runner-up behind Enable, Cracksman’s stable companion, in last year’s Arc, had been expected to give John Gosden’s colt a serious test. André Fabre’s runner was race-fit from two starts already this year and had a pacemaker in Wren’s Day to give Mickael Barzalona, his jockey, a target in the home straight. As it turned out it was Frankie Dettori, on Cracksman, who settled a couple of lengths behind Wren’s Day as Cloth Of Stars was caught towards the rear from an early stage. Dettori was able to choose his moment to strike in the straight and, though Cracksman took a few strides to go through the gears, he soon swept into a decisive lead as Cloth Of Stars set off in forlorn pursuit. Cloth Of Stars could not even pass his pacemaker as Cracksman crossed the line four lengths to the good and nearly five in front of Cloth Of Stars. That was roughly twice the margin that Enable enjoyed in the Arc at Chantilly last October, and the potential head‑to‑head between the two Gosden runners in five months’ time promises to be the biggest race of the European season. “Frankie was pleased with him,” Gosden said. “We felt that come the straight, we’d get balanced and organised and go, and I was thrilled when he passed me around the furlong pole as he got very low and stretched, which is a great thing to see in a horse. “The great thing is he’s won today on good [ground], and perhaps slightly on the faster side of good, and he can go on the soft, so he’s versatile. Mentally I was impressed with just how relaxed and professional he is. It would be marvellous if they are both in top order to come here for the Arc. It would be a dream come true for all of us.” Cracksman’s next race could be the Tattersalls Gold Cup at The Curragh before a possible run in the Prince of Wales’s Stakes at Royal Ascot, while Enable is expected to begin her season in the Coronation Cup at Epsom in early June. “I knew that he stays a mile and a half and I didn’t want it to turn into a sprint,” Dettori said. “I was surprised by the pacemaker. It took me a furlong to get past him but from then it was great. He gave me a good feel and he’s stronger. “It’s the first Group One of the season and he’s one of my best horses, so of course I feel nervous and I’ve got great expectation. Until it actually happens you don’t know what’s going to happen, so it’s a relief and he’s got a fantastic season ahead of him.” The Ganay was the feature event on an afternoon when the track officially started its new life as ParisLongchamp after a two-year redevelopment. Only time will tell whether the track’s new name will catch on with the racegoing public but the thousands of British and Irish racing fans who travel to the Arc in October will certainly find a very different course awaiting them in the Bois de Boulogne. The vast, twin grandstands that looked out over Longchamp for half a century have gone, replaced by a single, layered and consciously lop-sided structure with a top tier that extends significantly beyond the floor below. Most of the trees that were a much-loved feature of the old public enclosures have been preserved – in fact, several have had the new structure built incorporated into the new stand – and while the colour scheme of yellow and gold may not appeal to everyone, it has apparently been designed to look its best amid the tints and hues of autumn. The first Sunday in October is the day that matters most and, if the Arc pits Cracksman against Enable, few will have eyes for anything but the action on the track."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/29/amber-rudd-resigns-as-home-secretary-after-windrush-scandal","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T09:38:01Z","webTitle":"Amber Rudd resigns hours after Guardian publishes deportation targets letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/29/amber-rudd-resigns-as-home-secretary-after-windrush-scandal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/29/amber-rudd-resigns-as-home-secretary-after-windrush-scandal","fields":{"headline":"Amber Rudd resigns hours after Guardian publishes deportation targets letter","bodyText":"Amber Rudd has dramatically resigned as home secretary, after repeatedly struggling to account for her role in the unjust treatment of Windrush generation migrants. The home secretary was forced to step down after a series of revelations in the Guardian over Windrush culminated in a leak on Friday that appeared to show she was aware of targets for removing illegal migrants from Britain. The pressure increased late on Sunday afternoon as the Guardian revealed that in a leaked 2017 letter to Theresa May, Rudd had told the prime minister of her intention to increase deportations by 10% – seemingly at odds with her recent denials that she was aware of deportation targets. Rudd was facing a bruising appearance in the House of Commons on Monday. Downing Street sources said that in preparing for her statement, new information had become available which convinced Rudd she had inadvertently misled parliament – and she had therefore phoned the prime minister on Sunday to tender her resignation. In her resignation letter to the prime minister, published hours after the latest leak, Rudd said she had “become aware of information provided to my office which makes mention of targets. I should have been aware of this, and I take full responsibility that I was not.” The prime minister replied that she believed Rudd had given her evidence “in good faith”; but that she could “understand why, now you have had chance to review the advice that you have received on this issue, you have made the decision you have made, and taken responsibility for inadvertently misleading the home affairs select committee”. May added that Rudd had led her department with “great integrity, compassion and selflessness – notwithstanding the personal and political challenges you have faced during this period”. The process that led to Rudd’s departure began on Wednesday when Labour MP Yvette Cooper challenged her repeatedly about removals targets at the home affairs select committee, prompting Rudd to insist “that’s not how we operate”. The next day, she pledged to scrap future targets, saying, “I have not approved or seen or cleared any targets for removals looking ahead, and looking ahead I will not be doing that” – and said she would change the culture of the home office from top to bottom, insisting, “I can do this”. In her resignation letter, she said the Windrush cases had “shone a light on an important issue for our country. As so often the instincts of the British people are right. They want people who have a right to live here to be treated fairly and humanely, which has sometimes not been the case. But they also want the government to remove those who don’t have the right to be here”. She added, “I had hoped in coming months to devise a policy that would allow the government to meet both these vital objectives”. Rudd had been working on a long-delayed white paper on migration. The home secretary had faced mounting pressure in recent days over her role in setting the culture and policies that led to long-term residents of Britain from Caribbean countries being denied healthcare, pensions and benefits – and in some cases the threat of deportation. Speculation about her future had swirled around Westminster late into the evening on Friday, as the home office and Downing Street failed to respond for more than eight hours to the Guardian’s revelations. But Rudd finally issued a statement on Friday night insisting, “I wasn’t aware of specific removal targets. I accept I should have been and I’m sorry that I wasn’t.” She had pledged to explain herself in a statement to the House of Commons on Monday. But instead, she drafted a resignation letter. The prime minister was forced to apologise for the treatment of the Windrush generation during the recent Commonwealth heads of government meeting, after initially refusing a request to meet the leaders of affected countries. Rudd’s own repeated apologies failed to assuage the sense that the home secretary should have known what was happening – and got to grips with it earlier. She would also have faced tough questions on Monday about whether her own enthusiasm to crack down on illegal immigration contributed to the Windrush generation’s treatment. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott told the Guardian Rudd had “done the right thing”. “What I said when I called for her to resign last week was that it is a matter of honour. Given all the to-ing and fro-ing and issues about whether she’d been entirely truthful with the home affairs select committee, I don’t think the Windrush generation could have had the confidence in her,” she said. Conservative colleagues rallied round Rudd, however. Chief secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss, said, “very sorry to see Amber Rudd resign. As well as being a fantastic, compassionate and brave politician; she is a very generous colleague.” Another minister, Margot James, described her as, “competent, authoritative and utterly decent”. Rudd’s departure risks upsetting the delicate balance in May’s cabinet over Brexit, with a showdown looming on Wednesday about Britain’s relationship with the customs union. Once relegated to the backbenches, some colleagues were expecting Rudd, a former remainer, to begin speaking out about Brexit, and perhaps even joining the vocal group of rebels challenging the government to pursue a close continuing relationship with the EU. Among those affected by the Windrush crisis there was a sense that the resignation was necessary. Anthony Bryan, 60, who has spent five weeks in immigration removal centres over the past two years, despite having lived in the UK for over half a century, was one of the first people interviewed in the Guardian last November about the Home Office’s behaviour towards him. He said he “nearly fell over” with shock when he heard the news of her resignation. “It’s a shock. I feel like I helped bring down the home secretary. I wouldn’t say I am pleased; I feel sorry for her in a sense because it looks like she is taking the punishment for Theresa May,” he said. But he acknowledged that Rudd had not handled things well in her answers on deportation targets. “Either she was lying or she didn’t know. I think she resigned because she didn’t want to face Monday.” Cardlin Johnson, whose brothers were both Windrush victims, said that the news was bittersweet. “Rudd had to go because of her performance and because of her denials of the targets,” she said. “But we all know that Theresa May is the architect of that 2014 migration policy. I feel like it is one down, one to go. My personal opinion is: Theresa May next. May should be looking over her shoulder now.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/29/somerset-yorkshire-county-championship-division-one-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T18:11:03Z","webTitle":"Tom Abell’s crisp innings puts Somerset in driving seat against Yorkshire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/29/somerset-yorkshire-county-championship-division-one-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/29/somerset-yorkshire-county-championship-division-one-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Tom Abell’s crisp innings puts Somerset in driving seat against Yorkshire","bodyText":"A hint of normality returned to the ground that was once the haven of out‑of-form batsmen. Only 11 wickets fell in the day, albeit one truncated by bad light, which means that a tantalising finale awaits. At the close Yorkshire, needing an unlikely 321 for victory, were battling away on 49 for one. Batting was still a challenge in icy conditions and under a blanket of cloud. Somerset, starting the day on six without loss, were bowled out for 200, which represented quite a recovery from 24 for four. The captain, Tom Abell, produced the innings of the day to enable his side to set such a challenging target. His was a timely intervention for two reasons: it maintained Somerset’s dominance in a fast-moving match and it eased concerns about his own form. Abell is a gifted young batsman, who was catapulted into the captaincy last April. He has shown that he has a sharp cricket brain out on the field, where he shows zest and decisiveness as he juggles his bowlers and fielders. But all that counts for very little if the runs dry up and the side starts losing, as was the case in 2017. In the end he had to drop himself, though he soon returned down the order to oversee Somerset’s escape from relegation – at best a character-building process for a young captain, at worst a trigger to try something else. This season, like many other batsmen at Taunton, Abell has struggled but here he oversaw an important recovery with some crisp strokeplay, especially when playing copybook cover drives while making 82. He departed playing the only ugly shot of his innings, a wild swipe when he found himself alongside No 11. If he keeps scoring runs like this, the captaincy will not be a problem. Yorkshire were handicapped because their back-up bowlers lacked the venom of their openers. Ben Coad, who already has 17 wickets this summer, and Jack Brooks (13 so far) caused early havoc, dispatching the heavyweights Marcus Trescothick, Matt Renshaw and James Hildreth, plus the newcomer George Bartlett, in the first 40 minutes. Abell hung in there alongside Steve Davies, whose 33 was the equivalent of 66 in July or August. When Yorkshire’s opening bowlers were replaced by Matthew Waite and Tim Bresnan there was more scope for scoring and Abell took his chances deftly. Meanwhile Karl Carver, Yorkshire’s No 11 and a left-arm spinner, has had a quiet game. He will not bowl a ball in the match. He was unbeaten on one in the first innings. But there is always Monday. Triple treat for Stuart Broad as Nottinghamshire take control The rain finally stopped at New Road and Stuart Broad took three for 28 in his first game for Nottinghamshire this season as Worcestershire were bowled out for 110. There were also career-best figures of five for 27 for Luke Fletcher, who has had a happy return to the Championship after the head injury that kiboshed his 2017 season. In reply Nottinghamshire were 204 for six, with 50 for Ross Taylor and three wickets for Joe Leach. Surrey hit the buffers at Old Trafford in the evening chill, finishing on 231 for nine, needing 59 more to avoid the follow-on after losing five for 29 in 14.1 overs. Scott Borthwick made 79. There were four wickets for Tom Bailey and three for Graham Onions, including Mark Stoneman for a duck. Earlier, Bailey’s and Joe Mennie’s ninth‑wicket partnership of 118 took Lancashire to untold riches: 439 for nine declared. Only 28 overs were possible at the Ageas Bowl where Hampshire moved on to 241 for four against Essex with 87 for Jimmy Adams and 52 for Hashim Amla. At Hove Gloucestershire folded to 108 for six, chasing 167 to win, before bad light stopped play. Benny Howell top-scored with 45. There were three wickets for Stiaan van Zyl, who had earlier made 44 as Sussex were dismissed for 204. Bad light and rain also truncated the day at Lord’s, where Middlesex made 194, thanks largely to Stevie Eskinazi’s 94, with five for 49 for Michael Hogan and four for 63 for Timm van der Gugten. In reply Glamorgan were given a rude shock by Tim Murtagh’s four for 12 from the Nursery End, and finished on 38 for four.Leicestershire finished the day on 267 for five against Derbyshire at Grace Road, with Ned Eckersley 40 not out. Luis Reece took three 58. There was no play for the third successive day at Wantage Road.

British diplomats plan to use four major summits this year – the G7, the G20, Nato and the European Union – to try to deepen the alliance against Russia hastily built by the Foreign Office after the poisoning of the former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in March. “The foreign secretary regards Russia’s response to Douma and Salisbury as a turning point and thinks there is international support to do more,” a Whitehall official said. “The areas the UK are most likely to pursue are countering Russian disinformation and finding a mechanism to enforce accountability for the use of chemical weapons.” Former Foreign Office officials admit that an institutional reluctance to call out Russia once permeated British diplomatic thinking, but say that after the poisoning of Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, that attitude is evaporating. A cross-party alliance in parliament has developed which sees the question of Russian corruption no longer through the prism of finance, but instead as a security and foreign policy threat, requiring fresh sanctions even if this causes short-term economic damage to the UK. Ministers want to pursue a broad Russian containment strategy at the coming summits covering cybersecurity, Nato’s military posture, sanctions against Vladimir Putin’s oligarchs and a more comprehensive approach to Russian disinformation. It is argued that votes by MPs this week over public registers of beneficial share ownership in Britain’s overseas territories and the introduction of Magnitsky-style sanctions belatedly gives the UK greater moral credibility to urge wavering countries to join an international alliance. James Nixey, the head of the Russia and Eurasia programme at the thinktank Chatham House, said: “It’s hard to persuade even your closest allies to take tangible measures with impact if we’re not prepared to sacrifice some of the Russian investment in our own country and stick to a point of principle. Government statements on this have been either ambiguous or all over the place.” In making its case to foreign ministries, the UK is arguing that Russian denials over Salisbury and Douma reveal a state uninterested in cooperating to reach a common understanding of the truth, but instead using both episodes to try systematically to divide western electorates and sow doubt. Alicia Kearns, who ran the Foreign Office’s strategic counter-terrorism communications in Syria and Iraq, argues that Russia is seen as nearly unique in its willingness to conceal the truth. “When we are dealing with most malign states or even terror groups, an element of truth is expected to increase the efficacy of their disinformation, but with Russia there is no commitment, or adherence, to the truth,” she told the Guardian. “For instance for the first 10 days that Russia was inside Syria, it insisted through a large propaganda campaign that its planes were only bombing Islamic State’s positions, and it was categorically not true.” Russia’s critics say in case after case – the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in 2014, the role of official Russian forces inside Ukraine, the murder of the former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko on UK soil, the Syrian government’s repeated use of chemical weapons, the covert disruption in the western Balkans and repeated cyber-attacks – the west finds itself arguing with Russia not just about ideology, or interests, but Moscow’s simple denial, or questioning, of what the western governments perceive as unchallengeable facts. “Putin is waging an information war designed to turn our strongest asset – freedom of speech – against us. Russia is trying to fix us through deception,” said Tom Tugendhat, the chairman of the foreign affairs select committee. Tugendhat argues Putin only responds if countries stand up to him. Some argue this characterisation is Russophobic. Truth is always contested in international relations. Diplomats after all have always just been “good men sent abroad to lie for their country”. The US president, Donald Trump, has been described by his former FBI director James Comey as “untethered to the truth”.British politicians are not alone in claiming Russia’s record of mendacity is not a personal trait of Putin’s, but a government-wide strategy that makes traditional diplomacy ineffective. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, famously came off one lengthy phone call with Putin – she had more than 40 in a year – to say he lived in a different world. David Cameron also once told friends that discussions with Putin were unlike with any other leader. He told colleagues the normal assumption was that his interlocutors were speaking their version of the truth. “With Putin you came off the phone, and you were not quite sure he believed what he was saying,” Cameron said. For some Baltic diplomats, Putin’s regime now lies so systematically that diplomatic dialogue is close to redundant. Linas Linkevičius, the Lithuanian foreign minister, said: “A lie isn’t an alternative point of view; it is simply a lie and needs to be identified as such. A T-90 tank in Ukraine isn’t just a ‘vehicle’. Propaganda is not a legitimate form of public diplomacy.” According to Nixey, “diplomats have been part of the problem. We have known Russia has a fundamental disagreement with the west over the ‘post-cold war order’ for years, stretching back well before Georgia 2008. But diplomats are hard-wired to seek better relations. It is laudable in principle but logically you can’t have better relations with someone from whom you are getting a divorce due to irreconcilable differences.” Kearns concurs. “There is a reluctance in the Foreign Office to be forceful in our calling out of Russian falsehoods, fearing that it could end or frustrate wider dialogue with Russia,” she said. “But there has been a big shift in the wake of Ukraine, Syria and Salisbury. A firmer stance does not necessitate an increase in aggression or vitriol, but a recognition that when Russia – or any other nation’s – actions are unacceptable and there is a responsibility to hold them to account, and that by doing so, we can effect change.” For some old hands in the Foreign Office with deep experience of Russia, however, demonising Russia is a disastrous strategy. Sir Anthony Brenton, the British ambassador to Russia between 2004 and 2008, insists a fruitful common agenda with Moscow on issues such as nuclear disarmament, Islamist terrorism and cyberwarfare is still possible. “What on earth was her majesty’s foreign secretary doing comparing the Russian World Cup with Hitler’s 1936 Olympics?” he asked. “If you are looking for a single statement really calculated to infuriate the Russians there it is, or indeed the defence secretary telling Russia to shut up. Elementary diplomacy goes a long way with the Russians and we need to get back to that.” Figures such as Brenton fear that not only would a British all-out assault on Russian mendacity simply drive Moscow into the arms of China, a long-term strategic mistake for Europe, but also risk British diplomatic overreach, given the backdrop of Brexit. Pushing for further action runs the risk of dividing the existing alliance that the Foreign Office achieved after the Salisbury poisonings. One former foreign secretary said: “It is better for the Foreign Office to camp on where they have got to. The crucial thing is to keep the alliance together.” • This article was amended on 4 May 2018. We mistakenly said James Comey was former CIA director. He is of course former director of the FBI.

Dubbed “the Lion of the North” in a book by the French writer Voltaire and also known as the “Swedish Meteor” for his early military prowess, Charles, who acceded to the throne in 1697 at the age of 15, had bitten off rather more than he could chew by taking on Russia, and spent the following six years in exile in and around present-day Turkey. Having acquired a taste for the local cuisine, he returned to Sweden in 1714 with the recipe not just for köfte, the spiced lamb and beef meatballs that in time became the Swedish staple köttbullar, but also for the popular stuffed cabbage dish now known in Sweden as kåldolmar. Charles, who died in 1718 when he was shot in the head while attacking Danish-occupied Norway, is also considered responsible for importing and popularising the Turkish habit of drinking coffee, which became so widespread in Sweden in the later 18th century that King Gustav III briefly banned it. In Turkey’s meatball capital, Inegöl, this week, a local chef, İbrahim Veysel, told the Doğan news agency it was an honour that the Turkish dish should have become “an example to different cuisines all over the world”. Others were less happy. Serdar Çam, president of the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency, complained that Ikea, which sells 2m meatballs a day in its in-store restaurants, should not be selling the dish as though it were Swedish. Örjan, the forlorn – though presumably tongue-in-cheek – Swede currently curating the country’s @sweden tourism account, rotated every week, lamented that the news had robbed life of its meaning. “My whole life has been a lie,” he tweeted. • This article was amended on 4 May 2018 to clarify that King Charles XII was dubbed “the Lion of the North” in a book by Voltaire."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/may/04/othello-review-golda-rosheuvel-everyman-liverpool","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T12:07:21Z","webTitle":"Othello review – lesbian Moor boldly puts gender under microscope","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/04/othello-review-golda-rosheuvel-everyman-liverpool","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/may/04/othello-review-golda-rosheuvel-everyman-liverpool","fields":{"headline":"Othello review – lesbian Moor boldly puts gender under microscope","bodyText":"Samuel Taylor Coleridge famously talked of Iago’s “motiveless malignity”, but director Gemma Bodinetz certainly gives Iago a reason for his jealousy of Othello and determination to bring the general down. This Othello – played with dignity and intelligence by Golda Rosheuvel – is a woman who not only has the temerity and skill to lead an army, but is an out lesbian who has wedded and bedded Desdemona. Bodinetz’s contemporary production is brave and bold in every way. It’s played out on a mostly bare space that gives the actors nowhere to hide, and which at times works against the intimacy and claustrophobia that is integral to Shakespeare’s most domestic drama. In changing the gender of Othello – making the character is a woman who has excelled in what is clearly very much a man’s world – the stakes are raised, and the evening speaks to present-day workplace politics. Iago is the “ancient” who feels resentment at a woman’s success, particularly as Othello and Desdemona are clearly so much in love. Just before the murder, Emma Bispham’s Emilia tells Desdemona that men are made for eating women up “and when they are full, they belch us”, a comment on the illusionary power of a woman such as Othello in a deep-rooted patriarchy like that of the Venetian state. She is always just one step away from a fall. Iago brings her down with terrible ease. It reminds us how easily the advances made by women are lost. From the Donmar’s all-female Shakespeare trilogy to the RSC’s gender-fluid Romeo and Juliet, productions of these familiar plays are putting gender and identity as much under the microscope as those of newly written plays. That’s exciting, so it’s a pity that for all the intrigue here, and for the set-up’s juicy potential, Bodinetz doesn’t quite nail it. Part of the issue is technical. The space can be unforgiving (the first scene is so gabbled as to be almost unintelligible), and the murder in the bedroom and its fallout is rendered clumsy by the plonking of a room within a room – a large bed with billowing gauzy curtains – centre stage. The actors can only scuttle around the margins. Not all the cast members are as comfortable speaking the text as Rosheuvel, and there can be a lack of distinctiveness in the performances. Marc Elliott is funny as the absurdly silly Roderigo, but Desdemona (Emily Hughes) lacks force and is so passive it feels as if she has exited long before she is murdered. Patrick Brennan, a fine actor and a stalwart of last year’s Everyman ensemble, doesn’t quite rise to Iago, either. The motive for his behaviour may be abundantly clear, but he sets about destroying Othello with a disappointing lack of villainy. His very ordinariness may make it easier for him to spread false information and get the gullible to trust him, but this Iago is oddly bland. At Everyman, Liverpool, until 10 July.

Battle is joined over Bernard’s claim of sole credit for the hit single, but we see how the conflict is intensified as both parties resort to lawyers and seek to sort out their problems through psychotherapy. Dramatically, the danger is that the issue seems one-sided. Bernard is a bully with a palpable contempt not just for musicians but for singers whom he equates with actors and politicians as people who “breathe life into words they didn’t necessarily write”. Cat, meanwhile, is vulnerable, inexperienced and subject to all the pressures women face in the record industry. It even emerges that, on tour in America, she was lugged from one date to the next by a male crew who treated her as little more than a drugged-up rag doll. While the play makes the point that the music business treats women badly, it is infinitely more than a loaded conflict over intellectual property. For a start, Penhall has the courage to show the couple at work, where we see how a song is often developed through argumentative give-and-take. Everything is made worse by willy-waving lawyers and musically ignorant therapists who try to provide tidy solutions to intractable problems. As I see it, the music business is simply a metaphor: what Penhall is really writing about is the way art is often the product of damaged individuals who depend on a degree of collaboration. The play itself helps to dent the myth of the solo creator. Penhall wrote it but Roger Michell has given it physical life by staging it with a beautiful fluidity that allows the arguments between the six characters to flow back and forth. Disproving Bernard’s thesis that actors are just mouthpieces, Ben Chaplin endows the character with a sadness that offsets his inbuilt arrogance. He may be a vampire but when he expresses to his therapist incredulity that he could ever know his wife’s feelings, you feel that he is trapped inside his own chauvinism. Seána Kerslake also brings light and shade to the exploited Cat by showing that she is seeking vindictive triumph to compensate for her inability to satisfy her father’s dreams. Neil Stuke and Kurt Egyiawan as the lawyers buzz around like flies, and Jemma Redgrave and Pip Carter as the therapists remind us of the perils of trying to stabilise creative talent. I’d have liked to have seen even more of Cat and Bernard making music together, but this is a fine play that raises a host of issues without ever trying to resolve them. At the Old Vic, London, until 16 June.

A US survey has found that 40% of those aged between 65 and 80 report being sexually active, with more than half of those who have a partner saying they still engage in steamy moments. “We recognise that sex and sexual health is something that is very important to the health and wellbeing of older people but is not something that gets a lot of attention,” said Dr Erica Solway from the University of Michigan, who was involved in the research. That, she says, could be because either individuals or medical professionals don’t raise the issue. “We thought this was a unique way to better understand this issue from the perspective of older people,” she said. The findings, part of the university’s National Poll on Healthy Aging, are based on online answers from around 1,000 participants aged between 65 and 80, and are nationally representative. The study was funded by Michigan Medicine – part of the university – and AARP, an interest group for ageing. The results reveal that 84% of men and 69% of women between 65 and 80 believe sex is important to a relationship at any age, with just over half of men and just under a third of women reporting that they were sexually active – although the researchers did not define quite what that involved. “We wanted it to be how that person defined it,” said Solway. While 12% of women reported having a strong interest in sex, more than 50% of men said the same. Fewer men were “extremely or very” happy with their sex life compared with women. Age was another key factor. Only a quarter of those aged between 76 and 80 reported being sexually active, compared with 46% of those aged 65-70. The authors say the report shows that while sex is important for many older adults, the topic is rarely discussed with either partners or healthcare professionals – just 17% of participants said they had talked about it with a health provider in the past two years, despite almost two-thirds saying they’d be happy to do so. “Some of these conversations are not happening,” said Solway. “It is possible it is because people don’t have problems, but more likely what might be happening is that healthcare providers may be more likely to wait for the older adults themselves to initiate a conversation.” Solway said the lack of discussion was important, not least because such conversations could help increase testing and awareness of sexually transmitted infections. According to UK figures, diagnoses of infections such as chlamydia are soaring among older adults. What’s more, 18% of men and 3% of women in the 65-80 age group reported taking medications or supplements in the last two years to improve their sexual function. “It is possible that there could be interactions with other medications that they are taking,” said Solway. And there might be other benefits from talking to doctors: recent research has found that while sex in older age appeared to protect women from cardiovascular problems, the opposite was true for men. Lesley Carter of Age UK said the report chimed with findings from England, and that it was time to get rid of stereotypes and misconceptions about sex in older age. She added that it was important medical professionals broached the topic with patients: “We know as younger people if you don’t get [sex] enough then you are quite miserable, but that is the same thing in older people. I think we as a society have to agree that older people have a right to good sexual health too, because every message is always about younger people.” Prof Josie Tetley of Manchester Metropolitan University, who has worked on English studies into the issue but was not involved in the latest survey, agreed. “Evidenced-based data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing has identified that sex and intimacy are important issues of ageing,” she said. “However, our research recognises that sex and intimacy is not all about penetrative sex, and we are looking at how sex and intimacy can be supported in later life through health and relationship support.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/03/la-philharmonicdudamel-review-bold-but-tending-towards-bluntness","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T10:42:43Z","webTitle":"LA Philharmonic/Dudamel review – bold, but tending towards bluntness","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/03/la-philharmonicdudamel-review-bold-but-tending-towards-bluntness","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/03/la-philharmonicdudamel-review-bold-but-tending-towards-bluntness","fields":{"headline":"LA Philharmonic/Dudamel review – bold, but tending towards bluntness","bodyText":"You can’t accuse the Los Angeles Philharmonic of underselling itself. Any orchestra that kicks off a three-day residency with a programme that includes Edgard Varèse’s riotous Amériques alongside a Shostakovich symphony, with the Liebestod from Wagner’s Tristan und Isolde as an encore, is counting on making an impression. But while the loudest moments lacked nothing, it took conductor Gustavo Dudamel until well into the second half – the slow movement of Shostakovich’s Symphony No 5 – to draw out quiet playing of anything like the same intensity. That the orchestra’s expressive range seemed curtailed wasn’t a problem in the first half, which was all Technicolor anyway. It opened with the European premiere of Pollux by Esa-Pekka Salonen, Dudamel’s predecessor as the LA Phil’s music director. A feast of many-layered strings, it sounded dense and sweet; occasionally there was the addition of a weighty bassline, and when a glockenspiel pinged out high above, it could have been John Adams at quarter-speed. Salonen plans a partner piece, Castor, depicting Zeus’s other twin son; for now, Pollux remains an abstract work, its seething, intriguing textures let down by a slightly pedestrian peroration towards the end. Amériques is a kind of urban Rite of Spring – imagine not the ice cracking, but the Manhattan tarmac. Varèse had been at the scandalous Paris premiere of The Rite only a few years earlier, and he boldly peppers his score, not only with glancing references to Stravinsky but with the alarm call of a wailing siren, which sounded rather measured – no freewheeling cop show sound-effects here. Otherwise, the orchestra played the piece for all it was worth, achieving a floor-shaking depth of sound, with Dudamel keeping things taut and tense. The Shostakovich, rightly, had the slow movement as its beating heart. The rest, though, tended towards bluntness, with phrasing that got the music from A to B without much nuance. The Wagner sounded luscious but felt foursquare. Perhaps the rest of the orchestra’s residency, which closes with Beethoven’s Ninth but otherwise focuses on new music and youth work, will play more consistently to Dudamel’s strengths. • At Barbican, London, 3 and 4 May.

Darcy Byrne, an ally of frontbencher Anthony Albanese and a delegate to the 2018 conference, says Newstart must increase because the unemployment payment hasn’t kept up with national living standards for more than a quarter of a century. Byrne, who is also the mayor of Inner West council in Sydney, said the conference in July will adopt a national platform, and as a delegate representing Albanese’s seat of Grayndler, he would push to commit Labor to increasing Newstart. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Shorten this week pledged to pursue a “root and branch” review of Australia’s welfare payments if he won the election, but he did not commit to raising it – leaving open the possibility his review could come to nothing. He made the pledge after a leading economist called for Newstart to be increased by $50 a week. A senior partner at Deloitte Access Economics and renowned budget conservative, Chris Richardson, called on the Turnbull government this week to boost Newstart in next week’s budget, saying it had become “embarrassingly inadequate” as a safety net for Australia’s poorest. “If we had to nominate the single standout fairness failure in Australia in 2018, it is undoubtedly our embarrassingly inadequate unemployment benefits,” Richardson wrote this week. “We should add $50 a week to these payments, and immediately index them to wages. That would be $3bn well spent.” The maximum Newstart payment is currently $272.90 a week for a single unemployed person, or just $38.98 a day. The cost of essentials such as housing, groceries, energy, transport and clothing is a minimum of $433 per week, according to the Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss). The national minimum wage is currently $694.90 a week for 38 ordinary hours’ work. Byrne said giving the poorest Australians a decent standard of living was a moral issue and “quite obviously should be a Labor cause”. “We must commit to increasing Newstart payments in the first term of a Labor Government,” he told Guardian Australia. “I will bring that proposition to the floor of the National Conference so this shameful national problem is properly debated and confronted. “When even the Business Council of Australia are advocating an increase in the dole you know it is time for the Labor Party to act. “Failure to increase the meagre income of unemployed Australians in the first term of a Labor Government risks this national outrage continuing indefinitely. Coalition Governments will always denigrate poor people but never offer them a helping hand. “Having provided the largest ever increase to the aged pension when last elected to government, our party must have the moral clarity now to lift the living standards of unemployed citizens too,” he said. Bryne will move his amendment to the national platform through the caucus of the Left faction before the national conference, and then seek support from Right faction delegates at the conference. Acoss says there are roughly 647,000 receiving the single rate of Newstart and Youth Allowance, and 55% of people who receive Newstart live below the poverty line. On Thursday the head of the Business Council renewed calls to increase the Newstart allowance, after the Liberal MP Julia Banks declared she could live on $40 a day. Banks told ABC radio on Wednesday she could “live on 40 bucks a day knowing that the government is supporting me with Newstart looking for employment”, for which she was later ridiculed. Banks, who according to her interests register owns five properties, including three investment homes, did not say where she would live in Melbourne, if she only had $40 a day to spend. As an MP, Banks receives $285 a night in travel allowance when she comes to Canberra, more than a Newstart recipient receives in a week. Greens senator Rachel Siewert, said she attempted to live off the payment for a weekand it was near impossible. “For anybody to make a claim that $40 per day is enough to live on shows they have become detached from the hardships experienced out in the community,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/08/the-pension-is-rubbish-what-western-sydney-wants-from-the-budget","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T05:32:21Z","webTitle":"'The pension is rubbish': what western Sydney wants from the federal budget","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/08/the-pension-is-rubbish-what-western-sydney-wants-from-the-budget","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/08/the-pension-is-rubbish-what-western-sydney-wants-from-the-budget","fields":{"headline":"'The pension is rubbish': what western Sydney wants from the federal budget","bodyText":"Last week, Guardian Australia spent a day speaking to people in western Sydney about what they wanted from the budget. Housing was the most common response, followed by health, childcare and social services. While funds have been earmarked for aged care and infrastructure, there is little indication that either housing or welfare will be boosted in Scott Morrison’s budget on Tuesday night, despite groups as diverse as the Business Council of Australia, Deloitte Access Economics, the Australian Industry Group and the Australian Council of Social Service all backing a rise in the Newstart payment. Drew Palmer, 33, Harris Park There’s not enough housing. [Building more houses] benefits homeless people, people with drug and alcohol problems. I think it fixes a lot of problems. A lot of other things integrate into that. I’m studying community services. In Canada, they help people off the street into housing and it was quite successful.

We’ve got resources to do it. • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Huong Truong, 61, top photo, Westmead My son and my daughter both got married and moved, and I live alone [in public housing] and every time the rent goes up, up, up, but nobody comes to fix it up for me. I’m very angry. Sometimes I want to go to the [Centrelink] counter to complain, because my money isn’t the same. $440, $395, sometimes it’s $300 – later, I don’t know. I want to complain to housing, ‘Why isn’t my money from Centrelink the same?’ It’s not correct for me. Joe Abassi, 67, Guildford The last three years the energy prices have more than doubled. I was paying $1,500, I’m paying nearly $4,000 now [for my mixed business]. The government is stupid, selling everything to the private sector so they can play with the prices the way they want. There should be a control! Set a price. I’m OK, I own my own business. I still put my air conditioner and my heater on but some pensioner – when winter comes, they can’t bloody put the heater on. The pension in this country is rubbish. Forty years paying taxes and you get $400. Frank Webb, 64, Merrylands I’ve got four sons, all gainfully employed now, but for a period of time the eldest with a PhD in chemistry couldn’t get a job. He was 34 and for 12 months he couldn’t get work. The government says we’ve got to work on Stem but there are no jobs at the end for them. The system is stacked against young people coming in. We’ve had Tafe close down – that’s where I went to university. Tafe and apprenticeships are becoming unavailable to people. Also, house prices are being forced up because investors are coming in. The government has started to wind negative gearing back but there’s so much more winding back that has to happen. I’m concerned we’re going to end up with a crisis. Katherine Hardacre, 33, Penrith There’s a cap at the moment, where the government will only give you $7,500 back for your childcare benefit. Because [my three-year-old] Scarlett [left, pictured with Katherine and Chelsea, 5] goes four days a week this year, she’s going to reach that cap. After April, I’ll have to pay the full fee without the 50% you normally get back. It’ll cost me $2,500 or so. But after 1 July next year, they’ve scrapped the cap. They’ve changed some other rules around income but those don’t impact me, it just means she’ll be going four days a week and we’ll get the 50% rebate the whole year. Which is awesome.

The news came as the firm announced its IPO on the Hong Kong stock exchange seeking to raise at least $10bn (£7.3bn), in what could be the largest offering since Chinese e-commerce conglomerate Alibaba’s $25bn listing in New York in 2014. Xiaomi, the world’s fourth-largest smartphone maker, has made a name for itself selling high-end phones at rock-bottom prices but has been limited to China and other developing markets, such as India. It made its first move into western Europe by debuting in Spain in November last year. The partnership with Hutchinson will lead to Xiaomi phones being sold through Three stores in the UK and Ireland, as well as Austria, Denmark, Hong Kong and Sweden. “We have been watching Xiaomi’s success from afar and are impressed with the huge range of connected devices that they currently offer,” Three UK’s chief digital officer, Tom Malleschitz, said and added that it opens the door to Xiaomi’s other connected devices such as smart home appliances. Xiaomi’s $10bn fundraising could value the company at up to $100bn, making it the third largest Chinese tech firm by value behind so-called “national champions” Tencent and Alibaba. Xiaomi is the top-selling smartphone brand in India ahead of Samsung and the fourth globally in the first quarter of 2018 behind Samsung, Apple and Huawei, according to the analysts IDC. However, the firm made a a loss of $6.9bn last year. The eight-year-old company first cultivated a following in China by selling imitations of Apple’s iPhone at half the price of the real products, which resulted in it being hit with threats of patent infringement that were seen as keeping Xiaomi out of the west. Xiaomi describes itself as the “triathlete” of Chinese tech firms. Most of its revenue come from smartphone sales, sold at a low-profit margin. The rest comes from selling smart household gadgets – Xiaomi rice cookers, scooters or air conditioners – and online services such as entertainment and financial service apps. In an open letter included in the filing, the 48-year-old founder, Lei Jun, acknowledged the company’s struggles in 2016 when phone sales declined as competitors churned out cheaper options. “It was clear to us that because we grew so quickly in our early years, we did not have an adequately strong foundation to face all the challenges in front of us at the time,” Lei wrote. The company invested in businesses involved in lifestyle and internet of things products, and Lei asked his co-founder to step aside so he could take over as the supply chain chief. Between 2015 and 2017, sales increased by 70% to 114.6bn yuan ($17.9bn), according to the filing. Xiaomi still depends on China for the majority of its revenues, a challenge given that that market is nearing saturation. For the first time in five years, smartphone shipments dipped below 100m in the first quarter of this year. Xiaomi phones are popular with first-time buyers but shoppers often upgrade to Apple’s iPhone or other phones in later purchases."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/04/commonwealth-bank-board-asleep-at-the-wheel-during-scandals-advocates-say","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T18:00:00Z","webTitle":"Commonwealth Bank board 'asleep at the wheel' during scandals, advocates say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/04/commonwealth-bank-board-asleep-at-the-wheel-during-scandals-advocates-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/04/commonwealth-bank-board-asleep-at-the-wheel-during-scandals-advocates-say","fields":{"headline":"Commonwealth Bank board 'asleep at the wheel' during scandals, advocates say","bodyText":"Long-serving Commonwealth Bank board members have been asleep at the wheel during the corporate giant’s long string of scandals, consumer advocates say. The former treasurer Peter Costello has also slammed boards for being “complacent” in their duties since emerging from the global financial crisis relatively unscathed. On Wednesday CBA was the subject of yet another scandal. BuzzFeed Australia exposed how it lost 12m historical customer statements but failed to tell the public. Other revelations span back to at least 2009, when 14,000 investors were dudded by the collapse of Storm Financial. CBA has since been accused of breaching money laundering laws, bribery, forgery, a failure to provide advertised fee waivers, the provision of shoddy financial planning advice, complicity in an elaborate Ponzi scheme, unethical behaviour to avoid CommInsure insurance payouts and the fees-for-no-service scandal. • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The prudential regulator this week issued a damning report on flaws with the bank’s culture and criticised the board for “inadequate oversight” of emerging risks. Two of CBA’s current board non-executive directors – Shirish Apte and David Higgins – have sat on the board since 2014, while Brian Long and Andrew Mohl have been members since 2010 and 2008 respectively. Apte, the chair of the risk committee, lives in Singapore. Last year, non-executive board members were paid between $272,277 and $351,464, according to CBA’s annual report. On Thursday Costello said bank boards needed to take partial blame for the sector’s failings. He also criticised the use of overseas directors on risk committees. “Some of these boards became complacent,” he said, according to Fairfax. “To me one of the biggest risks facing a bank would be regulatory failure. Because if you fail to adhere to the law, not only are you letting your customer down but as we see now you face immense reputational risk. The Consumer Action Law Centre has made a submission to the royal commission, urging it to consider whether the directors of banks breached their duties by failing to prevent “systemic breaches of financial services law”. Asked whether the CBA board had fallen asleep at the wheel, the centre’s chief executive, Gerard Brody, told Guardian Australia: “I think that’s fair to say. And I think that the report put out by [the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority] this week confirms that. “One of the key roles of the board is to manage organisational risk, or have systems to manage organisational risk. That’s where they’ve failed. “I think these numerous incidents at Commonwealth Bank – from Storm Financial to financial planning, to the fee-for-no-service, to the CommInsure issues, the credit card insurance ones as well – it appears the board has had inadequate systems to make sure lessons were learnt, things were fixed properly and preventative measures were put in place to make sure it wouldn’t happen again.” The Australian Shareholders Association said much of the board at CBA was relatively new, which lessened their accountability for past scandals. Allan Goldin, the ASA’s New South Wales company monitoring committee chairman, said CBA’s chairwoman and new chief executive had “said all the right things” following APRA’s report. But Goldin said the bank needed to demonstrate what real steps it had taken in the wake of the crises. “How many people have been fired? Let’s get down to basics,” Goldin told Guardian Australia. “When any of these scandals [occurs], it’s like ‘three financial planners are no longer with us, 10 financial planners are no longer with us’. That’s nothing. It’s who was the financial planner’s boss, is he still there? “If you discover that people have been doing something wrong, yes you put procedures in to make sure it doesn’t happen again. But you also make a lesson. You say, ‘You’ve done wrong, you know you were doing wrong. Get out.’” Commonwealth Bank announced last year that it would strip the board of 20% of their fees. That is less than the 25% announced by AMP this week. Helen Bird, a corporate governance expert at Swinburne University, believes Apra could have taken tougher action against CBA. In a piece for the Conversation, she wrote that conditions could have been placed on CBA’s banking licence and board members and executives removed. Bird said bonuses for CBA executives should be limited until the bank proves it has met Apra’s recommendations. “The reasons I would push that is because it drives the performance,” she told Guardian Australia. “If you want them to comply with the undertaking, that’s the way you drive it.” The enforceable undertaking between Apra and CBA did allow for bonuses to be withheld. But Bird said the public would not be privy to whether that actually occurred, something she said was “troubling”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/14979","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T23:00:25Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 14,979","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/14979","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/14979","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 14,979","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/30/diante-yarber-police-shooting-jimmie-alfred-walker-hate-crime-charge","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T01:54:10Z","webTitle":"Diante Yarber: officer involved in killing was previously charged with hate crime","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/30/diante-yarber-police-shooting-jimmie-alfred-walker-hate-crime-charge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/30/diante-yarber-police-shooting-jimmie-alfred-walker-hate-crime-charge","fields":{"headline":"Diante Yarber: officer involved in killing was previously charged with hate crime","bodyText":"One of the police officers involved in the shooting of Diante Yarber, a young black man killed in a hail of bullets in a Walmart parking lot, was previously charged with a hate crime and fired from the force, the Guardian has learned. A police spokesman in Barstow, California, confirmed late Monday that officer Jimmie Alfred Walker was one of the officers involved in the 5 April shooting. The death of the 26-year-old father of three sparked national backlash after it was revealed that officers had fired a barrage of rounds into a car, injuring a young woman and killing Yarber, who was believed to be unarmed. Walker, who is white, was charged in 2010 with hate crime and battery charges after the then 30-year-old officer allegedly used racial slurs against a man and assaulted him and a woman while off duty. The officer eventually pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of fighting in a public place and being drunk in public, while the battery charge and hate crime charge (“violating civil rights by force or threat of force”) were dropped, according to records obtained by the Guardian. As part of his plea deal, Walker was forced to make a $200 donation to the NAACP and required to attend Narcotics Anonymous meetings, the court documents show. The local newspaper Victorville Daily Press reported at the time that Walker was fired as a result, but that an arbiter later ruled that the termination was wrongful, forcing the city to reinstate him and pay him $163,000 in owed wages. The Barstow police captain, Andrew Espinoza, confirmed to the Guardian that in addition to Walker, the other officers involved in the shooting of Yarber were corporal Jose Barrientos, officer Vincent Carrillo and officer Mathew Allen Helms. The department had previously refused to disclose the names despite intense pressure. Walker could not be reached for comment, and two attorneys who have represented him did not immediately respond to inquiries. Blurry witness footage suggested that police may have fired more than 30 bullets into Yarber’s car. Police have claimed officers were responding to a call of a “suspicious vehicle” and that Yarber was “wanted for questioning” in a stolen vehicle case. Officials further alleged that he “accelerated” the car towards officers when they tried to stop him, “almost hitting one officer”. His family and attorneys, however, told the Guardian that the car Yarber was driving to the store with his cousin and friends inside, was not stolen, that he was unarmed and not a threat to the policemen, and that it violated basic law enforcement standards to fire into a packed vehicle. Laywers representing Yarber’s family and the surviving passengers in the car said Walker’s history further supported their claims that it was unjustified and racially prejudiced to stop the vehicle and fire at the passengers. “We believe that it shows his improper motive and his bias and hatred of African Americans,” said Sharon Brunner, an attorney for the 23-year-old woman injured in the vehicle. “We believe that the only reason that he would believe the car was suspicious is because it contained African Americans.” Lee Merritt, an attorney representing Yarber’s family, chastised the media for focusing on Yarber’s previous run-ins with the law, given Walker’s background: “The relevant criminal record is the criminal record of the shooter. That has been absent from the discussion.” Marlon Hawkins, a 41-year-old man who was in the passenger seat, told the Guardian in a recent interview that he thought police targeted them because they were black: “It’s really disheartening that we have these demonic people out there claiming to protect and serve … What they did was nothing short of evil.” In a press conference last week, Merritt said officers did not provide medical aid to Yarber while he was bleeding to death in the car and that it appeared he was hit at least 10 times. Yarber’s death reignited protests surrounding US law enforcement’s treatment of black Americans following the recent police killing of Stephon Clark, an unarmed 22-year-old California man shot 20 times in his family’s backyard."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/01/cardinal-george-pell-stand-trial-historical-sexual-offence-charges","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T09:16:39Z","webTitle":"Cardinal George Pell: Vatican treasurer faces historical sexual offences trial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/01/cardinal-george-pell-stand-trial-historical-sexual-offence-charges","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/01/cardinal-george-pell-stand-trial-historical-sexual-offence-charges","fields":{"headline":"Cardinal George Pell: Vatican treasurer faces historical sexual offences trial","bodyText":"Cardinal George Pell, Australia’s most senior Catholic and the controller of the Vatican’s finances in Rome, has pleaded not guilty after he was ordered to stand trial over historical sexual offence allegations. Pell has always denied the allegations against him, but it was the first time he had been required to enter a formal plea. Many of the most serious allegations were dismissed in the Melbourne magistrates’ court on Tuesday, with witnesses described as unreliable and lacking credibility. But a number of charges were ordered to go to trial. Further details of the nature of the charges are unable to be reported for legal reasons. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Magistrate Belinda Wallington handed down the decision following a committal hearing that lasted almost a month throughout March and April. Pell was surrounded by police as he was quickly ushered into the court just before 9.30am, and was met by a small crowd of supporters and opponents. Wallington told the court that if the evidence was not of sufficient weight to support a conviction, an allegation must be discharged. If the credibility of a witness was destroyed during a committal, their allegation could not go to trial, she said. Cases so weak a jury could not possibly convict a defendant had to be thrown out. A number of charges had been withdrawn during the committal hearing. Wallington found it was impossible that a further group of charges relating to one complainant could be sustained. The offences were alleged to have occurred over 12 months and the complainant alleged he was removed from the St Joseph’s boys home and from his dorm, and taken to the locations where he alleged the offences occurred. But Wallington found the series of offences could not have occurred in the period alleged by the complainant, from late September 1978, because records showed the complainant did not live at the home during this time. His foster mother also gave evidence the complainant did not live in the boys home during that time. “He [the complainant] could not reconcile the differences,” Wallington said. “In this case the inconsistencies must be examined as a fundamental defect in evidence.” She said this had damaged the complainant’s reliability. “I find [his] evidence as a whole is not of sufficient weight for a jury to convict,” she said. A further allegation made by a separate complainant was also thrown out by Wallington. The complainant had a “cavalier attitude” towards the court, Wallington found, and sometimes cited a lack of recall to avoid answering questions. “It is difficult to see how a jury can convict on the evidence of a man who cannot recall what he said one minute ago,” Wallington said, even when considering the trauma of giving evidence. “I am not satisfied the evidence is of sufficient weight to support a conviction.” But she was satisfied a jury could hear the evidence from multiple complainants. The nature of those allegations cannot be detailed for legal reasons. Pell’s defence team said one group of charges was “substantially different” to another group, and indicated they might push for separate trials as a result. Throughout the committal Pell sat each day in courtroom 22 in the same seat, head bowed, sometimes taking notes, always dressed in the same outfit: black pants, black shirt and a beige jacket. The first days of the committal hearing, which began on 5 March, were closed to the media and the public while complainants gave evidence – a standard procedure for cases involving sexual offence allegations. When the hearing was reopened to the media and the public, Pell’s defence lawyer, Robert Richter, cross-examined former choir boys and staff of St Patrick’s cathedral in Melbourne, senior police officers, family members of the complainants and staff from other venues where offences were alleged to have occurred. Pell’s defence team argued that the evidence was uncorroborated and unreliable, and that police had sometimes failed to properly take notes. Wallington ordered those who had previously given evidence or who might be required to give evidence in a trial to leave the court before she handed down her decision. A date for the trial is yet to be set. A directions hearing will be held on Wednesday to go over a number of administrative matters. A statement released on behalf of Pell through law firm Galbally and O’Bryan on Tuesday afternoon said Pell would like to thank his supporters for their “continuing support and prayers”. “He will defend the remaining charges,” the statement said. A statement from the Vatican said that Pell would remain on leave during the trial: “Last year, the Holy Father granted Cardinal Pell a leave of absence so he could defend himself from the accusations. The leave of absence is still in place.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/16/john-travoltas-screen-portrayal-of-boss-gotti-takes-a-pelting","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T16:24:45Z","webTitle":"John Travolta's screen portrayal of crime boss Gotti takes a pelting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/16/john-travoltas-screen-portrayal-of-boss-gotti-takes-a-pelting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/16/john-travoltas-screen-portrayal-of-boss-gotti-takes-a-pelting","fields":{"headline":"John Travolta's screen portrayal of crime boss Gotti takes a pelting","bodyText":"Mobsters regularly face worse than a hail of rotten tomatoes, but John Travolta’s screen portrayal of the New York City crime boss John Gotti has taken quite a pelting. The film, directed by Kevin Connolly, has scored a rare zero on the well-known review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes. Travolta, 64, plays the leading role in the story of the rise of the criminal known as the Teflon Don, who headed the Gambino family. It had been in production since 2016. All 18 of the reviews on the website on Saturday had judged it thoroughly “rotten”. Scoring on the site is often harsh, but it is unusual for a film not to receive any positive feedback – aside from some favourable comments about the makeup. Unfortunately for Travolta, he also stars in one of the few other films to have been rated so low, the 1993 comedy sequel Look Who’s Talking Now! in which he returned for the third time opposite Kirsty Alley. Jaws: The Revenge, made in 1987, and The Ridiculous 6, a 2015 western comedy starring Adam Sandler, have also scored zero. The verdict of the New York Times critic was uncompromising: “That the long-gestating crime drama Gotti is a dismal mess comes as no surprise. What does shock is just how multifaceted a dismal mess it is.” Rolling Stone’s reviewer wrote: “Starring in this mobster biopic that deserves to get whacked is an offer Travolta should have refused.” The industry magazine Variety was no kinder: “It’s almost laughable to see this iconic star trying so hard on behalf of a movie that is so clearly compromised in its intentions.” Gotti also stars Travolta’s wife, Kelly Preston, in the role of his screen wife, Victoria. It does not yet have a British release date."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"crosswords/2018/jun/17/azed-crossword-2401","type":"article","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T23:01:10Z","webTitle":"Azed crossword 2,401","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2018/jun/17/azed-crossword-2401","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/2018/jun/17/azed-crossword-2401","fields":{"headline":"Azed crossword 2,401","bodyText":"Click here for a printable version.

The pace of Kylian Mbappé, the guile of Antoine Griezmann, the power of Paul Pogba – few expected Bert van Marwijk’s boys to have a hope against the might of the 1998 World Cup champions and two-times European champions France. How could the makeshift centre-back Mark Milligan, who plays his club football in Saudia Arabia, and the Western Sydney Wanderers full-back Josh Risdon stand a chance? Russia’s 5-0 demolition of Saudi Arabia, along with Iran’s struggles against Morocco on Friday, emphasised the point: Asian football is ordinary and the Socceroos would be no match for Didier Deschamps’s new brigade of French phenomenons. Victory was guaranteed. And after 15 minutes the match was going entirely to script. In the first five minutes Mat Ryan had to save the green and gold’s bacon no fewer than three times. It took less than two minutes for Les Bleus to trouble the Brighton goalkeeper. It appeared a matter of when, not if, they would find a way to pierce his armour. But then it all changed. Australia started to hold on to the ball and keep possession. They built pressure of their own and frustrated France, both full-backs bombing forward. Aaron Mooy was increasingly effective. In the 16th minute Trent Sainsbury would have scored if not for a brilliant diving save by Hugo Lloris. The Socceroos clawed their way back in and went toe to toe with France. The goalless stalemate lasted for 58 minutes, until a controversial penalty was given against them. But a mere four minutes later it was all tied up again, when Mile Jedinak blasted home from the spot after a handball. The largely pro-Australia crowd erupted. For 19 more minutes it was locked at 1-1 and Australia were headed for a draw, a deserved one at that. As the game progressed Australia calmed themselves, playing with no fear and plenty of artistry. This was not what was supposed to happen. Tomi Juric echoed his teammate’s thoughts: “We knew if we stayed organised and compact we could make it difficult for them, and it showed today. I don’t think they really created anything solid … there was two controversial decisions. If we continue to play this way and with this passion and togetherness like we did today, we can be pretty optimistic about the next two games.” It is clear in a short time that Van Marwijk has whipped Australia into solid shape, making them more disciplined and structured. His 4-2-3-1 formation plays more to the Socceroos’ strengths than Ange Postecoglou’s overly ambitious 3-4-2-1 and ultra-attack philosophy. The Dutchman, just as he did with his homeland in 2010, has turned the Socceroos into a formidable unit that puts workrate and organisation above individual brilliance or ego. Collectively, they are sturdy and difficult opponents. Van Marwijk has also used his considerable experience and pedigree to give his players the confidence to compete at this level. Australia next face Denmark and Peru, and will need a least a victory and draw to progress. That is entirely possible when they can perform as well as they did against a team such as France, who possess a superior XI to those two sides. Neither the Danish Dynamite nor La Blanquirroja are as dangerous or as talented. The positive signs were clear at Kazan Arena. Australia’s 2018 World Cup sojourn is anything but finished."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/16/italy-bars-two-more-refugee-ships-from-ports","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T14:39:49Z","webTitle":"Italy bars two more refugee ships from ports","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/16/italy-bars-two-more-refugee-ships-from-ports","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/16/italy-bars-two-more-refugee-ships-from-ports","fields":{"headline":"Italy bars two more refugee ships from ports","bodyText":"Italy’s interior minister has sparked a new migration crisis in the Mediterranean by barring two rescue boats from bringing refugees to shore, a week after the Aquarius was prevented from docking. “Two other ships with the flag of Netherlands, Lifeline and Seefuchs, have arrived off the coast of Libya, waiting for their load of human beings abandoned by the smugglers,” Matteo Salvini, the leader of the anti-immigrant party the League, wrote on his Facebook page. “These gentlemen know that Italy no longer wants to be complicit in the business of illegal immigration, and therefore will have to look for other ports [not Italian] where to go.” Italy’s closure of its ports to the migrant rescue ship Aquarius, which was carrying 620 people, triggered warnings from aid agencies of a deadly summer at sea for people trying to cross the Mediterranean. Axel Steier, the co-founder of Mission Lifeline which operates the Lifeline ship, said his crew had rescued more than 100 migrants off Libya on Friday in an operation with a US warship, and transferred them to a Turkish merchant vessel. He said his ship was too small to make the journey from Libya to Italian ports and that he always transferred migrants to other ships, but insisted those craft should have the right to land in Italy. “I am sure there is an obligation for Italy to take them because its closest safe harbour is Lampedusa. We hand over migrants to Europe because of the Geneva convention,” he said. Vessels chartered by an assortment of European NGOs have plied the waters off Libya for three years, rescuing migrants from leaking boats and transporting them to Sicily. Following Salvini’s decision to prevent the Aquarius from docking, however, Malta quickly followed suit, leaving the vessel stranded at sea until Spain offered to take the ship. It is due to arrive in Valencia on Sunday. Crews of the NGO boats say Salvini’s port closures leaves them without anywhere close by to take the people they rescue, and that the move will prove counterproductive. “It will not stop people coming,” said Ruben Neugebauer, of the German charity ship Sea Watch. “They will come anyway, but more of them will die.” Sea Watch refused last week to take 40 migrants rescued by the US navy ship Trenton off Libya, fearing a fate similar to that of the Aquarius. Trenton waited four days before being allowed to dock in Sicily. Charities say the NGO boats are a vital lifeline, rescuing more than 88,000 people in the past two years, but critics say they are a pull factor, encouraging people to make the dangerous sea journey. More than 600,000 migrants have made the crossing from Libya to Italy in the past four years, and Salvini’s stance reflects frustration that the rest of Europe refuses to take its share of arrivals. At least 13,000 people have drowned trying to reach European shores. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, accused Salvini last week of cynicism and irresponsibility, but at the same time refused to allow the Aquarius to dock at French ports. “Malta and Italy didn’t open their ports, but then most other European governments didn’t help either,” said Izza Leghtas, a senior advocate at Europe for Refugees International. “They are all passing the ball among themselves.“ If the NGO boats are unable to land the people they rescue and cease to operate, Operation Sophia, an EU anti-smuggler mission patrolling the Mediterranean, may take up some of the slack. NGOs, however, say its warships operate too far out to sea, given that people traffickers favour towing rubber boats full of migrants to the edge of Libya’s 12-mile territorial waters before setting them adrift. Italy’s port closures come despite an 85% fall in migrant crossings since last year. The decrease is in part the result of the EU and Italy training and funding Libya’s coastguard to intercept vessels."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/17/tunisia-england-world-cup-2018-nabil-maaloul","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T10:00:11Z","webTitle":"Tunisia coach Nabil Maâloul promises to play without fear against England | Paul Doyle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/17/tunisia-england-world-cup-2018-nabil-maaloul","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/17/tunisia-england-world-cup-2018-nabil-maaloul","fields":{"headline":"Tunisia coach Nabil Maâloul promises to play without fear against England","bodyText":"Tunisia were drawing 1-1 with Serbia when Mohamed Jedidi stepped up to take a penalty. The striker scored and began celebrating. But the referee, Tahiti’s Charles Ariiotima, spotted an encroachment and ordered a retake. Jedidi stepped up and scored again. But the referee spotted an encroachment and ordered a retake. So Jedidi stepped up and scored yet again. But the referee spotted an encroachment and ordered a retake. As Tunisia’s manager raged on the sidelines, Jedidi stepped up again. This time his shot was saved! But the referee spotted an encroachment and ordered a retake. For the fifth time Jedidi stepped up. The goalkeeper denied him again. But the referee spotted an encroachment and ordered a retake. For his sixth attempt Jedidi drove the ball into the net. By now everyone had got the message and, no one having strayed into the box, the referee allowed the goal. Tunisia went on to win 3-2 but did not get out of their group. That was at the 2004 Olympics, where Nabil Maâloul took charge of his country – albeit an under-23 side – for the first time and got a valuable reminder of the merits of persistence. On Monday Maâloul will send his side out against England hoping his second stint in charge of Tunisia’s senior team will end more gloriously than his first. Not that he has been starved of glory. He went to the 2004 Olympics straight after serving as assistant manager to the Frenchman Roger Lemerre when Tunisia won the Africa Cup of Nations. He then enjoyed success as a club manager, chiefly with Espérance, the Tunis club where the former midfielder spent most of his playing career. Maâloul led them to two domestic titles and the 2011 African Champions League. But his first attempt at leading his country’s senior team ended in ignominy, as he resigned following a home defeat against Cape Verde in the qualifiers for the 2014 World Cup. That result was overturned because Cape Verde fielded a suspended player but Maâloul had made up his mind. Likewise, many Tunisians had formed clear opinions of him after one victory from six matches. Many, then, were miffed when Maâloul eventually returned for a second go, taking the reins in April 2017 after the sacking of Henryk Kasperczak. To quash doubters he needed a strong second start. He made one, his team beating Egypt in his first match back thanks to a canny tactical performance that neutralised Mohamed Salah. Then he guided the Carthage Eagles to their first World Cup for 12 years. Since qualification Tunisia have had rotten luck, losing key players to injury including their best striker, Taha Yassine Khenissi, and the marvellous playmaker Youssef Msakni. Despite that Tunisia go into the game against England pointing to progress made in recent months. “We are in form,” says Maâloul. “We know very well we are in an extremely tough group but we have raised our game, especially in terms of our athleticism. Everyone has seen how well we have played in the warm-ups. We are determined to go down in history.” Maâloul was not talking twaddle. Always adept technically, Tunisia have played with more zip and muscle since qualification. They have also grown in cohesion, which must be particularly satisfying for the manager given critics told him he risked deflating team spirit when, post-qualification, he embarked on a scouting mission for new players, ones born in Europe to Tunisian parents. He has taken four such recruits to Russia. Two of them, the midfielders Saîf‑Eddine Khaoui and Ellyes Skhiri, have good chances of starting against England. The other two may also feature: the goalkeeper Mouez Hassen may be chosen ahead of Aymen Mathlouthi, the veteran who has looked shaky since falling out of favour at his club in Saudi Arabia. The Leicester City defender Yohan Benalouane will probably only play if Maâloul opts for three centre‑backs, which would be unwise on the evidence of the warm-ups, during which experimentation with a five-man defence confirmed that Benalouane is rash and Tunisia are at their best when playing nimbly on the front foot. Technique and clever movement are the keys to their attack, especially since injuries persuaded Maâloul to play without a recognised striker, using the winger Wahbi Khazri as a false 9. The Sunderland player tends to combine well with a trio of tricky midfielders behind him, especially Naïm Sliti. Maâloul has vowed to do more than absorb pressure against England. “I’ve told the players to enjoy these matches because you don’t get to play against the world’s best every day,” he said. Tunisians hope Maâloul really does intend attacking because that is what this team do best – and World Cups are opportunities that most countries and managers do not get to take again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/18/robert-lewandowski-interview-trust-friends-poland-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T05:59:35Z","webTitle":"Robert Lewandowski: ‘I know who I can trust.

I don’t change friends like socks’","bodyText":"The Olympiastadion in Munich was the scene of Poland’s two biggest football successes, so it is an apt location to meet the man carrying the nation’s hopes on his shoulders this summer. Robert Lewandowski has been a leader of this Polish generation for quite some time, yet he is about to play in his first World Cup. Qualifying disappointments in 2010 and 2014 have meant that one of the world’s best finishers has been forced to look on as other players have made the headlines. In the 1970s, Poland, inspired by Grzegorz Lato and Jan Tomaszewski, won the 1972 Olympic gold medal at the Olympiastadion and came back two years later to secure third place at the World Cup, in the same arena. The intervening years have not been as kind to the nation – although they had a wonderful team in the 80s – and Lewandowski and his team-mates are desperate to make up for lost time. They are eighth in the Fifa rankings and were among the top group of seeds for the World Cup in Russia. Can Lewandowski and co repeat the feats of Lato’s Poland and get to the semi-finals? Lato scored seven goals in the 1974 World Cup … “That kind of tally gives you immortality,” the Bayern Munich striker says. “Times have changed, though, and from that perspective seven goals is very hard to beat. It is harder near the penalty box now. To score five or six goals at such a tournament is a huge task. Two years ago, at Euro 2016, I only had two or three good chances and scored one of them. “Defenders give special attention to me and that can obviously happen again in Russia. If that is the case, I just want that our team benefit from it. History is history and it is nice to look back and remember, but we want to be remembered and write our own history. We will fight for beautiful memories.” The striker, who goes by the nickname “The Body” at Bayern, has been playing in Germany for eight years and has been in the world-class bracket for six of those. He is continually ranked among the 10 best footballers in the world, and is happily married to Anna, and has a daughter, Klara. Things could not be better really. However, life, as always, is not quite that simple. Being famous has its downsides too. Lewandowski, for example, knows he cannot trust people the way he used to be able to. He has had to learn from his experiences. “There have been many attempts of dishonesty,” he says. “Even fake charity proposals. The number of strange offers is absolutely astonishing and, because of that, I have become distrusting of people. No one becomes my friend in one day. I have many doubts and my first thought these days, sadly, is: ‘This person wants something from me.’ “But even if I weren’t famous, it wouldn’t be that easy to get close to me. I have my old friends and I keep them very close to myself. I know who I can trust. I don’t change my friends like socks. When there is someone I think I may like, I can open the door, but I do it very slowly. Trust has to be there before I open my heart.” His private and professional life connect because of the friends who work for him. They knew him long before he became the Robert Lewandowski and he is 100% sure he can trust them. Most of them he has known since his childhood. Tomasz Zawislak is his manager, Kamil Gorzelnik his lawyer, and he even has a bodyguard, Marcin Kulczyk. How many situations has he been through that have required a bodyguard? “Quite a lot of them. Me and Marcin have a feeling for when he should go with me somewhere. It is usually an official event, where it has been known for a long time that I will attend. Fans will be waiting and there will be a lot of photographers pushing toward me. “It is not about separating myself from people, but having a situation under control. There were times when I just lost focus for a second and suddenly I was under a lot of pressure and couldn’t get away.” Those situations can be difficult, with some people capable of being rude or aggressive, especially fans of other teams. “Especially when they are under the influence of alcohol,” he says. “There is aggression, people giving me the finger, swearing at me, reminding me of bad games, telling me how I should play or live my life. I have had confrontations like this in restaurants, for example, but if it gets too heated, Marcin reacts.” Lewandowski is recognised almost wherever he goes, but sometimes he gets away from the attention by introducing himself as … Emil. Why this alter ego, I ask? “It is pure coincidence and I don’t use it that much, but it is helpful when we are with friends somewhere,” he says. “For example, in a restaurant, we talk and laugh, but don’t use ‘Robert’ or ‘Lewy’. And in that situation I’m Emil. No one turns around or looks in my direction. And if someone thinks they have recognised me, and ask if I am Robert Lewandowski, I simply say ‘Sorry, it’s a mistake, I just look like him. I’m Emil, not Robert.” That trick, however, does not work all the time. The Pole, after all, is the Bundesliga’s highest earner and the league’s star name. Deep down, however, the money and the fame is not that important to him. A group of advisers runs his businesses, but it is always Lewandowski who has the final say. There have been times when important documents have needed signing and a helicopter has landed at the national team training camp in Arlamow, just so Lewandowski can close a deal. “I can afford anything,” he admits. “But I’m in a moment where I appreciate a different capital: love and happiness. I have a beautiful family. My daughter just turned one. She made me even more stabilised. I can say I’m a fulfilled person in life but in terms of football I’m still hungry. I think it is very important to be happy in life and a lot of people have the opposite. A lot of money doesn’t guarantee happiness and it can actually make you lonely, without support and motivation. There are intangible things that make you strong.” This World Cup will be his first but, he says, not necessarily his last. He will be 30 in August but says that his best moments are still in front of him. “I have a plan to play at the top level at least until I’m 35,” he says. “I feel I’m just starting the best period for a striker. I’m mature and have a lot of experience. If I’m healthy, I will play in Europe as long as possible – and then move on. We will see.” Improving is an obsession for Lewandowski. He always identifies what he can do better and is often the last one to leave the Bayern training pitch. It could be free-kicks or penalties or his left foot. “You do it because you have to repeat everything time and time again,” he says. “Then I add things. At the moment I am trying to improve my long-distance shooting with my left foot. I have to reach a point with that where my head doesn’t have to think – I just react – and that helps me to make quick decisions. It’s called the automatics. To do something because you just know how to do it. There is no wasting time on thinking. In football you don’t learn everything at the same time. You have to work on yourself all the time.” We look out over the Olympiastadion again. Soon Lewandowski will attempt to write his own World Cup story when Poland play Senegal in their first group match on Tuesday. Going back to the question of whether Poland can emulate the 1974 team, he says: “Relax, let’s not get expectations up too high.

The Reagan administration’s covert (and illegal) efforts to vanquish Ortega by force, after the Sandinistas helped topple the Somoza dictatorship in 1979, provoked an international campaign in support of the revolution. The fight against the US-backed Contra rebels was part of a wider, cold war struggle to defeat US hegemony in Central America. Many on the British left campaigned passionately on the subject. Not so much is heard from them about Nicaragua these days. And that’s a pity. The country appears to be in the throes of another revolution, but this time it is Ortega who is experiencing the people’s wrath. After failing to convert socialist enthusiasm into economic progress, Ortega was defeated by a US-backed candidate in elections in 1990. But he made a comeback in 2006 – and has held the presidency ever since. This is largely because, in the manner of another leftwing icon, Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez, he eviscerated opposition parties, abolished constitutional term limits and extended controls on the judiciary, the electoral authority and the media. Life for many in Nicaragua remains an uphill battle. It is ranked the poorest country in Central America and the second poorest in the western hemisphere after Haiti. Around 30% of Nicaraguans, in a population of 6 million, must manage on less than $2 a day. So when, in April, the government increased social security payments and cut pensions, a popular explosion occurred. Spontaneous, unorganised street protests involving unemployed youths, students, pensioners, trades unionists and religious leaders erupted across the country. Ortega’s response has been brutal. At least 170 people have been killed and hundreds more injured in violence involving police firing live ammunition, backed by “shock groups” of armed paramilitaries. The government says Sandinista supporters have been targeted by demonstrators, too. Disappearances, punishment beatings and kidnappings have become a frequent occurrence in Managua. Schools, universities and banks have shut their doors. One report described the country as being in “full cardiac arrest”. But still the protests continue, focused on twin demands that Ortega and his wife, the vice-president, Rosario Murillo, step down, and that early elections be held. Hopes that the crisis may be defused now centre on talks mediated by Catholic church leaders. On Friday, all parties agreed to halt the clashes and Ortega reportedly accepted a proposal to allow an international taskforce to investigate the killings. But while he has promised to instigate political reforms, the civic groups opposing him have received no reply to their call for early elections. The crisis is far from over. The Organization of American States and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights have a responsibility to help chart a path forward. Despite his political failings and alleged personal misdeeds, it would be unfair to stereotype Ortega as a heedless caudillo or crass dictator of the old Central American school. Pro-business reforms have brought economic growth of up to 5% a year since 2011. Tourism has been growing. The pro-Sandinista, London-based Nicaragua Solidarity Campaign offers alternative explanations for the unrest, including the alleged bias of western media and Washington’s enduring hostility. “It has been a complete shock that a country with a stable growing economy and extensive investment in health, education, social programmes and infrastructure erupted into such violence so quickly,” the NSC said on its website last month. Some people are too easily shocked. Nicaragua cannot afford the current chaos – and Ortega and Murillo have become a big part of the problem. They have had their moment. Nicaragua would benefit from a fresh start."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/17/observer-view-europe-migration-policy-populism-rescue-ship-aquarius","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T04:59:06Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on migrants dying because Europe is pandering to populism | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/17/observer-view-europe-migration-policy-populism-rescue-ship-aquarius","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/17/observer-view-europe-migration-policy-populism-rescue-ship-aquarius","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on migrants dying because Europe is pandering to populism","bodyText":"The plight of Aquarius, the rescue ship carrying 629 migrants, stands as a potent reminder of the dire failings of European migration policy. No matter that the ship carried seven pregnant women and more than a hundred unaccompanied children rescued at sea as they tried to make the desperate, dangerous crossing from Libya to Italy. First Italy, then Malta, refused the ship entry to their ports. Eventually, Spain offered to let it dock in the port of Valencia, four days away in harsh sailing conditions. Spain’s socialist foreign minister, Josep Borrell, said this was a “symbolic act” to try to impel more coordinated action from a continent engaged in “ostrich politics”. But the sad truth is that since 2015 – the year that the scale of the migration crisis became clear – the European appetite for a common, humanitarian approach to migrant and refugee flows from Africa and the Middle East has only dwindled. The Spanish gesture seems highly unlikely to prompt a desperately needed rethink. In recent years, the thrust of European policy has shifted from improving conditions for those seeking refuge within Europe, to stemming irregular migration flows regardless of the humanitarian cost. The philosophy appears to be that, so long as there are no drowned toddlers washing up on Greek beaches, Europe is discharging its moral and legal duties, regardless of whether ultimately they end up dead elsewhere. As a result, the numbers of people coming across the Mediterranean have dropped dramatically, not because of an easing of the conflicts that drive them to seek sanctuary, but because European leaders have struck unsavoury deals with dictatorial states and repressive regimes to stop people arriving. Europe has channelled cash to Turkey and countries in Africa in exchange for their help in deporting unwanted migrants and preventing people from leaving for Europe. This has simply shifted the focus, not the scale, of the humanitarian problem – from drownings in the Mediterranean, to exploitation, rape and torture elsewhere. Conditions in Libyan detention camps are appalling, and UN agencies say the Libyan coastguard – funded by the EU to return migrants to its shores – is co-operating with smugglers. Aid money is flowing to some of the most repressive and dictatorial regimes, such as in Sudan, whose abuses are driving the exodus of people trying to escape dangerous and desperate conditions in the first place. The millions of Syrian refugees living in countries such as Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan face terrible and worsening conditions as a result of cutbacks to UN aid. This approach is entirely counter-productive: the more that Europe focuses on making it less safe for people fleeing war and destruction to cross the Mediterranean, the more they are driven into the hands of criminal smugglers. The European-backed destruction of the wooden boats used by smugglers for the Libya-Italy crossing has simply led to more people attempting to make the journey on even more dangerous rubber dinghies, pushing up the death rate further. Meanwhile, in Europe, thousands of refugees and migrants are trapped in intolerable conditions in camps on the Greek islands as they wait for their asylum applications to be processed, where there is a huge backlog. There have been no meaningful efforts to reform the Dublin regulation, which says refugees must be processed by the first EU country they set foot in and be sent back there if they move on to other parts of Europe. This has created the preposterous state of affairs in which two of Europe’s poorer countries, Italy and Greece, have been left to process the biggest volumes of asylum claims. Some argue that the Fortress Europe approach, based on preventing people from arriving here in the first place, is the only pragmatic response to the populists who have sought to make hay from the migration issue. But the truth is that in buying into the populist frame of irregular migration flows as a European crisis, and a mortal threat to European values, mainstream politicians have created the oxygen populists need to thrive. In Italy, the policy of closing ports to migrant rescue ships did not originate with Matteo Salvini, Italy’s new populist interior minister, but with his centre-left predecessor, Marco Minniti. A failure to develop a fair, pan-European system based on resettlement quotas and a commonly funded network of reception centres has fuelled the anger of citizens in southern Europe; it is not surprising that far-right parties have capitalised on it. Today, Europe remains more divided than ever. The populist nationalist approach, long championed by the Visegrád bloc, is gaining wider traction, with the interior ministers of Austria, Italy and Germany announcing a new “axis” of cooperation on security and immigration. Support for once-fringe ideas, such as asylum processing centres in Africa, is growing; even as Macron has offered to take in some of the Aquarius migrants who dock in Spain, he has reiterated his backing. This is being talked of as an existential crisis for an increasingly isolated Angela Merkel, whose own interior minister has threatened to defy her by introducing controls on Germany’s southern border. But – far more than Brexit – it is an existential crisis for the EU itself. Will Europe continue in its race to the bottom, or will leaders be able to come together to develop a shared, humanitarian approach to irregular migration? The answer will shape the very future of the European project."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/17/order-donald-trump-holds-in-contempt-was-once-americas-proudest-creation","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T11:00:13Z","webTitle":"The order Trump holds in contempt was once America’s proudest creation | Jonathan Fenby","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/17/order-donald-trump-holds-in-contempt-was-once-americas-proudest-creation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/17/order-donald-trump-holds-in-contempt-was-once-americas-proudest-creation","fields":{"headline":"The order Trump holds in contempt was once America’s proudest creation","bodyText":"Behind the Twitter storms and hyperbolic self-promotion, Donald Trump is nothing if not consistent in his approach to the world. A single aim runs through his international policy – to liberate himself and his country from constraints and to leave it free to pursue whatever he determines to be its destiny. Thus, this month, he has rounded on allies in the G7 and formed a “partnership for peace” with Kim Jong-un. His complaints about how America has been ripped off may not be unjustified, as when they target China’s commercial behaviour or the low European contribution to defence. But in the broad sweep of the president’s view of the world, that is becoming rather beside the point as he sets a pattern of reaching for his six gun regardless of others, proclaiming victory come what may and gingering up his electoral base. The rest of the world has only been able to stand by, trying to absorb each bump as if they were isolated incidents. Trump’s shock-jock style obscures the way in which the global order of the past seven decades is being shifted amid the constant agitation from the White House and Air Force One. Major players, above all China, are moving into the arena. Surveys show democracy in decline across the globe. Accepted rules lack force and international institutions are losing more of their influence. Alliances, along with the values meant to underpin them, become matters of short-term expediency as Palmerston’s observation about nations pursuing their interests meets Make America Great Again. Thus the G7 fracas and the way major US allies in Asia were not informed in advance about Trump’s decision to placate Kim by halting US-South Korean military exercises; as for personal diplomacy, Emmanuel Macron and Shinzo Abe can only wonder about their Bastille Day and golf course bromances with the president as he enthuses about Kim. Trump sees no reason for America to continue in the role it took up after the Second World War and celebrated five decades later with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Although that has been plain in the president’s thinking since he hit the campaign trail, other countries do not appear to have appreciated the extent to which he means what he says and will translate it into action. His moves may seem disjointed and subject to abrupt short-term shifts as his humour alters, along with his calculation of what will play well with his public, as if seeking votes on a reality show. There is no “Trumpian order” and a new president in 2022 may revert to the old mean. But for the moment we can only go on what we have and, 18 months after his inauguration, it is clear that the self-styled “very stable genius” has ditched the vision of his predecessors since 1945 and that the rest of the G6 has no substitute while Putin nibbles at the edge of the western alliance and Xi Jinping lays out China’s increasingly global ambitions. The vision that Trump has abandoned was shaped by the belief that, after victory over the Axis powers, the US should play the global role it had declined after the Great War. Although Franklin Roosevelt remarked to Stalin that the GIs would soon be coming home, the division of Europe after Germany’s defeat made continuing involvement inevitable. The stationing of the troops was important, as was the formation of Nato and the air power to supply Berlin during the Soviet blockade. However, the core American concern in the immediate postwar period was that the devastating legacy of the fighting might lead to the economic and social collapse of western Europe, opening the door to Soviet domination. Hence the Marshall Plan to revive the continent, or at least its western half, once Stalin had given the thumbs-down to participation by Soviet bloc countries. That gave the US presence a legitimacy that would not have come from simple military power and that played a role in encouraging co-operation that led to the original Common Market. Europe was far from being the only part of the globe where developments in 1947-8 forged the future. But it is striking how major events, such as the independence of India and Pakistan, or the creation of Israel and the ensuing war, took place outside the rivalry between the US and USSR, while the civil war in China was not an international struggle. The global order that took shape in 13 crucial months of 1947-8 was, therefore, geographically limited, focused on events in Europe and reactions to them in Washington and Moscow. US-Soviet competition spread in due course (and the division of Korea had been formalised in 1948). However, when democratic capitalism triumphed four decades later, it lacked the varied prescription for the wider world – and then tripped over itself in the new century as the spoils of prosperity were unevenly distributed and a complacent political class failed to react to the resulting resentments. The US is not alone in replacing internationalism with an inward-looking mentality and transactional approach to international relations. But its role since it entered the Second World War in 1941 makes it crucial. Pax Americana rested for seven decades on internationalist alliances and institutions, generally observed rules and a political and economic system that, while serving US interests, offered advantages for its partners. Now the security and economic umbrella this provided – even if it sometimes came with downsides – is being rolled up, with implications that go well beyond individual decisions from the White House. “The fundamental question of our time is whether the west has the will to survive,” Trump said last summer. “Do we have the confidence in our values to defend them at any cost?” Harry Truman asked a similar question when faced with Soviet power in the 1940s. His response was the Marshall Plan and all that flowed from it: the revival of Japan and Germany, internationalism and partnerships (even if it was clear who was in the driving seat) and encouragement of democracy (although support for dictators could be justified in the name of fighting communism). Today, the personality-driven response is very different in a fragmented world where combat is a sign of strength and it’s everyone for themselves.

As those pushing for a Brexit that will almost certainly negatively affect the UK are seen doing things like moving abroad; protecting their assets; lining up to profit from EU withdrawal; or prioritising their own career interests, it looks more and more like contagion. Here are the worst offenders. Nigel Farage Nigel Farage, who has spent his entire career arguing for Brexit, and slagging off the European parliament from his seat in the … European parliament, has announced that, no, he will not be giving up his £73,000 per annum EU pension. Because, as he understandably explained: “Why should my family suffer?” Quite right. The rest of our families, bracing for an economic hit, a shortage of NHS staff to take care of us, a possible destruction of relationships and a narrowing of travel options, can suck it up. Then again, Farage is not new to hypocrisy. A privately educated former banker who rails against the establishment. An anti-immigration, anti-free-movement politician who has a German wife, and two of whose children have German passports. (Oh, and letting a French politician stay in his London home.) I half expect him to come out against tweed suits and pints of beer. Nigel Lawson To another Nigel: everybody’s favourite climate change denier, Nigel Lawson, who has also been a Eurosceptic for his entire political career, and remains president of the Conservatives for Britain, as well as a member of Leave Means Leave, and was also chair of Vote Leave, and has shocked us all by being another integrity vacuum – Lawson has lived in France for a number of years, and has now applied for his French residency card. This is pretty merde behaviour, given that Brexit will make it much more difficult for the rest of us to move freely to France and settle there, should we so wish. Then there’s the fact that we’ll be stuck queuing in airports, but Lawson won’t. “I love Europe!” he once said: “That’s why I live in France.” As long as Lawson is happily sipping wine in Gascony, that’s all that matters. Arron Banks Where to start with Arron Banks, who told us last week that he found Brexit “exhausting”. After screwing the future of the country, he is exhausted. Bear in mind this is also the guy who said the working class was being mugged off, while presiding over offshore tax companies. Perhaps if he had put the minimum £6m he spent on Brexit into paying more tax, he might have helped the “left behind” rather better, whose lot is about to get worse. Still not entirely sure where he gets his money from by the way – it’s like he just found it down the back of the sofa. Which almost certainly is a disgusting white leather number. Oh, and Banks is another anti-immigrant one married to a foreigner (Russian, obvs) living in the UK. Andy Wigmore Banks’s sidekick, Andy Wigmore, with a haircut that even a neo-Nazi would reject for being a bit too fascist, has announced plans to up and leave to Belize, where he has citizenship and is a former diplomat. Theresa May Theresa May is someone who knows the destruction Brexit will bring to the UK, but is pushing ahead regardless, while spouting things she knows to be false. Brexit dividend? She kept her head down for most of the remain campaign, with an eye on a future leadership bid, which turned out to be tactically sound. But she did give a speech to Goldman Sachs in which she said of remain: “I think the economic arguments are clear. I think being part of a 500 million trading bloc is significant for us.” And then went on to talk about the security benefits of being part of the EU. She’s a defender of the Good Friday agreement, but doesn’t seem to understand that her Irish border policy (I use the word policy loosely) threatens it. She is not beholden to the DUP, but also totally is. Her latest about-turn is promising Dominic Grieve and other Tory rebels a meaningful vote in the event of no deal, and then afterwards denying the whole thing. Absolute wind-up merchant. Paul Dacre This is the guy whose Daily Mail acted as a sort of Brexit Pravda, variously insulting high court judges (despite championing sovereignty) and half the population on its front page. Paul Dacre, of course, is a rich man. Before stepping down two weeks ago as editor of the Mail, he was earning a salary of nearly £2.5m a year. As one recent book put it, Dacre is a man ferried around, who “lives on carpets”. This is why he is a Brexit hypocrite: estates owned by Dacre have received £460,000 since 2011 in EU agriculture subsidies. Maybe he can afford to lose those – many farmers cannot. Jeremy Corbyn There’s something phenomenally rude about lapping up the support of young people to win the Labour leadership (twice) and then campaigning to stay in the EU (which 75% of 18- to 24-year-olds support) with all the fervour of an Arsenal fan cheering Tottenham. David Cameron This is the guy who plunged us into the mess by allowing an internecine Tory party beef to rip us out of the EU. Of course, before and after the result, David Cameron vowed to steer the ship. That plan lasted a matter of hours. Nobody’s seen him since, apart from when he boasted that he’d spent £25,000 on a shed. We’ve all done it. The entirety of Vote Leave Remember MEP Dan Hannan’s “nobody is talking about threatening our place in the single market”? Because that seems like a rather big threat at the moment. Remember how, Boris Johnson, a lead Brexiter, actually drafted two versions of a Telegraph article – one for remain, one for Brexit – because he was so on the fence about which side would be better for his career. Does he really believe Brexit is better for the country? Who knows what Johnson really believes in, except himself. Here’s what he wrote in the pro-remain piece that went unpublished: “Shut your eyes. Hold your breath. Think of Britain. Think of the rest of the EU. Think of the future. Think of the desire of your children and your grandchildren to live and work in other European countries; to sell things there, to make friends and perhaps to find partners there.” Couldn’t agree more, mate.

But if Eton expects its 13-year-old boarders to hand in their phones overnight, where are they the rest of the time? And why are older boys allowed to keep their phones overnight? On schools and smartphones, I’m an enthusiastic proponent of the nanny state. After Emmanuel Macron made it a key pledge in his presidential campaign, the French government is banning mobile phones in schools altogether after September. In the UK, the decision is left to headteachers: some ban them, others take a more permissive approach. France has got it right. It is surely beneficial for all young people to have a few hours where they are disconnected and school, which should be a distraction-free zone, is the right place to enforce that. The educational benefits make it a no-brainer: an LSE study found that banning smartphone use in schools boosted results, particularly for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. The researchers estimated it was equivalent to providing an extra five days of school for these young people, something that by my (admittedly back-of-an-envelope) calculation would cost more than £1bn a year for five- to 16-year-olds in England and Wales. This would undoubtedly be opposed by those edtech evangelists who argue that banning phones will limit rather than augment learning. But to say the evidence that technology in schools improves learning is shaky would be a polite way of putting it. Others will complain that it’s impractical to enforce: won’t schools need to install secure lockers? But a technological solution such as 4G signal-jammers would mean that parents could still reach children after school, but access to the internet during the day could be tightly regulated by teachers. There’s a reason some Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are sending their children to screen-free schools. They’re all too aware that the currency in which social media companies trade is time spent on their platforms. Developers have responded to those commercial incentives in ingenious ways: the “like” buttons that deliver the dopamine hits that keep us coming back for more; the unlimited scroll and autoplay functions that keep us hooked; the constant stream of alerts and notifications that draw us back in; the read receipts and status updates that fuel more interactions by making us feel it would be rude not to respond immediately. A new report by the 5Rights foundation looks at how these addictive features affect young people. It highlights that excessive social media use is linked with anxiety, self-doubt and low self-esteem, aggression, bullying and sleep deprivation. “Scrolling forever gives me a sick feeling in my stomach,” one young person told researchers. “All I want to do is disconnect from my phone for a long period of time… but there are always pressures preventing me,” said another. Nanny-statism in the form of school bans should absolutely form part of the response – this is stuff that kids deserve to be protected from – but we also need to develop children’s resilience to addictive technologies that fuel negative behaviour. That doesn’t mean simply teaching children about the dangers of social media in the classroom, which would be akin to letting loose a bunch of 17-year-olds on the roads with no more than a theory test under their belts. Instead, we should be providing safe spaces in which children can learn positive online behaviour. CyberSmarties in Ireland is one such initiative. Its founder, Diarmuid Hudner, likens it to bike stabilisers for a social media age. It’s a locked-down, safe social network exclusively for seven- to 12-year-olds that works in partnership with primary schools, with more than 80,000 users. It’s what a network might look like were it designed with the needs of children, rather than the commercial interests of Silicon Valley, in mind. Negative messages are flagged and children asked to reword them before they are sent. Clicking on an “I’m feeling sad” button prompts positive comments that the child’s friends have made about them to pop up. The network is monitored by a team of more than 50 trained moderators while it is operational, between 8am to 8pm, seven days a week. Moderators inform schools about any incidents of bullying so they can be proactively addressed by teachers. The hope is that teaching positive behaviour to a pre-smartphone age-group will better equip them to cope with the world of adult social networks. The jury is still out on the long-term impacts – the network has only been running three years – but it has all but eliminated cyberbullying within the site itself. While the government should be doing more to get social media companies to enforce age restrictions and to remove addictive features for the under-18s, it should also be piloting initiatives such as CyberSmarties. But the sad truth is that in a world where it has taken years of tireless campaigning to have sex and relationships education made compulsory in all English schools, despite the numbers of children now viewing porn online, we’re much more likely to see hand-wringing than real action. Perhaps the biggest problem, though, is that we adults are not generally very good at modelling responsible tech behaviour for children: the average adult smartphone user touches their phone more than 2,600 times a day. I suspect it isn’t just schoolkids who’d benefit from a smartphone confiscation service. • On 18 June 2018 the reference in the first sentence to year 7s was amended to year 9s. • Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/16/wrecking-ball-christopher-chope-v-upskirting-bill-alas-no-contest","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T15:59:01Z","webTitle":"Wrecking ball Christopher Chope v upskirting bill?

Chope will no doubt lean on this defence to explain why he objected to a bill that would have made sexual offenders of perverts who instead of calling their mothers are using their iPhones as their only chance of ever seeing a vagina. He will exclaim that the bill needed more scrutiny. I dare say he will claim he fully supports the bill. I call bullshit on that. He doesn’t care less about women who have suffered this indignity. I was part of a group of MPs who tried to put forward a bill that would have allowed mothers’ names to be listed on marriage certificates. The Tory MP who was taking the bill through parliament sheepishly approached me and said it wasn’t going to pass because he’d had a chat with Chope who didn’t like the bill because of something some vicar in his constituency had said to him. So our old friend Chope and no doubt an imaginary vicar trumped a nation of mothers. That was that. I searched for him in the corridors of Westminster that day in order to give him a bollocking, but couldn’t find him – it wasn’t a Friday and I can’t say I have ever noticed him doing anything but wrecking bills. Chope is fully within his rights to stop these bills in their tracks. He has more rights for his tomfoolery than I have to appear on the marriage certificate of my sons or to keep my pants to myself. Our democracy surely is a wondrous thing. Parliament is full of such archaic practices and even fuller of dinosaurs who want to protect them. Preceding Friday’s filibustering asshattery were the endless votes on the Lords amendments to the EU withdrawal bill. Round and round the lobbies we went, 11 times on Tuesday, eight on Wednesday. It took hours and each of the 11 times we got exactly the same result. Pacing through the lobbies endlessly were three heavily pregnant women. Jo Swinson was five days off her due date. This week, we expect even more closely fought contentious votes. Assuming Swinson’s baby arrives on time on Monday, parliament will expect a woman who has given birth two days earlier to rock up and vote. Chope, who campaigned against changing one of the many bars in parliament into a nursery, probably thinks this is the exact bloody problem with allowing pesky women into the Commons. Swinson could be paired with a Tory so that they cancel out each other’s votes, but if the government majority is down to one, I wouldn’t trust that any more than Dominic Grieve should have trusted Theresa May. Why on earth can’t parliament allow a proxy vote for people on maternity leave? We’ve asked for it and been told it will probably, definitely, possibly happen one day, sometime soonish. Since then, lots of men in the Commons have muttered to me what a ridiculous idea proxy voting is – as if when they walk round and round the garden like a teddy bear through the voting lobbies that it somehow takes some skill no one else could manage. Parliament is ridiculously old fashioned and stupid in so many ways, the worst being that it allows the old guard to rule the roost. Chope isn’t special or clever – he is just the bastard child of old-fashioned ideals and a broken system. We could stop him if only parliament weren’t terrified of changing its ways. For now, we just have to fight back ourselves. I’ll be writing “Cheers Chope” on the gusset of every pair of knickers I have. I suggest you do the same."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/15/spain-fernando-hierro-david-de-gea-support","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T22:18:57Z","webTitle":"Spain’s Fernando Hierro supports David de Gea after blunder against Portugal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/15/spain-fernando-hierro-david-de-gea-support","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/15/spain-fernando-hierro-david-de-gea-support","fields":{"headline":"Spain’s Fernando Hierro supports David de Gea after blunder against Portugal","bodyText":"Fernando Hierro, the manager who admitted he never expected to be standing on the touchline at the World Cup, said he has “no doubts” about David de Gea, despite the goalkeeper gifting Portugal a goal. The Portugal manager, Fernando Santos, meanwhile insisted Cristiano Ronaldo was the best player in the world following his hat-trick to secure a 3-3 draw in Sochi, saying: “I’m glad he’s Portuguese.” He also expressed his hope Ronaldo would still be around and scoring goals in Qatar in four years’ time. Spain had been thrown into crisis when it was revealed that Julen Lopetegui had agreed to take over at Real Madrid after the World Cup, prompting the Spanish football federation to sack him on the eve of the tournament. Hierro, called on to take over the team as an emergency measure, said: “We have to be very proud at the way they overcame adversity. They showed character, conviction, pride, and personality. “This is a team that has no doubts. It knows what it wants, how to play. It is a pleasure to work with these players. These have not been easy days. I am very grateful to every one of them, and all the staff, who adapted rapidly in difficult circumstances. I repeat, it hasn’t been easy.” Asked about De Gea, who allowed Ronaldo’s shot to slip through his hands for Portugal’s second goal, Hierro said: “I embraced him and that’s it. We know that goalkeeper is a special position, with a special psychology, and we have no doubts about him at all. None. We’re a team. We’re a family and we will not leave anyone aside. We don’t have the slightest doubt about any member of the family. Hierro added: “When you have a star like Ronaldo, a detail can change a game. It’s lucky for whoever has him. I have a great relationship with him, he’s a great lad but I wouldn’t change him for any of mine.” Ronaldo’s hat-trick makes him the first player to score in four consecutive World Cups. “I’ve said it so many times: he’s the best in the world and I hope in Qatar he will score again,” Santos said. “People talk about his physical condition but mentally he is so strong. I’m glad he’s Portuguese.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/17/tories-nhs-pledge-brexit-leave-dividend","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T13:59:44Z","webTitle":"The Tories’ NHS pledge puts them on a Brexit bus to nowhere | Matthew d’Ancona","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/17/tories-nhs-pledge-brexit-leave-dividend","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/17/tories-nhs-pledge-brexit-leave-dividend","fields":{"headline":"The Tories’ NHS pledge puts them on a Brexit bus to nowhere","bodyText":"As Theresa May would say: let me be clear. There is no “Brexit dividend”. There is no glorious golden handshake to look forward to when we leave the European Union. If there is to be £600m extra a week in cash terms for the NHS within six years, it will not be found in the goody bag when we leave the Brussels party. As Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the Financial Times: “Payments to the EU will fall [after Brexit], but tax revenues will fall more as a result of Brexit.” That, as Johnson said, “is the official position of the government, which has accepted the Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecast that the public finances are likely to be weakened to the tune of £15bn a year as a result of the referendum vote.” Given that there is absolutely, categorically, definitely, no Brexit bonanza in prospect, it is natural to ask why ministers keep pretending that there is. And the reason is big and red and monstrous. In the game of politics, it is commonplace to speculate about what might happen if someone were knocked down by a hypothetical bus. Well, the Conservative government was knocked down by a real one two years ago, and specifically by the pledge emblazoned on its side that leaving the EU would yield £350m a week for the health service. Since the victory of the leave campaign, this particular promise – as fiscally ridiculous as it was emotionally cunning – has bedevilled the Tories like political herpes. How to deliver the undeliverable? The answer, it transpires, is to promise a quite distinct increase in NHS spending, and cheekily slap an entirely misleading “Brought to You By Brexit!” sticker on the side. The prime minister also hopes that the renewed association between our departure from the EU and extra money for the health service will make it harder for MPs to sabotage the withdrawal process between now and the end of March. I doubt that this ruse will work, but desperate times call for desperate measures. This, in other words, is political triage before it is public policy. Which is a shame; because there are few more pressing issues confronting our society than the future funding and structure of the NHS in an age of greater longevity, pioneering medical technologies and a growing recognition that mental health deserves the parity it has so long been denied. Credit to Jeremy Hunt, the longest serving health secretary in the 70-year history of the service, who has secured this spending increase through a combination of stamina, political guile and sheer persistence. It may not be as much as the NHS needs, and is certainly not as much as it wants. But the cash boost is substantial, and it is churlish to pretend otherwise. It also marks the beginning of a huge political debate that is long overdue. Correctly framed, the government’s recognition that more money is needed, and must be found, might have put Labour on the back foot, forcing Jeremy Corbyn on to the terrain of fiscal precision, the detail of tax-and-spend, and the practicalities of turning social ideals into clinical reality. The problem for the PM is that this terrain is no less awkward for the Tories, some of whom regarded even David Cameron’s ringfencing of the NHS budget as an ideological affront. Let us assume, though, that May and Hunt are able to convince their party that it cannot possibly face the voters in another general election until it has explicitly acknowledged the problem of NHS underfunding and (no less explicitly) done something about it. We have established that the “Brexit dividend” should be categorised with leprechauns, the Easter bunny and fairies at the bottom of the garden. Where, then, will the money come from? Herein lies the true strategic significance of the PM’s announcement. For eight years the Conservatives have made deficit reduction a core objective: combining fiscal conservatism with monetary activism. Though Philip Hammond has introduced greater flexibility to the plans he inherited, he remains committed, as was George Osborne, to wiping out the deficit as soon as politically feasible. The question, then, is whether the chancellor will now allow the NHS to edge ahead of the deficit as a priority – and borrow accordingly. To do so would send a sharp signal to Westminster and the markets, and the fact that this matter has clearly not yet been resolved is eloquent. Whatever he decides, the impact of austerity will be felt for years to come. But Hammond’s decision on borrowing will be one of the most important he faces in office. If, on the other hand, he chooses to fund the new NHS spending from taxation, he will infuriate those Tories who are ideologically opposed to all tax rises, and alarm those who, more narrowly, believe that social justice is best served by lifting as many people out of taxation altogether by continuing to raise the personal allowance. I am as confident as I can be that the NHS funding conundrum will not be properly addressed until one or other of the main parties proposes a wealth tax (in fact, Osborne was inclining towards a mansion tax as a first step in this direction, only to be stopped in his tracks by Cameron). But a mature debate on the subject will be very hard as long as the question is entangled with fatuous claims about shimmering Brexit gold. Labour, it is true, still languishes in the shade of the magical money tree. But the Tories will be in no position to mock as long as they stay on board the big red bus of magical thinking, hurtling toward the unknown. • Matthew d’Ancona is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/17/leicester-southampton-james-maddison-norwich","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T09:11:15Z","webTitle":"Leicester set to beat Southampton to £25m signing of James Maddison","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/17/leicester-southampton-james-maddison-norwich","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/17/leicester-southampton-james-maddison-norwich","fields":{"headline":"Leicester set to beat Southampton to £25m signing of James Maddison","bodyText":"Leicester City look set to beat Southampton to the signing of James Maddison after agreeing a deal worth £25m with Norwich City. Southampton offered £20m plus add-ons for the 21-year-old midfielder over the weekend but it is understood that Leicester have outbid the St Mary’s club. Maddison is not short of suitors – Everton, Fulham and West Ham have all targeted him – and his departure from Carrow Road seems inevitable. The expectation at the start of last week was that Everton would make the first move for Maddison, who is determined to make the step up to the Premier League after starring in the Championship last season. But while Everton have identified the England Under-21 international as a potential long-term replacement for Wayne Rooney, who is likely to join DC United, it is understood that Leicester are his preferred option and a deal could be completed soon. Madison is expected to have his medical at Leicester on Monday. West Ham revived their interest in Maddison after Manuel Lanzini ruptured an anterior cruciate ligament while preparing for the World Cup finals with Argentina. Manuel Pellegrini is also searching for attacking reinforcements and West Ham are expected to hold further talks with Lazio over the transfer of Felipe Anderson this week. While there is confidence in Italy that a deal for 25-year-old Brazil winger is close, West Ham have grown frustrated with Lazio for adjusting their valuation. Reports have claimed they are holding out for €45m plus a 20% sell-on fee. West Ham have indicated a willingness to pay €35m plus add-ons for the 25-year-old. Pellegrini wants to bolster his defence and has targeted Toulouse’s Issa Diop and Swansea’s Alfie Mawson, who is available for £20m. West Ham also expect to complete the signing of Mawson’s teammate, Lukasz Fabianski. However the Poland goalkeeper could face competition for the No 1 spot if West Ham pursue their interest in Stoke’s Jack Butland."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/17/mod-may-duck-decision-on-army-numbers-in-review","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T19:00:22Z","webTitle":"MoD may duck decision on army numbers in review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/17/mod-may-duck-decision-on-army-numbers-in-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/17/mod-may-duck-decision-on-army-numbers-in-review","fields":{"headline":"MoD may duck decision on army numbers in review","bodyText":"The Ministry of Defence is struggling to complete a review aimed at modernising British forces in the face of a renewed threat from Russia and new threats such as cyber and electronic warfare. The review was supposed to be finished in time for Theresa May to brief Nato allies including Donald Trump at what is shaping up to be a potentially fractious summit in Brussels on 11 and 12 July. With a select committee report published on Monday calling for defence expenditure to rise to 3% of GDP, the MoD is under pressure to finalise its proposals on its spending priorities. The MoD has failed to resolve many of the nitty-gritty issues involved in its review, stymied by black holes in its budget and threats of Tory backbench revolts if too many traditional capabilities are abandoned. The final draft of the Modernising Defence Programme (MDP) looks likely to be a messy compromise, setting out the threat posed by Russia while ducking politically and financially difficult decisions about the size of the army, equipment orders and other issues until later this year or beyond. The MoD, the Cabinet Office and the Treasury are still working on the review. One of the most vocal of Conservative MPs on the issue, Johnny Mercer, a former army captain, said: “It is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to define what a modern UK defence force should look like.” He said he and service personnel were looking for an end to speculation about cuts. Asked what his response would be if the review fails to provide detailed proposals, he said: “That would be unacceptable. I will not accept a fudge.” Conservative backbenchers expressed concern when it was leaked that two amphibious landing ships, HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark, were to be taken out of service, and the army and Royal Marines cut. The review is unlikely to go into such detail when published in the next few weeks, but it is understood that, given the two ships have become totemic for Tory backbenchers, at least one and perhaps both of them will be saved. HMS Albion is at present part of a flotilla enforcing sanctions on North Korea. The defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, is scheduled to meet the chancellor, Philip Hammond, this week to press for more money for the MoD. Given the demands for increased spending from other departments such as health, it will be an uphill task. Williamson can argue, however, that the UK will come under pressure from Trump, alongside other European members of Nato, to raise defence spending. A government source said: “The US wants to see greater commitment from the likes of Britain, France and other countries.” Senior US military staff complained last week that the UK was not doing enough, despite being one of the few Nato countries to meet the target of spending at least 2% of GDP on defence. The US is having to send marines to Norway, viewed by Nato as vulnerable to Russian pressure, to fill a gap after the UK stopped sending Royal Marines there for training exercises as a money saving measure. The Commons defence select committee, which includes Mercer, published a report on Monday calling for spending on defence to be raised from 2.1% of GDP to closer to 3%. “The strategic environment has changed for the worse, and this defence review must reflect this. The UK needs to be in a position to deter and challenge peer adversaries equipped with a full range of modern military technologies who seek to use them in way that confuse our traditional conceptions of warfare,” the report says. “The likelihood of operating in contested environments across all five domains – maritime, land, air, cyber and space – should be reflected in this force structure.” An MoD spokesperson said they would not speculate on the outcome of the programme. The UK defence budget has been skewed by the nuclear programme – £31bn on four new nuclear missile-delivering submarines, which excludes work on new warheads – and two new aircraft carriers, due to be operational by 2023. A cost-cutting option would be to reduce the number of American F-35s planned to operate from the carriers. Other cost-cutting proposals include buying ships off the shelf rather than the long delays and expense involved in building them to order. The kind of details backbenchers and allies are looking for is whether the army will be cut from its present 77,000 to create a more mobile force that can be deployed at speed. One analyst said that although a tank invasion of eastern Europe by Russia was highly unlikely, a feasible scenario would be an incursion of Russian special forces into Norway or the unexpected arrival of a team of Russian advisers in a disputed part of the Balkans, and that would require a quick deployment. The review began last summer as part of a look at UK security and defence as a whole, taking in the intelligence agencies as well as the MoD. In January, however, as concern grew that the defence spending problems were proving to be too big a headache, the MoD was hived off for separate review. Prof Malcolm Chalmers, the deputy director general of the defence thinktank the Royal United Services Institute, who wrote a report in February on the review, said: “I don’t think we are going to see an end to the MDP review process before the Nato summit. We will, it appears, see some announcement of the principles around which the government is reviewing defence. But will we see the end to speculation on army numbers and marine support or other capabilities? I think that is most unlikely.” He said that unless there was significantly more money from the Treasury, there would be more minuses than pluses from the review. “I don’t see an appetite from the government at present to conclude a review on that basis,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/17/tory-rebellions-may-brexit-plans-could-bring-down-government-dominic-grieve","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T12:48:58Z","webTitle":"Tory rebellions against May's Brexit plans 'could bring down government'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/17/tory-rebellions-may-brexit-plans-could-bring-down-government-dominic-grieve","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/17/tory-rebellions-may-brexit-plans-could-bring-down-government-dominic-grieve","fields":{"headline":"Tory rebellions against May's Brexit plans 'could bring down government'","bodyText":"Tory rebels against Theresa May’s Brexit plans could ultimately collapse the government, Dominic Grieve has said, ahead of another key week in parliament over the EU withdrawal bill. Grieve, the former attorney general, has said he objects to a government amendment to the bill which would limit the power of MPs in shaping policy if parliament rejects a final Brexit bill. Asked if voting against the government could eventually bring it down, Grieve said: “We could collapse the government.” He told BBC One’s Sunday Politics: “And I can assure you I wake up at 2am in a cold sweat thinking about the problems that we have put on our shoulders. The difficulty is that the Brexit process is inherently risky.” Grieve, who has drafted his own amendment that would give MPs more scope in directing ministers in the possible event of a likely no-deal Brexit, later clarified to the Press Association that his comments referred to a future vote on a deal, rather than next week’s events. The ping-pong process of the withdrawal bill between the two houses of parliament returns to the Lords on Monday, when peers are expected to reject the amendment drafted by May and her team, and insert one modelled more closely on Grieve’s idea. On Wednesday, the amendments will return again to the Commons, where May faces the possibility of defeat over a meaningful vote. A series of Conservative rebels pulled back from voting against the government last week after the PM promised to listen to their concerns, but then said they felt let down by the eventual government amendment produced on Thursday. Grieve said: “I can’t save the government from getting into a situation where parliament might disagree with it. “The alternative is that we have all got to sign up to a slavery clause now saying whatever the government does, when it comes to January, however potentially catastrophic it might be for my constituents, and my country, I’m signing in blood now that I will follow over the edge of the cliff. And that, I can tell you, I am not prepared to do.” The government’s prospects of defeat were increased last week when the junior justice minister Philip Lee resigned his post so he could vote against the minister on a meaningful vote. He ended up abstaining after the promise of a compromise. In an interview broadcast on Sunday, Lee said he planned to back Grieve’s amendment, and indicated that other ministers could be prepared to follow his example. “My intention is to support Dominic Grieve in the amendment that he put before the house, because that’s what I publicly stated last Tuesday,” he told Sky’s Sophie Ridge on Sunday show. “This amendment I guess may be amended and if that is acceptable I will support that but fundamentally I resigned to support parliament getting a proper truly meaningful vote on the deal to leave the European Union.” Lee said he had had “conversations with ministers at all levels who are concerned about the direction of travel”. He said he did not know whether any immediate resignations could happen, but added that others did have serious worries. The rebels were angered after the government amendment offered parliament the opportunity only to vote on a “neutral motion” stating that it has considered a minister’s statement on the issue, if a deal is rejected. It would not be possible to amend the motion, meaning that MPs could not insert a requirement for May to go back to the negotiating table or extend the Brexit transition. In an interview with the prime minister, broadcast on Sunday, May rejected the idea she had double-crossed her rebels. “I did indeed meet a group of my fellow MPs,” she told BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show. “I listened to their concerns and I undertook to consider their concerns. “And the next day I stood up in prime minister’s questions and said I’d put an amendment down in the House of Lords. I’ve done exactly that. We recognise the concerns people have about the role of parliament.” She added: “Parliament cannot tie the hands of government in negotiations.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/17/the-carters-everything-is-love-review-beyonce-jay-z","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T13:34:12Z","webTitle":"The Carters: Everything Is Love review – Beyoncé and Jay-Z celebrate their marriage and magnificence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/17/the-carters-everything-is-love-review-beyonce-jay-z","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/17/the-carters-everything-is-love-review-beyonce-jay-z","fields":{"headline":"The Carters: Everything Is Love review – Beyoncé and Jay-Z celebrate their marriage and magnificence","bodyText":"It may seem an odd thing to say about a record that’s a guaranteed smash hit, but there’s a sense in which Everything Is Love represents a rather dicey undertaking, and not merely because it features Beyoncé rapping more heavily than it features Beyoncé singing. It’s clearly intended as the third part of a trilogy. After Lemonade, her album packed with hell-hath-no-fury revelations of infidelity and emotional ruin, and 4:44, his album of agonised mea-culpa guilt, comes the joint album affirming Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s renewed romantic bliss. “We broke up and got back together,” raps the latter on the closing Lovehappy. “Now we’re happy in love,” adds his wife. Its very existence runs the risk of making the two releases that preceded it seem less like urgent, brave exorcisms of pent-up emotions – the duo’s equivalent of Blood on the Tracks or Here, My Dear, albums their authors felt they had to make “almost like a therapy session” as Jay-Z put it last year – than stages in a carefully premeditated plan to wring as much capital out of the couple’s nuptial discord as possible. It doesn’t take away from the musical contents of those preceding records, both artistic highlights in their respective makers’ oeuvres. But it does make them look a little more obviously calculated, very clearly underlining that the whole business is as much an exercise in brand management as soul-baring artistry. But, even if you tend to a cynical view, it’s hard not to boggle at the imposing and authoritative way it’s all been executed: from the sudden arrival of Lemonade, with its deft interweaving of relationship despair and black womanhood, to the joint tour currently packing stadiums around the world. And besides, as Everything Is Love keeps emphasising, Jay-Z and Beyoncé don’t care what you think. Presumably realising that an album full of them making gooey eyes at each other might be a little sickly, the topic of their patched-up relationship is more or less confined to its opening and closing tracks, where, it has to be said, it’s dealt with skilfully. Fuelled by the musicians from New York’s Daptone label doing their best impersonation of a late-60s soul band, Summertime undercuts its amorous tone – “Let’s make plans to be in each other’s arms” – with a rap from Jay-Z in which his romantic reverie is haunted by grim memories of summer nights filled with violence in the Marcy Projects. Meanwhile, on Lovehappy, the pair trade lines in a way that’s charming and witty rather than cloying, particularly when the old bete noire of Becky With the Good Hair makes another appearance. “You’re lucky I ain’t kill you when I met that B …,” raps Beyoncé, but the name is cut off by her husband wearily interjecting: “All right, all right.” Elsewhere, there are occasional jabs at the racism of the American police and legal system, not least on Black Effect, with its references to Trayvon Martin and the 60s civil rights movement. But, for the most part, Everything Is Love concentrates on hymning the imperial nature of the Carters’ success, how untouchably prosperous and magnificent they are. An entire song is devoted to emphasising that even their friends are “better than your friends”. If listening to Jay-Z and Beyoncé bragging about their wealth and all-round wonderfulness is substantially less interesting than listening to them pick over the flaws in their relationship, at least it’s usually done with real wit and spark. And Beyoncé turns out to be pretty great at rapping. “My great-great-grandchildren already rich,” she snaps on Boss. “That’s a lot of brown children on your Forbes list.” Similarly, if there’s nothing on Everything Is Love that matches the breathtaking sonic experimentation of Lemonade’s Freedom – plus the sound of Beyoncé singing through Auto-Tune feels surplus to requirements, serving to diminish one of modern R&amp;B’s true powerhouse voices – there’s still a lot to like about the music, which is far more rooted in hip-hop than R&amp;B. If you ever longed to hear what Beyoncé might sound like making a trap track, then both Apeshit and Friends should satiate your curiosity. Elsewhere, Nice sets a dense, jazzy sequence of piano chords against a sparse beat to hypnotic effect; Boss boasts swirling vocal samples and a spectacular 70s soul horn arrangement; and Heard About Us transforms Biggie Smalls’ 1994 single Juicy into something approaching glossy yacht rock. “We already know you know about us,” sings Beyoncé self-assuredly on the latter, which pretty much sums up both Everything Is Love and indeed the pair’s recent output. Calculating it may be, but it’s hard to think of anyone who’s turned prurient public interest in their personal lives to their advantage quite as adeptly as the Carters have."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/17/may-grieve-brexit-constitutional-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T12:23:10Z","webTitle":"May double-crossed Grieve over Brexit – this is a constitutional crisis | Andrew Adonis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/17/may-grieve-brexit-constitutional-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/17/may-grieve-brexit-constitutional-crisis","fields":{"headline":"May double-crossed Grieve over Brexit – this is a constitutional crisis","bodyText":"Ever since she took office, Theresa May has sought to evade and avoid parliamentary sovereignty. Her assertion of “government sovereignty” has reached crisis point, and it is imperative it is rejected by both the Lords and Commons in this week’s debates on Brexit. The double-crossing of Dominic Grieve brings the issue to a head. Last Tuesday, by his and other accounts, May promised Grieve there would be a legal commitment to a “meaningful” parliamentary vote in the event of a “no deal” Brexit. On this basis he was persuaded to withdraw his amendment to the EU withdrawal bill, which the government feared it would lose. On Thursday Grieve secured an acceptable legal text from ministers, which was suddenly withdrawn and replaced by a provision that in case of “no deal” the House of Commons would be allowed only to debate a “take note” motion, which would be unamendable and meaningless if the government chose to ignore it. This assertion of government sovereignty follows a now established pattern. May’s first step on the Brexit road was her implacable refusal to submit the EU withdrawal notice for parliamentary approval, claiming the royal prerogative. It took a path-breaking decision by the supreme court to force her into parliament. Worried that she might not have a majority to carry hard Brexit through the Commons, the prime minister then called an election, expecting a landslide victory. Instead she got a hung parliament, and has no credible mandate for anything the Commons does not authorise. The reason May is now seeking to solidify “government sovereignty” in advance of the key Brexit votes in parliament this autumn is precisely because she is so weak in parliament. That is all the more reason not to grant her powers that no head of government has assumed since Charles I and James II in the 17th century. If May’s proposal is carried, the House of Commons would be in a weaker position than if there were no advance legal provision whatsoever for what to do in the event of “no deal”. By constitutional practice, the Commons would be free to vote on whatever resolutions it thinks fit under normal circumstances, whereas May is seeking the Commons’ agreement to deprive itself of any meaningful vote in advance. To try to make an argument, ministers are objecting to the word “instruction” in the Grieve amendment. David Davis, once a poster boy for civil liberties, now asserts that it is wrong for the Commons to seek to “instruct” the government, and this might give rise to the unacceptable situation of MPs taking over the Brexit negotiations from ministers. Ever the conservative, Grieve is proposing only that parliament should give instructions in the event that the government fails to negotiate any deal at all. As he rightly says, this would be a national emergency, and since – unless May’s new doctrine is accepted – parliament is sovereign, it has a duty as much as a right to say what should then happen. It would then be for the government to “execute” the will of parliament – which is why it is called the executive. It is absolutely legal and appropriate for the House of Commons to give instructions to the government in such circumstances. There are countless cases where it has done so over the centuries, and it is the essence of our parliamentary democracy. Davis himself has form on this issue. In 2012, in the argument over Britain’s EU budget contribution, he supported a successful backbench amendment calling on the government to “strengthen its stance” to reduce it. That’s an instruction. More explicit still are recent Commons’ resolutions on military action, an area where until the Iraq war MPs had often deferred to ministers. To assuage discontent among MPs, Tony Blair went to war in 2003 only after the Commons explicitly resolved that it “supports the decision of HM Government that the UK should use all means necessary to ensure the disarmament of Iraq”. “It is right that the House debate this issue and pass judgment,” Blair said. The next time the Commons was asked to authorise military action – by David Cameron, against Syria in 2013 – it refused to do so, rejecting an explicit motion to “agree to military action”. When the motion was lost, Cameron immediately told MPs: “I believe in respecting the will of this House of Commons. It is very clear that the House does not want to see British military action. I get that, and the government will act accordingly.” Tellingly, when May undertook limited military strikes against Assad’s regime earlier this year, she refused to summon parliament or table a resolution. Those opposed to such bypassing of parliament didn’t press the issue because the airstrikes had already happened by the time parliament met to debate them, and May indicated there would be no more. In retrospect, MPs would have been wise to register their strong objections, whether for or against the action, since it only encouraged May to approach Brexit in the same high-handed manner. The irony is that Brexit is supposed to be about parliament “taking back control”. That fiction is being steadily exposed for what is in reality a power grab by the right wing of the Conservative party, which is seeking to suppress the party’s moderate and pragmatic MPs – who, May and Davis know, would be able to command a majority in the Commons if matters went to a vote. That is why it is crucial that both houses of parliament support the Grieve amendment this week. We should do so in the tradition of the Bill of Rights 1689, which declared resistance to James II’s attempt to subvert the “laws and liberties” of this kingdom by assuming a power of suspending of laws without consent of parliament. • Andrew Adonis is a Labour peer and former transport secretary"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/17/gennady-rozhdestvensky-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T15:57:40Z","webTitle":"Gennady Rozhdestvensky obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/17/gennady-rozhdestvensky-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/17/gennady-rozhdestvensky-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Gennady Rozhdestvensky obituary","bodyText":"The maverick Russian conductor Gennady Rozhdestvensky, who has died aged 87, managed to maintain throughout his professional life an astonishing balancing act between apparent chaos and an underlying grasp of form. There was always an element of risk in his performances but when they worked, the results could be extraordinary. Even had he not been an inspirational conductor, he would still have been remembered for championing the oddball scores of Russian and international music in difficult times. Nothing sums up his individual approach to the Russian arts more than his choice as his favourite work of Shostakovich’s opera The Nose, which he single-handedly brought back to life from obscurity in the early 1970s, shortly before the composer’s death. Figures from Russia’s past are frequently invoked as role models for the present. Stalin did it in the cause of nationalism, as Putin does now. Rozhdestvensky expressed it differently. He was, he said, impressed by the “amazing correspondence” between the great satirical writer Gogol’s masterpiece The Nose – in which the appendage takes a holiday from the face of a petty official – and Shostakovich’s opera. What fascinated Rozhdestvensky was that although the two geniuses lived nearly a century apart, their delight in making fun of authority seemed to belong to the same period. His own time was decidedly out of joint, but he seemed to skip through it. His official ddebut took place when he was 20, conducting the Bolshoi theatre orchestra in Tchaikovsky’s The Nutcracker, and many of his duties in his first 10 years as a Bolshoi staff conductor were linked to the ballet. “It was real torture to conduct those ballet performances,” he said in 1995, “because there was practically no connection with the stage until you tried to take the music as written by the composer. Then you had a conflict with the dancers because it was either too slow or too fast. The choreographer was not educated in the music and could not read the score.” Unlike many conductors who regard the rigours of accompanying the dance as a necessary step on the way to greater things, Rozhdestvensky decided that the great Russian ballet scores would be with him for the rest of his life. When he conducted Romeo and Juliet at Covent Garden in 1986, he had the opportunity of realising Prokofiev’s original intentions for the first time in the theatre; the Bolshoi performances had always used a re-orchestration of certain numbers by the percussionist so that the dancers could hear everything loud and clear. He was equally proud of championing the original version of Mussorgsky’s Boris Godunov at the Royal Opera at a time when the Rimsky-Korsokov arrangement was still standard. His recordings of the original Romeo and Juliet with the orchestra of the Bolshoi theatre (which he served as conductor, 1956-60, principal conductor, 1965-70, and artistic director, 2000-01) and of Tchaikovsky’s Swan Lake with the Moscow Radio Symphony Orchestra, remain by far the most vivid interpretations of those great scores. During his tenure with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, from 1978 to 1981, he took the unprecedented step of conducting Tchaikovsky’s most fertile masterpiece, The Sleeping Beauty, in its entirety, and in the 90s he blazed a trail in the recording studio for the missing link in Shostakovich’s output, the ballets The Golden Age, The Bolt and The Limpid Stream, none of which had fully surfaced since the late 20s and early 30s. Shostakovich had been a central component in his repertoire throughout his years with the Moscow Radio Symphony Orchestra (1961-74), and later with the USSR Ministry of Culture Symphony Orchestra (1983-92), with whom he recorded a cycle of the symphonies that has never been surpassed in its raw intensity and unflinching harshness. Western orchestras, he felt, never understood Shostakovich in the same way. He demonstrated the difference by recounting a rehearsal of the Fourth Symphony in Cleveland, Ohio, when the players were amused at the clicking of wood block, castanets and side-drum. “I asked them, ‘Why are you laughing?’ They replied, ‘Maestro, it sounds like horses’ hooves,’ and I said, ‘I do not agree with you one hundred per cent it’s horses.’ ‘But what is it? Explain.’ So I did: ‘One explanation is that it happens in prison, when the prisoners contact each other by …’ and I tapped the radiator to demonstrate this point. One of the musicians commented, ‘I cannot believe it, because it’s much easier for prisoners to phone each other.’” This anecdote was served up to demonstrate the difference in schooling between American and Russian musicians. He always remembered the composer’s even-handed approach to his works when he conducted the Fourth and 12th Symphonies at the Edinburgh festival in 1962. Regarding the Fourth, along with the Eighth, as one of the two idiosyncratic pinnacles among the symphonies, Rozhdestvensky assumed that the public propaganda of the 12th Symphony was less important, “but it was a vital lesson to learn that he approached the details of both with the same absolute scrupulousness”. His own instincts were always for the wildest, least trammelled aspects of Shostakovich and Prokofiev; and among several distinctive orchestrations, his arrangement of Prokofiev’s early piano piece Suggestion Diabolique includes a brief but uproarious part for four accordions. His encyclopedic championing of the unusual in his native music has overshadowed his achievements on behalf of western music. He conducted the Soviet premiere of Britten’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream as the Bolshoi’s music director in 1965, and among the many unforgettable programmes he undertook with the BBC Symphony Orchestra was a 1981 Prom that followed Schubert’s Ninth with Britten’s Spring Symphony – unbuttoned joy from start to finish. In the brief period of licensing freedom that opened up the Soviet radio archives, there was a chance to sample such outrageously brilliant performances as his account of Richard Strauss’s Rosenkavalier Suite. Among the greatest Russian composers, Sofia Gubaidulina and Alfred Schnittke, who knew him and his surprisingly prolific output well, dedicated substantial works to him. Rozhdestvensky was born in Moscow and not only dutifully followed in the footsteps of his father, the conductor Nikolai Anosov – taking his mother Natalya’s patronymic of Rozhdestvenskaya to avoid confusion – but took lessons from him at the Moscow Conservatory, where he also studied the piano under Lev Oborin. In 1969, he married the pianist Viktoria Postnikova. Their partnership as soloist and conductor was a fascinating match of strong personalities, and Rozhdestvensky partnered his wife in a recording of Tchaikovsky’s folksong arrangements for piano duet. How he always did what he wanted as Soviet officialdom’s court jester remains a mystery. “I lived with communism for more than 50 years, and I have seen around me terrible things,” was as much as he would say. “I was not repressed and I was not in the war. I am very lucky not to have been killed.” On the podium, his manner often suggested the clown with a personal array of tics and grimaces as well as a certain amount of lackadaisical shoulder-shrugging, but his stick technique was clear and disciplined. In later years, his notorious inclination to abandon rehearsals at an early stage often delighted British orchestral musicians, pleased to finish early, but outraged more conscientious players. His perceived lack of commitment led to a serious rift with the Stockholm Philharmonic, where he spent two periods (1974-77 and 1992-95). Even in Stockholm, though, the recorded legacy yielded brilliant results – not only in the Shostakovich ballets but also in an underrated series of Carl Nielsen’s symphonies. He may have seemed happy-go-lucky in execution, but this was frequently deceptive; and his commitment to a rounded picture of Shostakovich and Prokofiev as well as to a younger generation of composers who needed his help under the Soviet regime remains unquestionable. He was honoured in Russia with the award of the Lenin prize in 1970, People’s Artist of the USSR in 1972 and the Order of Red Banner of Labour in 1981. In 2014 he was appointed an honorary CBE. He is survived by his wife and their son, Sasha, a violinist. • Gennady Nikolayevich Rozhdestvensky, conductor, born 4 May 1931; died 16 June 2018 • The caption to the first picture was amended on 25 June 2018.

The Panama manager, Hernán Darío “Bolillo” Gómez, says he is a “believer” and insists he “knew” there was a way back but time was running out and so was hope. Looking across at his players he saw “a ghost” appear before them. In the final minutes of the final game last October, they found themselves outside the qualifying places – the dream of a first World Cup denied at the last, as it had been four years earlier. Drawing with Costa Rica, Panama desperately needed a goal from somewhere, anywhere. What came next was, says Édgar Carvajal, the assistant manager, “like something handed down by God”. A long ball, headed on by Luis Tejada, and there, steaming in, was Román Torres – the centre‑back, a huge, dreadlocked figure. “I still get goosebumps,” Carvajal says. The ball crashed into the net. Torres turned, whipped off his shirt, leapt the advertisement boards and raced along the running track, fans clambering on to fences, drinks thrown into the air. “We had visualised it, dreamed, longed for that moment,” says Gabriel Gómez, the country’s most capped player, gazing at the goal where the ball went in. He turns, looks the other way. “We’d been knocked out at this other end four years before and that hurt. This time it all came off: the result from Trinidad where the USA unexpectedly lost and our goal, which came just at the right moment.” Panama – yes, Panama – were going to the World Cup. Not quite. It was the 88th minute, two minutes plus stoppage time to hang on and never, ever let go. An injury-time goal had cost them the chance of going to Brazil 2014 and they could not let that happen again. Crying ballboys kicked balls into the stands, never to be returned. A substitute leapt from the bench, ran over and booted another as far away as he could. A few more seconds spent. Then someone turned the lights out. From the office under the stand where she works, Elida de Mitchel appeared on the pitch, walking straight past the referee, and pretended to faint. It was a policeman’s idea. Anything to stop the game, run down the clock. Three minutes she was there before eventually Gabriel Gómez and the substitute goalkeeper José Calderón “helped” her off, asking what was happening in the other game as they went. The USA were still losing, she said. “Sure?” “Yes, you’re in the World Cup!” When the whistle at last went Bollillo slipped to his knees, gripping a ball. As he and Torres rolled round together the goalscorer shouted: “You deserve this!” One of the photos Bolillo is fondest of shows Torres embracing a fan who is on the track, not in the stands as he should be. A policeman arrives and hugs both. Beyond the Rommel Fernández stadium in Panama City, there was pandemonium, people flooding the streets. The players paraded on the back of a fire engine. Alcohol sold out and the party ran all night. The president declared the next day a national holiday. “The emotion, the satisfaction, the belief,” Bolillo says. “In life you can dream and dreams can come true.” On Monday they face Belgium in Sochi. “It will be emotional,” says the striker Blas Pérez, whose international career goes back 17 years. “It was always a dream and when I’m standing there listening to the anthem at the World Cup, I don’t know how I’ll react.” Felipe Baloy also began his international journey in 2001. “I’ve had a long career, lots of falls, lots of sadness; this is a reward for many of us,” he says. “I feel lucky to be involved; the whole country will enjoy this.” The journey had been hard. “Ooooh, very hard,” Bolillo says. There were defeats, tension, even death, the midfielder Amílcar Henríquez gunned down outside his home. After one game in Mexico there had been a fight in the dressing room, encouraged by the manager, shouting: “Go on then, hit each other! Do it!” “Cathartic,” he calls it. The Colombian, who had taken his country and Ecuador to the World Cup, arrived on a mission to do the same with Panama. Only two squad members play in Panama but only five are in Europe – two in Belgium, plus Romania, Slovakia and Spain – and while the rest play in the Americas that does not include Brazil, Argentina or Uruguay. Torres plays for Seattle Sounders. Traditionally, baseball and boxing are bigger than football, although that is changing. “We worked in central America and had seen Panama,” Carvajal says. “We always thought: ‘This team has to go to the World Cup,’ but it’s difficult; football is underdeveloped here. Bolillo is perfect for groups like this, giving them the professionalism they lack. Physically, Panamanian players are very good and have belief: they see Germany and think they can take them on mano a mano but we had to develop other aspects. This is the Profe’s fifth World Cup; he had a lot to teach them.” “The principal thing is not the pitch; it’s how you live,” Bolillo says. “You have to build good people, a family. When I arrived there were countless off-field problems. It’s more important to be a good leader than a good coach, someone to say: ‘I know what this is, how this works.’” Discipline was vital, just as it had been for the previous manager, Julio Dely Valdés. Bolillo talks about how football makes you pay for “poor living”. He says: “Last time Panama weren’t a family, they didn’t behave well and football said ‘no’. This time, ‘luck’ fell differently. Why? Because we deserved it to.” Yet while Valdés imposed discipline, Bolillo delegated, trusting in the veterans to lead. There is loyalty to them, then? “And gratitude,” he says. “I slept easy.” The story of Panama reaching the World Cup does not have a grand explanation, nor some big plan behind it – it is about them. A generation of players, most of whom have spent years away from home and had lost out four years earlier, many of them reaching the end. That defeat haunted them but drove them too. “Francisco Maturana [a former Colombia manager] said sometimes to lose is to win,” says the midfielder Gómez. “We lost out but I think we weren’t ready as a team and that day brought us together. This time we were ready. We also knew it was the last chance for many of us.” As the game progressed, it really was. “We were never out of the World Cup … until then,” Bollillo says. By half-time, the USA were 2-0 down but Panama trailed 1-0 to Costa Rica. “You’re doing things you haven’t done for three years,” Bolillo shouted in the dressing room. “There’s no bollocks, nothing! If you’re scared, turn out the lights, we’ll go home. No talking now, show it. Show it!” Pérez equalised soon after, scoring a goal that did not go over the line. The news from Trinidad was that the USA had pulled one back, too.“It’s inevitable you look to the bench, wondering about that score, thinking: ‘They haven’t said anything,’” Gómez says. “And we kept going forward, bravely.” They had to. A first World Cup was at stake. As they went out for the second half, Torres shouted, the expletive in English: “There are 45 fucking minutes left!” By the time he went forward for the last time, it was down to three."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2018/jun/17/in-search-of-dinozord-review-the-place-london-faustin-linyekula","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T14:47:38Z","webTitle":"In Search of Dinozord review – the quest for hope in a ravaged nation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/17/in-search-of-dinozord-review-the-place-london-faustin-linyekula","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jun/17/in-search-of-dinozord-review-the-place-london-faustin-linyekula","fields":{"headline":"In Search of Dinozord review – the quest for hope in a ravaged nation","bodyText":"In Search of Dinozord begins, as earthquakes do, with a tremor. Congolese choreographer Faustin Linyekula stands half-shadowed, his face smeared white, one hand quivering uncontrollably. The shudder becomes convulsive as a distorted sound grows louder, higher, denser – like rising panic – until it seems Linyekula must burst open. He doesn’t. But the feeling lodges inside you. A lot of backstory has brought Linyekula to this juncture, fragments of which he and his collaborators (three dancers, two actors, a singer and a writer) intermittently reveal. There are stories from the violent, virulent history of their ravaged nation; photos from the prison where their writer, Antoine Vumilia Muhindo, was incarcerated and tortured; memories of the genesis of the work itself, sparked by a dream that theatre just might be able to change the world. Those fragments can be hard to piece together (who is Dinozord?) but – like Linyekula’s whitened face – they are surfaces: it’s what lies beneath that gives the performance its ground-shaking force. When two men are upended into headstands, it feels like a form of torment. Hlengiwe Lushaba can sing like a soaring angel – who plummets into rasps of pain. Jeannot Kumbonyeki creates beautiful, bird-like shadows with his arms, only to deliver a krump-styled outburst of stinging bitterness. A suitcase of unread writings is borne like a coffin, its contents not only lidded but destined for burial. Accompanied by Mozart, traditional chants and Jimi Hendrix, this ragged work bears witness to beauty and abjection, dreams and futility, and, most of all, to rage.

He is among a chorus of 17 voices in this powerful, harrowing and extraordinary verbatim production, written and solo-performed by the playwright and West Wing actor, Anna Deavere Smith. While it looks like a pre-civil-rights era of segregation, persecution and police injustice, the play is made up of 250 contemporary interviews that Smith conducted during the Obama administration. (He is a fan of the play.) The voices form a palimpsest of “broken people” living in a “broken system” that fast tracks black men into a pipeline from school to prison. This is the America of Childish Gambino’s latest single, just as startling in its violence against black communities, haunted by the Jim Crow laws and lynchings, and living with the still shocking memory of the Charleston church shootings. A recurring motif is of black men being stalked by police or running for their lives. In one of the most powerful monologues, Pastor Jamal Harrison Bryant speaks at the funeral of Freddie Gray, who died aged 25 in 2015 when his spine was severed during his arrest. Gray’s crime is described in a voice thick with irony: “He did something that black men are taught not to do: to look the police in the eye.” That is what brought on the chase, says the pastor, but “he stopped because somewhere in the inner recesses he made up his mind: ‘I’m tired of living in a box.’” Other messages are as stark. “What are your dreams?” the mayor of Stockton, California, asks a boy. “I just want to be alive at 25,” he replies. Smith is a tour de force in these roles, performing switches in characterisation with astonishing fluidity – between men, women, teenagers, black Americans, Native Americans and Latinos – and with blazing passion. Leonard Foglia directs with originality. Costume changes are initially made in darkened stage corners, Smith sitting and glugging from a water bottle like a theatrical pugilist waiting to throw herself back in the ring. Later, the changes are on the lit stage. Where this technique might have had the effect of Brechtian distancing, Smith embodies her characters so fully that we are not distracted. She knows her power, reaching for shoes, coat or props well after she has fallen into character. The staging uses tropes from documentary film-making so that it appears at times as if a screen production has dramatically burst into three dimensions. The theatre’s brick wall is turned into a screen on which TV and archive footage and grainy phone-camera images are projected. These include recent notorious incidents – footage of a bikini clad 14-year-old being arrested as she cries for her mother, film of a girl being violently handled by a police officer in a classroom. The final monologue is given to Congressman John Lewis. He recalls the Selma march in 1965, speaking of forgiveness and brotherhood as Smith invites the audience to sing Amazing Grace. It is a peaceable ending but sits awkwardly next to the horror and hate that precedes it. If this is a flaw, it is forgivable. This is captivating political theatre, a devastating document of racial inequality and the most rousing of rallying calls. Everyone should watch it, at least once. • Notes from the Field is at the Royal Court, London, until 23 June.

But the Australian Border Force told the man, known as Ali, that he could not come to Australia for palliative care, despite pleas from doctors on Nauru, who say the care there is inadequate. After reading reports by Guardian Australia about Ali’s situation, Dr Sara Townend wrote to Dutton and launched a petition she urged other doctors in Australia to sign. “Australia has accepted this man as a legitimate refugee,” her letter says. “This means Australia is obligated by international conventions to care for his physical and mental health, whether he is on the mainland, or off shore. Nauru is not an appropriate place for this man to die. The Australian Border Force tacitly acknowledged this by offering to transfer him to Taiwan for palliative care. He requires expertise beyond what is available on Nauru.” Ali has told the Australian Border Force he will not go to Taiwan because he has no friends or family there, was concerned there would be no translator from his language, Hazaraghi, and that there would be no one to perform the Shia Muslim rituals after his death. • Sign up to receive the top stories every morning “If he goes to Taiwan, where there are no Hazara, he will die isolated and without community,” Townsend wrote. “This is no way to die.

Blackwell, 34, is the most-capped Australian women’s cricketer, with 251 international appearances across three formats in a career spanning 16 years. She recently retired from international and state cricket, but will play on in the WBBL 04 for Sydney Thunder. Two other women – including current member Patricia Forsythe – have been appointed to the board, but Blackwell is the first to be elected. Cricket Australia has recently had a focus on increasing opportunities for women post-retirement in cricket. This includes the appointment of Shelley Nitschke as assistant coach of the Australian women’s cricket team. Cricket Australia now employs six women in full-time coaching roles, and five as part-time assistants or national selectors. “There are a lot of opportunities now for women to go into coaching and selecting, and as the game grows that encourages more past players to get involved,” said Nitschke in a recent interview with Guardian Australia. “The opportunities are there and there are a lot more entry points now too – you don’t have to go straight to coaching a team, you can do some assisting with underage teams and really build a pathway to work into. “I think Cricket Australia are really good at providing those opportunities and encouraging women to get involved in that space, so it’s a good time to be involved in both coaching and playing.” Blackwell scored 5250 runs batting for Australia across Test, T20 one One-Day International formats, becoming just the fourth Australian to pass 5000 runs.

The debate on the impact of the government’s approach towards immigration was introduced by Lord Bassam, former shadow chief whip of the Lords. Taverne, a former director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, used the debate to accuse the Home Office of “not only breaking every canon of a civilised society [but] ignoring one of the most basic tenets of the rule of law: the golden rule that someone is assumed innocent until proven guilty”. Taverne said that “in their determination to increase the number of deportations and intensify the hostile climate for immigrants”, the Home Office was improperly using an anti-terror power intended “for really serious crimes such as murder, terrorism and for conduct that constitutes a threat to national security” against those who have made minor and legal amendments to their tax records. “It is almost unbelievable but under 322(5) [of the immigration rules] migrants are deprived of their right to work, rent property or access the NHS, while the burden lies on them to prove their innocence, not on the Home Office to prove guilt,” he added. “And not just innocence but also that the Home Office’s decision was ‘perverse’ or ‘irrational’. And to top it all, they cannot get legal aid. What could be a greater betrayal of our traditional respect for justice and the rule of law?” It is the second time in two days that the Home Office has been held to account for its use of 322(5) against highly-skilled migrants. On Wednesday, the SNP MP Alison Thewliss held a heated debate in Westminster Hall about the issue with Caroline Nokes, the immigration minister, at which MPs from all parties spoke up about the issue. Last month the home secretary, Sajid Javid, promised “all applications potentially falling for refusal under the character and conduct provisions of paragraph 322(5) … have been put on hold pending the findings of the current review”. But the Guardian revealed on Monday that the use of 322(5) was continuing. Opposition MPs have said the Home Office’s failure to pause all cases, “smacks of a government department unjustly and incorrectly misusing a draconian power” and “shamelessly ruining innocent people’s lives”. Taverne took that case further by demanding the Home Office quash all residency refusals made under paragraph 322(5) and reopen those applications for fresh consideration. He also demanded the immediate restoration of the right to work, rent property and have access to the NHS “to those who were deprived of these rights because of the abuse of the subparagraph”. “This is vital to the hundreds or thousands of skilled migrants who are a great asset to this country but whose lives have been ruined, or who face ruin,” he said. Taverne demanded that the Home Office make public the terms of its review into its use of 322(5). He cited cases still going forward that the Home Office claims have already been reviewed and found to be a correct use of the power. Taverne called on Javid to “make his mark as a radical reformer”, and asked him to “tell us that the use of 322(5) will be discontinued and that in cases where it has been used, visa histories will be wiped clean, that IRL [indefinite leave to remain] applications will be reconsidered and that applicants’ right to work, rent property and access to the NHS will be reinstated in the meantime”. “These people are desperate and need immediate help,” he concluded. “They wanted to give their all to the UK, but in exchange, the Home Office has intentionally and calculatingly, taken it all from them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/15/tourism-pollution-backlash-japan-crackdown-costs-airbnb-10m-kyoto","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T23:52:39Z","webTitle":"'Tourism pollution': Japanese crackdown costs Airbnb $10m","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/tourism-pollution-backlash-japan-crackdown-costs-airbnb-10m-kyoto","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/15/tourism-pollution-backlash-japan-crackdown-costs-airbnb-10m-kyoto","fields":{"headline":"'Tourism pollution': Japanese crackdown costs Airbnb $10m","bodyText":"It has become a familiar scene: tourists in rented kimonos posing for photographs in front of a Shinto shrine in Kyoto. They and other visitors have brought valuable tourist dollars to the city and other locations across Japan. But now the country’s former capital is on the frontline of a battle against “tourism pollution” that has already turned locals against visitors in cities across the world such as Venice, Barcelona and Amsterdam. The increasingly fraught relationship between tourists and their Japanese hosts has spread to the short-stay rental market. On Friday a new law comes into effect that requires property owners to register with the government before they can legally make their homes available through Airbnb and other websites. The restriction has caused the number of available properties to plummet and has cost the US-based company millions of dollars. Thanks to government campaigns, the number of foreign tourists visiting Japan has soared since the end of a flat period caused by a strong yen and radiation fears in the aftermath of the 2011 Fukushima disaster. A record 28.7 million people visited last year, an increase of 250% since 2012. Almost seven million were from China, with visitors from South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong Thailand and the US taking the next five spots. By 2020, the year Tokyo hosts the Olympic Games, the government hopes the number will have risen to 40 million. But for many people living near sightseeing hotspots, the tourism boom is proving a double-edged sword. “Japan’s rise as a bucket-list destination is a mixed blessing,” said Peter MacIntosh, who organises walking tours and geisha evenings for small groups. “When there were very few tourists, people complained, and now that there are lots of them, they’re not ready for it. If it’s like this now, what do you think it’s going to be like closer to the Olympics?” The Gion-Shimbashi area of Kyoto is quiet on this weekday morning, but by the weekend the road in front of Tatsumi Daimyojin shrine, the bridge over the Shirakawa and alleyways dotted with restaurants, homes and ryokans (traditional Japanese inns) will be teeming with an international cast of visitors. Tomoko Okuda, who runs Shiraume, a ryokan that welcomes overseas guests, believes more could be done to educate tourists about local customs before they arrive. “Making a booking at a restaurant and then cancelling on the same day may be acceptable in other countries, but in Japan it causes real problems because of the preparation involved,” Okuda said. “I’ve also heard complaints about people going into old tea houses and coffee shops, taking photos and leaving without ordering anything.” Kanji Tomita, an architect and member of a group campaigning to preserve the Gion-Shimbashi’s traditional atmosphere, said tourists were welcome, but added that some local businesses were running out of patience. Most complaints target groups loitering in the doorways of private homes, sitting on delicate bamboo fences and trespassing to take the perfect selfie. Others say the sheer number of visitors has led to overcrowded buses, fully booked restaurants and a general din that spoils the city’s miyabi – the refined atmosphere that draws people to Kyoto in the first place. “This used to be a place where you’d only see locals out for a stroll or eating at a restaurant,” Tomita said. “But more and more people read online reviews and make a beeline for the area. It’s a beautiful place and we want visitors to enjoy it, but they should also consider the feelings of the people who live here. It’s not some sort of cultural Disneyland.” Under the new private lodging law, which was supposed to address a legal grey area surrounding short-term rentals – known as minpaku – properties can be rented out for a maximum of 180 days a year, and local authorities are permitted to impose additional restrictions. The result has been a dramatic drop in the number of Japanese properties available via Airbnb, from more than 60,000 this spring to just 1,000 on the eve of the law’s introduction. The legislation has forced the firm to cancel reservations for guests planning to stay in unregistered homes after Friday and to compensate clients to the tune of about $10m. Complaints about late-night noise and rubbish incorrectly sorted before disposal, along with security concerns, have pitted residents against local authorities keen to cash in on the tourism boom. Tellingly, Kyoto will allow private lodging in residential areas only between mid-January and mid-March, the one time of the year that tourists traditionally avoid. A short walk south of Tatsumi Daimyojin, hordes of tourists have congregated on a street in front of Ichiriki, the 300-year-old teahouse made famous by the book and film Memoirs of a Geisha. Most are here for one reason: to catch a glimpse of the Gion district’s geiko and maiko – or qualified and trainee geisha. “The problem is that everyone thinks of Kyoto as their own private photo studio,” said MacIntosh, who has lived in the city for 25 years. “I’ve seen maiko bursting into tears and fending off people who want to have their photo taken with them. They are not on display. This is a live, working environment.” Other incidents have hardened attitudes towards mass tourism, with TV networks running features on tourists climbing up cherry trees during the blossom season or staggering drunk around Tokyo’s Golden Gai bar district. In May there was widespread anger when more than 100 trees in a popular bamboo forest were found to have been defaced by people carving their names into them. Alex Kerr, a Kyoto resident and author of several books about Japan, said the country had been caught off-guard. “It’s not just Kyoto – most of Japan is unprepared for the foreign influx because the boom has happened so quickly. Nobody ever expected tourists to come in such large numbers, and it is only just beginning.” Kerr believes better management would ease the pressure, including the introduction of higher admission fees to popular attractions. “Tourism is the last salvation for many rural towns, and even having a big impact on metropolises such as Osaka,” he said. “So clamping down on tourism is not the answer. At the same time, there’s no question that unmanaged crowds can damage the experience, especially in a city like Kyoto where so much of the essence of the culture was about the quiet and meditative atmosphere.” In Tatsumi Daimyojin, the photoshoots have ended and the groups in kimonos move on to the next attraction. “Japan is going through a period of adjustment,” said Okuda. “Kyoto isn’t as big or cosmopolitan as Tokyo, and it is taking time to get used to the influx of visitors. But the last thing I want is for Kyoto to become the sort of place that sends out the signal that tourists should stay away.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/14/us-trump-olive-tariffs-hurting-spanish-producers-eu","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T13:48:43Z","webTitle":"US's olive tariffs already hurting Spanish producers, says EU","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/14/us-trump-olive-tariffs-hurting-spanish-producers-eu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/14/us-trump-olive-tariffs-hurting-spanish-producers-eu","fields":{"headline":"US's olive tariffs already hurting Spanish producers, says EU","bodyText":"The European commission has said the “simply unacceptable” imposition of high tariffs by the US on Spanish olives is already having a major effect on producers in southern Spain. This week the US Department of Commerce announced that tariffs ranging from 7.52% to 27.02% would be needed to counteract Spanish olive prices, arguing that the fruits were being sold for 16.88% to 25.5% less than their real value. On Wednesday, a commission spokesman told reporters in Brussels that the preliminary duties were already hitting producers in Andalusia, where olive production “has a very significant economic and social impact”. He said: “We are also well aware of the possible wider implications of this process and that is why the commission got involved so actively in these proceedings and will continue to do so.” The US has said its move covers Spanish olives of all colours, shapes, size, pitted and non-pitted, whole, sliced, minced, wedged or broken. Exports to the US were worth £50.3m in 2017. Exports of black olives to the US fell 42.4% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2017, dropping from 6.9m kgs to 4m kgs, according to Spain’s association of table olive producers and exporters (Asemesa). “The decision by the US Department of Commerce to impose unreasonably high and prohibitive anti-subsidy and anti-dumping duties on Spanish olives is simply unacceptable,” said the commission spokesman. “This is a protectionist measure targeting a high-quality and successful EU product popular with US consumers.” Spain’s agriculture minister, Luis Planas, called the tariffs unjust and said he would raise the matter at a meeting of EU agriculture ministers in Luxembourg on Monday. “It’s an unfair measure because it has no economic or technical basis and it’s worrying as it could call into question the rules governing international trade,” Planas said on Wednesday. He said the tariffs not only affected Spanish producers but could also challenge the common agricultural policy (CAP). “A unilateral action of this nature cannot go unanswered,” said Planas, adding that Spain’s trade, industry and tourism minister would also be raising the issue with the EU trade commission. Antonio de Mora, the secretary general of Asemesa, recently called on the EU commission to “defend the sector on the political stage as forcefully as it has defended steel and aluminium”, saying CAP rules were at stake. He added: “This precedent could mean that any agricultural sector in any country that competes with EU products that receive CAP assistance could ask its government to act like the US is.” The issue of US tariffs has been a cause of concern in Brussels for months, with the commissioners for both trade and agriculture, Cecilia Malmström and Phil Hogan, working behind the scenes to protect the Spanish industry. Brussels claims that Spain’s support for producers is consistent with World Trade Organisation rules because they do not target a single industry or product. The final US decision on the imposition of the tariffs is expected to be made on 24 July."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/14/state-of-mind-rugby-league-mental-health","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T16:25:00Z","webTitle":"From drugs and alcohol to wellbeing: how rugby league is tackling mental health","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/14/state-of-mind-rugby-league-mental-health","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/14/state-of-mind-rugby-league-mental-health","fields":{"headline":"From drugs and alcohol to wellbeing: how rugby league is tackling mental health","bodyText":"It did not take Paul Highton long to realise something was wrong. “On Sunday I’d played my last game, retired, and by Monday or Tuesday I was sat on the couch thinking: ‘Is this it now?’” the former Halifax and Salford forward recalls. In 2009, Highton’s 20-year career came to an abrupt end and, having struggled to integrate back into everyday life, he turned to substance abuse. “I was really struggling,” he says. “That led me to alcohol and taking prescription drugs to cope with the fact I wasn’t playing anymore.” Highton’s story could have easily had an unhappy ending but, shortly after things began to spiral out of control, he got the call that changed his life. Highton visited Sporting Chance and soon after was contacted by State of Mind. Suicide remains the biggest killer of men under 45 in the UK, and the charity was founded amid tragic circumstances in 2011, when the former Great Britain hooker Terry Newton took his own life. Dedicated to raising awareness of mental health issues in the typically macho environment of rugby league and encouraging players to talk, this weekend features the latest dedicated State of Mind round in Super League. Highton, now both an ambassador for the charity and Salford’s player welfare manager having rebuilt his life, is only too aware of the difference it has made to rugby league. “In our club alone, I get our leadership group asking me to speak to certain players if they don’t seem right or they’re struggling. I’m not sure that would have happened a few years ago,” Highton says. But State of Mind’s reach is not strictly limited to players. Part of the ultimate goal is helping everyone involved in the sport adjust to life away from rugby league – something the former Super League referee Ian Smith can attest to being more difficult than he first envisaged. The wellbeing of match officials is rarely considered in most emotionally charged sports, a category into which rugby league firmly falls. And when Smith suddenly found himself out of work following a restructure of the Rugby Football League’s refereeing department in 2016, the 52-year-old had nowhere to turn. “Not only was it my income stream, it was my love, my passion,” he tells the Guardian. “I felt like I lost my identity, to be brutally honest. “I just wanted to isolate myself; I had no reason to get up and go to work. Eventually I did get a job, but that adrenaline wasn’t there. I was lost – I needed help.” Like Highton, Smith sought help with Sporting Chance before State of Mind reached out. And like Highton, Smith now leads motivational talks on the benefits State of Mind can provide. “It’s given me purpose and focus back in my life,” he says. “Highton asked if I wanted to do some presenting for them and it’s rocketed from there.” Smith also reached out to the RFL’s match officials department recently to offer help to the current group of officials in dealing with abuse. “I didn’t deal with the abuse,” he recalls. “Walking back to your car after a game, to have stewards escorting me back … that was tough. My parents didn’t see me referee a game in my last eight years as an official because they couldn’t take hearing their son being abused by people. “Players will make mistakes, but referees seemingly can’t. There’s a human behind the uniform that cries, that bleeds and that has a family. Just think about what you’re shouting on the terraces sometimes – that’s my plea. We’re trying to raise awareness of issues like that.” Such has been the success of State of Mind, the likes of Highton and Smith now take the concept into other walks of life, such as, in Smith’s words, “alpha-male organisations” such as those in construction. “Rugby league should be very proud that we can use our sport as a driving force to the masses,” Highton says. “It doesn’t matter how flash your car is or how rich you are: mental health does not discriminate.” The goal for State of Mind at its foundation was to save one life; to stop one player from feeling like the worst option was the only option. The likes of Highton and Smith are living, breathing proof that in rugby league, the taboo is being eroded as the charity prepares to take over Super League again this week. • In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

Faine was characteristically blunt as he told listeners to the Conversation Hour that politicians were “laughing” at the ABC for staying silent while it was “done over” by the Coalition government, which imposed more budget cuts and an efficiency review last month. He took aim at managing director, Michelle Guthrie, and her chairman, Justin Milne, for not standing up to ABC critics and defending the broadcaster. “I’ve been here since 1989 busting my guts for a vision and a set of values and quite frankly I’m sick of getting it ripped apart because of the failure of our managers,” Faine said. “[Guthrie] has been remarkably quiet and reluctant to engage in what she herself previously has described as megaphone campaigning,” Faine said. “She says ‘No, the best way to protect the ABC is to work quietly behind the scenes’. And that’s obviously delivered a terrible outcome in the last budget round.” Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Guthrie is giving a speech on Tuesday at the Melbourne Press Club, and plans on taking her strongest stand since she took office in May 2016. Faine urged the MD to rethink her “failed” strategy and talk about the importance of the ABC to the nation. “We are hopeless at telling our own story as an organisation and we have a managing director who has been deliberately and, she says, strategically silent. Well, that’s not worked. We have a chairman of the board who has written one piece for a newspaper that I’m aware of – ever – and has given a handful of interviews. He also thinks it’s strategic to be silent. That hasn’t worked.” Not #YouToo: do women want men to walk in their shoes? There was some consternation among women writers on Thursday when they discovered journalist David Leser had been commissioned to write a book about the #MeToo movement for Allen &amp; Unwin. Leser, an experienced features writer for the Daily Telegraph, the Australian, the Sydney Morning Herald, Good Weekend and the Australian Women’s Weekly, told Brava magazine he was trying to give voice to the story as a man. “As a man I can’t speak for women, just as a woman can’t speak for a man, or a white can’t speak for a black, or a Palestinian can’t speak for an Israeli,” he said. “In conflict zones it’s hard to put yourself in the other’s shoes but you have to try. So what I’m trying to do is find the moral imagination and the empathy and the ability to walk – in the Biblical sense – in someone else’s shoes, and examine my own privileges, examine the ways in which I’ve drunk from the well of patriarchy myself.” One of the women he contacted for the book, Guardian columnist Van Badham, was not impressed. “So you have a community of women united by a shared experience of pain, often compromised professionally, personally, financially, by their manipulation ... and their recompense for these humiliating events is that a man will be paid and platformed to tell their story,” Badham told Beast. “Jesus Christ. As if we are such hopeless and emotional children we can’t articulate our own experience with gravitas or clarity. This is precisely the structural sexism that #MeToo has illuminated, and we are staring at it, and it’s so very ugly.” Allen &amp; Unwin publisher Jane Palfreyman gave us a mixed message. “I can confirm that Allen &amp; Unwin has NOT commissioned David to write a book on the #MeToo movement,” Palfreyman said in an email. It hasn’t? Palfreyman went on. “We were one of many publishers contacted by his agent after this essay by him was published to huge interest in the Good Weekend on Feb 9, 2018. After discussions with several publishers, David decided to work with me and Allen &amp; Unwin on expanding that essay into a book, which will be a snapshot of gender politics at this present moment. We will be publishing that book in August 2019.” So he’s not writing a book about #MeToo but he’s writing “a snapshot of gender politics at this present moment”. Clear as mud. Joe Aston takes a blowtorch to Stan Grant The Australian Financial Review’s most favoured columnist, Joe Aston, who divides his time between Los Angeles and Sydney as his generous pay packet allows, has criticised the ABC for flying three reporters – Washington bureau chief Zoe Daniel, Phil Williams and Stan Grant – to Singapore for the Trump-Kim summit this week. Aston is no fan of Daniel, after she objected to not being invited to an audience with Trump in Washington held by ambassador Joe Hockey, who was once Aston’s boss when he was a media adviser. The handful of media included Aston but not the ABC’s Washington correspondent. But it is Grant who was given the blowtorch treatment by Aston. Grant is a “human full toss” who had been “sent from the nearest echo chamber wallpapered with mirrors”, he wrote. “With inward-facing expertise of such unshakable assurance, and in times of such muscle hewing, what is Zoe doing there? What can she say? Stan’s a man, sure, but not a white one.” Many colleagues of Grant’s were appalled by the racist and sexist tone of the piece. Saturday Paper nabs Connaughton At 25, Maddison Connaughton is relatively young to be appointed editor of the Saturday Paper, but then again her soon to be editor-in-chief, Erik Jensen, was just 23 when he became the paper’s founding editor. Four years after the paper was launched by publisher Morry Schwartz, it has a print readership of 242,000, according to industry data, and is a success despite the naysayers who scoffed at the idea of starting up a print newspaper. A finalist in this year’s Walkley Young Australian Journalist of the Year awards for her reporting from the Syrian border, Connaughton comes to Schwarz Media from a job as features editor at Vice Media. Connaughton: “I see this as an opportunity to find new audiences for the paper and to foster a whole new generation of writers who think deeply, and differently, about the shifts that are reshaping Australia and our region.” SBS collaborates to drive diversity SBS has partnered with Film Victoria, Create NSW, Screen Queensland, Screenwest and the South Australian Film Corporation to create opportunities for diverse and underrepresented groups, including those from multicultural, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island and LGBTIQ+ communities to make television. Under the new Short-Form Content Initiative the agencies and the broadcaster will collaborate with creative teams to produce shows for SBS On Demand next year. SBS director of TV and online, Marshall Heald, hopes the project will address the imbalance in the diversity of stories being told. And the rules? Each project will need to demonstrate that two of the three key creatives (writer, director, producer) are from backgrounds presently underrepresented in the screen industry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/jun/14/talking-horses-musicka-sprint-handicap-nottingham-horse-racing-tips-royal-ascot","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T10:28:53Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Redkirk Warrior fighting fit for Royal Ascot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jun/14/talking-horses-musicka-sprint-handicap-nottingham-horse-racing-tips-royal-ascot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/jun/14/talking-horses-musicka-sprint-handicap-nottingham-horse-racing-tips-royal-ascot","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Redkirk Warrior fighting fit for Royal Ascot","bodyText":"4.30pm Warrior fighting fit for Ascot Ben Hayes, who jointly trains the Australian sprinter and Royal Ascot contender Redkirk Warrior with his father David, was at the press conference in Newmarket this morning to talk through the seven-year-old’s chances in the Diamond Jubilee Stakes a week on Saturday. “We’ve been really happy with Redkirk Warrior since he arrived in Britain,” Hayes said. “He’s settled in well and taken everything in his stride. He was originally from England and he has done plenty of travelling, having raced here, Hong Kong and Australia, so he seems to take his travelling really well. It’s an advantage that he has raced on the track before [when winning a handicap in 2014] as we know he handles it. “I definitely think he has the credentials to win. If you win both a Newmarket and a Lightning [at Flemington], that is pretty good form which entitles you to have a really good chance at Ascot. Most of the Australian sprinters who have come over here have won at least one of those races, so we know that the form stacks up and we hope he has a great chance in the Diamond Jubilee.” Thursday’s best bets With Royal Ascot imminent, this is probably not the time to be wading in too deeply on the daily cards, but there are a few interesting races scattered around five meetings and Muscika (3.50) looks sure to go close in the sprint handicap at Nottingham on Wednesday. David O’Meara’s gelding bumped into a progressive opponent in Maid In India at Haydock in May, and then won off a 4lb higher mark at Ayr next time out. He is up another 6lb today but the time of his last race was strong and at around 6-4, he is a very solid bet. The seven-furlong handicap at Newbury is competitive but Desert Trip (4.00) has just four races behind him and has shown enough already to suggest that a win off today’s mark is not beyond him. Marilyn (3.40) and Full Suit (3.05) are both fairly priced at Yarmouth, and the veteran Alejandro (7.55), a winner nine times in 84 starts, could well get his head in front again on the evening card at Haydock Park."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/14/sporting-lisbon-meltdown-portugal-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T09:32:39Z","webTitle":"Sporting meltdown casts shadow over Portugal’s World Cup buildup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/14/sporting-lisbon-meltdown-portugal-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/14/sporting-lisbon-meltdown-portugal-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Sporting meltdown casts shadow over Portugal’s World Cup buildup","bodyText":"“Spoiled kids, let’s resolve this then …” wrote the Sporting president, Bruno de Carvalho, on his personal Facebook account at the start of April. Two months on, after a period in which 19 players have been suspended and a group of hooded men forced their way into the club’s training ground armed with sticks after defeat in the final league match of the season, it’s fair to say things have not worked out quite the way the man some have labelled the “Donald Trump of football” would have planned. While Spain have problems of their own as the Iberian nations prepare to meet in their opening match at th e 2018 World Cup, the fallout from the Sporting soap opera has marred the buildup to the tournament for the reigning European champions. On Monday Gelson Martins, William Carvalho and Bruno Fernandes joined the goalkeeper Rui Patrício in cancelling their contracts, citing “valid motives” for their decision. The Netherlands international Bas Dost, who was one of the players injured in the training ground attack, has also indicated his desire to leave one of Portugal’s most famous clubs, even accusing the president of perpetrating of “psychological violence” towards him, with the law courts now set to rule on the case. “It’s a big mess,” admits Nuno Travassos of the Portuguese website maisfutebol.pt. “He was seen as the saviour and even now the club is split in two. There are still many people who support De Carvalho and want him to stay, even after all this controversy. He has always liked to speak about the team’s performances and uses social media a lot. That’s why some of the newspapers have made the comparison with Trump.” Surprisingly elected in March 2013, De Carvalho has proven to be a popular choice among supporters for his frequent attacks on the Portuguese football establishment, including accusing their Lisbon rivals Benfica of offering gifts to referees. He has even been known to sit on the bench during matches – “creating a presence” as he described it – and also regularly texted his players after matches to make plain his dissatisfaction with their performances. But despite the controversial appointment of Jorge Jesus as manager after he left Benfica, Sporting’s season unravelled after the 2-0 defeat to Atlético Madrid in the first leg of their Europa League tie that prompted De Carvalho’s Facebook post. Having previously promised to stay away from social media after one outburst in 2015, the president’s accusation that members of his team had committed “grotesque mistakes” understandably did not go down well. Nineteen players subsequently posted their own statement on Facebook noting their “displeasure with the public declarations of our president” – a move that prompted De Carvalho to threaten them with suspension. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the denouement of the season was a disaster as Sporting finished third in the table, failing to qualify for the Champions League, before the damaging defeat to the minnows Aves in the Portuguese Cup final, who have been a top-flight side for only three seasons. Having already complained about fans being allowed access to the private car park at the club’s training ground, the attack on Dost, Jesus and several other members of staff a few days before the final proved to be the final straw. “The environment became awful,” says Travassos. “The players said in their resignation letters that the president and the board are responsible for this situation because they contributed to this bad environment and didn’t assure the security conditions of the team. That’s why they say they have reason to leave.” Patrício, the 30-year-old goalkeeper who has won nearly 70 caps, was the first to tender his request to terminate his contract after a proposed €18m transfer to Wolves was vetoed by De Carvalho at the last minute, while the winger Martins and midfielders Carvalho and Fernandes have also been linked with moves to the Premier League in recent days. Whether they get their wish remains to be seen, with De Carvalho having since offered to resign if all the players who want to leave reverse their decision, although the Portugal coach, Fernando Santos, may fear the damage has already been done. “Some of them are experienced players but obviously it’s something that they would have wanted to avoid,” says Travassos. “Usually the only thing we talk about in press conferences is Ronaldo, Ronaldo, Ronaldo but this time, there is more about Sporting.” But with a squad that contains 13 of the 23 players who helped win the country’s first major silverware at Euro 2016, Portugal supporters have every reason to feel quietly confident of their chances. A comparison with the 1986 World Cup – when a talented squad went home bottom of their group after falling out with the Portuguese FA over bonuses – is tempting, especially given the presence of Morocco, to whom they lost 3-1 in their final match 32 years ago after defeating England, in their group. Yet with top-level players throughout the squad led by Cristiano Ronaldo in what is likely to be his last appearance at a World Cup, anyone who writes off Santos’s side does so at their peril. “I don’t think this has changed anything among the fans,” says Travassos. “It’s a bad situation of course but expectations are still the same. The players will be focused and if there is a problem, the coach has others to replace them. We don’t have the options of many countries but we have very good quality.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/14/eu-raises-renewable-energy-targets-to-32-by-2030","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T09:31:58Z","webTitle":"EU raises renewable energy targets to 32% by 2030","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/14/eu-raises-renewable-energy-targets-to-32-by-2030","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/14/eu-raises-renewable-energy-targets-to-32-by-2030","fields":{"headline":"EU raises renewable energy targets to 32% by 2030","bodyText":"The EU is raising its target for the amount of energy it consumes from renewable sources, in a deal lauded by the bloc’s climate chief as a hard-won victory for the switch to clean energy. Energy ministers agreed a binding renewable energy target of 32% by 2030, up from the previous goal of 27%, but fell short of the hopes of some countries and green groups for a more ambitious share. The EU council deal caps 18 months of negotiations. It was welcomed by the renewables industry and the trade body for European energy utilities called it: “a well-balanced compromise”. The talks saw the UK call for a target of 30%, below the 32% a newly pro-renewables France wanted and the 35% that new governments in Spain and Italy argued for. Miguel Arias Cañete, EU climate commissioner, said: “This new ambition will help us meet our Paris agreement goals and will translate into more jobs, lower energy bills for consumers and less energy imports.” He added that the binding nature of the goal would provide certainty to investors. Whether the target will apply to the UK after it leaves the EU will depend on the exit deal reached by London and Brussels. The agreement also includes plans for a 2023 review on whether the target should be bumped even higher. Around 17% of EU energy consumption in 2016 was from renewables, with the UK on about 9%. Green energy advocates argued the existing 2030 target was unambitious because member states were already on track to exceed it. Environmental groups said the increase did not go far enough and were critical of a decision to keep counting biomass as renewable energy. Molly Walsh, renewable energy campaigner for Friends of the Earth Europe, said: “EU decision-makers have agreed a paltry 32% target for renewable energy that is inadequate for a climate-safe fossil-free future, and shows a failure to grasp a shifting energy landscape, including rapidly falling renewables costs.” However, the group welcomed the deal’s recognition of rights for consumers to produce and sell their own renewable energy, such as from solar panels on rooftops. The agreement now needs to be formally approved by the EU parliament and council in coming months."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/14/rolls-royce-cut-jobs-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T08:22:08Z","webTitle":"Rolls-Royce to cut 3,000 jobs in UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/14/rolls-royce-cut-jobs-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/14/rolls-royce-cut-jobs-britain","fields":{"headline":"Rolls-Royce to cut 3,000 jobs in UK","bodyText":"Rolls-Royce has announced it is to cut 4,600 jobs as part of a major shakeup of its business, mainly affecting managerial and administrative roles in the UK. Warren East, the aircraft engine maker’s chief executive, said the UK would bear the brunt with around 3,000 of the job losses, and that he could not rule out compulsory redundancies. “It’s a horrible decision, never easy,” he said, but that the cuts were necessary “if we want to be around for the next 100 years”. The job losses will fall heavily on Derby, the group’s biggest manufacturing base in the UK, which currently has a workforce of 15,700 people. The firm’s HR, finance, and legal departments are also based in Derby. Some corporate and support jobs in Bristol, its second-biggest base in the UK, will also go. While most of the cuts will be in middle management jobs, engineers working on early-stage design will also be laid off as they are not needed at present, the group said. Rolls-Royce said it was still hiring engineers in electrification and digitalisation. Approximately 1,500 of the jobs will be axed by the end of the year. It is the company’s biggest round of redundancies since 2001. Rolls-Royce said the move would simplify the business into three customer-focused units with smaller corporate and support functions and reduce management layers and complexity, including within engineering. At the same time, it is ramping up production and hopes to be making 600 engines for wide-body aircraft a year by 2020, twice as many as five years ago. The company employs 55,000 people worldwide. It has a workforce of 26,000 in the UK, which includes contractors. Britain’s biggest union, Unite, warned Rolls-Royce against cutting “too deep and too fast”. Its assistant general secretary for aerospace, Steve Turner, said: “This announcement will be deeply unsettling for Rolls-Royce workers and their families and could have a dire economic impact on local communities reliant on Rolls-Royce jobs.” East, who took the helm three years ago, expressed frustration at the pace of change at the business, and said: “We must create a commercial organisation that is as world-leading as our technologies. We need to modernise the way in which we do business.” He said the 33,000 non-manufacturing staff were “too many for a business of our size”. This week, Rolls-Royce said it had discovered new problems with its troubled Trent 1000 engines, which power Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner aircraft. More than 30 aircraft have been grounded, and analysts reckon the bill for fixing the problems and paying compensation to airlines could total up to £1bn. The firm said it would stand by a deal made with the unions a year ago that will protect 7,000 engineering jobs in the east Midlands – Derby, Hucknall and Annesley – as part of a £150m investment. Unite said the collective agreement included a guarantee against compulsory redundancies, and that it would be seeking a similar guarantee for its members affected by Thursday’s announcement who were not covered by that agreement. The redundancies and other restructuring costs are expected to reach £500m, but would save £400m annually by 2020. In recent years East has reduced the workforce in the loss-making marine division, which is now up for sale, by 2,000 and laid off 800 managers across the group, but because the company has also been hiring, the net number of job cuts was 600. A government spokesman said the government was “in regular contact” with Rolls-Royce on its plans to reduce its back-office and support functions. “This is clearly an uncertain time for affected employees and their families and Jobcentre Plus Rapid Response stands ready to help people back into employment as soon as possible.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/planet-oz/2018/jun/15/inside-the-aef-the-climate-denial-group-hosting-tony-abbott-as-guest-speaker","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T18:00:07Z","webTitle":"Inside the AEF, the climate denial group hosting Tony Abbott as guest speaker","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2018/jun/15/inside-the-aef-the-climate-denial-group-hosting-tony-abbott-as-guest-speaker","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/planet-oz/2018/jun/15/inside-the-aef-the-climate-denial-group-hosting-tony-abbott-as-guest-speaker","fields":{"headline":"Inside the AEF, the climate denial group hosting Tony Abbott as guest speaker","bodyText":"Securing a former prime minister to speak at your organisation is no doubt a coup for many groups. Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy recently got Kevin Rudd. Australia’s Nelson Mandela Day committee has snaffled Julia Gillard for their next annual lecture. What about our most recent former PM, Tony Abbott? Next month, Abbott will deliver the “2018 Bob Carter Commemorative Lecture” to the Australian Environment Foundation (AEF), where the ticketing site says he’ll talk about “Climate Change and Restraining Greenhouse Gas Emissions”. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The AEF is an “environment charity” that promotes views that wind turbines make you sick, that human-caused climate change isn’t really a thing, and that environmentalists (the other sort) are killing farmers, fisheries and the economy. Abbott’s lecture will no doubt pick up from his speech in London in December, where he delivered a suite of climate science denial talking points to the Global Warming Policy Foundation. So who, or what, is the AEF? To look into its history, and the people involved with it, is to take a deep dive into Australia’s climate science denial network. But first let’s look at the AEF right now because, as an “environmental charity”, Abbott’s next port of call doesn’t seem to do very much. Latest figures available from the Australian Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission show that in 2016, the charity declared an annual income of just $1,175. The AEF’s YouTube channel has just 11 subscribers and has posted only one video, from December 2016. In May 2017, the AEF lent its logo to a letter to US President Donald Trump to offer “enthusiastic support” for his commitments to withdraw from the UN Paris climate agreement. But between July 2017 and February 2018, there was virtually nothing posted on its website. Much of that website, including the “Climate News” section, is content from former Institute of Public Affairs fellow Alan Moran and postings that variously dismiss human-caused climate change and renewable energy, in particular wind power. The charity has two other trading names listed with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission – the Australian Climate Science Coalition (ACSC) and ListenToUs – but both of these seem to be defunct. The ACSC at one time was receiving cash from a US affiliate, the American Climate Science Coalition, itself an offshoot of the International Climate Science Coalition. The ACSC received $107,000 from its American donors in 2009 and 2010, after which the donations stopped. The ACSC didn’t do any actual climate science, but did host talks from folks like climate science denier and self-titled “high priest of climate scepticism” Christopher Monckton, who once compared then Australian government climate policy advisor Professor Ross Garnaut to a Nazi. The AEF’s ListenToUs website was an attempt to generate an online social media campaign against carbon pricing. But now, either the AEF has a new line in promoting “Male Strippers Melbourne” and “Home Cleaning Melbourne” or some sort of hackery or lapsing of domain names has eventuated. When Abbott delivers his lecture, he’ll be introduced by Dr Peter Ridd, the controversial marine scientist sacked from James Cook University for alleged multiple breaches of its code of conduct. A brief history Ridd has been a director at the AEF since 2005. That’s a neat segue into the AEF’s history. In late 2004, the Institute of Public Affairs – by then already pushing out climate science misinformation – held its “Eureka forum” to work out how to push back against “environmental fundamentalism” that, it claimed, was “denying farmers, foresters, fishermen, prospectors, miners, beekeepers, 4WD enthusiasts and others access rights, property rights, water rights”. As part of this push back, the AEF was formed in early 2005 with the Institute of Public Affairs as its business address. Then IPA boss Mike Nahan and IPA staffer Jennifer Marohasy were both founding directors. These days the IPA says it has nothing to do with the AEF. Over the years, the AEF has consistently promoted climate science denialism. The group has campaigned against marine parks, carbon taxes, climate science and wind farms, which it says make people sick. For several years, the AEF gained a little notoriety thanks to TV celebrity Don Burke serving as its chairman. The AEF’s current chair, lawyer Tom Bostock, was also a board member of the Lavoisier Group – another collection of conservative white males that came together in 2000 to fight Australia’s engagement in United Nations climate agreements and to attack the science of human-caused climate change. Another AEF director is Tom Quirk, a former director at the IPA and a member of the ACSC advisory panel when that project was a thing. Quirk is involved with another effort to convince right wingers that human-caused climate change science is a massive con. The unincorporated “Climate Study Group”, of which Quirk is a member, has been running a series of odd adverts in the Australian. The half-page ads have evoked the philosopher Socrates and some cod-psychology to claim sea levels are not rising, global warming isn’t caused by rising levels of greenhouse gas, and we should all be preparing for a coming ice age. Fake quotes and conspiracies So what of Abbott’s lecture? The AEF says it “established the lecture series to commemorate the life and work of Bob Carter”, who was an AEF director at the time of his death in 2016 (Carter was affiliated with 10 or more climate science denial groups around the world). Abbott’s lecture will be the second in the “series” – the first was delivered in November 2016 by Canadian denialist Tim Ball (that’s the one YouTube video on AEF’s channel). At the time, Ball was in Australia with former One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts. Ball’s speech was a classic of the climate denial genre, mixing conspiracy theories, hatred of “leftists” and disregard for any evidence contradicting a view that climate change is the “biggest deception in history”. Ball claimed the United Nations, led by a favourite enemy of climate science denialists, Maurice Strong, was attempting to exert global control over people’s lives to push a socialist agenda. Ball even used a slide of a quote from Strong, supposedly uttered at the 1992 Rio Earth summit, which read: “Isn’t the only hope for this planet that the industrialised civilisation collapses? Isn’t it our responsibility to bring that about?” This quote is widely used among climate science deniers as evidence of the nefarious motives of the UN. The quote was actually from two years earlier, when Strong was talking to a journalist about the plot of a novel he hoped to write (incidentally another Maurice, Tony Abbott’s former lead business advisor Maurice Newman, has also used the fake quote in a 2015 opinion column in the Australian. Until recently, One Nation also ran the quote on its website). I emailed three of the listed AEF directors – Ridd, Bostock, and Alan Oxley, the former Hawke-era diplomat and now chairman of the APEC Study Centre at RMIT University. I asked about the charity’s activities, how they secured Abbott’s appearance and the charity’s apparently defunct projects (including the Melbourne strippers) but I didn’t get a response."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/14/pru-goward-rejects-call-to-appoint-aboriginal-child-and-family-commissioner","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T06:39:53Z","webTitle":"Pru Goward rejects call to appoint Aboriginal child and family commissioner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/14/pru-goward-rejects-call-to-appoint-aboriginal-child-and-family-commissioner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/14/pru-goward-rejects-call-to-appoint-aboriginal-child-and-family-commissioner","fields":{"headline":"Pru Goward rejects call to appoint Aboriginal child and family commissioner","bodyText":"The NSW families minister, Pru Goward, has rejected calls to appoint an Aboriginal child and family commissioner to help reduce the number of Aboriginal children being removed from their families and placed in out-of-home care. “We’re not creating a separate system for Aboriginal children. This is core business for us,” Goward told ABC radio on Thursday morning. “This is Australia and we are all in this together. This is core for all of us. It needs to remain in the mainstream, as part of mainstream responsibility.” Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The peak body for Aboriginal organisations working in the system, the Aboriginal Child, Family and Community Care State Secretariat, or AbSec, told Guardian Australia an Aboriginal child and family commissioner could direct investment in child and family support services, set up a statewide data system to measure needs and effects, and provide early intervention programs for Aboriginal families. “We want to see investment in solutions pioneered and provided by Aboriginal agencies and communities,” Absec’s chief executive, Tim Ireland, said. “It is not fair that we should have such little say in a system which so heavily affects our people.” More than 7% of Aboriginal children are in out-of-home care, compared with 1% of all children and young people in NSW. The NSW government “probably should have” released the Tune report into child protection earlier, Goward told ABC radio. But because it was commissioned by cabinet, the government was following the “time-honoured Westminster tradition” of respecting cabinet confidentiality, the minister said. “But the really good news is that now that it’s out there, you can see we have implemented Tune’s recommendations and we are doing better than he predicted we would do if we followed his recommendations.” Goward said her department had reduced by 20% the number of Aboriginal children being taken into care over the past six years. Family and Community Services (Facs) data shows 2,914 Aboriginal children were taken into out-of-home care in 2016, down from 3,585 in 2011. The 2018-19 budget, to be delivered next Tuesday, will invest an additional $59m over four years by adding 100 more child protection staff and setting a target of more than 1,000 open adoptions. NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge was part of the upper house push to have the Tune report made public last week and backed the AbSec call for a Aboriginal child and family commissioner. “The minister is either in denial or plainly ignorant of the needs of First Nations people and the systemic disadvantages they face at the hands of her department,” Shoebridge told Guardian Australia. “Aboriginal children are 10 times more likely to be taken from their families by a government official. “This is a result of the engrained racism of a system that pretends it can treat communities and children who face systemic disadvantage no differently than non-Aboriginal children. “The independent Tune report says what Aboriginal communities have been saying for 230 years, that the answer lies in self-determination and that Aboriginal kids are best cared for by Aboriginal parents, elders, aunts, uncles and grandparents.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/14/nhs-child-mental-health-costs-social-media-firms-must-share","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T23:09:52Z","webTitle":"Social media firms 'must share child mental health costs'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/14/nhs-child-mental-health-costs-social-media-firms-must-share","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/14/nhs-child-mental-health-costs-social-media-firms-must-share","fields":{"headline":"Social media firms 'must share child mental health costs'","bodyText":"Social media firms must share the burden with the health service as it battles mental health issues in young people, the head of NHS England has said. Setting out the health service’s key priorities for the future as it marks its 70th year, Simon Stevens, the body’s chief executive, warned of a “double epidemic affecting our children” that also included obesity. “It is obvious that there is more unmet need for young people’s mental health services than probably any other part of the health service,” he said in his keynote address at the NHS Confederation annual conference in Manchester. “The conversation, though, around young people’s mental health has got to be wider than just about what the NHS can do. “This is certainly about schools, but we also have to ask some pretty searching questions around the role of technology companies, social media, and the impact that that is having on childhood. “So, this cannot be a conversation that is simply left to the National Health Service to pick up the pieces – for an epidemic of mental health challenge for our young people induced by many other actors across our economy.” He said the NHS must “lock in” progress on cancer and mental health, while also prioritising the integration of social care as it considers plans for the next five to 10 years. Obesity was also highlighted as a key issue for the health service. “It is absolutely true that we need to be more physically active,” Stevens said. “But that by itself is not going to deal with what’s happening to our food and drink calorific environment. “That said – here is a key fact for you – on average in this country we spend twice as much time on the toilet than we do exercising.” The prime minister, Theresa May, has pledged a long-term funding settlement for the NHS, which celebrates its 70th anniversary next month. “I want that to be done in conjunction with NHS leaders and provide a multi-year funding settlement consistent with our fiscal rules and balanced approach,” she told parliament’s health and social care select committee in March. “Ensuring the NHS can cope with demand ahead of the spending review, I would suggest we can’t wait until next Easter. I think in this 70th anniversary year of the NHS’s foundation we need an answer on this.” The prime minister did not say how much more money the long-term plan could involve. But Stevens told the audience he was “heartened” by the commitment to securing a deal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/14/queensland-scraps-law-forcing-married-transgender-people-to-divorce","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T23:19:10Z","webTitle":"Queensland scraps law forcing married transgender people to divorce","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/14/queensland-scraps-law-forcing-married-transgender-people-to-divorce","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/14/queensland-scraps-law-forcing-married-transgender-people-to-divorce","fields":{"headline":"Queensland scraps law forcing married transgender people to divorce","bodyText":"The Queensland government has removed an anachronistic quirk of state law that forced married transgender people to divorce to if they sought legal recognition of their gender. The laws were drawn up before same-sex marriages were recognised. The vote by the Queensland parliament on Wednesday to amend the state’s Births, Deaths and Marriages Act recognised the existing marriages of people who undertake gender reassignment. They can now apply to have their birth certificates amended without having to get divorced. “This is not a cost or a consequence any law of this state should impose on members of our community,” said the state’s attorney-general, Yvette D’Ath. “It has been unjust and unfair and I’m proud to say this distressing choice will no longer be a requirement in Queensland. “I hope delivering this reform will go some way to helping the transgender community to live their lives openly and without judgment.” The changes were supported by the Liberal National party opposition, the Greens and the independent Sandy Bolton. One Nation and Katter’s Australia party MPs voted against them. The KAP state leader, Rob Katter, told the ABC said the party was philosophically opposed to the federal law changes and the Queensland bill. “It’s a consistent ideological position we have,” Katter said. “This is a continued attack on traditional values and we want to represent the traditional views.” The Palaszczuk government has steadily reviewed a number of laws, some remaining from Queensland’s conservative past, on human rights grounds. It has expunged historical convictions for homosexual people, removing the “gay panic” defence in assault and murder cases, changed the age of consent and removed barriers to same-sex adoption. The government is now reviewing abortion laws, which in some parts date back to 1899. It is expected the state will begin a euthanasia debate after abortion laws are passed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/jun/13/russia-stanislav-cherchesov-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T19:08:22Z","webTitle":"Russia’s Stanislav Cherchesov upbeat about mission to confound critics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/jun/13/russia-stanislav-cherchesov-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/jun/13/russia-stanislav-cherchesov-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Russia’s Stanislav Cherchesov upbeat about mission to confound critics","bodyText":"Stanislav Cherchesov smiled when asked by a Danish journalist whether he had a message for the Russian people on the eve of the opening match of a World Cup finals that is taking place in the largest country on the planet. “You would be hard pushed to get around the labyrinth of the Russian soul,” the Russia coach replied. “I think half the country will find out that we have a World Cup when the whistle blows. It takes a long time for us to start driving but I think when we press the foot on the pedal, we go all the way.” Russia, in other words, is not exactly gripped by World Cup fever in the way Brazil was four years ago, and the extent to which that mood shifts from apathy to excitement over the next couple of weeks is likely to hinge on whether the lowest-ranked team in the tournament can defy expectations and avoid the ignominy of being among the first to leave their own party. Hopes are not high in that respect. The front page of the Moscow Times, 24 hours before Russia face Saudi Arabia at the Luzhniki Stadium, provided a reasonable gauge of the mood in the country. “Ageing and inexperienced: why Russia is doomed to fail” ran the headline. “Destined for defeat” screamed the words above the article inside that lamented Russia’s failure to invest in a new youth programme once they were awarded the World Cup. The fact Cherchesov’s players are without a win in their past seven matches and have registered only one shot on target in 180 minutes has fuelled the inescapable sense of pessimism, with plenty of media commentators, as well as former players, describing the current generation as the worst Russia team ever. With all that in mind, Cherchesov could have been forgiven for walking into a packed media room in Moscow on Wednesday afternoon and looking like a rabbit staring into the headlights when the microphone was passed around the auditorium, yet nothing could have been further from the truth. The 54-year-old cracked jokes about James Bond and moustaches, revealed that his players had been relaxing by playing Trivial Pursuit and generally gave the impression that pressure was the last thing he was feeling. “I can tell you I don’t read anything,” Cherchesov said, when quizzed about the negative backdrop in Russia. “Getting criticism is a natural thing in the world that we live in today. But we never touch upon this topic at all. We have to do everything to earn praise and do everything we can to turn criticism into positive feedback.” That may be easier said than done, not least because there are clear signs that the Russia players are not as detached from the scathing media coverage as their manager. “I see all that is happening from the negative side and I want to ask the media, because you are broadcasting to the people, to be positive,” Artem Dzyuba, the Zenit St Petersburg striker, said. “The tournament has not started yet and [the media] are behaving aggressively.” In Saudi Arabia, the next-lowest-ranked team in the World Cup, Russia could not have asked for more obliging opponents for their first game in a group that also features Egypt and Uruguay, yet few within the host nation are taking victory for granted. Serious injuries to Viktor Vasin, Georgy Dzhikiya and Alexander Kokorin have robbed Russia of three nailed-on starters and raised the possibility of Sergei Ignashevich, who effectively retired from international football two years ago and turns 39 the day before the final, starting in central defence against Saudi Arabia. Cherchesov, however, made Ignashevich’s belated return sound like it was all part of his grand plan. “As far as Ignashevich is concerned, I have the feeling that he never left us,” he said. “We kept track of him from day one, we reached an agreement with him and we kept our end of the bargain. He’s a cementing factor inside and outside of the pitch.” Whether that turns out to be the case against Saudi Arabia remains to be seen. The Saudis have not won a World Cup match since 1994, when Saeed al-Owairan ran half the length of the pitch to score a brilliant solo goal against Belgium, but recent results suggest that they can be awkward opponents. Managed by Juan Antonio Pizzi, a former Chile coach, Saudi Arabia lost only 2-1 against Italy at the end of last month and were narrowly beaten by Germany on Friday. An experiment in which nine Saudi players moved to Spain for the second half of the season to gain experience in a more competitive environment never worked, with few getting much game time, but this is the sort of stage – the opening match of a World Cup, in front of a huge global television audience – that should inspire Pizzi’s players. “We are ready, we are not afraid,” the former Spain international said. “Our goal is to beat Russia.” The challenge for Russia, in contrast, is to galvanise a sceptical nation with the victory that would lift some of the gloom that has enveloped the team before a ball has been kicked and give everyone in this vast country a gentle nudge that the greatest sporting event of all is taking place on their doorstep."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/14/mido-doctor-said-continued-lifestyle-die-before-40","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T09:00:42Z","webTitle":"Mido: ‘The doctor said if I continued with my lifestyle I’d die before 40’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/14/mido-doctor-said-continued-lifestyle-die-before-40","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/14/mido-doctor-said-continued-lifestyle-die-before-40","fields":{"headline":"Mido: ‘The doctor said if I continued with my lifestyle I’d die before 40’","bodyText":"Mido has been talking with refreshing candour for an hour, explaining why he predicted Mohamed Salah would be 10 times as good as Raheem Sterling, accepting he was a selfish player who could be difficult to handle, and praising Gareth Southgate for his transformation since the days when he would “panic” as Middlesbrough’s manager, yet the obvious and only place to start is with the Egyptian’s frank admission that he was staring death in the face unless he lost some weight. It is an extraordinary story that resonates even more because Egypt are playing their opening World Cup match on Friday and Mido, who is only 35 years old, could quite feasibly have been lining up alongside Salah against Uruguay. Mido, however, retired from playing five years ago, after briefly falling out of love with football towards the end of a disappointing spell at Barnsley, and although he has rediscovered his affection for the game through coaching, the former Tottenham striker has clearly been through quite an ordeal with his health. “I was 150kg and I reached a point where I couldn’t walk 30 yards,” Mido says. “If I did, I started to feel pain in my back, my joints and my knees. I remember I was getting off my boat in Egypt five months ago – this day is the turning point in my life – and I was walking off on to an island. I had three friends with me and it was 300 yards to the end of the island. The sand was a bit heavy and it was a bit sunny and I said to them: ‘I cannot walk.’ I had to sit for 30 minutes. I was only 34. That was the moment the switch flicked. “Two days later I saw the doctor. He asked me to do blood tests. When I had the results and the doctor started to talk to me, I knew I had to change. He told me that my cholesterol is 320 and that the top of the average is 200. He said I was on the edge of being diabetic. And, to be honest, the doctor told me that if I continue with my lifestyle, there is a more than an 80% chance that I’ll die before I am 40. He told me: ‘You will die.’” It was a sobering wake-up call that Mido had no intention of ignoring. Two weeks ago, he posted an updated photo to his 3.86 million Twitter followers, alongside a message revealing that he had lost a remarkable 37kg in five months. In the same breath, Mido thanked those who had mocked him, with the derogatory comments that had been made on social media giving him extra motivation to get back into shape, so much so that he played in the Fifa legends tournament in Moscow on Tuesday. “I’ve totally transformed my lifestyle,” says Mido, who wants to speak about his story in the hope that he can encourage others with similar problems. “I don’t eat any bad carbs. I don’t eat anything fried at all. And I don’t eat any red meat. I have no salt or sugar. I do general training – swimming, playing squash, playing football, some easy weightlifting. But if I’m putting it in a percentage, it’s 70% what you eat and 30% workouts. If you want to lose weight, it’s what you put in your mouth.” Mido looks and sounds as though he is in a much better place with his life these days and there is certainly no trace of regret that he is working at the World Cup as a pundit rather than playing as a centre-forward, even if he did tweet a tongue-in-cheek message about his weight loss to remind Héctor Cúper, Egypt’s coach, that he averaged a goal every two games for his country. Salah, perhaps not surprisingly, has an even better ratio and Mido has no doubt Egypt’s talisman will be fit to face Uruguay and that the Liverpool forward can handle the pressure that comes with around 96 million people back home pinning their hopes on him. “He’s the kind of guy who says: ‘Come on, even if I have the whole nation on my shoulders, I don’t mind that.’ “He’s a great guy and I think the way he developed as a person, comparing Salah of Chelsea and Salah of Liverpool, is a miracle. I saw him at Chelsea and he was a shy boy. I even said on TV that if he keeps that character, unfortunately he will never be a big player, but that his quality can make it to the top. Three years ago when Liverpool wanted to sign Salah and he went to Chelsea, I went on Twitter and said: ‘Salah is 10 times better than Sterling,’ and people laughed at me. Sterling is a very good player, he’s developed so much under [Pep] Guardiola, but Salah is unbelievable, one of the very few players that if it’s his day, there’s no way to stop him.” Although Mido was never in that category, he played for a distinguished list of clubs, including Ajax, Marseille, Roma and Spurs, and had plenty of talent. The problem, however, tended to be his attitude. “It’s true when I was younger I had some problems with some coaches and I wasn’t an easy boy to handle. I was only thinking of myself. I was selfish. And if it didn’t work for me in one place, the first decision for me was to go somewhere else. “I was difficult. But I believe it’s so unfair to me now that the English media is still putting me in that corner. I never get what I deserve for what I’ve worked so hard for in the last five years to change that.” Mido is referring to his progression into management – he has taken charge of three clubs in Egypt – and his appetite for learning when it comes to coaching. “I’ve changed my attitude in everything I’m doing and I’ve learned from my mistakes. I’ve worked on myself so much to become a good coach and now I’m very well educated. Marcel Desailly, who is working with us at BeIn Sports, convinced me to go to the Welsh coaching programme and said that it was the best thing for me to get a good education. And he wasn’t wrong.” After finishing his ‘A’ licence with the Football Association of Wales, Mido is doing some punditry work while he weighs up a couple of job offers. He loves analysing football for TV but is dismissive when asked if that could be enough for him. “No, no, no. Coaching, once you taste it, you cannot go out of it. Once you get the opportunity to build your own team, to make your own decisions and see your players doing something on the pitch that you have been working on for weeks, this is the best pleasure I have in my life.” Generous with his time, Mido is happy to answer questions on anything and everything, including his thoughts on Southgate, who was his manager at Middlesbrough at a time when he now reflects that his playing career was starting to unravel. “The way I see him talking now, I think that he’s changed a lot because at his first job at Middlesbrough he used to panic big-time during games and at half-time. For me as a player who had played for so many different managers, you could easily see it. If you look at this guy in the dressing room: ‘That’s his first job.’ “But now I see the way that he’s handled Sterling and a lot of other things around the team – I think he learned a lot from working with the FA and working on his badges. He got rushed into the Middlesbrough job and I don’t think that worked in his favour. He wasn’t ready. And I’m sure if you asked Southgate, he would say the same. But I really like what he is doing now.” Asked how he thinks England will fare at the World Cup, Mido talks about how much he enjoys watching Southgate’s team and then turns on his telephone with a smile. “I have predicted every game. I will show it to you,” he says, pulling up a table. “Brazil will beat Germany in the final. England? They lose 2-1 to Poland in the last 16.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/13/california-split-into-three-states-proposal-vote-tim-draper","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T21:42:29Z","webTitle":"Split California into three states? Billionaire's eccentric idea will get a vote","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/13/california-split-into-three-states-proposal-vote-tim-draper","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/13/california-split-into-three-states-proposal-vote-tim-draper","fields":{"headline":"Split California into three states? Billionaire's eccentric idea will get a vote","bodyText":"A proposal by the billionaire venture capitalist and Bitcoin investor Tim Draper to divide California into three separate states will appear on the November 2018 ballot after the “Cal 3” campaign garnered enough signatures for a statewide referendum. Cal 3 is Draper’s latest effort to break up the country’s most populous state. In 2014, he spent $5.2m on a campaign to split the state into six pieces, but failed to qualify for the ballot when only about 750,000 of the 1.14m signatures collected were found to be valid. This time around, Draper cut the number of new states in half, and cleared the requirement for petitioners, reportedly paying canvassers $3 per signature. The three new states would be Northern California, roughly comprising the northern half of the state, including San Francisco, Silicon Valley and Sacramento; Southern California, stretching from Fresno to the US-Mexico border; and California, comprising six coastal counties between Los Angeles and Monterey. “ThreeCAs will give Californians better education, better infrastructure and lower taxes,” Draper said in a statement when he launched the campaign in November. “Three new state governments will be able to start fresh, to innovate and better serve their people.” If approved, the partition would mark the first division of a US state since the pro-union West Virginia broke from secessionist Virginia during the US civil war. But don’t start adding stars to the US flag yet: even if the idea were to win voter approval, it would still have to clear numerous hurdles, including getting approval from the US Congress. “My guess is [voters] will vote this down, and this will all be a waste of time,” said Jim Newton, a lecturer in public policy at the University of California Los Angeles. “But no children or animals will be hurt in the process. It’s a fatuous exercise but it’s not fatal.” It’s not immediately clear what the constituency is for the proposal, beyond the eccentric Draper. An April poll by SurveyUSA found support for the measure among registered voters was just 17%. Draper made his fortune investing in Hotmail and Skype, and made headlines in recent years over his investments in cryptocurrency and staunch support of Theranos and its disgraced founder, Elizabeth Holmes. Draper also runs a school for entrepreneurs called “Draper University of Heroes” and once performed a striptease in honor of the female entrepreneurs in whose companies he has invested. “I don’t think anyone else in the state besides Tim Draper thinks this is a good idea,” said Steven Maviglio, a Democratic political consultant and spokesman for the official opposition campaign, OneCalifornia. “Our only difficulty is getting people to take it seriously ... In this political climate, you have to take everything seriously.” The Cal 3 campaign blames “the Sacramento system of top-down control” for the state’s various ills, and suggests that having state governments “closer to home” will result in better outcomes for education, infrastructure and taxes. “I think it’s actually fairly ludicrous,” said Newton. “Why three states? Why not 30 states? Why not 300? ... Substantively, I don’t think it solves any problems California confronts.” There are also a host of legal obstacles that could stymie the effort. “There’s a lot more than just an initiative that would be required to split California in three parts,” said Eric McGhee, a research fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California. “Even if this were to pass, it would face a real struggle in Congress, or it would be tied up in legal issues in California, or both.” Vikram David Amar, the dean of the University of Illinois College of Law, has suggested that the Draper proposal, which is written as an amendment to the state constitution, may not pass legal muster. “There is a very strong argument that Mr Draper’s proposal would constitute a ‘revision’ to rather than an ‘amendment’ of the California constitution,” he wrote in April. A constitutional revision cannot be placed on the ballot in the same manner as an amendment. Whether Draper has any chance of seeing his dream come true, he has certainly succeeded in making the state’s voters debate his idea, which may stir more debate over California’s referendum process. “We’ve gotten further and further away from the idea that this is a populous or progressive process,” said Newton. “It really is a money process, and anyone with enough money that wants to get something on the ballot can do it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2018/jun/13/uk-university-figures-show-up-to-fivefold-rise-in-first-class-degrees","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T18:40:52Z","webTitle":"UK university figures show up to fivefold rise in first-class degrees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jun/13/uk-university-figures-show-up-to-fivefold-rise-in-first-class-degrees","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/jun/13/uk-university-figures-show-up-to-fivefold-rise-in-first-class-degrees","fields":{"headline":"UK university figures show up to fivefold rise in first-class degrees","bodyText":"British universities have been handing out higher-class degrees at an unprecedented rate over the past decade, according to detailed figures released by the higher education regulator. The figures, from a selection of universities taking part in the government’s latest teaching excellence framework, known as Tef3, show huge variation, with at least one university issuing five times as many first-class degrees last year as it did a decade before. The figures confirm previous signs that universities have been upping the proportion of firsts and upper seconds awarded in recent years, which many within the sector blame on pressure from league tables and from students themselves. The group of 20 universities were required to submit detailed records of degree classifications awarded since 2007, and annually since 2014, in an effort to identify “rigour and stretch” of students at each institution. The figures show that in the 2006-7 academic year at the University of Wolverhampton, 175 students (5% of the total) were awarded first-class degrees. In 2016-17, 973 students (28% of the total) were awarded firsts. More established universities were not immune to the trend. The University of Liverpool, a member of the Russell Group, more than doubled the proportion of students awarded firsts in the same period, from 12% to 27%. In 2016-17, 73% of Liverpool students graduated with either a firsts or 2:1, compared with 61% a decade before. In its submission to the Tef, Liverpool attributed the rise to recruiting more able students through a partnership with a Chinese university. “These are academically the most able students from the Chinese secondary education system, with attainment that places them in the top 1.5% of the Gaokao [school exam], and one-third of them graduate with a first-class degree,” Liverpool said. “XJTLU [Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University] students now account for one-quarter of our graduating cohort and have driven the growth in our overall figures. The increase is not due to inappropriate grade inflation; those subjects where the rate has increased appreciably are those where most of our XJTLU students are based.” Some universities appeared willing to resist the trend. At Warwick University, the proportion of first-class degrees rose from 22% in 2006-7 to 27% a decade later, and the proportion of 2:1s remained the same at 54%. Data from the Higher Education Statistics Agency showed that in 2016-17, 26% of students gained a first-class honours degree from British universities, compared with 18% in 2012-13. Surrey University awarded firsts to 41% of its graduates last year, Oxford 33% and Cambridge 32%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/jun/13/apple-facebook-privacy-data-harvesting-onavo-app-store","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T01:10:14Z","webTitle":"Apple strikes blow to Facebook as it clamps down on data harvesting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/13/apple-facebook-privacy-data-harvesting-onavo-app-store","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jun/13/apple-facebook-privacy-data-harvesting-onavo-app-store","fields":{"headline":"Apple strikes blow to Facebook as it clamps down on data harvesting","bodyText":"Apple has updated its rules to restrict app developers’ ability to harvest data from mobile phones, which could be bad news for a Facebook-owned data security app called Onavo Protect. Onavo ostensibly provides users with a free virtual private network (VPN) which, it claims, helps “keep you and your data safe when you browse and share information on the web”. What is not immediately obvious is that it feeds information to Facebook about what other apps you are using and how much you are using them back to the social networking giant. “The problem with Onavo is that it talks about being a VPN that keeps your data private, but behind the scenes it’s harvesting your data for Facebook,” said Ryan Dochuk, CEO of the paid-for VPN TunnelBear. “It goes against what people generally expect when they use a VPN.” Onavo has been a Trojan horse for Facebook (in the classical sense, not as malware), allowing it to gather intelligence on the apps people use on tens of millions of devices outside its empire. This real-time market research highlights which apps are becoming popular and which are struggling. Such competitive intelligence can inform acquisition targets and negotiations as well as identify popular features it could copy in rival apps. As first reported by Bloomberg, Apple’s new App Store rules explicitly ban the collection of “information about which other apps are installed on a user’s device for the purposes of analytics or advertising/marketing”, which appears to be intentionally worded to clamp down on apps like Onavo. “Apple has been very clear that it’s pro-privacy,” ,” said Joseph Jerome, a privacy specialist from the Center for Democracy and Technology, “and with every iteration of iOS [Apple’s mobile operating system] has been trying to restrain the ability of apps to know what’s going on on the device if a user hasn’t authorised it.” Onavo started life in Tel Aviv in 2010 as a startup that helped people reduce their wireless bills by compressing incoming data on an iPhone or Android device. It also highlighted which apps were using the most data. For mobile publishers, it provided analytics to help them keep track of how their apps were performing against competitors. In May 2013, it launched a VPN called Onavo Protect, which promised to protect people’s data when they were browsing the web from their phone on a public wifi network. Facebook bought the company in October 2013 for an undisclosed sum, estimated to be between $100m and $200m. VPNs work by redirecting and encrypting all data leaving your computer, phone or tablet and sending it to another server in another location. They position themselves as tools for protecting people’s privacy and security, but that very much depends on who is running the VPN and how they make their money. “This server is in a really privileged position,” said Dochuk. “Essentially, it needs 100% of consumer trust because 100% of their data is going through that server.” This means whoever runs the VPN knows which apps are installed on your device and how much you use them; which websites you visit; and your device type and location. There are some VPNs, such as TunnelBear, that cover their server and bandwidth costs through paid subscriptions and others, like Hola and Onavo, that provide a free service to the end user, but extract value from the data they collect or by selling people’s unused bandwidth. “If you’re not paying with your money you are probably paying with your data,” said Will Strafach, a security specialist who has analysed the Onavo app. According to the Wall Street Journal, Facebook employees have put the Onavo data to good use by monitoring the performance of rival Snapchat, particularly after Facebook’s Instagram app launched similar features. Onavo’s data also reportedly helped guide Facebook’s decision to buy WhatsApp for $19bn in 2014 and to clone the popular group video chat app Houseparty. In written questions following CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s congressional testimony in April, lawmakers asked Facebook whether its use of data gleaned from Onavo violated the privacy consumers expect of a VPN. Facebook said that it explained what data it would receive when a user installed the app. “This helps us improve and operate the Onavo service by analysing your use of websites, apps and data,” Onavo Protect’s App Store messaging reads. “Because we’re part of Facebook, we also use this info to improve Facebook products and services, gain insights into the products and services people value, and build better experiences.” Users have to accept these terms before using the app. The company has acknowledged it uses Onavo to monitor competitors, but it insists this is not unusual: “Websites and apps have used market research services for years.” Facebook said it did not connect the app usage data collected through Onavo to the data collected from an individual’s Facebook account. Strafach said it would be easy for Facebook to connect the data if the person also had the Facebook app installed on their phone. “You just have to trust that they are not doing that,” he said. Given Facebook’s recent track record with data privacy, that trust may have slightly eroded."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/13/football-anthony-martial-agent-leave-manchester-united-jose-mourinho","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T22:39:49Z","webTitle":"Anthony Martial wants to leave Manchester United, says agent","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/13/football-anthony-martial-agent-leave-manchester-united-jose-mourinho","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/13/football-anthony-martial-agent-leave-manchester-united-jose-mourinho","fields":{"headline":"Anthony Martial wants to leave Manchester United, says agent","bodyText":"Anthony Martial wants to leave Manchester United, according to his agent. The 22-year-old, who joined United from Monaco for £36m in September 2015, has found life at Old Trafford increasingly frustrating under José Mourinho, with limited opportunities from the bench. The forward was not included in France’s squad for the World Cup having struggled to make much impact at United since Mourinho’s arrival. On Wednesday night, his representative, Philippe Lamboley, insisted that “the time has come” for the player to move on. Lamboley told RMC Sport: “After thinking about all the factors and possibilities, Anthony wants to leave Manchester United. There are lots of factors, and right now it’s too early to talk about them. Manchester United want Anthony to extend his deal and do not want him to leave but we have not reached an agreement for several months. “I think that when Manchester United, the most powerful club in the world, do not find an agreement after eight months of negotiations then they do not really want to keep such an important player in their squad. That’s why this decision has come – it’s a well-thought-out decision. “It’s important to remember that he is under contract and that Manchester United will have the last word. We will respect the club’s decision and he will stick with his commitment to the end. “Anthony is disappointed because he has shown his love for the club and the supporters for three seasons. Without the unconditional support of the fans he would have already asked to leave United. I think he has done his best for three years and it is important to remember that he scored 11 goals and made 10 assists in five months of last season. “Everyone will have their opinion but I think he needs to resume his career.

Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership has been rocked by dozens of Labour MPs breaking ranks to vote either for or against keeping Britain in the European economic area (EEA). Ninety voted, when all the party’s MPs had been whipped to abstain. One frontbencher and five parliamentary aides resigned from the shadow cabinet before the vote. Theresa May, meanwhile, largely succeeded in defeating a string of amendments to her Brexit bill. But she ended the day locked in negotiations with rebel Tories led by Dominic Grieve who want to guarantee that a hard, crash-out Brexit will be impossible without parliamentary approval. They thought they already had that commitment from the PM until No 10 appeared to backpedal. Here is how the votes stacked up on a pivotal day in the Commons. The government is expected to table a compromise amendment today on the “meaningful vote” for parliament, which peers will vote on when the bill returns to the Lords on Monday. In Brussels, a bitter row continues over the Galileo satellite navigation programme. EU member states have voted to shut British companies out of the project despite UK taxpayers having already contributed £1bn towards it. And there is more than a little irony to the news that Jacob Rees-Mogg’s investment firm Somerset Capital Management is warning prospective clients about the financial risks associated with Brexit – when he has repeatedly dismissed such concerns. World Cup 2018: we’ve got it covered Football fans – finally the wait is over. Eight years and $19bn in the making, the 2018 World Cup is upon us.

It all kicks off today with the hosts playing Saudi Arabia in Moscow after Robbie Williams’s soul-selling performance at the opening ceremony. Over the next five weeks the greatest show on Earth will again demonstrate its power to enthral – kicking aside Fifa’s tarnished reputation and the murkiness of Putin’s regime, writes Barney Ronay. The build-up to tonight’s opening ceremony and first match has had its share of drama. Spain’s squad was plunged into crisis after the coach Julen Lopetegui was sacked two days before their opening game against Portugal, with director of football Fernando Hierro named as his replacement. A heady cocktail of anger and ethics was at the heart of the decision, writes Sid Lowe. And Travis Tygart, the US Anti-Doping Agency chief executive, has warned that it would be “naive” not to think that hosts Russia could violate the rules again during the tournament. Strap yourselves in for the kick-off … * * * ‘A tough, smart guy’ – He is not the first western leader to break bread with a tyrant but few could match Donald Trump in waving away the ethical qualms. “So have a lot of other people done some really bad things,” said the US president, when asked about Kim Jong-un’s human rights record. The secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has lost his temper when asked why the statement signed by Trump and Kim in Singapore about disarmament did not contain words such as “verifiable” and “irreversible” that the Trump administration had stuck to doggedly beforehand. “Don’t say silly things,” Pompeo snapped at reporters during a tirade against what he called “insulting and ridiculous and, frankly, ludicrous” questions, despite similar questions being raised by observers and analysts worldwide. * * * What’s in a name? Macedonia’s president has refused to endorse changing the country’s name to the Republic of North Macedonia. In Greece, the government is being threatened with a vote of no confidence after the plan to end a bitter geographical and cultural dispute was attacked on both sides of the border. Officials in Brussels, London and Washington had all enthusiastically welcomed the deal, but for the two parties concerned, any conciliation lasted only a day. Macedonians are supposed to vote on the name change in a referendum this year. * * * ‘Like coming back to life’ – An Italian politician forced to hide from the mafia for years has revealed her face publicly for the first time since 1993. Piera Aiello went into witness protection after mafia hitmen killed her husband in 1991. In March this year she won a parliamentary seat – despite not being able to show her face in public, be photographed or freely hold campaign events in city squares. Aiello often wore a veil and became known as the “faceless candidate”. * * * Biscuit barrel – Are you familiar with the “cookie shot”? It sounds a bit … well, adult film oriented to be frank.

Lunchtime read: A year after Grenfell, where do we stand? It is a year today since the Grenfell Tower fire. Eleven housing blocks have new cladding, out of more than 300 that need their flammable panels replaced. Almost 1,000 adults have been screened for PTSD, while psychologists continue to work with affected children at seven state schools. Fifteen Grenfell households are still living in hotels. The public inquiry continues. And, in perhaps the most startling fact rounded up by Robert Booth and Owen Bowcott, combustible cladding remains on sale in Britain. Sport England won the first one-day international against Australia by three wickets but they did so messily, in a manner hardly befitting the side ranked No 1 in the world. Afterwards, Australia’s former coach Darren Lehmann staked out the moral high ground after some wiseacre investment company tried to stoke things up by handing out squares of sandpaper outside the ground. In the women’s game, New Zealand’s Amelia Kerr hit a world record 232 not out in the third one-day international against Ireland and then took five wickets to complete a remarkable day for the 17-year-old. The US Open gets under way today with Americans seeking to maintain a run in which they hold every men’s major and significant transatlantic team trophy. Anthony Martial wants to leave Manchester United, according to his agent. And one of the most anticipated fights of the year appears to be back on after it was announced Canelo Álvarez will fight Gennady Golovkin on 15 September. Business The decision by the US Federal Reserve to raise its base rate to 2% helped send Asian shares down overnight. The move was telegraphed for several months so there was more concern among investors about chairman Jerome Powell’s concerns regarding deteriorating trade relations between the US and Europe and Asia.

The papers The Guardian has Brexit on the front page – “New fissure with EU as Britain blocked from security project” – as well as a feature about life a year after the Grenfell tragedy. The Mail wonders what Tory MP Dominic Grieve is doing addressing a meeting of people allegedly plotting to reverse Brexit, under the headline “Conspiracy in Smith Square”. “Web giants ‘are fuelling child mental health crisis’,” says the Times, quoting the head of the NHS. By the Briefing’s count this is the third separate front-page story this week about the impact of the internet on children. The Telegraph also has the NHS chief’s comments on the front but leads with Sajid Javid relaxing the visa cap: “Doors open to thousands more skilled migrants.” The Sun splashes with “Brit held over jet secrets to China”, saying a former “Rolls-Royce boffin” has been arrested based on MI5 intelligence. “Trapped in hospital for six months” is the splash in the Express – it says the NHS will not allow a terminally ill pensioner home because it does not want to pay for carers.

Then came the recession, the street demonstrations, the endless graft scandals, the divisive impeachment of the leftist president Dilma Rousseff and, more recently, a debilitating national truckers’ strike during which protesters waving Brazilian flags called for a military coup. Nowadays, Brazilians are no longer as proud of their country or their team – to the point that some fans will wear red when Brazil line up for the first game against Switzerland – while others are even going so far as to root for arch-rivals Argentina. One street in a working-class neighbourhood in Teresina, in the north-eastern state of Piauí has even been painted in the light blue and white of Messi’s team – the equivalent of a Halifax road being decorated in Germany’s white, black, red and yellow. The colours were the idea of Raimundo Pereira Júnior, 35, who talked his neighbours into contributing £5 each to daub 8 Street with Argentina’s colours. He said that he and his neighbours are supporting Argentina – a country he has never visited – to express their disgust over failing public services and corruption. “The country is broken. It is an embarrassment. I am ashamed to live here in Brazil today,” he said. Such revulsion is a sign of the rising discontent and disillusionment. Even in the dark days of the military dictatorship, which ruled from 1964-1985, leftwing guerrillas suffering torture in prison rooted for Brazil in the 1970 World Cup, according to Rousseff, a former member of the armed resistance, who told the story four years ago while trying to fire up enthusiasm for the previous tournament, which Brazil hosted. After a slow start, Brazilians got behind their team that time around – but a humiliating 7-1 thrashing by Germany in the semi-final left deep scars on the national psyche. “Nobody swallowed the 7-1,” said Pereira Júnior. And since then the country has staggered from one crisis to another. In 2016, Rousseff was impeached after huge street demonstrations by middle-class Brazilians angry about rampant graft who wore canary yellow and green team shirts. Many see her removal as a coup by any other name and leftists have sworn off the national colours. “They have taken the green and yellow of Brazil and I will not wear it any more,” said Angela de Siqueira, 62, a retired university professor in Rio de Janeiro who used wear a team shirt to watch Brazil games – but this year doesn’t even have a copy of the match schedule. In April Luísa Cardoso, 26, an architect and designer from Uberlândia in Minas Gerais state started selling a red version of the Brazil shirt emblazoned with the hammer and sickle – but the Brazilian Football Federation, the CBF, warned her off using its logo. That turned out to be a blessing, because the CBF has faced more graft scandals than many troubled Brazilian institutions. Last December its former president José Maria Marin was convicted of racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering and is awaiting sentencing in a US jail. In April his successor, Marco Polo Del Nero, was banned for life by Fifa for taking bribes, fined 1m Swiss francs and lost his job. Consquently, said Cardoso, “many people said they prefer the new shirt without the CBF symbol.” Some of her townsfolk are even opting for the green shirt of fourth division Uberlândia Esporte Club. But Cardoso will still support her home country. “I will cheer for Brazil and after they are out, I will cheer for Argentina,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/13/england-australia-first-odi-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T22:39:00Z","webTitle":"Eoin Morgan steers England to ODI win after Moeen puts Australia in a spin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/13/england-australia-first-odi-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/13/england-australia-first-odi-report","fields":{"headline":"Eoin Morgan steers England to ODI win after Moeen puts Australia in a spin","bodyText":"England won the first one-day international against Australia by three wickets. But they did so messily, in a manner hardly befitting the side ranked No 1 in the world. Had they lost this match England would have lost their position at the top of the ICC’s one-day perch and no one could have quibbled about that. The Australians were tigerish in the field but they were defending an inadequate total. Too often England’s batsmen were wanton, as if taking the win for granted. It may be time for a word from those in charge – an “honest discussion” is the modern description. The Australians behaved impeccably but they did not bat very well. With the exception of Glenn Maxwell their batsmen succumbed meekly against the bowling attack hammered by the Scots four days earlier. England’s spinners, Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid, did most of the damage, sharing five wickets as Australia were bowled out for 214. That total could have been worse. In fact it was one more run than Australia scored in arguably the greatest 50-over game of all, the semi-final of the 1999 World Cup at Edgbaston when the match was tied, which allowed Steve Waugh’s side to progress to the final rather than South Africa. On that occasion the bowlers who prevailed in a low-scoring match were Shaun Pollock, Allan Donald and Shane Warne. That calibre of bowler was not on view here and the game has changed a lot since then. A total of 214 has become a paltry one in 50-over cricket, one which makes thousands of punters feel slightly betrayed at the absence of a contest. And it appears that for too many of England’s batsmen it is not a target that warrants serious consideration. Only Joe Root and Eoin Morgan appeared to take the contrary view that this was a task, however menial, that required some application. The ticket touts were out in force outside Oval tube station beforehand but the value for money was better in Edinburgh. Most of the fans were in place in time for the crucial handshakes just before the start of play. At least the players did not hang around too long when performing this gesture. It did not take 12 seconds for all of them to get this odd ritual out of the way. Once the game started David Willey did not have to work too hard for the initial breakthrough. A very wide swinging half volley was edged by Travis Head and the ball ballooned gently to Jonny Bairstow at first slip. Thereafter 40 easy runs were crunched against the pacemen and there was the expectation of a runfest from Aaron Finch and Shaun Marsh. Both looked in fine fettle until the introduction of Moeen. Morgan gave his off-spinner the ninth over, which can be a teaser for the batsmen. It was a worthwhile ploy. In his first over Finch was trying to drive with an inside-out swing of the bat in pursuit of a boundary but the outcome was only a gentle catch to backward point. Marsh soon fell in a more classical manner as the ball turned sufficiently to beat his outside edge. Moeen’s third wicket was the Australia captain, Tim Paine. The bowler removed his first slip so to the next delivery Paine opted to reverse sweep; instead of mischievously trickling through the vacant slip area the ball ended up in the hands of Mark Wood at backward point. So Australia were stumbling at 70 for four, which soon became 90 for five when Marcus Stoinis was caught behind, trying to cut a delivery from Rashid, who had embarked on one of his more frugal spells for England. Maxwell, with discreet support from Ashton Agar, forged a minor recovery, the pair adding 84 in 17 overs. Even Maxwell recognised a grave situation and reined himself in, though he did treat himself to 14 runs from Moeen’s final over, hitting an effortless six over mid-off with the ease of a golfer who had decided to give the ball a hint of fade. But on 62 he was caught on the square-leg boundary by Bairstow and the chances of Australia posting a decent target disappeared. The blasters at the top of the order had all disappeared within eight overs when England took to the crease. Jason Roy was bowled off the inside edge by the second delivery he faced from the beanpole Billy Stanlake; Alex Hales was lbw to Michael Neser. Bairstow hit six boundaries, five of them racing from the middle of his bat, to confirm that he is in princely form, but he could not capitalise. A pull shot fizzed from his bat straight into the hands of Head on the rope at square leg. Morgan and Root managed to restore the situation with no apparent difficulty, with the white-ball captain scoring faster and striking the boundaries. Meanwhile Root was content to bat with restraint, a rare event in this England side. Then there was another surprising flurry of wickets. Morgan was caught behind off the cunning Andrew Tye, whose pace variations caused considerable confusion. Jos Buttler’s mind seemed elsewhere; he was off the mark with a lofted drive; a top-edged catch was dropped by Paine and then he was duped by Tye’s knuckle ball and caught at mid-on. In the next over Root was caught behind off Stanlake with 52 runs still required. Moeen holed out to square leg. But Willey, forsaking the notion of getting ’em in singles, swatted enough boundaries to see a relieved England home."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/14/usa-world-cup-2018-2026-soccer-in-america","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T09:00:43Z","webTitle":"The 2026 World Cup is scant silver lining as US fans watch Russia 2018","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/14/usa-world-cup-2018-2026-soccer-in-america","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/14/usa-world-cup-2018-2026-soccer-in-america","fields":{"headline":"The 2026 World Cup is scant silver lining as US fans watch Russia 2018","bodyText":"US soccer received a much-needed jolt of positivity on Wednesday, when it was awarded the bid to co-host the 2026 World Cup with neighbors Mexico and Canada. But that fleeting high will come with a Thursday morning hangover when this year’s tournament kicks off, and the greater significance of what happened to the US in their failed campaign to qualify for Russia 2018 begins to truly, finally sink in. The 2026 World Cup will bring welcome publicity and interest in soccer in the US but in the present day US Soccer does not appear to have entirely grappled with the long-term ramifications of missing out on Russia. Most of the players involved in the Calamity in Couva, when a loss to Trinidad &amp; Tobago doomed the US campaign, have described the experience as a waking bad dream. “The main thought that goes through your head is shock,” says midfielder Dax McCarty, who was on the bench that night. “Being a part of it, you almost have a feeling of helplessness. You’re just hoping, praying, that something, anything goes your way. When the final whistle blows, it’s a feeling of shock and awe.” The knock-on effects of the letdown continue to reverberate even up to now. The Guardian spoke to two bars in the soccer strongholds of Portland and Seattle who estimated that they will lose something like $20,000 in revenue on days on which the USMNT would have played. Elsewhere, FourFourTwo scaled back its US operation a few months later, citing advertisers who pulled out after the Trinidad loss, putting several of the country’s best soccer journalists out of work. The World Cup remains the only time soccer is front and center of the mainstream American sporting consciousness. There are one-offs, here and there. The Champions League, for example, has gained in relevance in recent years. Major League Soccer continues to improve, and crowds continue to grow even if television rankings remain comparatively stagnant. Every four years, however, the World Cup thrusts the game toward the very top of the news cycle. Players pose for magazine covers beforehand and make the late-night talkshow circuit in the aftermath. Bars fill to standing-room-only even for games the US are almost certain to lose. That shared, communal experience is impossible to replicate. Ask American soccer diehards to date the beginning of their fandom, and most will reference a World Cup year —from the 1994 edition on home soil to the USMNT’s underdog run to the quarter-finals in South Korea in 2002. All of those possibilities for connecting with new fans vanished in an instant with the 2018 qualification debacle. Despite the World Cup setback, those within the soccer bubble have mostly played down and waved off concerns about negative long-term implications. Prior to last year’s MLS Cup final, just a few months after the loss in Trinidad and at his annual State of the League address, Commissioner Don Garber insisted that the sport remains on the rise in the US. Garber pointed to increased investment in the domestic league, the gains made in player development, and soccer’s rising popularity among millennials. Garber’s not wrong, per se, but it’s also undeniable that the league has benefitted from the USMNT’s regular World Cup appearances. It is impossible to separate MLS’s gains from those casual fans being introduced to the sport every four years. The players, at least, realize that Trinidad &amp; Tobago 2-1 United States will forever be the first line of their respective career epitaphs. For a group that likes to refer to itself as a brotherhood and which has taken pride in results that have outpaced their collective talent levels over the years, to have been the first team to fall short in 32 years has been devastating. Midfielder Benny Feilhaber recalls the silence in the locker room afterward the Trinidad game, how Arena was the only one who spoke. “’Obviously, there’s not much to talk about,’” Feilhaber recalls Arena saying. “’We didn’t get it done. That’s it.’ It was up to everybody to deal with the fact that they were part of this massive failure.” The powers that be seem to have escaped a similar self-reckoning. During the US federation’s election this past February, it was president Sunil Gulati’s long-time No2, Carlos Cordiero, who was voted in to replace him, rather than any of the self-described “change” candidates such as Kyle Martino, Eric Wynalda and Hope Solo. Despite the fanfare about the new general manager position, it went unfilled for months before the hiring of Earnie Stewart from the Philadelphia Union. It remains unclear, however, whether the role is going to hold enough power to actually bring about meaningful change – that the process to fill the position took so long, and that so many of the leading minds within MLS shied away, hint that it does not. “Whatever we’ve been doing hasn’t panned out the way that we, as Americans, expect,” former USMNT defender Brad Evans said. “We always think that we’re the best at everything, and that we deserve the best in everything. We have money. Why are we not the best? That’s the mentality through every single sport. I think it’s hard for us to grasp that what we’re doing isn’t right.” Even after Trinidad, the single most traumatizing night in the modern history of the United States men’s national team, it’s unclear whether the federation has still totally grasped Evans’s point. There are those who think that any kind of drastic change would be rash, and unwise. Soccer has been on an upward trajectory for years now – why completely shift course? “You don’t make wholesale changes based on the ball being two inches wide or two inches in,” said Gulati after Trinidad, referencing a Clint Dempsey shot that hit the post in the final qualifier and could have saved the day. That argument may ultimately be proved right. It may also merely keep the federation on track for another, unseen and even more traumatizing reckoning further on down the line. Regardless, it’ll be of little consolation to the millions of American sports fans who tune into the World Cup this month and flip channels in bewilderment looking for the USMNT. And it means that the loss in Trinidad has no silver lining, that the promise of change that sustained some in the aftermath will be unrealized, and that the hollow pit in the stomach of American soccer fans this summer will have no useful purpose moving forward."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/13/mps-condemn-home-office-deportation-threats-over-taxes","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T18:14:45Z","webTitle":"MPs condemn Home Office deportation threats over taxes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/13/mps-condemn-home-office-deportation-threats-over-taxes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/13/mps-condemn-home-office-deportation-threats-over-taxes","fields":{"headline":"MPs condemn Home Office deportation threats over taxes","bodyText":"Caroline Nokes, the immigration minister, has been accused by MPs of either not having a grip on her department or being recklessly incompetent for allowing the use of counter-terrorism powers to force the removal of highly skilled migrants from the UK over their taxes. In a Westminster Hall debate called by the SNP’s Alison Thewliss, MPs spoke about constituents including teachers, doctors, lawyers and engineers who are facing expulsion from the UK under paragraph 322(5) of the immigration rules for making minor and legal amendments to their tax records. “This is highly inappropriate … regimented, calculated decision-making,” said Thewliss, the MP for Glasgow Central. “None of those whom I have spoken to have any issues which would cause them to be considered a threat to national security. “A substantial number of refusals appear to be predicated on nothing more than the individual making an honest mistake – and as far as HMRC are concerned, when the correction has been made, the case is closed. Some of the sums involved in these corrections are only a few pounds, and often this was several years ago.” There are believed to be at least 1,000 people, some of them working in professions listed by the government as facing shortages, who are fighting removal under the controversial paragraph. “It seems odd to me that HMRC could be satisfied but that the Home Office should treat the same behaviour as being akin to deception at the least and terrorism at worst,” Thewliss said. “The Home Office should consider carefully the impact of their target-driven culture on the wider economy, especially given the uncertainty of Brexit.” The Lib Dem MP Ed Davey said a number of his constituents had been forced into destitution by the paragraph, and the Home Office’s decisions around taxes were so “nonsensical” that it should be stripped of these powers. “They don’t have any idea,” he said. Stephen Doughty, a Labour member of the home affairs select committee, which has repeatedly questioned the Home Office about its use of paragraph 322(5), said: “What this scandal shows is a widespread, systematic problem in the Home Office. It shows the ministers do not have a grip on their department.” Another Labour MP, Lyn Brown, said a heavily pregnant constituent had been told to pay a £9,000 NHS bill or face removal from her GP list after being served with a 322(5). Brown said the Home Office was guilty of “bad and disgusting treatment” of highly skilled migrants. “It’s hard to look at these cases and not conclude that the government is chasing arbitrary immigration targets without a sense of decency,” she said. Labour’s Stephen Timms referred to a recent admission by the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt that he had forgotten to declare luxury flats he owns to HMRC. Hunt was given no sanction after dismissing the omission as an “honest administrative error”. Timms said: “We can’t have one rule for cabinet ministers and affluent people and a completely different set of rules for our constituents.” Nokes said the first phase of a review of the issue had looked at 281 uses of 322(5) and found it had been used correctly in all cases. The second phase, assessing a further 1,671 cases, will be concluded shortly. She failed to respond to MPs’ demands that the Home Office restore the right to work, use the NHS and rent property to those refused a visa under 322(5), and to pay compensation for loss of earnings. The paragraph in question gives the Home Office the discretionary right to deport migrants “in the light of his conduct … character or associations or the fact that he represents a threat to national security”. It mentions nothing about taxes. Instead, the examples it lists are linked to terrorism, war crimes and repeated, deliberate and serious criminality. After the Guardian highlighted numerous cases in which the power was being misused, the Home Office promised a pause in its use of 322(5) pending the conclusions of the review. On Monday it was revealed that highly skilled migrants were still being dragged through the courts in what MPs said “smacked of a government department unjustly and incorrectly misusing a draconian power” and “shamelessly ruining innocent people’s lives”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/jun/13/wpp-chair-suggests-execs-done-little-else-placate-martin-sorrell","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T18:24:24Z","webTitle":"WPP chair suggests execs have done little else but placate Sorrell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jun/13/wpp-chair-suggests-execs-done-little-else-placate-martin-sorrell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jun/13/wpp-chair-suggests-execs-done-little-else-placate-martin-sorrell","fields":{"headline":"WPP chair suggests execs have done little else but placate Sorrell","bodyText":"By WPP’s standards, a 29.5% vote against the remuneration report almost counts as a decent result for the board. Back in 2012, the figure was 60%. In 2016, when the former chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell scooped his £70m, it was 34%. This time the issue was how on earth Sorrell could be entitled to up to £20m-worth of share awards after departing in circumstances WPP refuses to explain, citing legal restrictions. So, yes, the chairman, Roberto Quarta, will be relieved. A 30%-ish protest, on a resolution that would have obliged WPP to do nothing formally anyway, is not so bad for him. Quarta did, though, offer a glimpse into life inside the boardroom in recent years. It almost sounded as if the directors have done little else but dance around Sorrell’s sensitivities over pay and perks. Pay, said Quarta after Wednesday’s shareholder meeting, was “the most important thing on the agenda from shareholders” when he became chairman in 2015. There had already been one downwards adjustment to Sorrell’s rewards and the “spousal travel allowance” had been cut. Quarta was now expected to deliver another reduction in rewards while “wanting to ensure Martin did not throw his toys out of the pram”, as he put it. The task is semi-achieved but the effort seems to have exhausted the board. As Quarta admitted, WPP never got round to asking Sorrell to sign a conventional employment contract in place of the unorthodox “at will” arrangement that had somehow survived from 2008. Critically, the absence of a non-compete clause has allowed the founder to found a rival startup within two months of departing – something that may or may not become a medium-term headache for WPP. The company can insist Sorrell respects confidentiality clauses, but obviously cannot control clients’ choice of agency. The contract was “something we were working on”, said Quarta, weakly. Working on – or trying to summon the courage? Questions remain for FRC The Financial Reporting Council, the audit watchdog, has seemingly awoken from its slumbers. This month it gave itself new powers to increase penalties against big auditing firms, and now it has used them. PricewaterhouseCoopers has been hit for a record £6.5m for its work on the accounts of BHS and Taveta Group, and Steve Denison, the relevant PwC partner, is facing a 15-year ban from the audit industry. Everybody happy? Of course not. The need for the “root and branch” review of the FRC that is currently being conducted by Sir John Kingman, the chair of the insurer Legal &amp; General, looks as clear as ever – and not just to address the suspicion that the FRC is too close to the firms it regulates. The PwC-BHS case does not answer the separate criticism about the speed at which the FRC works. The BHS accounts under the microscope were for 2014 and FRC took two years to get from opening its investigation to concluding it, despite PwC making a “very early admission” of serious shortcomings. Nor has the watchdog explained how it reached its decision. Nor do we know if the FRC’s idea of a big fine is sufficient to serve as real encouragement to better standards. The effective ban on Denison carrying out audit work will sting the individual, but the £6.5m penalty on PwC is equivalent to a mere 0.8% of its UK profits last year of £822m. PwC notes that the audit failings did not contribute to BHS’s collapse a year later. On the other hand, it confesses its audit methodology “simply was not followed” and it is being told by the FRC to do what sounds like basic stuff: ensure that the checking process for “high-risk or high-profile” private businesses matches the one that applies to listed companies. Why didn’t the FRC insist on such a process previously? There remains much for Kingman to chew on. Soames does his sums Rule one for bosses appearing in front of select committees is to be prepared to be asked about your pay packet. It’s amazing how many arrive unprepared and thus look evasive. The rule applies doubly when the committee is the public accounts committee, which is usually dealing with matters relating to public money, in this case the government’s approach to outsourcing. Rupert Soames, the chief executive of Serco, showed how to do it on Wednesday. He flourished his P60 and read the figures: “Last year I was paid £2,312,174 on which I paid tax of £1,037,851.” Chief executives take note: candour is not hard and the effect was disarming."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/13/interest-rates-federal-reserve-raises-us-again","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T19:27:29Z","webTitle":"Federal Reserve raises US interest rates again amid trade relations fears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/13/interest-rates-federal-reserve-raises-us-again","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/13/interest-rates-federal-reserve-raises-us-again","fields":{"headline":"Federal Reserve raises US interest rates again amid trade relations fears","bodyText":"The Federal Reserve raised US interest rates again on Wednesday, the seventh increase since 2015 when the central bank resumed raising rates after the last recession. The Fed move came after a two-day meeting where its members discussed the robust state of the US economy and the potential impact of a trade war amid rising tension between the US and its largest trading partners. Announcing the decision to increase its target for the fed-funds rate to a range of 1.75% to 2%, the Fed described the US jobs market as “strong” and said economic activity had been rising at “a solid rate”. At a press conference the Fed chair, Jay Powell, said that concerns over deteriorating trade relations were mounting among US executives but added: “Right now we really don’t see that in the numbers at all.” US unemployment dropped to 3.8% in May, its lowest level since April 2000 and one of the lowest levels since the second world war. More increases are expected this year but the Fed noted “readings on financial and international developments” would factor into its decisions on future increases. The US has now added jobs every month for 92 consecutive months and wages, which have stagnated since the recession, have begun to rise moderately. At the same time stock markets remain close to record highs and inflation has accelerated. The labor department reported on Tuesday, just as the Fed was meeting, that the consumer price index had risen by 2.8% from a year earlier, the biggest annual gain since February 2012. The Fed’s twin mandate is to bolster employment while controlling inflation, and in the current environment more rate rises appear inevitable. The Fed has indicated that it is likely to raise rates three or four more times this year. Against this background, however, Fed officials are closely watching the escalating tensions between the US, Canada, China, the EU and Mexico over trade. So far stock markets have shrugged off strong rhetoric from both sides about threats of retaliatory action following the Trump administration’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium. Last week’s G7 summit of world leaders in Canada ended in acrimony after Trump officials said Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, had “stabbed us in the back” after he told a press conference Canada would “move forward with retaliatory measures” in response to the Trump administration’s move to impose tariffs on aluminium and steel. As early as this week the Trump administration is expected to unveil $50bn worth of tariffs on Chinese goods – a move that Beijing has also warned will be met with retaliatory action."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jun/17/spencer-tunick-woolworths-relents-and-allows-mass-nude-photo-on-car-park","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T02:44:59Z","webTitle":"Spencer Tunick: Woolworths relents and allows mass nude photo on car park","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/17/spencer-tunick-woolworths-relents-and-allows-mass-nude-photo-on-car-park","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/17/spencer-tunick-woolworths-relents-and-allows-mass-nude-photo-on-car-park","fields":{"headline":"Spencer Tunick: Woolworths relents and allows mass nude photo on car park","bodyText":"A US artist best known for his large-scale nude photo shoots says he is relieved that the Australian supermarket chain Woolworths will now allow him to use one of its rooftop car parks for his next project, because the layout of Melbourne’s tramlines meant there was “no plan B”. Spencer Tunick is travelling to Australia in July where he will take part in Melbourne’s Provocare Festival of the Arts. He had been commissioned by the festival to do a work within the precinct of Chapel Street, a main street known for upmarket fashion stores and restaurants, and which runs through the south-east suburbs of South Yarra, Prahran and Windsor. Tunick’s plan to photograph about 350 naked people on the rooftop carpark of Woolworths in Prahran was temporarily thwarted after the supermarket declined him access. The number of people involved means that Tunick will also need to get up high to take the photograph and capture the scene. “I tried for three full days to scour the Chapel Street district and I couldn’t find any place large enough to fit so many people, and all of the trolley [tram] wires meant there was no other place safe enough to use,” he told Guardian Australia on Sunday. “I’m very happy and lucky that Woolworths is now allowing me to go ahead with this art event for the people of Melbourne, because there was no plan B.” He said the supermarket came around to the idea after a less busy day of the week was proposed. In a statement a Woolworths spokesperson said Tunick would have access to the car park for one hour on a Monday morning. It followed an online petition protesting against the supermarket’s original decision. “It’s a good outcome that will allow Spencer Tunick to profile the Chapel Street precinct on the world stage without compromising the ability of our customers to access the store, in an easy and convenient manner,” the spokesperson said. Tunick said an hour would be plenty of time. “You know, an hour is a long time for people to be naked in cold weather,” he said. “Some of my best works in New York were made in under 15 minutes and with the threat of arrest.” About 11,000 people have registered to take part in the shoot. Successful applicants will be notified. Tunick said he did not want to give too much away about what he planned to do with participants on the rooftop. “We are now still waiting for confirmation on other aspects of the art installation but those aspects don’t require permissions,” he said. The shoot will take place on 9 July."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/16/us-open-phil-mickelson-loses-plot-justin-rose-in-contention","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T23:52:25Z","webTitle":"Phil Mickelson loses the plot as Justin Rose stays in contention","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/16/us-open-phil-mickelson-loses-plot-justin-rose-in-contention","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/16/us-open-phil-mickelson-loses-plot-justin-rose-in-contention","fields":{"headline":"Phil Mickelson loses the plot as Justin Rose stays in contention","bodyText":"The US Open could trademark its recurring and spectacular brand of chaos. Nobody does it better. On a day in which Dustin Johnson sampled this major’s evil side, Phil Mickelson triggered shockwaves throughout the golfing world. Mickelson’s turbulent relationship with his professional nemesis took its latest and most extraordinary twist as he deliberately rehit his own putt when rolling rapidly past the hole on the 13th green at Shinnecock Hills. This was quite the 48th birthday. The offence, which led to calls for disqualification, was widely interpreted as a Mickelson protest at the United States Golf Association’s setup of the course. The man himself denied such a theory, even if Zach Johnson stepped forward to lacerate tournament organisers. As the leaders grasped desperately for air, it appeared Johnson had a point. “They’ve lost the course,” said the two-times major champion. In what represented an ominous throwback to the 2004 US Open here, perfectly good approach shots failed to stick on greens and putts reacted as if on glass. The Mickelson drama and Johnson broadside came on a day where Dustin Johnson’s earlier tight grip on the tournament he had headed by four was significantly loosened courtesy of a front nine of 41. The world No 1 had steadied himself before three-putting the 18th; his 77 means a 54-hole, four-way tie for the lead at three over par alongside his American compatriots Brooks Koepka, Tiny Finau and Daniel Berger. Justin Rose was three over for the day but the 2013 champion gained four shots on the lead, to be one behind the quartet. The brutality was illustrated by only three members of the field breaking par. Finau and Berger made morning 66s; they rose through the field at great pace from the comfort of their hotel rooms. Rose’s 73 left him a shot ahead of Henrik Stenson. Wide open? You bet. Mickelson, who requires victory at his national open to complete a career grand slam, had virtually no chance of such glory when taking to the hole he was to render infamous. He was four over par for the day and plus 10 for the tournament. Nobody could reasonably have predicted what happened next. Mickelson rattled his fourth shot, a curling 18ft putt, well past the cup. Before the ball could come to a standstill – it was still gathering pace on a slope – Mickelson chased after it and struck it back towards the cup. Had Mickelson not intervened, the ball would have rolled back off the green. His score was deduced as a 10, including two-stroke penalty. Tournament officials instead insisted that rule 14-5, which relates to playing a moving ball as opposed to stopping or deflecting it, covered the issue entirely. Others called foul. “I would have lobbied for a disqualification,” said David Fay, a former executive director of the USGA. Mickelson was blissfully at ease with his own actions. The harsh truth is he had brought the second major of 2018 into disrepute. After signing for an 81, Mickelson openly admitted he broke the rule wilfully. “I don’t mean to disrespect anybody, I know it is a two-shot penalty. At that time, I just didn’t feel like going back and forth, hitting the same shot over. I took the two shots and moved on. “It’s my understanding of the rules. I’ve had multiple times where I have wanted to do that, I just finally did it. “I would gladly take the two shots over continuing that display. I don’t mean any disrespect to anyone and if that’s the way it was taken, I apologise to them. Sometimes in these situations it is just easier to take the two shots and move on.” Mickelson disdain for the way the USGA configure courses has been easy to infer for a number of years. On this occasion, Mickelson opted not to publicly lambast the pin placement on the 13th. “Everybody has got to play it so I am not saying that either way,” he added. “I was playing it worse than most and wanted to get to the next hole eventually, which I did.” Andrew “Beef” Johnston, who was playing in Mickelson’s company, didn’t quite know what to make of it all. “I looked at him and was like: ‘Is this actually happening?’” said the Englishman. “I said to him: ‘Sorry but I can’t help but laugh at that, it’s one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen.’ I’ve never seen anything like it.” Zach Johnson, who posted 72 in the group immediately behind Mickelson, delivered his volley long before the principal protagonists were reduced to quivering wrecks. “When you have a championship that comes down to sheer luck, that’s not right,” he said. “Shinnecock Hills is beautiful but unfortunately they’ve lost the golf course.” Stenson swore on a live television interview when venting his frustration. Few could blame him. The US Open should carry a health warning."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/16/tite-brazil-switzerland-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T22:47:31Z","webTitle":"Tite and Brazil at peace with pressure to win before Switzerland opener | David Hytner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/16/tite-brazil-switzerland-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/16/tite-brazil-switzerland-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Tite and Brazil at peace with pressure to win before Switzerland opener","bodyText":"For a section of the Brazilian media here Tite’s novel policy of rotating the Seleção captaincy from game to game, in an effort to promote collective leadership, raises the obvious question: who gets the gig in the final and lifts the World Cup trophy? At the last tournament in Brazil the then manager, Luiz Felipe Scolari, had talked about “seven steps to heaven”. His team, notoriously, would descend into hell after step six – the 7-1 humbling against Germany, which has hung over them ever since. The exorcism will be possible only if Brazil can go all the way in Russia and there is no doubt that failure is not exactly on the press agenda at present. A nation does not expect, it assumes and, given the way Tite has re-energised the set-up, who can blame them? The pressure is excruciating and, when Tite faced the media on the eve of Sunday’s Group E opener against Switzerland, it seemed revealing that he was asked whether he was on any medication to help him sleep. His response – part humour, part conviction – reflected his comfort and it extends to the trappings of Brazil’s tag of favourites. They are here to win it and Tite is not afraid to say so. “As somebody who has been through eight or nine surgeries, I take no drugs,” he said. “I try to manage my ghosts, my angst, my human side. Yes, there is this expectation. I just try to focus on what matters. “The work we have done gives us the expectation but also a lot of inner peace. We have been building up to this for some time. Winning is a dream and my focus is totally geared to that. It feels like the world is looking at us but we want to be natural on the pitch, like we have been in all the games.” Tite has given the captaincy to Marcelo for the Switzerland tie and, with Dani Alves out injured, it appears that he will continue to pass the armband around. He had previously indicated that Alves, who has captained the team the most during his tenure, would assume the responsibility in Russia. Each member of Tite’s likely XI against Switzerland has captained the team, even the 21-year-old striker Gabriel Jesus. Marcelo, one of only six survivors from the last World Cup, radiated confidence, particularly when asked about the 7-1. “There is no longer any trauma,” Marcelo said. “If there was, I wouldn’t be playing any more. I would have retired. Of course, I wish it were different but there is no trauma. I always look for new goals and this World Cup is another challenge. “The captaincy is something that I like. When you are a kid playing on the beach, you dream of representing the national team and now I have the opportunity to be captain at a World Cup. Money cannot buy this feeling. In the group everybody contributes but I am 30 and, of course, you gain experience.” In the numbers game that can colour match previews Tite can point to having suffered defeat only once in his 21 matches in charge – against Argentina in a friendly. There have been 17 wins. But there is another detail that seems to have slipped under the radar. It comes from the Switzerland side and it is the one that shows them in sixth position in the Fifa world rankings, looking down on France and Spain, among others. How the world governing body gets to its master-list is often questioned and mocked but do not tell the Swiss they do not deserve their status. “We have worked hard to have this ranking,” Stephan Lichtsteiner, the captain, said. Before the Brazil game it underpins the quiet confidence that has built around their camp. Vladimir Petkovic’s team are set up to pass and pass – everything goes through the midfield fulcrum Granit Xhaka – and there was the statistic from Euro 2016, when Switzerland reached the last 16, that showed they had enjoyed more possession than their opponents in every game, even against France in the final group tie, which finished 0-0. Switzerland have the utmost respect for Brazil and it was a snappy soundbite when Lichtsteiner said that Neymar, whom Tite revealed was not yet 100% fit after ankle and metatarsal damage, was “practically impossible to neutralise completely over 90 minutes”. The right-back is set for a direct confrontation with Brazil’s brightest star. “He is probably the best and most complete player in that position in the world,” Lichtsteiner added. But he returned with a measure of swiftness to Switzerland’s pre-match message – they are hellbent on showcasing their own game. “It’s about us imposing ourselves and using our full-backs to get forward,” Lichtsteiner said. “We have to be cohesive as a team and close the gaps when we confront players like Neymar.” Petkovic mentioned how his team’s mentality had grown during his four years in charge. They have lost only once in their previous 22 matches, winning 16 of them. “I always focus on our way of playing,” he said. “We will try to dominate and win. We are not here to make a lovely match against Brazil but to win it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2018/jun/16/glasgow-school-of-art-fire-witnesses-shock-disbelief","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T19:54:12Z","webTitle":"Glasgow School of Art: ‘It should have been the safest building’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jun/16/glasgow-school-of-art-fire-witnesses-shock-disbelief","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/jun/16/glasgow-school-of-art-fire-witnesses-shock-disbelief","fields":{"headline":"Glasgow School of Art: ‘It should have been the safest building’","bodyText":"The hosepipes snaked all the way down to the river Clyde, thick with water, as firefighters smothered the last of the flames on Friday night and into Saturday. While they worked, students and artists, architects and sculptors gathered in the streets around the Glasgow School of Art’s Mackintosh Building – Charles Rennie Mackintosh’s art nouveau masterpiece – to find out what had happened, and ask: four years after the Mack was devastated by fire, how could it happen again? “It should have been the safest building in Glasgow,” Margaret Archbold said. The 48-year-old artist graduated from the school in 1994 and was looking forward to the building’s reopening next year. “It’s so ironic that all that money was put back into restoring the building. It’s devastating to see when you know what’s in that building. It just keeps getting kicked in the teeth. It shouldn’t have happened again.” The Mack has been at the heart of Glasgow since it was completed in 1909, a focus for the community of artists who meet at the Vic cafe and bar opposite for gossip and inspiration. The imposing windows stretching up the building and the mahogany furnishings inside are viewed as the pinnacle of Mackintosh’s achievements. Sir Christopher Frayling, the former chairman of Arts Council England, described it as “the only art school in the world where the building is worthy of the subject”. The first fire came in 2014, starting in the basement and spreading up through wood-lined vent ducts. The famous library, which housed many rare and archival materials as well as original furniture and fittings, was gutted, but more than half of the building and its contents were saved. A fund backed by the actors Peter Capaldi and Brad Pitt and writer and broadcaster Muriel Gray raised £35m to restore the building. The stonework was a particular concern, weakened by being heated to 1,000C then cooled rapidly by hoses. But slowly the refurbished library, carved from longleaf pine and tulipwood as Mackintosh had used originally, began to take shape and the school began using the building again. Friday had been a day of celebration, marked by a graduation ceremony. Students had been packing up the works from their degree show and later heading out into the warm Glasgow night to drink at the Vic and other bars at the top of Garnethill. But at 11.15pm people noticed the flames rising from the roof and called the fire brigade. Aidan Dick, an eyewitness, posted videos of the fire on social media, saying it appeared to have become more intense “in the space of a few minutes”. By 2am police were concerned enough to start evacuating people from their homes in Renfrew Street and the number of firefighters had grown to 120. Residents said the heat was so intense it could be felt several streets away, with chunks of blazing timber and debris raining down on neighbouring buildings. “People were dodging fist-sized flaming embers,” said Jane Sutherland, who graduated from the school in 1982 and could see the blaze from her flat. “All the neighbours were out – we were all worried all the roofs were going up. This area is full of architectural gems. It was terrifying. The smell of it, and you could feel the heat of it two blocks away.” Fire crews ran hosepipes down to the Clyde in search of enough water to douse the flames, but the fire was “well developed” and they struggled to contain it. Flames spread to the Campus nightclub and the O2 ABC venue. It was only by 6am that Iain Bushell, deputy chief officer with the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, was able to say that the fire was under control. “There are a few hotspots and we can still see flames. It’s difficult to reach because it is such a large building and we are only firefighting from the outside because of the risk of collapse of structural elements..” Even then, the building continued to smoulder well into Saturday afternoon. Fifty firefighters carried on pouring water on the stones, to make the building safe enough to investigate whether the fire had been stopped in time to save the Mack. Fire officers said they were not yet able to get into the building to assess the full extent of the damage or start investigating the cause of the fire. Bushell said: “The roof is gone completely. We cannot get in yet to assess the damage. I can only see from the street but it looks as if the building has been extensively damaged.” Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, said the scene was “heartbreaking”. “The fire has been a devastating blaze, much much worse than the one that took hold of the Mackintosh building four years ago, so the damage is severe and extensive,” she said. “Obviously there are assessments and discussions ongoing with the fire service and building control about the structure of it and its structural safety. Obviously all of us hope the building can be saved but I think it’s too early to draw any conclusions from that.” She said the Scottish government would provide any support required, while the secretary of state for Scotland, David Mundell, said the UK government was ready to help the school “financially or otherwise”. Other Scottish politicians, architects, historians and musicians from bands who studied at the art school, including Travis and Franz Ferdinand, all spoke of their sorrow. “The building was the jewel of Glasgow,” Peter Swanton, a former student, said. “It sat up on Garnethill looking over the entire city. From the hen run at the top of the building, you could sketch the city skyline guided by the straight lines of the window frames. Mackintosh designed this to teach students about perspective.” Swanton had studied at the art school during the renovations, “soundtracked by the noise of construction”. “Nobody cared. Everyone knew this was what needed to happen. The building was rising from the ashes.” Stuart Robertson, director of the Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society, said the fire was a “massive body blow”. “To see some of the work and the beautiful craftsmanship that’s gone on – and I’d seen a glimpse of the new library taking shape – and the studio work and all the painstaking work that’s gone into the restoration is just … people must feel sick.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/16/gareth-southgate-england-team-selection-tunisia-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T23:26:00Z","webTitle":"Gareth Southgate tells squad his starting team to ease England anxiety","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/16/gareth-southgate-england-team-selection-tunisia-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/16/gareth-southgate-england-team-selection-tunisia-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Gareth Southgate tells squad his starting team to ease England anxiety","bodyText":"Gareth Southgate has moved to ease any anxiety within his England squad by making the unusual decision to reveal his selection to the players well in advance of Monday’s opening group game against Tunisia. England travel to Volgograd with a fully fit squad available to the manager, with Marcus Rashford having been integrated back into training in Repino, and with their lineup for the Group G opener decided. That is understood to mean World Cup debuts for nine players with starts for Ashley Young at left wing-back and Harry Maguire in central defence, while Jordan Henderson will be the side’s midfield anchor instead of Eric Dier. The choice to disclose the selection to his players is surprising for Southgate, who has tended to name his side on the day of the game, but is designed to allow those involved to focus fully on their task at the Volgograd Arena. Rob Green revealed last week that he had been given only two hours’ notice he was to play in England’s opening game at the 2010 World Cup and duly made a bad mistake in the 1-1 draw with the United States. It would be almost two years before the goalkeeper played for England again. “The players know the team for the first game already,” said Southgate. “We have been working on a system of play we think suits the players we have available and the style of play we want to implement as well. “From our fans’ point of view, they’re enjoying seeing young players come into the squad. Everyone at home wants England to win but they want to see them play well and enjoy their football and that’s what I want as a coach. So if we can marry those things and the environment is right, then we think results become part of that process. “Whenever you represent England, or any other country, there’s expectation, there’s hope, you carry the dreams of a nation, and it’s impossible to say to any player you can go out and play without any feeling of pressure or any feeling or fear. “But what you have to do is make sure that doesn’t control you and that you go for it in your performances. You don’t feel: ‘Oh, I was inhibited in the way I played’ or worry about making mistakes because mistakes will happen for certain. So no, I think pressure is what you perceive and very often that comes from listening to too much external noise. Actually we have to focus on the things we can control and they’re things within our camp and within our team.” Southgate heaped praise on Harry Kane but has urged the Tottenham striker’s creative teammates to ease the goalscoring burden on his captain. “He’s only played something like seven games in our 18 matches and he’s scored eight goals, so he’s pretty important,” added Southgate. “A goalscorer is worth his weight in gold. He is a great leader in terms of his approach to everything about his profession. He is meticulous and considered, he wants to be the best he can be and believes he can be one of the best in the world. His stats over the last few years tell us he’s heading that way so, of course, he is a key player for us. Equally we have others in our camp which help to take the pressure away from him having the burden of expectation, because the young players coming through, people we are excited about. Dele Alli, Raheem Sterling, Jesse Lingard, Marcus Rashford … we have Jamie Vardy who scored regularly for his club at a high level in the Premier League, so I think it’s important it isn’t just one story. Although it’s important Harry [Kane] is a big player for us, we have to be about the collective.” While Southgate was talking, Danny Rose explained why the squad is not about to question the manager. The left-back believes the moment he dropped Wayne Rooney for a World Cup qualifier in Slovenia in 2016, he put down an important marker. “I definitely didn’t expect the manager to drop him against Slovenia and as soon as we all saw that we knew the gaffer was not somebody to be messed around with,” said Rose. Monday’s Group G fixture will be officiated by the experienced Colombian referee, Wilmar Roldán, who has been on the Fifa list for a decade and is at his second World Cup finals."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/16/peru-denmark-world-cup-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T17:56:57Z","webTitle":"Yussuf Poulsen winner for Denmark edges out luckless Peru","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/16/peru-denmark-world-cup-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/16/peru-denmark-world-cup-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Yussuf Poulsen winner for Denmark edges out luckless Peru","bodyText":"A landmark day for Peru, who returned to the World Cup finals for the first time since 1982, ended with a sobering reminder of just how cruel football can be at times. Yussuf Poulsen scored the goal that broke Peru hearts on a night that turned into a personal ordeal for Christian Cueva, who had to be consoled by his teammates after his awful penalty, which was awarded following a pitchside review by the referee, sailed wildly over the bar just before half-time. Cueva was unable to keep his emotions together at the time as he fought back tears and the midfielder was still shaking his head at the final whistle, along with plenty of other Peru players, as the team whose colourful supporters have travelled to Russia in such huge numbers, capturing the imagination of people from all over the world, struggled to come to terms with a chastening defeat. Even Åge Hareide, Denmark’s coach, conceded Peru deserved something from a game that slipped from their grasp just before the hour, when Christian Eriksen came to life and delivered one of those killer passes. Poulsen, who had brought down Cueva for the penalty, coolly dispatched his shot inside the near post and the Peru fans briefly fell silent. It did not take long for them to regain their voices and, buoyed by the introduction from the bench of Paolo Guerrero, their all-time leading scorer, the tens of thousands of Peru supporters inside the stadium willed their team to get an equaliser. That the players came up short was down to a combination of profligacy, bad luck and an outstanding performance from Kasper Schmeichel, the Denmark goalkeeper, who denied Edison Flores, Guerrero and Jefferson Farfán in the second half. Guerrero also back-heeled inches wide and Alberto Rodríguez headed agonisingly past the far upright. Denmark have gone 533 minutes without conceding a goal but that run should have come to an end before the interval. Bakary Gassama, the Gambian referee, initially waved for play to continue when Cueva tumbled to the floor under a challenge from Poulsen and it appeared as though no penalty would be given. Then, however, Gassama got word from the VAR that he should look at the incident on the pitchside monitor. Although the contact was slight, the footage clearly showed that Poulsen caught Cueva’s trailing leg, and Gassama pointed to the spot. For all the criticism of VAR and the concerns voiced beforehand, the process was relatively quick and ultimately the correct decision was reached. What nobody could legislate for is what would happen next. Giving himself a long run-up, Cueva stuttered before sweeping a right‑footed kick horribly over the bar and into the supporters behind the goal. Cueva looked absolutely devastated moments afterwards, so much so that when the half-time whistle blew he was surrounded by Peru players, including the substitutes. “At half-time we told him he had to keep playing the same,” said Ricardo Gareca, the Peru coach, whose team had been unbeaten in 15 matches. The missed penalty was a huge reprieve for a Denmark side who created little throughout. With Eriksen on the fringes in the first half, they were guilty of knocking too many long balls and overly dependent on set pieces. Hareide called his team’s display “tentative” and also admitted that Denmark’s players had struggled to cope with the noise inside a stadium that must have felt like a home venue for the Peru players. “We were afraid a little bit of the atmosphere and it did affect us,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/16/may-to-unveil-20-billion-pound-a-year-nhs-boost","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T21:30:08Z","webTitle":"May to unveil £20bn a year boost to NHS spending","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/16/may-to-unveil-20-billion-pound-a-year-nhs-boost","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/16/may-to-unveil-20-billion-pound-a-year-nhs-boost","fields":{"headline":"May to unveil £20bn a year boost to NHS spending","bodyText":"Taxpayers are to be asked to help fund a £20bn a year injection of extra cash into the National Health Service by 2023-24 that will pay for thousands more doctors and nurses, while cutting cancer deaths and improving mental health services, Theresa May will say today. The announcement, before the NHS’s 70th birthday next month, will represent the biggest funding boost since Gordon Brown imposed a one percentage point rise in National Insurance to pay for more NHS spending in his 2002 budget, in the face of Tory claims that Labour was slapping a “tax on ordinary families”. Government sources said the increases, which would be paid for in part by a “Brexit dividend”, would amount to around £600m a week extra for the NHS in cash terms within six years. Health and social care secretary Jeremy Hunt said last night that the government wanted to “show the world what a cutting-edge 21st-century healthcare system can look like”. He added: “This long-term plan and historic funding boost is a fitting birthday present for our most loved institution. Like no other organisation could ever hope to be, the NHS is there for every family at the best and worst of times, from the wonder of birth to the devastation of death, living and breathing those very British values of decency, fairness and compassion. He said the extra cash “recognises the superhuman efforts made by staff over the last few years to maintain services in the face of rapidly growing demand. But it also presents a big opportunity for the NHS to write an entirely new chapter in its history”. Details of how the public will be required to pay through tax rises, and the proportion of the funding increases they will pay for, will not be spelled out until the budget, because of ongoing arguments involving the chancellor Philip Hammond, Hunt, and No 10. It is understood that a freeze on tax thresholds is being considered as one option to pay for up to £10bn of the extra annual cash injection. This would, however, mean another big policy U-turn by the Tories, who are committed to raising the tax-free threshold to £12,500 and increasing the level at which people pay high-rate tax to £50,000 by April 2020. May is expected to say that the rest of the package will be paid for from extra borrowing within the government’s fiscal limits and, controversially, from a “Brexit dividend” resulting from the UK’s exit from the EU in March 2019. Claims by the official VoteLeave campaign that £350m a week extra could be spent on the NHS if the British people voted to leave were hotly contested during the EU referendum campaign in 2016, with critics saying that the economic damage of Brexit and resulting loss of government income would far outweigh any Brexit dividend. The independent Health Foundation cast doubt on whether the cash would be enough, suggesting any increase that fell significantly below the 4% extra a year that had been demanded by Hunt would not lead to improvements. Anita Charlesworth, the charity’s director of research and economics, said: “Increases of 4% a year above inflation are the minimum needed to allow the NHS to improve and modernise. Without funding growth at this higher level it is hard to see how there can be any improvements in mental health and cancer care. And if funding growth is limited to the NHS England element of the health budget, this will mean ongoing and severe problems in public health and staffing – with no end in sight to the serious shortages of nurses and GPs. There are potentially really tough times ahead for the health service.” May’s announcement follows months of intense debate at the top of government about how to prepare the NHS for the challenges of an ageing population and the rising costs of care and drugs, which have taken NHS finances to breaking point. NHS England will be asked to come up with a 10-year plan laying out how it will use the extra money to provide more doctors and nurses and improve all key services. Last night, some Remain-supporting Tory MPs said the timing and content of the announcement was “cynical” and designed to give a misleading impression that Brexit would make the country better able to fund public services. With more key parliamentary battles over the Brexit withdrawal bill expected this week the rebels believe May is trying to sell Brexit as a money-spinning course for the country to take, when they say the reality is that is loaded with economic risk. One senior Tory said it was “sickening” and “pathetic” that the government could claim Brexit would provide extra money for the NHS when the reverse would be the case. In 2016, the UK government paid £13.9bn to the EU budget, according to the Office for National Statistics, and the EU funded projects and other spending in this country amounting to £4.4bn. But many economists argue that the cost of Brexit, in terms of loss of economic activity and therefore revenue to the Treasury, will far outweigh any budgetary gain from leaving. Theresa May will spell out her plans on television interviews before explaining the changes to NHS staff in a major speech in London on Monday. Government sources defended their record on the NHS, saying funding had increased every year since the party came to power in 2010. But they said it now urgently needed more to meet rising demand caused by people living longer, and the cost of more complex and effective treatments for patients with complex conditions. They said a key aim was to improve cancer survival rates, improve mental health care, and expand the number of doctors and nurses in areas of most demand. They added that the plans would also involve a fresh assault on waste and inefficiency within the NHS."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/16/spain-portugal-world-cup-spanish-reaction-cristiano-ronaldo","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T19:07:03Z","webTitle":"‘Too little luck, too much Ronaldo’ – Spanish reaction to Portugal thriller","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/16/spain-portugal-world-cup-spanish-reaction-cristiano-ronaldo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/16/spain-portugal-world-cup-spanish-reaction-cristiano-ronaldo","fields":{"headline":"‘Too little luck, too much Ronaldo’ – Spanish reaction to Portugal thriller","bodyText":"Gerard Piqué said “there will be a time” to tell the story of the three days that shook Spain, but not yet. In the meantime, there was plenty to be getting on with. If what happened backstage was extraordinary, what happened when they finally took to the stage was, too. The opening night in Sochi brought one of the competition’s great games, from the “funeral parlour” in Sergio Ramos’s words, to the fiesta – a match in which the first goal came after just three minutes, the last came in the 90th, and there were four more between them, in which there might even have been another after that, Cristiano Ronaldo nodding just wide. He’d got enough already. As the front page of the Spanish sports daily AS put it: “Too little luck, too much Ronaldo.” His hat-trick, completed with that wonderful late free-kick, was just one of the many stories to come from a game that also had two goals from Diego Costa – “We’ve been waiting for you,” cheered Marca – a dreadful error from David de Gea, Isco’s “wonky walk” and lovely touch, Gonçalo Guedes’s pace and Jordi Alba’s whirring legs. “And,” said Marca, “Nacho was Cafu”. That might have been pushing it a little, but he did score a superb goal – the stand-in right-back hitting the ball beautifully. Above all, there was the sense that there is much more to come. Spain’s World Cup is not over. And nor is Portugal’s. And all of it, of course, after one of the most bizarre buildups to a World Cup in recent memory. These had been “delicate days”, Ramos admitted. “Extremely difficult,” Luis Rubiales, the president of the Spanish football federation, called them. Days in which the then Spain manager, Julen Lopetegui, had agreed to join Real Madrid and been sacked for it and in which three more Portugal players – William Carvalho, Gelson Martins, Bruno Fernandes – joined goalkeeper Rui Patrício in announcing that they were leaving Sporting Lisbon, where the confrontation with the president was even worse than the ones leaking out of Spain’s Krasnodar HQ. There was more. On the day before the match, Spain’s new manager, Fernando Hierro, gave a press conference, and then, less than an hour later, so did Spain’s former manager, the cycle of accusations never ending. And then on the morning of the game, news came that Ronaldo had reached an agreement with the state prosecutor to pay €18.8m and accept a suspended two-year prison sentence for tax evasion. The timing felt significant, maybe even a little suspicious. After all the damage Spanish football had done to its own national team, maybe the state was helping out? Unity had been the word; “the national team is everybody’s,” as the slogan goes. Another one insists – and, yes, this is real – “the tax office is all of us”. It didn’t put Ronaldo off. Within four minutes he had scored his first, from the penalty. He had made it too, running at Nacho and going over him. “I know I touched him but I tried to pull my leg out,” Nacho said afterwards. Gerard Piqué noted: “He was hardly touched. Ronaldo has a habit of diving and he almost always gets the decisions.” He also got a second and a third, Spain twice coming from behind and eventually leading until Ronaldo’s free-kick hit the net. “It came when we were most comfortable, keeping possession for a long time. But when there’s a star like that on the pitch, the game can change. It’s lucky for whoever has him.” For Spain, it was unlucky. It could also have done them further damage, but there was also satisfaction in the way that they had responded to the crisis, and the setback of an early goal and then De Gea’s mistake just before half-time. Hierro talked about his “pride” in the “personality” his team – “a family”, he called it – had shown. “It’s a question of character”, he said. A draw isn’t bad either – Spain lost their opening game in 2010 and went on to win the tournament. “It’s not all bad news. The most important thing was not to lose after everything that’s happened,” Piqué said. “It is difficult when you go a goal down after three minutes but we stood up to be counted and we played very well.” Piqué also defended De Gea, after his mistake gifted the second goal to Ronaldo. It was the third time in four games that he has been at fault for goals. “Better now than at the World Cup,” he had said after an error against Switzerland in a recent friendly, but this time it hurt. Piqué, though, was unequivocal. “There is no doubt and no debate: he’s our goalkeeper, he has proven himself for years, he’s the best,” the defender said. Ramos too rallied to him, tweeting: “It’s not about never making mistakes; it’s about never giving up”. De Gea, though, appeared affected afterwards, not just in what he said but the way he said it. “If for one mistake you’re going to change the goalkeeper…” he responded when he was asked about the error. “I’m calm, ready for the next game. One day you’re ‘very bad’, the next day you’re ‘very good’. I haven’t killed anyone.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/16/south-africa-england-summer-international-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T17:37:57Z","webTitle":"England’s nightmare continues as South Africa complete series victory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/16/south-africa-england-summer-international-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/16/south-africa-england-summer-international-match-report","fields":{"headline":"England’s nightmare continues as South Africa complete series victory","bodyText":"One hundred and twenty-six days have now elapsed since England last won a game of Test rugby and the long wait goes on. In terms of this series the clock has already stopped ticking, South Africa having taken an unsurpassable 2-0 lead with one left to play in Cape Town on Saturday. Five Test defeats in a row and counting is the starkest English statistic of all. It is a grim sequence that Eddie Jones, his coaches and players, for all their hard work, seem depressingly unable to shake. Again they threw away an excellent start, losing momentum, discipline and, gradually, belief as the Springboks dished out a lesson in directness, execution and collective desire. This is far from the greatest South Africa team of all time but they have still been consistently too strong for England. For all the dash of Jonny May and Elliot Daly, England continue to add up to less than the sum of their parts on and off the field. Looming job cuts have Rugby Football Union staff fretting at home and all sorts of questions suddenly hover over the national team’s progression towards next year’s World Cup in Japan. Whatever magic dust Jones scattered earlier in his tenure has long since disappeared into the ether. What makes it even more frustrating is England’s continuing inability to finish games they have initially dominated. For the second week running they made an eye-catching start, with two tries inside three minutes within the first quarter. For the second week running it all came crashing down. This time they gave away 13 penalties, having solemnly sworn beforehand to be squeaky clean. As one wag asked rhetorically on social media what is the word for deja vu in Afrikaans? England certainly should have known what was coming once they had again exploited acres of space in South Africa’s wide channels to register early tries through Mike Brown and the roaming May. From 12-0 down on the scoreboard, the Springbok forwards ultimately took a firm grip in another storming game which, at times, was almost reckless in pace. England, in contrast, played only in fits and starts, made too many errors and faded badly after losing Billy Vunipola with another significant-looking arm injury at half-time. In Duane Vermeulen, South Africa had the perfect man to exploit any defensive fragility. The No 8, always a powerful threat, is a tough man to stop at full bore and once he had left Maro Itoje and Ben Youngs sprawled in his wake to put his side on the scoreboard after 25 minutes the contest assumed a different complexion. The game was already simmering in other ways, with plenty of niggle, pushing and shoving. England were clearly trying to get at Faf de Klerk but once again their discipline left something to be desired. Mako Vunipola, sent to the sin-bin last week, was lucky only to be warned for slapping Pieter-Steph du Toit at the bottom of a ruck and by half-time England, for all their pre-match promises, had already conceded seven penalties. With a kicker like Handré Pollard around it was always going to cost them. Some obstruction at the lineout allowed the Springbok fly-half to drag his side back within two points before a huge 58-metre effort from Pollard punished England’s failure to release on the floor a minute before the break. There was still time for Bongi Mbonambi to crash through a clearly struggling Vunipola, leaving the English management little option but to replace their No 8 with Nathan Hughes for the second-half. If England were also hoping to exert a fresh measure of control they were instantly disappointed. A half-break from Youngs led only to a loose pass and a concerted spell of South African pressure at the other end, long passes whizzing left and right and the familiar figure of Vermeulen crashing on to short balls from the increasingly involved Willie le Roux. Itoje and Brad Shields did manage to effect one relieving turnover but the screw was tightening. England could not cope with a series of scrums which led to the month’s least surprising penalty try and, after a potential first Test try for Shields was ruled out by the TMO, England slowly ran out of ideas. Even George Ford could not find a solution, getting caught in midfield and throwing a horrible pass to no-one in particular which resulted in three more points for Pollard. It was the signal for Jones to call for Danny Cipriani, bizarrely still trying to prove himself to certain people at the age of 30. England did briefly spark into some semblance of life following the fly-half’s arrival but the series, by now, was in effect gone. The postmortem will become even messier if England are flattened again at Newlands, raising fresh doubts about the effectiveness of Jones’s training methods and whether or not he can drag things back between now and the World Cup. At least this tour has proved to be a landmark moment for South Africa, with Siya Kolisi’s historic appointment as captain being gloriously matched by Tendai Mtawarira’s achievement in becoming the first black African to make 100 Test appearances. His nation’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, was also at the stadium on Youth Day, when South Africans remember those killed in the 1976 Soweto uprising. The divisive racial barriers of old are increasingly being torn down, along with England’s once lofty reputation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/17/may-gamble-brexit-dividend-nhs-raises-remain-anger","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T07:00:10Z","webTitle":"Why claims of Brexit dividend for NHS will raise Remainers’ anger","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/17/may-gamble-brexit-dividend-nhs-raises-remain-anger","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/17/may-gamble-brexit-dividend-nhs-raises-remain-anger","fields":{"headline":"Why claims of Brexit dividend for NHS will raise Remainers’ anger","bodyText":"It was a claim familiar to millions of voters in the June 2016 referendum on whether the UK should stay in the European Union. Emblazoned across the official Vote Leave battlebus was the suggestion that £350m this country sends to Brussels every week could be spent instead on our own National Health Service, if only we broke free and left the EU. The figures, and the basic argument, were hotly contested at the time and have been widely ridiculed ever since. The idea that the UK would receive any Brexit dividend in the foreseeable future, to help fund public services, from an enterprise beset by so much economic risk was so dubious that even Ukip’s Nigel Farage disowned it. Today, however, after a week in which she and her ministers survived a series of parliamentary votes on Brexit only by the skin of their teeth – and before one which promises even more trouble for the prime minister in parliament – Theresa May needs to boost the benefits of Brexit. With this week’s parliamentary hurdles uppermost in their minds, ministers have officially bought into the idea that leaving the EU will be great for the NHS, helping to allow millions more in funding for hospitals every week, just as the official Vote Leave Brexit campaign said it would. After days of argument between the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, over how much could be afforded and was needed (which some MPs believe has been played up by spin doctors to draw attention to the announcement), May reveals today that the NHS is to receive £20bn a year extra by 2023-24. Government sources insist that Brexit will indeed help the country afford the NHS’s big 70th birthday present. While most MPs will be thrilled at getting more for their local hospitals, Conservative rebels campaigning for a soft Brexit smell a large rat. “It is sickening if this money is being in any way linked to Brexit,” said one senior Conservative MP among the rebel group who have been threatening to defeat the government over Brexit legislation in parliament. “It is truly pathetic. The availability of money for the NHS has nothing to do with Brexit at all. If anything, Brexit makes us less able to fund the NHS because it hits the economy. And for them to suggest the reverse is truly shameful.” Another Tory rebel added: “They will go to any lengths, even buying into the Boris Johnson lie that Brexit will be the saviour of the NHS.” Health experts and health economists are primed and ready to cast fresh doubt on the idea that Brexit will somehow make us more able to afford a better-funded NHS. On Saturday, as rumours of the supposed Brexit NHS boost circulated, Anita Charlesworth, director of research and economics at The Health Foundation, put out a pre-emptive tweet to counter the government spin: “In case talk of Brexit dividend comes up in discussion of NHS funding thought I’d retweet excellent @PJTheEconomist piece explaining in his wonderfully clear way why there is NO Brexit dividend. NHS needs extra funds but it’s taxes not Brexit that will have to pay for it.” She provided a link to a piece by two senior figures at the Institute for Fiscal Studies who argue that “Brexit has reduced rather than increased the funds available for the NHS (and other public services), both in the short and long term”. It is possible that the NHS announcement could go contrary to plan, and stir yet more resentment among the hardcore Tory Remainers as this week’s parliamentary clashes on Brexit approach. Tory rebel MPs and peers are in no mood to take the spin lying down. They are already furious at tactics being used by the government and the whips as they attempt to bring them into line. They are outraged by what they say are campaigns of “personal vilification” being run by hard Brexiters and elements of the Brexit-backing press, which are trying to get them deselected. Anna Soubry, the arch-Remain Tory, says hard Brexiters have been bombarding her constituency chairman and his office with emails demanding her deselection, and accusing her of being a traitor. “How do they get the chairman’s personal email?” she asks, adding that there appears to be a “concerted campaign” to bully MPs to vote against their beliefs. She says those sending the emails are not in her constituency, nor do they seem to be Conservatives, though she thinks someone has given people the addresses. “It is a very serious matter for democracy,” says Soubry. She believes that some MPs will be swayed (although she insists she herself will not be) by such efforts to subvert the democratic process. “Many of them will simply not vote in the way that they want to vote, because they will worry about being deselected or their lives being made extremely difficult. It is appalling for our democracy.” Health experts and health economists are of like mind, and also pour scorn on the idea that Brexit will somehow make us more able to afford a better-funded NHS. Some Conservative MPs also feel betrayed after May offered them a compromise deal on the “meaningful vote” on Brexit as the price for their loyalty last week, only for ministers to go back on the agreement. In these pages the former attorney general Dominic Grieve, who has been at the centre of the row, today suggests he will do his duty, come what may, to ensure parliament can play its part to avoid a “no-deal Brexit”, which he says would cause a “major crisis for our country”. He adds: “In the absence of some agreement, the barriers to trade, commerce and movement would be such as to bring us to a complete halt.” Tory peers look certain to help inflict defeat on the government on Monday over the meaningful vote. The matter will then be voted on in the Commons on Wednesday, in what could be the most critical test of May’s authority yet. However much she throws at the NHS in the meantime, it is far from certain that it will be enough."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/16/leave-eu-russia-arron-banks-andy-wigmore","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T20:29:07Z","webTitle":"Leave. EU faces new questions over contacts with Russia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/16/leave-eu-russia-arron-banks-andy-wigmore","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/16/leave-eu-russia-arron-banks-andy-wigmore","fields":{"headline":"Leave. EU faces new questions over contacts with Russia","bodyText":"A leader of the Leave.EU campaign suggested sending a “message of support” to the Russian ambassador after the then foreign secretary made a speech that was critical of Russia, documents seen by the Observer suggest. The material also appears to show that Andy Wigmore, spokesman for the Leave.EU campaign and the business partner of Arron Banks, the biggest funder of Brexit, passed confidential legal documents to high-ranking officials at the Russian embassy and then denied it to parliament. The documents related to George Cottrell, an aide to Nigel Farage who was with him on the campaign trail for Donald Trump in July 2016. Cottrell was arrested by the FBI and charged with 21 counts of money laundering, bribery and wire fraud. Damian Collins, chair of the culture, media and sport select committee, said that Banks and Wigmore appeared to have misled parliament and “what we really need to know is why”. He added: “It makes you question whose side they are on.” According to material seen by the Observer, Wigmore, who was Belize’s trade envoy to Britain at the time, forwarded an email to a Russian diplomat marked “Fw Cottrell docs – Eyes Only”. It is understood the email, dated 20 August 2016, showed six attachments of legal documents relating to Cottrell’s arrest by federal agents. It appears that Wigmore sent it to Sergey Fedichkin , a third secretary at the Russian embassy, saying: “Have fun with this.” Collins asked Wigmore and Banks a series of questions about Cottrell’s arrest. He noted Wigmore was with Cottrell when federal agents seized him at Chicago airport on 26 July 2016, and that Farage was sent his charge sheet by the FBI. “Did you discuss George Cottrell’s arrest with the Russian embassy?” Collins asked. Wigmore replied: “It never came up. While at the time it probably seemed a big thing, there was so much else going on at the time it just was not an issue. It never came up.” Collins told the Observer: “Wigmore kept trying to make the point that their contact with the Russian embassy was around social occasions, but we believe it went much further. On the surface, these documents didn’t hold any interest to the Russians, so why did they appear to pass them on? And why then deny it? Why did they mislead the committee about the true nature of their relationship? What are they trying to hide?” The Observer has also seen what appears to be a discussion between the Leave.EU social media team and Wigmore and Banks in March 2016, three months before the referendum. On 11 March 2016 the Russian embassy put out a press release attacking Philip Hammond, the then foreign secretary, for suggesting that “the only country who would like us to leave the EU is Russia”. Ian Lucas, Labour MP for Wrexham, who is also on the committee, said: “There has been a coordinated attempt to attack, bully and intimidate anyone asking questions about this, including MPs. But what the evidence is showing is an intimate business relationship with a hostile foreign government that was being built up in the period before the summer of 2016 that needs to be in the public domain.” The Observer has seen a series of exchanges that suggest a picture of communications between the embassy and the Leave.EU campaign running up to the referendum which continued in the period after Farage became an active supporter and campaigner for Trump. In October the Russian ambassador, Alexander Yakovenko, was identified by US special counsel Robert Mueller as a high-level intermediary between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. The documents about Cottrell’s arrest appear to have been handed over during a period in which Trump’s campaign manager, Paul Manafort, had his business dealings in Ukraine exposed and was replaced by Steve Bannon. The New York Times published a story about a secret ledger of payments to Manafort – that were paid via the British Virgin Islands, Belize and the Seychelles – on 14 August 2016. On 19 August, the day that Bannon became campaign manager, Wigmore and Banks were invited to lunch at the embassy with Yakovenko. And on 20 August, documents suggest, Wigmore appears to have sent the papers about Cottrell’s arrest. A few days later Farage, along with Wigmore and Banks, travelled to meet Trump in Mississippi, where he introduced the crowd to “Mr Brexit” and promised to deliver “Brexit plus”. The indictment included claims about Cottrell’s expertise with the dark web and cryptocurrencies, and was public by the time Wigmore appears to have sent it to the embassy. It is also thought to include five other documents about the case. The embassy said it “has not in any way intervened in the domestic UK political process, including the Brexit referendum.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/17/italy-ventimiglia-migrants-stuck-at-border-crisis-suffering","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T08:21:09Z","webTitle":"Between Italy’s cliffs and sea, migrants bid to outwit police","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/17/italy-ventimiglia-migrants-stuck-at-border-crisis-suffering","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/17/italy-ventimiglia-migrants-stuck-at-border-crisis-suffering","fields":{"headline":"Between Italy’s cliffs and sea, migrants bid to outwit police","bodyText":"For the fifth time in one week, Sami, a 25-year-old from Guinea, was trying to cross into France from the Italian border town of Ventimiglia. As the train glided along a track sandwiched between the steep cliffs of the Maritime Alps and a glistening Mediterranean sea, passing well-manicured beach resorts along the way, he was feeling hopeful. “I just need to get as far as Marseille where I have a friend who can help me reach Germany,” he told the Observer. “All I want is a better life – in Guinea it is impossible, it is so corrupt.” But, after a week of thwarted attempts to cross an impenetrable border, Sami’s plan was scuppered once again by border police at Menton-Garavan, the first stop along a route that passes through Monaco and Nice before arriving in Cannes. Along with three others, he was escorted off the train and immediately recognised by an officer who had intercepted him the day before. Tourists aboard the train looked on in bewilderment. “On some days we find between 10 and 20 migrants on each train,” said the officer leading the team of four. “We are doing nothing wrong in sending them back; it’s within the law. They are supposed to stay in the country in which they first arrived.” This game of cat-and-mouse has played out between France and Italy since early 2011, shortly after the Arab spring and Syrian war prompted the biggest migration crisis since the second world war. Between January and May this year alone, French authorities say they sent back 10,524 people who tried to cross either by train, or by walking along the motorway or a deadly mountain path. The situation reached boiling point last week when Emmanuel Macron, the French president, was accused of “hypocrisy” by Giuseppe Conte, Italy’s new prime minister, after he criticised his southern neighbour for blocking the Aquarius from Italian ports. The rescue ship had saved more than 600 people from the sea off Libya. The order came down from Matteo Salvini, the recently installed anti-migrant interior minister and leader of the far-right League, which is now in government with the populist Five Star Movement. Relations between Macron and Conte appeared to have thawed on Friday in Paris, where they called for the EU to establish asylum processing centres in Africa as a way of stopping the flow of migrants across the Mediterranean. But in the perennial migrant waiting room of Ventimiglia, a seaside town which has become known as the “Calais of Italy”, charity workers are unconvinced. “Where will they set up these centres? Definitely not in Libya,” said Daniela Zitarosa, from the Italian humanitarian agency Intersos. “You can’t exactly put centres in countries from where asylum seekers escaped because their lives were in danger.” Zitarosa contributed testimony to a report released by Oxfam on 15 June accusing French border police of detaining migrant children as young as 12 without food or water, cutting the soles off their shoes and stealing sim cards from their mobile phones before illegally returning them to Italy. The allegations came two months after French police were accused of falsifying the birth dates of migrant children on “refusal of entry” documents so they could pass them off as adults and send them back. Under the Dublin regulation, child migrants in France cannot be sent back to Italy if they request asylum. EU law stipulates that unaccompanied minors must be protected, and that those seeking asylum in one member state have the right to be transferred to another where they have family members. The police officer at Menton-Garavan dismissed the claims as “completely false”. He said: “If that’s what they say, that’s what they say … we’re just here doing our job, monitoring the trains.” At least 16 migrants have died while trying to cross into France since September 2016, either by falling off the mountain path or being hit by cars. A migrant was recently electrocuted after climbing on top of a train, the police officer said. Some 16,500 people, a quarter of them children, had passed through Ventimiglia in the nine months to April, according to the Oxfam report. About 500 are currently staying in a Red Cross camp on the outskirts of the town. Local authorities recently dismantled a makeshift camp beneath an underpass along the banks of the Roia river. Meanwhile, a priest who had been hosting people in a church opposite was forced to stop after receiving threats. Zitarosa estimates around 200 migrants are sleeping rough, in parks or on the beach. She said there had been an increase in arrivals in recent weeks as the summer approached: “You hear stories every day from people who have suffered … starting from personal accounts in their home countries and then their experience in Libya and the sea crossing,” she added. “ Then, in Ventimiglia, they are being pushed back and suffer even more. It’s not an easy job and it makes me feel deeply sad. With all the political stuff I feel even more worried about the future as these people are not being treated like human beings – politics is being made out of people and it needs to stop.” For Sami, who arrived in Italy by boat and had been sleeping for more than a week in a park in Ventimiglia, yesterday’s setback did not mark the end. He is determined to make it to Germany and find work. “This is my fifth time,” he said. “I will keep trying.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/17/dominic-grieve--brexit-government-contradicting-power-bases","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T04:59:06Z","webTitle":"The government has split into contradicting power bases on Brexit | Dominic Grieve","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/17/dominic-grieve--brexit-government-contradicting-power-bases","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/17/dominic-grieve--brexit-government-contradicting-power-bases","fields":{"headline":"The government has split into contradicting power bases on Brexit","bodyText":"For all the rhetoric about a “no deal” being better than a “bad deal”, I have yet to come across a Conservative colleague who does not accept that a failure to reach an agreement on our terms of withdrawal would be a major crisis for our country. In the absence of some agreement, the barriers to trade, commerce and movement would be such as to bring us to a complete halt. Fortunately this may be an unlikely outcome, as it must be in the interests of all parties that this should not happen, even if we fail to get any deal on a future economic relationship with the EU. But the fact that negotiations have yet even to get over the hurdle of reconciling our acceptance of the need to uphold the Good Friday agreement with not wishing to be in a customs union, and the diminishing time available to resolve a large list of issues ought to give us pause for thought. As the withdrawal bill, which is all about process not outcome, goes through its final stages in parliament it is inevitable therefore that there should be focus on the possibility of no deal. Parliament has a portcullis as its emblem because of its duty to safeguard the nation. How it brings its view to bear to influence government in such an event cannot be characterised as illegitimate. Yet this is now where we find ourselves, with MPs and peers who are trying to provide for an assured mechanism for doing this through a parliamentary procedure where we can agree or dissent from the government’s approach described as traitors and vilified in sections of the press. It is said that we are trying to sabotage Brexit and the will of the people. During the course of debate last week the prime minister undertook to a group of us that she understood our concerns and would discuss with us how they could be addressed. In return we agreed not to vote immediately on one possible solution. A very productive negotiation followed, at the end of which we had a text that provided what I felt was needed – amendable government motions in the Commons that would be advisory and not mandatory. Minutes before the amendment was to be tabled, I was told that the text had been changed. Instead of the Commons being able to express a different view from government if necessary, it would only be able to note the government’s position, making the amendment valueless. No proper explanation has been offered for this. The one most promoted is that the change is needed to avoid the risk of a credible legal challenge in the courts if the Commons disagrees with the government and the government refuses to act on the opinion of the Commons. None of us who were negotiating on either side saw this as a risk on the text we approved. One of the reasons the negotiation took place was to ensure that this risk was removed. The second explanation was that some believed that the government should demand that any successful amendment by the Commons had to have the status of a vote of no confidence. But the whole purpose of the amendment procedure is to give an opportunity to resolve differences without adding to the level of crisis. This would therefore also defeat its object. If the Commons wants to trigger a vote of confidence, it can take place at any time. I am afraid the reality is the government now seems to have divided into contradicting power bases that cannot deliver collectively on assurances given to backbenchers when they seek them. This is not a good place to be, as it erodes trust. We have collectively to face up to the fact that in the two main political parties there are substantial disagreements on the best form Brexit should take. It should be possible to disagree and seek compromise while retaining trust even when, particularly on matters of process such as this one, we may end up in different lobbies if we can’t resolve the disagreement. We all need to challenge the virulent hatred that is being stirred up quite deliberately to silence debate.

The five-times world champions were in control thanks to a Philippe Coutinho screamer and the first step of the mission to avenge the trauma from the previous finals looked set to be sure-footed. Brazil swaggered about for much of the first half with Neymar – looking every inch the A-lister with his meticulously coiffured blond crop – the performer-in-chief. He repeatedly slowed to a halt in a flashy attempt to trick his marker into a rash move. Yet they were stunned when Steven Zuber headed the equaliser early in the second half and, despite a late onslaught, Brazil could not dig themselves out of the hole. It was self-inflicted. Brazil complained bitterly that Zuber’s goal ought to have been disallowed for a push on Miranda but the referee, César Ramos, was correct to ignore them. Yes, there was an element of levering for position but it was not enough to throw the centre-half off-balance. The bigger problem for Miranda was that he misread the flight of Xherdan Shaqiri’s corner and lost his man. It was weak defending and with a priceless result within their grasp, Switzerland were in no mood to relinquish it. They dug deeper, their resolve hardening, although they rode their luck during a frenetic finale. By then, Brazil had dropped the swagger and belatedly, turned up the intensity. They created a flurry of chances but the ball would not go in. Coutinho sliced wide when well-placed on 69 minutes before Neymar and the substitute Roberto Firmino headed too close to Yann Sommer. Miranda also dragged off target when gloriously placed and another substitute, Renato Augusto, had a close-range shot cleared to safety by Fabian Schär. The other controversy came in the 74th minute when Gabriel Jesus felt Manuel Akanji put his arms around him as he ran on to a pass in the area. Jesus went down but the penalty appeal was waved away. The fall looked exaggerated but the contact was there. It was risky from Akanji although even Tite, the Brazil manager, did not complain too long about it. His grievance was all about the equaliser. Brazil have cast themselves as avenging angels, even if the trauma of the 2014 World Cup – when they were humiliated 7-1 by Germany – might never truly leave them and they have not run from their status of favourites. Far from it. Neymar had posted a message on the eve of the game in which he declared himself unafraid of dreaming big. “Let’s go Brazil – for the sixth!” he wrote. They started brightly and the breakthrough goal was a peach. Neymar popped the ball off to Marcelo and his cross was headed out by Zuber but only as far as Coutinho. The midfielder took a touch before shaping a right-foot curler into the far corner. Sommer dived at full stretch but there was nothing he could do. Tite had started Coutinho on the left of a midfield three, which had Paulinho on the right and Casemiro at the base, but he had scope to roam. So did Neymar. In fact Neymar was pretty much allowed to do whatever he wanted and that included a few bursts of dramatics. Switzerland’s Valon Behrami could be seen to laugh after one first-half tumble. On the other hand there were plenty of times when his quicksilver movement was too much for Switzerland and rather than let him pass, they fouled him. The statistics showed that Neymar was fouled 10 times and, if there was nothing dangerous in the treatment, there was certainly a cynical edge to it. Stephan Lichtsteiner, Schär and Behrami were all booked for challenges on Neymar. Brazil might have led earlier. Neymar combined with Coutinho to cross low and, when Schär got himself into a tangle, Paulinho sniffed out the close-range shooting chance. He went for the far corner, scuffing it slightly, only for Sommer to make a finger-tip save. The goalkeeper did not get the credit at the time, with Ramos awarding a goal-kick rather than a corner. Blerim Dzemaili had lifted an early half-chance high from Shaqiri’s pass but the Swiss did nothing further as an attacking force in the first half. Brazil’s lead at the interval might have been greater. Thiago Silva glanced over from Neymar’s corner at the end of the period while moments earlier Akanji had snuffed out Jesus in a one-on-one last man duel. It was all Brazil and yet the game would turn sharply at the beginning of the second half. It was a soft way for Brazil to surrender the initiative and some of their players demanded Ramos refer the incident to VAR. Already such pleas are becoming a feature of the tournament. The referee did not do so and nor, presumably, was he advised to by the team of video officials The setback shook Brazil and for 15 minutes or so they were gripped by opening-night nerves. Tite said he and the players felt the pressure and he used the word “anxiety”. They regrouped for the final push in which Neymar was prominent, although it was noted that he appeared to be feeling his right foot. He has only just returned from ankle and metatarsal damage. On the balance of play Brazil deserved to win. They had 21 shots to Switzerland’s six but Tite could lament the lack of cutting edge. The Swiss celebrated the point. For Brazil it rang hollow."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/18/eight-arrested-after-violence-at-manchester-cycling-event","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T23:35:09Z","webTitle":"Eight arrested after violence at Manchester cycling event","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/18/eight-arrested-after-violence-at-manchester-cycling-event","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/18/eight-arrested-after-violence-at-manchester-cycling-event","fields":{"headline":"Eight arrested after violence at Manchester cycling event","bodyText":"A cycling festival in Greater Manchester has been disrupted by violence, leading to 12 people being injured and eight arrests. Thirty protesters interrupted the event at Curzon Ashton Football Club’s Tameside stadium on Saturday at about 3.15pm. Organisers of the Eritrean Cycle festival said the protesters threw bottles, food and beer kegs, and that young children were put in danger. Riot officers were deployed by Greater Manchester police (GMP) at the stadium in Ashton-under-Lyne. It is believed the protesters were demonstrating against the Eritrean government. Organisers stressed that the festival was not politically connected to the East African nation and was arranged to celebrate road cyclists who had represented the country for years. The event was attended by hundreds of people, with singing, dancing and appearances from cyclists who featured at the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome and 1964 Games in Tokyo. The festival was supposed to continue throughout Sunday but was cancelled due to the disruption. Organiser Goitom Seyoum, 48, said: “This had nothing to do with politics – this was purely a celebration of Eritrean cycling. We had African champions here and people who appeared at the Olympics. “It was a peaceful protest at first and then they barged in throwing bottles, food and beer kegs. It was outrageous – there were children in buggies and people cut and bleeding. “This was supposed to be a festival but now we leave with a sad feeling. Young children were put in danger by these cowards.” The eight men arrested were held on suspicion of public order offences. Ch Insp Andy Harty of Greater Manchester police said: “The vast majority of people attending the event were innocent people, including children, who sadly got caught in the middle of this appalling act of violence. “Following the fast work of officers, a number of men were arrested at the scene and we will continue to question them as this investigation progresses. “We are still in the very early stages of inquiries and we are keen to hear from anyone who witnessed this incident. “In particular we would like people to come forward with phone or dashcam footage that could be vital to finding all those responsible. “This type of behaviour is completely unacceptable and I want to assure the residents of Tameside that we are doing everything we can to bring any offenders to justice.” North West Ambulance Service said 12 people, including two teenage girls, had suffered minor injuries. A 46-year-old woman was taken to hospital after sustaining a cut, which was not believed to be serious. A spokesperson for Curzon Ashton FC, who play in the National League North, said: “Police inquiries are currently ongoing and no further comment will be made at this time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/17/novak-djokovic-warns-andy-murray-of-perils-of-grass-on-eve-of-queens-return","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T18:29:05Z","webTitle":"Novak Djokovic warns Andy Murray of perils of grass on eve of Queen’s return","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/17/novak-djokovic-warns-andy-murray-of-perils-of-grass-on-eve-of-queens-return","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/17/novak-djokovic-warns-andy-murray-of-perils-of-grass-on-eve-of-queens-return","fields":{"headline":"Novak Djokovic warns Andy Murray of perils of grass on eve of Queen’s return","bodyText":"Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray have shared a rivalry for 20 years and have known the pain and sacrifice of their calling for many of those, as well, so the Serb speaks from the heart when he tells the Scot to beware the hidden dangers of grass when he returns at Queen’s on Tuesday. Djokovic thinks Murray is well advised to make his comeback on the surface he loves most, where he has won five times in front of a home audience, but warns that he needs to take care in his tricky engagement against Nick Kyrgios in the first round of the Fever-Tree Championships. Murray is nursing his hip back to good health after surgery in January, and Djokovic has his serving elbow to care for, after a shock exit in the quarter-finals of the French Open two weeks ago. In the lead-up to his opening match against the Australian qualifier John Millman, Djokovic said: “The one thing – again, I don’t know the state of his hips – that could be a bit dangerous is slipping on the grass. That’s something that is very unpredictable and grass is always this kind of surface where one wrong footing can make something go wrong, especially in the hips. I just hope for his sake that doesn’t happen.” Both men were eliminated on day nine of Wimbledon last year, suffering spiritually and physically, although Djokovic is ahead of Murray in the remodelling of his game. He believes the biggest challenge facing both of them after being at or near the top of their sport for so long will be mental more than physical. Facing opponents they once beat regularly would be, “circumstances that are quite new, because we’ve had tremendous success a couple of years ago, and for a period of five, six years alongside Nadal and Federer”. He said: “I’ve known him since we were 11, 12 years old. I’ve always had a wonderful relationship with Andy, never experienced anything negative in that relationship. We still are big rivals on the court [because] we’ve had so many great matches. But he deserves a chance – everybody deserves a chance – to come back. Coming back after a major injury is also something that inspires you, brings you that motivation. You breathe in a new breath of life. You feel like you have restarted your career. I’m sure that he’s more motivated than ever to go out there.” For most of his career, Murray has ground opponents into the dirt, grass, submission or to the point of distraction. However, the Scot suspects he might have to fine-tune his attritional strategy if he is to compete at the highest level again, and look after his body. Murray, who has idled and fretted for 11 months trying to fix a left hip injury that has plagued him for at least eight years, returns in hope as much as expectation. And the man his former trainer, Jez Green, calls “the Problem Solver”will need all his considerable acumen to, firstly, give Kyrgios a game after the Australian’s stellar three-set effort against Federer in the semi-finals in Stuttgart on Saturday, and, second, have at least a half-way chance of competing, unseeded, at Wimbledon, which starts on 2 July. “I’ll see when I start competing again, what works and what doesn’t,” he said. “It’s sort of getting the balance between playing a style that is effective and can win you matches, I could on Tuesday go and serve-volley every single point, which maybe might be better for my body, but is unlikely to win me lots of matches at this level. It’s trying to find the balance between playing a style that wins you matches and preserving your body as much as you can.” Cameron Norrie, the British No 2, who will come up against the three-time slam champion Stan Wawrinka in the first round, played two sets against Murray on Friday. “I played flat out,” Norrie said. “We organised it like a proper match. We went at it. It was a good level. There was no mercy. “No, I think he’s playing well. Obviously he hasn’t played many matches, so there were a couple of points here and there where he wasn’t quite on it. But he’s hitting the ball well and he’s moving great. Everyone’s pretty pleased to have him back. He’s a great role model for British tennis. It’s great to have him back and I wish him the best of luck for this week.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/17/england-coach-eddie-jones-and-his-methods-still-in-favour-with-rfu","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T21:00:25Z","webTitle":"England coach Eddie Jones and his methods still in favour with RFU","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/17/england-coach-eddie-jones-and-his-methods-still-in-favour-with-rfu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/17/england-coach-eddie-jones-and-his-methods-still-in-favour-with-rfu","fields":{"headline":"England coach Eddie Jones and his methods still in favour with RFU","bodyText":"The Rugby Football Union has insisted it still has faith in Eddie Jones and has no plans to review his contract despite England’s sharp decline in recent months. South Africa’s series‑clinching win on Saturday was England’s fifth successive Test defeat and is set to push them down to No 6 in the World Rugby rankings this week. Not since 2006 have England endured a worse losing sequence but an RFU spokeswoman said the union remains “supportive” of Jones and his coaching team in the wake of the team’s 23-12 defeat in Bloemfontein. Jones is understood to earn in the region of £750,000 per annum and extended his contract in January for a further two years until 2021. Since then, however, England have trailed in fifth in the Six Nations Championship and lost consecutive Tests in South Africa, surrendering a healthy lead on each occasion. Even Jones’s patience is being tested, with the head coach comparing his team to an unreliable vehicle. “We’re a bit like an old car at the moment,” he said. “Fix one thing and something else breaks.” The squad are now facing fresh disruption ahead of the final Test on Saturday following confirmation that the No 8 Billy Vunipola has re-broken the arm which put him out for four months this year. With his brother Mako also returning home for the birth of his first child and another prop, Leicester’s Ellis Genge, missing the remainder of the tour with a knee injury, England will be forced to field a reshuffled pack in Cape Town. With Ben Youngs also having to apologise for brusquely cutting short a post-match interview and Joe Marler exchanging forceful views with an irate English supporter as he walked down the tunnel, frustrations are clearly mounting Jones, though, insists his team are good enough to bounce back. “As England coach you are always under pressure, that is the reality,” he said. “In these sort of situations you get a lot of advice but we are only 2-3% away from turning this around.” The RFU, meanwhile, has revealed Jones has sent a letter of apology to the Bath owner, Bruce Craig, for describing him as the “Donald Trump of rugby” last month. Jones had taken issue with Craig’s criticism of England’s training regime but an RFU spokeswoman said he had apologised to Craig “for the personal remarks”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/17/yvette-horner-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T16:07:24Z","webTitle":"Yvette Horner obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/17/yvette-horner-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/17/yvette-horner-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Yvette Horner obituary","bodyText":"The name of the accordion player Yvette Horner, who has died aged 95, is synonymous with the golden years of the Tour de France, from 1950 until 1965. While it was (usually French) men at the heart of the narrative of the summer soap opera – Louison Bobet, Raymond Poulidor and Jacques Anquetil – related by writers such as Antoine Blondin, it was Horner who created the soundtrack of light-hearted music that set the mood on the roads of France. It said much about the chauvinistic nature of the Tour that one of the few women allowed to travel with the race spent her days at the head of the publicity caravan, sitting on top of a Citroën Traction Avant plunking at her accordion for up to seven hours a day, in all weathers. That was just part of a playing career that encompassed 64 years, 2,000 concerts, 150 albums and – so she said – 30m records sold in France. Horner was born in Tarbes, south-west France, where her maternal grandparents ran the Italianate Théatre Impérial. Her father, Louis Hornère, was a building contractor. Yvette trained as a classical pianist but was made to switch to the accordion by her mother, who sensed a commercial opportunity (and encouraged her to change her surname to Horner). “I cried for three years,” she recalled. At 26, she won the World Accordionist Federation’s world cup in Lausanne, the first woman to do so. She was a versatile player, as at home playing Bach or free-form jazz as with the popular airs of the time. Initially, she played in cinemas and casinos, but her breakthrough came in 1952 when the Calor company, which made electric irons, suggested she travel with them in the Tour de France’s publicity caravan. “I stood on the roof [of the car], leaning on the seat, strapped in, with an instrument weighing almost 15kg,” she recalled. “I played all along the course, without stopping on the mountain climbs or the descents. Sometimes I had to take mosquitos out of my nose, sometimes I was grubbier than the stage winner, and when it rained I had only a hat.” When she was completely worn out, she would put a life-size model of herself on the car roof (it was auctioned off for 2,200 euros in 2005) – until the crowds cottoned on. In the evenings, after attempting to find something to eat “in a bar on a back road” to avoid crowds – and drying out the keys of the accordion if it had been raining and they had begun to stick – she would play again in the centre of the stage town until 2am. The alarm would ring at 6am and she would be back on the road again, driven by her husband, the former Bordeaux Girondins soccer player René Dresch, who had quit his career to support her. Dresch died in 1986; Horner often expressed her regret that the marriage produced no children. Horner left the Tour in 1965 – conscious that accordion music was about to be overtaken by rock – but her contacts with the bike race lingered: when she sold her millionth record, Anquetil came to celebrate; later, she played for him at a celebratory evening at his home village in Normandy, the kind of local bal musette where the accordion was de rigueur. She had bought a house in the Paris suburb of Nogent-sur-Marne, which was reported to be accordion-themed from top to bottom; in Nogent, she was seen replicating her Tour act on top of a lorry during the Fete du Petit Vin Blanc. Late in her career, she became something of a national treasure with a slightly camp edge, playing at the Bastille on 14 July 1989 in a red, white and blue dress with the national jazz orchestra to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the revolution. She appeared on the TV rock show Taratata, duetting with Boy George on Gershwin’s Summertime, collaborated with the choreographer Maurice Béjart, and was seen in a revue at the Casino de Paris, dressed by Jean-Paul Gaultier, who was to design the sleeve of her final album, Hors Norme (2012). Her memoirs, Le Biscuit dans la Poche, were published in 2005; towards the end of her life a square in her home town of Tarbes was named after her, and she was made a member of the Légion d’Honneur. • Yvette Horner (Yvette Hornère), accordionist, born 22 September 1922; died 11 June 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/17/taliban-refuse-to-extend-truce-with-afghan-forces","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T16:05:38Z","webTitle":"Taliban refuse to extend truce with Afghan forces","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/17/taliban-refuse-to-extend-truce-with-afghan-forces","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/17/taliban-refuse-to-extend-truce-with-afghan-forces","fields":{"headline":"Taliban refuse to extend truce with Afghan forces","bodyText":"Afghanistan’s first taste of peace in 17 years is expected to end after the Taliban refused to extend a three-day ceasefire during which civilians, militants and soldiers hugged and danced together over the festival of Eid. The Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said: “The ceasefire ends tonight [Sunday] and our operations begin tomorrow, inshallah [God willing].” The Taliban’s decision to take up arms once more comes despite the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, on Saturday indefinitely extending the Afghan government’s own ceasefire and his request that the militant group follow suit to prolong the first countrywide lull in hostilities since the US invasion in 2001. Hopes are nevertheless higher than ever before that an agreement can one day be reached. On Sunday the Taliban ordered their fighters not to enter major cities after an Islamic State suicide bombing killed 26 people in Narangahar province, near the city of Jalalabad. Another Isis suicide attack in Jalalabad on Saturday killed 17. However, the ceasefire between Afghan forces and the Taliban was scrupulously observed and some analysts said the order to fighters not to enter cities stemmed from concern that they might enjoy peace too much. “Of course the leadership might fear some of them just stay,” said Thomas Ruttig, of the Afghan Analysts Network (AAN). Over three days, Afghans witnessed the kind of scenes few dreamed possible. Thousands of Taliban fighters were welcomed into Kabul, Kunduz, Ghazni and other cities. Some posed for selfies with soldiers, some handed out red roses, and in Kabul some sought out a famous ice-cream parlour. News of the ceasefire’s end came as a blow to many fighters. “I and thousands of Afghan Taliban definitely want the ceasefire extended,” Muhammadullah, 22, told the Guardian. “I went to the city and the mosques were full of people, I did not notice anything against the Islamic rules. After the sweet three days of peace, going back to bloodshed looks strange. How can you even compare peace with war?” The Taliban senior council met on Sunday to discuss the ceasefire and Ghani’s overture. According to insiders, the leadership was stunned by the jubilant scenes in city centres. The hardline deputy leader and son of Mullah Omar, Mullah Yaqoob, was particularly dismayed. In an audio message obtained by the Guardian, he said there had been “no permission for mixing with Afghan forces”, which he said “totally disobeyed the terms of the ceasefire”. One senior Taliban member said the leadership, recognising the pressure for peace within the group’s ranks, was considering a 10-day ceasefire over the next Eid festival, in September. However, he said there was disappointment that Ghani had not been more specific on the subject of US troop withdrawal. “Ghani should have created a timeline,” he said. “That might have created attraction to extend the ceasefire.” Michael Kugelman, of the Wilson Centre, said a tit-for-tat extension had never been likely. “If the Taliban’s to agree to a reconciliation process, it will do so at a time of its own choosing and not by reciprocating the government’s own moves,” he said. Progress towards peace is not helped by hardliners’ belief that they are winning the war, a view not contradicted by the latest report from the US watchdog, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. It said a surge in bombing raids under the Trump administration had not won back any of the 15% of the country under Taliban control – the highest level on record. Yet civilian pressure on the Taliban to negotiate is growing. A convoy of 80 civilians on a 400-mile peace march from the capital of Helmand province, Lashkar Gah, to Kabul has come to symbolise the stubborn determination of the public to end a war that has brought so much loss. Conditions abroad have also rarely been as conducive for talks. Pakistan, long thought of as a spoiler, has held an increasing number of bilateral negotiations with Afghanistan since the middle of 2017, partly under pressure from China, its key ally in the region. On 12 June the army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, visited Kabul and expressed support for the ceasefire."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/jun/17/prada-spring-summer-menswear-2019-milan-fashion-week-sexy-boy","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T21:59:40Z","webTitle":"Prada guides Milan through the gaze of the 'sexy boy'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jun/17/prada-spring-summer-menswear-2019-milan-fashion-week-sexy-boy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/jun/17/prada-spring-summer-menswear-2019-milan-fashion-week-sexy-boy","fields":{"headline":"Prada guides Milan through the gaze of the 'sexy boy'","bodyText":"Generally speaking, Miuccia Prada is known for taking a more oppositional stance when it comes to received ideas of beauty. The brand’s head designer tends to create womenswear that refuses to adhere to the male gaze – it was arguably her designs that prompted the term “ugly chic”. For her spring menswear show, which took place on a warm Sunday night in Milan, she made a collection that was exactly for that gaze. The Prada boy, she explained, is a “sexy boy”, a theme she crystallised by using the word “sexy” almost five times to describe the collection. The show was held in a vast, coolly lit concrete space behind the company’s headquarters. As guests sat on inflatable square stools under pink lights, the models came out to Aphex Twin’s Windowlicker. Then came the clothes: short shorts on men, an original Prada motif – both were ratified again this season – and came in pink, green, white and blue nylon. Backstage, Prada described them as “the equivalent of a mini skirt”. On the catwalk, she paired them with ultra tight, body-con polo necks. These were then worn under looser fitting blouses, varsity knits or long dark jackets. The Prada spring silhouette is overwhelmingly top-heavy. Almost every look was consciously mismatched. Sugary tones sat with primary colours or various shades of brown, yellow sat with blue, red with burgundy, and navy with emerald. Making the impossible palatable is her game: “brown is a colour that no one likes,” she once said, “so of course I like it because it’s difficult.” There were several shades in today’s show. Nylon was a running theme too, as was running, with knitted, zipped track tops unsuitable for any sport appearing on every other model. Denim too, baggy and bleached in a 90s way, featured on several looks. The accessories were the most Instagrammable: every model had a “feminine” leather handbag slung over their right shoulder, and almost half wore bloated trapper hats – incidentally, similar styles featured in the recent resort show. Shoes were black brogues or deck shoes with sports socks. The only predictable element were the Prada-ish trainers which came in pastel colours. Keen eyes noted a new diminutive logo. “Because the logos are such a trend, I joke with them,” Prada said, explaining why she made them small when the industry is making them big. Prada is known as a pioneer, a creative, a feminist and an authority – her work is impossible to predict or copy and generally speaking, what she says goes. Backstage she implied her inspiration came from real-life dressing: “Sometimes we hide our work. But sometimes it’s good to go to see how people actually dress, and the freedom they should have.” On the topic of fashion changing or being politicised in a post-#MeToo era, Prada said she hoped “sexy will always exist, whatever company you choose – that’s probably one of the reasons people dress” before adding quickly, “not the only one.” She added: “I guess I am known for being a contrarian”. A shift to sexy may well be seen as a bid to aid sales. Despite seeing a profit growth in 2017 after being hit by the downturn in global luxury spending – 2016 saw a 10% decline in revenue – Prada has seen a slight dip in recent years. Backstage the designer turned her comments to the wider fashion-scape: “People in fashion invent so many words. But in the end I am really fixated on giving [things] the right name, to not to be conceptual or pretentious. I like to use simple or banal words”. She laughed. “Also I never pronounce the word [sexy] in my life.” If turning unexpected parts into a compelling whole is her Prada trademark, then the spring 2019 menswear show took that idea and flipped it on its head."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/17/gareth-southgate-england-transfer-energy-world-stage","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T21:42:00Z","webTitle":"Gareth Southgate calls on England to transfer energy to world stage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/17/gareth-southgate-england-transfer-energy-world-stage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/17/gareth-southgate-england-transfer-energy-world-stage","fields":{"headline":"Gareth Southgate calls on England to transfer energy to world stage","bodyText":"It was France 98 on the last occasion England faced Tunisia in a World Cup. That one kicked off in the middle of the day and a 2-0 win, as always with England, sent the giddy-meter spinning. The lingering memory, however, is still the line with which Des Lynam opened the television coverage. “Good afternoon,” he greeted the viewers. “Shouldn’t you be at work?” This year, it will be 9pm local time when the two sides renew acquaintances in the Volgograd Arena. Nothing changes, though, when it comes to the raised expectations surrounding England on the eve of another World Cup adventure. Or, indeed, the diminished reputation of the nation’s footballers in the wake of more disappointments than they would probably care to remember. One Russian journalist was impudent enough to ask Harry Kane in the pre-match news conference whether it was true, as he had read on social media, that the welcome gift he received in Repino earlier in the week – a golden teapot – was the first trophy he had picked up in his career. Kane took that one on the chin and pointed out that maybe he could lift the “big gold one” on 15 July. Except, of course, we have been here before, falling into the trap. Roy Hodgson’s team went into the last World Cup on the back of an unbeaten qualifying programme and with everyone noting how immaculately prepared they seemed to be behind the scenes. The training ground just beneath Sugarloaf Mountain in Rio de Janeiro was pristine. Scientists had designed specially tailored recovery drinks for each player, depending on their sweat output. Turf specialists had been brought in to make the sure the grass was the same length, to the millimetre, of the pitch of their opening game. All that was left was for England to show they could take care of a football and the standing joke, four years on, is the team were on their way home before they had even finished their anti-malaria tablets. Seven days, to be precise. England’s qualifying results for Euro 2016 were even more impressive, with an immaculate record of 10 successive wins. Then it came to the now-infamous game against Iceland – a nation ranked 133rd in the world, between Burundi and Turkmenistan, four years earlier – and the din from thousands of England supporters chanting “you’re not fit to wear the shirt” at their own players. If all this sounds slightly downbeat it should also be pointed out that speaking to Southgate here in Volgograd on Sunday was to be in the company of a man who seems entirely comfortable in his own skin. Southgate talked of his pride to be leading out his national team. “My family are incredibly patriotic,” he said. “My grandad was a marine. I’ve always been brought up with England being a core part of what we stood for and my life.” But there wasn’t even a flicker of tension and when it came to the inevitable questions about how the current side would do better than the last one – and the one before that, and so on – he made it clear that he and his players were “looking at things a different way”. What good would it do, he seemed to be saying, to keep looking back all the time? “You can learn from the past. But this team shouldn’t be burdened with it. They’re a fresh group. Most of them have very few caps. The future is all ahead of them, so they have to be thinking about what’s possible. The players, and opportunities, of the past have gone now.” That doesn’t change the fact that, psychologically, England have choked on the big stage too many times. “The first thing is to have a really clear understanding of how we want to play,” Southgate said. “When you are in tense moments of games it’s important everyone knows their individual roles and the team is still connected on the pitch. Stick to your principles, whatever the state of the game. You have to stick to your beliefs. Look at Spain versus Portugal: whatever the stage of the game, they stuck to what they did well. You have to have the character to do that.” For England, that will mean Kieran Trippier and Ashley Young showing the confidence to advance from their wing-back positions and provide the team’s width. The three central defenders – Kyle Walker, John Stones and Harry Maguire – will be encouraged to play out from the back. Jordan Henderson will have to curtail his forward runs, as the holding midfielder, but Southgate wants Dele Alli and Jesse Lingard to make it their business to get into the Tunisia penalty area in support of Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling. It is a quick, exciting and attack-minded operation. More than anything, Southgate said he wanted his players to transfer the energetic performances he had seen in training on to a bigger platform. He said this more than once and it left the impression he was encouraged, to say the least, by what he had seen in England’s closed sessions. “They have a hunger to press, win the ball back and play brave football. They want to be a bold and attacking team. That’s how I wanted them to play.” In which case his players should not expect Southgate to try anything special with his team talk. Indeed, he is not planning to say too much just before his team, in a 3-3-2-2 formation, run out. His players, he said, were pumped up enough – and impatient to get going bearing in mind six of the eight groups are under way. Some managers would still feel it necessary to deliver a killer speech. Not Southgate. “When I was a player, there were moments before games when I thought: ‘All the manager can do now is fuck it up for me [with his team talk] and put me off my game.’ I was ready and I didn’t want to hear too much more. And now, I think, my boys are ready.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/17/us-south-korea-north-korea-large-scale-military-drills-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T19:04:38Z","webTitle":"US and South Korea to announce suspension of 'large-scale' military drill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/17/us-south-korea-north-korea-large-scale-military-drills-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/17/us-south-korea-north-korea-large-scale-military-drills-trump","fields":{"headline":"US and South Korea to announce suspension of 'large-scale' military drill","bodyText":"South Korea and the US are expected to announce the suspension of “large-scale” military drills next week, with the provision that they will restart if North Korea fails to keep its promise to denuclearise, a South Korean news agency said on Sunday. Citing an unnamed government source, the Yonhap agency said the suspension was likely to affect only major joint exercises, not more routine military training. Donald Trump surprised officials in Seoul and Washington after his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore last week, when he pledged to end “war games”. Immediately after the announcement, US forces in Korea said they had received no guidance on stopping any drills and South Korean officials said they were trying to figure out which exercises Trump was referring to. At a Senate hearing on Thursday, Trump’s nominee to be ambassador to South Korea, the retired admiral Harry Harris, backed the idea of a “pause” in major military exercises. He said his understanding was that any suspension would involve only major military exercises and that regular training of US forces in South Korea would continue, although final decisions were up to the Department of Defense. Trump said via Twitter on Sunday that it was his initiative to suspend military drills – a step North Korea has long sought. “Holding back the ‘war games’ during the negotiations was my request because they are VERY EXPENSIVE and set a bad light during a good faith negotiation,” the US president wrote. “Also, quite provocative. Can start up immediately if talks break down, which I hope will not happen!” Trump also tweeted a defence of widespread criticism of the summit, his apparent concessions to Kim and his praise of the authoritarian leader. “Funny how the Fake News, in a coordinated effort with each other, likes to say I gave sooo much to North Korea because I ‘met’,” the president wrote. “That’s because that’s all they have to disparage! We got so much for peace in the world, &amp; more is being added in finals. Even got our hostages/remains!” He added: “The denuclearization deal with North Korea is being praised and celebrated all over Asia. They are so happy! Over here, in our country, some people would rather see this historic deal fail than give Trump a win, even if it does save potentially millions &amp; millions of lives!” About 28,500 US troops are stationed in South Korea, a legacy of the Korean war, which ended in 1953 in an armistice that left the two Koreas technically still at war. The US-South Korean exercise calendar hits a high point every year with the Foal Eagle and Max Thunder drills, which both wrapped up last month. The next major drill, Ulchi Freedom Guardian, is planned for the end of the summer. Last year, 17,500 US and more than 50,000 South Korean troops participated in Ulchi Freedom Guardian, an exercise mostly focused on computerised simulations rather than live field exercises that use weapons, tanks or aircraft. Moon Jae-in, the South Korean president, said on Thursday his government would need to be flexible when it came to applying military pressure on North Korea if it was sincere about denuclearisation. Moon said South Korea would carefully consider joint military drills with the US and asked his officials to cooperate with Washington on the issue, his office said in a statement. Yonhap also reported on Sunday that during military talks between the two Koreas on Thursday, South Korean officials asked their northern counterparts to relocate artillery 30km to 40km away from the heavily fortified military demarcation line that divides the two countries. The South’s defense ministry denied it made such a request, Yonhap said. The talks, the first in more than a decade, were held in the border village of Panmunjom in the demilitarised zone (DMZ) and followed an inter-Korean summit in April at which leaders of the two Koreas agreed to defuse tensions and cease “all hostile acts”. North and South failed to reach any concrete agreement, officials said. North Korea proposed the disarming, on a trial basis, the Joint Security Area in Panmunjom, the only site in the DMZ where both countries’ soldiers stand almost face to face, the South’s presidential spokesman said on Friday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/17/the-guardian-view-on-yemen-our-complicity-lies-bare","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T17:47:32Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Yemen: our complicity lies bare | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/17/the-guardian-view-on-yemen-our-complicity-lies-bare","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/17/the-guardian-view-on-yemen-our-complicity-lies-bare","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Yemen: our complicity lies bare","bodyText":"The fig leaves covered little to start with, and withered long ago. Now the excuses for our role in Yemen’s misery have fallen away entirely. The assault on Hodeidah by the Saudi- and Emirati-led coalition can only deepen the world’s worst humanitarian crisis; 70% of the country’s imports pass through the port. Britain and France urged Saudi Arabia not to launch the attack, but the UK has now “said its piece”. The US rejected a UAE request for a minesweeper for the operation, but as an Emirati official observed: “Not giving us military assistance is not the same as telling us not to do it.” So they are doing it. They are conducting this war with British-, American- and French-made arms. They are conducting it with western military training and advice; British and US officers have been in the command room for airstrikes, and this weekend Le Figaro alleged that there are French special forces on the ground in Yemen. They are conducting it with diplomatic shelter from the west. On Friday, the UK and US blocked a Swedish drive for a UN security council statement demanding a ceasefire: “Britain, as the ‘penholder’ on Yemen at the UN security council, nevertheless takes a nakedly pro-Saudi approach to the conflict,” the former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell notes. Arms sales and security interests dictate. The war has already claimed tens of thousands of lives, the oft-cited toll of 10,000 being highly conservative when reached and now hopelessly out of date. Many more stand in peril. International law obliges the rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian aid, but both the coalition and the Houthi rebels have an atrocious record on observing the rules of war. Relief groups have had to flee Hodeidah. Twenty-two million Yemenis need aid. Eight million are at risk of starvation. The assault appears to be an attempt to pre-empt the presentation of a peace plan by the UN envoy Martin Griffiths, who had previously warned that an attack on Hodeidah could “take peace off the table in a single stroke”. He is due to brief the security council on Monday, following emergency talks, and the UN’s humanitarian coordinator, Lise Grande, has said that talks on the UN taking over the port’s administration are at an advanced stage. But even if Mr Griffiths can manage an agreement against the odds, the chances of it sticking are poor, given both sides’ record of acting in bad faith. The complexities of a handover are immense. The coalition backs the internationally recognised president, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, driven out by the Iran-backed Houthis. But the campaign appears largely driven by two forces. First, rivalry with Iran, and other strategic interests. Second, the prestige of its leaders – notably Mohammed bin Salman, who led the charge to war and is now Saudi Arabia’s de facto leader. The coalition has calculated that after a lengthy stalemate it may be in its best position since the war began more than three years ago; it hopes to change the facts on the ground and appears to have convinced itself that Hodeidah will be a relatively easy win, if far from painless for civilians. This is familiar stuff, as an International Crisis Group report pointed out this week: “The warring factions are overconfident in their military prospects, almost always press for military advantage when there is an opportunity for negotiation, and are all too often starkly indifferent to the humanitarian impact of their actions and the plight of ordinary citizens.” Riyadh and Abu Dhabi may be of one mind in their loathing for Tehran, but the crowded and increasingly complex field is exposing divergence in their interests. A few months ago, Emirati-backed forces were fighting and killing Saudi-backed forces in Aden. The south is moving towards outright autonomy. But which Saudi and Emirati officials will dare to tell their superiors that Tehran enmeshed them in a costly, apparently endless war at relatively little cost to itself? The entrenchment of a war economy is another significant obstacle to peace. So it goes on, the suffering mounting, further unsettling this unstable region and breeding cynicism and rage towards the west and its talk of human rights and international law. If the complicity ever looked deniable, events of recent days have laid it bare."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/17/aimen-dean-al-qaida-agent-mi6-spy-role-us-laptop-ban","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T16:53:37Z","webTitle":"Former al-Qaida agent turned MI6 spy reveals role in US laptop ban","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/17/aimen-dean-al-qaida-agent-mi6-spy-role-us-laptop-ban","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/17/aimen-dean-al-qaida-agent-mi6-spy-role-us-laptop-ban","fields":{"headline":"Former al-Qaida agent turned MI6 spy reveals role in US laptop ban","bodyText":"A former MI6 spy has revealed how the actions of a West Midlands man who became a master bomb-maker for Isis led to America’s laptop ban on flights. Aimen Dean made the revelation in his autobiography, explaining how Hamayun Tariq, from Dudley, had plans to smuggle bombs “disguised as laptop batteries”. This prompted a ban on passengers carrying laptops on flights from 10 airports in the Middle East and North Africa bound for the US. Tariq, a car mechanic who became a jihadist and boasted about his bomb-making skills on Twitter, is believed to have helped create bombs that could be disguised as laptop batteries and taken on planes. Dean says Tariq is now adapting drones to strike football stadiums and other crowded venues. The disclosures from Dean, a former al-Qaida explosives expert recruited by secret services to infiltrate UK jihadist circles, were made in his new book, Nine Lives. Dean first met Tariq, who once went by the nom de guerre Abu Muslim al-Britani, while working as an undercover agent. In the book, written with Paul Cruickshank and Tim Lister, Dean writes: “An intelligence source told me in 2017 that Abu Muslim was involved in Isis efforts to develop bombs that could be smuggled onto aircraft disguised as laptop batteries.” The discovery is believed to have caused the US to ban some airlines from the Middle East from allowing passengers to take laptops onto flights as carry-on luggage. The ban, which also covered electronic tablets and e-readers, was initiated in March last year but lifted four months later after improved security checks had been put in place. Dean told the Sunday Times in May that Tariq, a divorced father of two who was born and brought up in Dudley, is now on the Syria-Iraq border where he is developing drones laden with explosives with the potential to attack sports arenas. Tariq served three-and-a-half years in prison for conspiring to defraud banks and post offices. He then left the UK in July 2012 to fight for Islamic insurgents in Waziristan in the tribal belt of north-west Pakistan. After leaving the UK he resurfaced on Twitter to share chilling images of a new high-tech bomb-making laboratory he assembled there. The self-declared bomb-maker used the social media platform to distribute information from the Mujahideen Explosives Handbook. He tweeted pictures of multiple pages of handwritten notes on electronic components that could be used to assemble bombs, along with basic information on the chemicals needed to make crude toxins and poisons. In an interview with the Guardian in November 2014 via direct message on Twitter, Tariq said his transition towards a more fundamentalist mindset began in 2000. “It was after … I started reflecting on the creation of God that I came to understand there was a creator who gives life and takes life,” he said. He skipped bail and fled to Pakistan to avoid being tried for fraud in Wolverhamton crown court in April 2005 but said that he was deported back to the UK in October 2007 and subsequently served his sentence for three and a half years. Following his release, he said, he went to the tribal regions of Pakistan “to evict the infidels from our occupied lands and to implement the laws of the almighty God”. While there he said his co-jihadist members were killed in US drone strikes. Asked about his role in Isis he said that he was working in explosives and also trained as a sniper."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/18/jeremy-corbyn-tories-little-fear-jezfest-labour-live","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T07:00:36Z","webTitle":"If walking around JezFest is anything to go by, the Tories have little to fear | Martha Gill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/18/jeremy-corbyn-tories-little-fear-jezfest-labour-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/18/jeremy-corbyn-tories-little-fear-jezfest-labour-live","fields":{"headline":"If walking around JezFest is anything to go by, the Tories have little to fear","bodyText":"There was a tussle over the last cardamom flapjack at the cake stall, there was some bitterness from those who had paid the full £35 for a ticket while others got in for free – but there was one thing everyone at this nice middle-class festival in north London could agree on: the establishment was absolutely terrified of them. “The establishment hate the idea we are coming together to talk about politics,” boomed the Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, speaking at his party’s music and politics festival, Labour Live, on Saturday, to an audience of largely white middle-class men clutching £4 beers. “I congratulate our leadership for having the bravery to put this on”. “Look around you: we are some of the scariest people, we are feared by the establishment,” said a fellow panellist, the Labour MP Dawn Butler, before taking audience questions: a woman who pointed out that hers was the only foreign accent she had heard at the event so far, and a former councillor candidate who wanted specific mental health resources for “people who have stood in elections and failed to win”. Meanwhile, McCluskey homed in on the source of the fear. “The Tories fear Corbyn,” he said. “If Brown or Blair were leading the party now, we’d have already had an election, because the establishment wouldn’t fear them.” This must be because Labour leaders who have made it to No 10 have historically been no threat to the establishment, no threat at all. After all, what could be more establishment than being prime minister? Other groups afraid of the festival – which featured a performance of gentrification-themed spoken-word poetry – included a “sea of hostile media”, who were at that very moment raging against its audacity. Unless they were one of the panel speakers, of course, about a quarter of whom were journalists who work for the national media. Meanwhile, headliners the Magic Numbers, known to your dad for their mellow love songs, made it clear their performance was one in the eye for the man, too. “This is our music; these are rebel songs,” a huge sign said behind them, as their gentle harmonies washed over a field of families digging out lunchtime Tupperware. “Are you in or out?” In between events, buoyed by how livid they were making the powers that be, festival-goers defiantly browsed the stalls: stocking up on almond polenta cake, plastic bottles of wine (£20), and gift cards bearing the slogan “first tea then revolution”, while in the background a guitarist on the main stage sang about “kicking posh boys up the arse”. But the main event - most terrifying of all to the establishment - was yet to come: the appearance of the great and powerful wizard himself. As the crowds gathered rapturously by the main stage, a full 40 minutes before his appearance, it became apparent the whole festival had been something of a warm-up act. First, some stirring songs and chants, then, a short film: Jeremy being applauded by thousands, Jeremy being adored by young female activists, Jeremy walking purposefully along the road to rap music. And finally, an introduction from the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, explaining how annoyed the Daily Mail would be by all this. By the time the leader appeared, they were going absolutely ballistic. And then he started to speak, and it suddenly became apparent why all day his supporters had been talking him up as a fearful threat to the system. The man behind the curtain was no danger to anyone, but a muddled and feeble speaker – rambling in a strained, breathless fashion, in sentences such as this: “This is the first time a political party has ever organised something like this: bringing together music, poetry, creativity; bringing together the inspiration that is there in all of us, to learn from each other, and be strengthened, by that learning, from each other.” Deprived of natural pauses, or sentences that felt like they had ended, the adoring crowds took to cheering whenever Corbyn happened to take a breath. Their leader’s presence was enough: they did not care what he said. But one suspects other voters will be more circumspect. And this is the point. The festival was a show of Corbyn’s power among hardcore Labour supporters – in the event the party claimed some 13,000 of their 20,000 tickets were sold, despite predictions it would be a total failure. It is difficult to imagine another of the country’s political leaders drawing in such a crowd. But politics is about winning over people who do not already agree with you. And as far as this goes, the Tories shouldn’t be too afraid just yet. • Martha Gill is a freelance political journalist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/17/england-eddie-jones-indecision-spats-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T21:39:00Z","webTitle":"Indecision, spats and flogged players – England crumble under Eddie Jones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/17/england-eddie-jones-indecision-spats-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/17/england-eddie-jones-indecision-spats-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Indecision, spats and flogged players – England crumble under Eddie Jones","bodyText":"The Eddie Jones era has been nothing if not educational for the Rugby Football Union. The idea was to hire the world’s most experienced coach, shower him in cash and then sit back and watch him reel in the 2019 World Cup. The only thing Jones will be catching between now and Christmas, at this rate, is a flight back to Australia. Harsh, perhaps, on the guru who steered England to 24 wins in his first 25 matches, but those halcyon days are starting to read like dog-eared fable. England have lost five Tests in succession, are in danger of unravelling as World Cup contenders and, on and off the field, seem to have had the joy and personality sucked out of them. It is reaching a point where their morale is almost as shaken as it was in the aftermath of the 2015 World Cup. Things do not feel entirely right behind the scenes, with Jones’s all-pervasive influence at risk of becoming counter-productive. The players seem caught in a fug of indecision, many of the feted Lions of 12 months ago are shadows of their old selves, assistant coaches are either leaving or communicating publicly in robot-speak and the roster of backroom staff has been allowed to become ridiculously bloated. Worse still, England are acquiring a reputation that will concern the RFU even more than recent results. In addition to a few terse media interviews and unseemly on-field spats, both the coach and a squad member have been drawn into verbal altercations with supporters immediately after games. Travelling English fans staying at the team hotel in Bloemfontein reported even polite requests for pictures were frowned on. They were similarly unimpressed when a senior player jumped a lengthy reception queue saying he had an emergency, which turned out to be requesting an extension lead for his PlayStation. Jones remains a knowledgeable rugby man with a vast repertoire of amusing soundbites but the unhealthy culture he is overseeing needs rebooting. Too few English players are demonstrating an ability to think on their feet and, for whatever reason, good players are being sucked into a tactical morass. Blaming the absence of several players from this tour is a red herring; South Africa have lost hundreds of players to overseas clubs and have been comfortably the better side in the series. Aside from Jonny May, how many England players would make a combined XV picked purely on the evidence of the first two Tests? Nor is Owen Farrell’s first tour as captain proving an auspicious one. Twice his team have made positive starts only to be overtaken by a Springbok side playing with appreciably more belief. The Saracens fly-half’s warrior qualities are well chronicled but schmoozing referees is not his strongest point and the past two weeks have been sobering. “When the pressure has come on we have not been as clear as we should have been,” Farrell said. “We are going to have to figure it out if we are going to start turning it round.” Switching him to his preferred No 10 shirt next season and finding an alternative captain may sound an extreme solution but England cannot afford to rule out anything. It is yet another item for Jones’s bulging in-tray, with the third and final Test in Cape Town on Saturday a dead rubber. South Africa are planning to name a reshuffled side, with Schalk Brits at hooker. Of greater relevance is what may unfold in November, just a year out from the World Cup, when England host the Springboks, New Zealand, Japan and Australia on successive Saturdays. Jones says England require only a “two or three per cent” improvement to turn things around but their descent to sixth place in the world rankings would suggest otherwise. With Billy Vunipola under another injury cloud and more question marks hanging over the front five, the back‑row balance, half-back and midfield, an instant cure is unavailable. The RFU also needs its cricket-loving coach to take a fresh guard. From slagging off the Welsh and Irish and comparing the Bath owner, Bruce Craig, to Donald Trump, to flogging players in training and unsuccessfully preparing in Durban for two Tests at altitude, Jones has not got a great deal off the square lately. Smashing the daylights out of an already weary squad during the Six Nations, ignoring some of the Premiership’s better players for no logical reason, conceding nine tries to the Barbarians, bringing players on tour who probably should have been rested, blooding youngsters only to humiliate them by dragging them off at half-time: it is not an edifying list. A damp forecast for Cape Town is the latest complication; a slower track should theoretically help England but without the two Vunipolas and Ellis Genge they are running short of dynamic ball-carriers. Biting the bullet and giving Danny Cipriani his first England start in a decade has to be one option, with Dan Robson also overdue a start at scrum-half. Neither is weighed down by the frustrating baggage of recent months, both are desperate for a proper chance to alter Jones’s perception of them. England need all the renewed energy and bright ideas they can muster."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jun/17/art-and-authenticity-frida-kahlo-fakes-and-the-fate-of-a-stolen-work","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T16:55:16Z","webTitle":"Art and authenticity: Frida Kahlo, fakes and the fate of a stolen work | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/17/art-and-authenticity-frida-kahlo-fakes-and-the-fate-of-a-stolen-work","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/17/art-and-authenticity-frida-kahlo-fakes-and-the-fate-of-a-stolen-work","fields":{"headline":"Art and authenticity: Frida Kahlo, fakes and the fate of a stolen work","bodyText":"Jonathan Jones’s piece about the Frida Kahlo exhibition at the V&amp;A is right (A shrine to St Frida misses the point – her art, not her stuff, tells us who she is, 13 June). The curators of the show have missed the boat and are looking at the wake. Frida painted my cub scout banner and gave my sister and me hot chocolate on the nearly weekly visits with her when I was growing up in Mexico. Frida is no doubt spinning in her proverbial grave at being twisted and converted into a symbol represented by her stuff – icons to misplaced femininity. Frida’s clothes and trappings served her delightfully, but without her are empty objects that howl with absence. The real Frida is vividly expressed in her paintings. Volumes could be written about what she painted, how she painted, how the objects and symbols in her paintings relate to each other and to us, the viewers. Her profound appreciation of life, including managing pain, and the ways in which she perceived and conceived being embedded in a relation to plants and animals and nature, sing from her canvases. I hope the exhibition will perhaps make some go look at her paintings and listen to what she says in them.

So long as the original artist is dead, and their income not affected, surely the only people injured are the ones who treat art as a form of currency? Take that pension funds that buy pictures then lock them away in vaults till they’ve gained enough value to resell, and hedgies who see everything in terms of cash.

By contributing to the training and financing of the Libyan coastguard, they are consciously participating in interceptions of boats in distress, which not only result in people being sent back to the Libyan hell, but also gravely jeopardises safe, efficient and professional search and rescue activities in international waters. To those of them who have been indifferent to our repeated calls for more coordinated search and rescue capacity in the central Mediterranean and for a European response to the drama on our common shores, we say that time has come to wake up. We urge all EU states to adopt immediately an adequate and common response plan to this tragedy: a European rescue fleet must be deployed and a EU-shared policy must be found for the safe disembarkation of the rescued people in the nearest port of safety. Indifference has resulted in too many deaths; inaction is criminal. As long as there will be people risking their lives at sea, SOS Méditerranée will pursue its mission in the international waters at the doorstep of Europe to search, rescue and testify.

And if you have no idea what Fortnite is, count yourself lucky. It’s this summer’s object of moral panic, an online shoot-’em-up game wildly popular among teenagers and tweenies (and England footballers out in Russia). If you haven’t seen anyone actually playing it then the chances are you’ve seen a child doing the floss, the frenetic dance move the game’s avatars can use as a victory celebration. But it’s what they’re celebrating that has parents worried. Playing war games is a pastime as old as childhood itself, of course, from tin soldiers and pop guns to Action Man and Nerf battles. Parental resistance is useless; when a well-meaning friend banned toy guns, her children defiantly ate their toast into pistol shapes to fire at each other over breakfast. But there’s a rather more disturbing feel to Fortnite, with its faintly Hunger Games-style premise that players parachute on to a cartoon island where their sole task – either alone or in a squad – is to kill anyone they meet, until there’s only one shooter left standing. There’s no blood or gore, so it has a 12 rating. But it’s hard to feel good, all the same, about an immersive game putting a child into the shoes of a sniper. We have reached an uneasy truce in my house, where Fortnite isn’t banned but it is rationed – although arguably not strictly enough. For what singles Fortnite out from other games is the addictive quality it shares with some nonviolent social media apps, and the compulsive behaviour that both seem to encourage in some children. A nine-year-old British girl reportedly wet herself rather than stop playing long enough to go to the loo, hitting her father when he tried to make her stop. School-gate gossip about kids creeping downstairs in the night for a sneaky go while everyone’s asleep, or parents having to physically pull the plug to stop them playing, is rife. What makes it so gripping is partly the fact that the action unfolds live. Unlike other computer games (not to mention a book, or a good old-fashioned board game), you can’t hit pause and come back later; put the console down even for a second, and someone will kill you. As with Snapchat streaks or chain letters, there’s a powerful built-in incentive to keep it going, which seems unlikely to be accidental. And the bitter lesson from alcohol, tobacco and sugar is that addictive substances are more dangerous for some than others. Some adults can easily stop halfway down a bottle of wine; others really can’t. Some people can have just one square of chocolate, others have to finish the bar. Most kids will be obsessed with Fortnite for a while and then get bored, just as they once did with loom bands or Fireman Sam or any other passing craze; but others won’t move on so easily. As with other addictive substances, the lonely, the troubled and those trying to fill an emotional need may be more at risk. And with all due respect to the guest on Radio 4’s Today programme complaining that even when she took her sons to Barbados they just wanted to go on Fortnite, the problem isn’t middle-class kids failing to appreciate expensive holidays. It’s kids hooked on screens in homes where nobody’s even trying to turn them off. Simon Stevens, the head of NHS England, rightly warned this week against the twin threats of childhood obesity and social media fuelling anxiety; they’re inextricably linked. Kids spending hours on the Xbox have less time for calorie-burning physical play or seeing friends in real life. Toddlers permanently glued to iPads aren’t getting enough adult interaction, and teenagers addicted to their phones are often short on sleep. It’s not the act of staring at a screen itself that matters so much as all the other things you’re not doing as a result, as any adult who can’t drag themselves off Twitter will know; and as with all addictions, the red flag is when it’s getting in the way of a normal life. Sensible parenting should go a long way to solving the problem, obviously, but that doesn’t help the children of parents who have either never learned to say no or are overwhelmed by their circumstances. Instagram and Fortnite are free, and there’s not much tweens will happily do for hours that costs no money. There is a reason that effective regulation of booze, fags and sugar has generally involved taking control out of parental hands. But the public health repertoire of age restrictions at point of sale, or “sin taxes”, don’t transfer easily to free online games and apps. What’s left is piling pressure on industry, making it commercially risky for them to ignore their social responsibilities. Can they really not devise more viral kids’ games that don’t revolve around killing (and would the answer change if more developers were female)? Given how much they know about users’ behaviour, can’t social media platforms do more to identify young children opening accounts below the age limit of 13? And now that we understand more about Facebook’s addictive design features, it’s time to identify similar aspects of gaming that may be encouraging children in particular to overdo it, just as happy-hour promotions and dirt-cheap supermarket booze promotions make binge-drinking more likely. There’s nothing wrong with creating a product kids want to use. But deliberately trying to get them hooked crosses an ethical line, which is why the concerns raised by Fortnite will be around long after the game itself has fallen out of fashion. • Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/15/timeline-oxfam-sexual-exploitation-scandal-in-haiti","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T14:41:36Z","webTitle":"Timeline: Oxfam sexual exploitation scandal in Haiti","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/timeline-oxfam-sexual-exploitation-scandal-in-haiti","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/15/timeline-oxfam-sexual-exploitation-scandal-in-haiti","fields":{"headline":"Timeline: Oxfam sexual exploitation scandal in Haiti","bodyText":"A leaked document shows Oxfam must make £16m worth of cuts to jobs and relief programmes as it tries to recover from the fallout over a sexual exploitation scandal involving staff in Haiti. This is how the scandal unfolded. 9 February Oxfam is accused of covering up an investigation into the hiring of sex workers for orgies by staff working in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, which killed thousands. After the investigation the charity allowed three men, including the country director, Roland van Hauwermeiren, to resign, and sacked four for gross misconduct, according to an internal 2011 report seen by the Times. 11 February Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, threatens to cut government funding to Oxfam unless the charity hands over all information on its workers’ use of sex workers in Haiti. Meanwhile, Oxfam is hit with allegations that employees used sex workers in Chad in 2006, when Van Hauwermeiren was running operations there. 12 February The Charity Commission launches a statutory inquiry into Oxfam amid concerns it might not have “fully and frankly disclosed” all details about the Haiti allegations. The charity’s deputy chief executive, Penny Lawrence, resigns, saying she is “desperately sorry”, as Haiti demands the prosecutions of aid workers identified as using sex workers. 13 February The actor Minnie Driver, who was one of 16 celebrity patrons for Oxfam, says she is withdrawing her support “in no uncertain terms” after working with the charity for more than 20 years. At the same time, claims emerge that Van Hauwermeiren had been forced out of another British charity seven years earlier after an investigation into the use of sex workers. 15 February Archbishop Desmond Tutu resigns as an ambassador for Oxfam saying he is “deeply disappointed” by the allegations of “immorality and possible criminality”. 16 February Mark Goldring, the chief executive of Oxfam GB, claims attacks are “out of proportion to the level of culpability”, and accuses critics of an anti-aid agenda. In contrast, the head of Oxfam International, Winnie Byanyima, warns that what happened in Haiti “is a stain on Oxfam that will shame us for years”. 19 February Oxfam fulfils a promise to publish its 2011 inquiry into the Haiti sex abuse, which reveals that three staff who were under investigation physically threatened a colleague to ensure that person’s silence. The charity offers its “humblest apologies” to the Haitian government. 20 February Goldring tells MPs on the international development select committee that the charity has lost 7,000 regular donors since the scandal emerged. 22 February Haiti announces it is temporarily suspending Oxfam GB’s right to work in the country pending an investigation into how the charity handled the sexual exploitation case. The suspension is intended to last for two months. 17 March Oxfam is accused of further failures in Haiti by keeping a senior aid worker there for more than a year despite reported sexual harassment claims. According to an internal report seen by the Times, the charity attempted to “contain” allegations against Raphael Mutiku, an engineer who led Oxfam’s installation of water supplies after the earthquake. Oxfam confirms the decision not to dismiss Mutiku was made by Van Hauwermeiren. 16 May Goldring announces he is to stand down as chief executive at the end of the year, citing the scandal and the need for “fresh vision and energy” at the charity. “We are now laying strong foundations for recovery,” he says. 14 June Haiti announces it is withdrawing Oxfam GB’s right to operate in the country “for violation of Haitian law and serious violation of the principle of the dignity of the human beings”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/17/managing-england-the-impossible-job-review-52-years-of-hurt","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T21:00:24Z","webTitle":"Managing England: The Impossible Job review – tracing 52 years of hurt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/17/managing-england-the-impossible-job-review-52-years-of-hurt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/17/managing-england-the-impossible-job-review-52-years-of-hurt","fields":{"headline":"Managing England: The Impossible Job review – tracing 52 years of hurt","bodyText":"He doesn’t look as if he’s going to score, does he? And he doesn’t. It’s a poor penalty, along the ground and too close to the keeper, who guesses right and saves it easily. “Oh no,” cried Barry Davies, commentating, as England go out of another tournament, on penalties (to the Germans). God, can it really be 22 years ago, Euro 96? That was the last game for the then England manager Terry Venables, although he was always going to go after the competition (time-consuming legal battles, you may remember). The player who missed his spot kick? The current England manager, who has his first game in charge at a major tournament tomorrow. “Those experiences helped me in this role,” he – Gareth Southgate, one of five England bosses to take part in this timely, thorough and thoroughly enjoyable doc – says. Hope so, Gareth. The story doesn’t begin there, of course, but 30 years earlier. All football stories begin in 1966. They really knew how to go in hard in those days, didn’t they? No, not Norman Hunter with his tackles, the journalists with their questions. “I must say I’m not terribly sure how to start this interview – do we start by calling you Sir Alfred?” a plummy Fleet Street man asks Alf Ramsey. Well, I guess Alf earned the respect; he did actually win the thing. After Alf, Don – forgettably and regrettably – then Ron. England managers had proper names back then. Greenwood might have had longer if Kevin Keegan hadn’t headed a sitter wide against Spain in 1982. Future managers have a habit of messing it up for current ones (keep an eye on the future Sir Raheem in Russia). Look, Hoddle does it, too, just lets Maradona through to score his first in Mexico in 1986. Yes, Sir Bobby and the hand of God, and Glenn who had the ear of God, between them Turnip Graham and El Tel. Next Kev, then Sven the Swede, who had a private life that wasn’t private and not the best relationship with the tabs, on account of being foreign. He’s here to talk about it, sportingly. After Sven, Steve (McClaren, also easily – and best – forgotten, the wally with a brolly) and Fabio, who still hasn’t bothered to learn the lingo, although the translation is nice. “We get to the World Cup and there’s that ghost smothering you with its white tentacles.” Hodgson speaks well, too: “As founder fathers, we regard ourselves as custodians of the game.” But when you go out to Iceland, there are no words. And no job. “It’s not an impossible job, because people keep doing it,” says Big Sam, who – impossibly – kept doing it for just one game, before being stung. Still, he does have the best win rate of all of them: 100%. Now Gareth, with it all to do and a lot to make up for. I have, after 22 years, just about forgiven you for the lame penalty, but not for the Pizza Hut ad afterwards. Cashing in on your own mistake and your nation’s – and my – misery. There’s only one way to make amends for that: win it. You may still be on the first season of Atlanta, the last two episodes of which went out on BBC Two on Sunday. Or you may have begun the new one, Atlanta: Robbin’ Season, which started at the same time on Fox, if you have that. Which makes it tricky to discuss meaningfully or in any kind of detail. So, not very meaningfully and with little detail ... Man of the moment Donald Glover’s sort-of-comedy is possibly the best – almost certainly the freshest – TV around right now. It is funny, observing Glover’s Earn help his cousin Alfred, AKA Paper Boi (so brilliantly convincing by Brian Tyree Henry), try to make it as a rap artist. So it’s about that and about music industry bullshit, and all sorts of other bullshit, and family, and pressure, Atlanta, the South, race, all kinds of prejudices, and what it is to be black and male in the US … as well as being a vehicle for Glover’s subtle, sharp, poignant, minutely observed, human humour. It’s not giving too much away to say that the new Robbin’ Season begins with a robbery – of a fast food chicken joint. It’s a front, the restaurant, for a drug stash. And the robbery’s a kind of front, too, because it is soon apparent there are all sorts of other kinds of robbing going on – not just of money, but also dignity, respect and hope. Glover – Henry, too, I hope – will continue to run off with all the awards. Oh, and there’s a cool cameo in the first episode, from an alligator. An excellent alligator, with a lot of attitude. He looks like he wouldn’t hesitate to rob you of a limb or two. Can’t say much else, except that to not get involved would be to rob yourself."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/22/dave-eggers-interview-circle-lifters","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T11:00:26Z","webTitle":"Dave Eggers: ‘I always picture Trump hiding under a table’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/22/dave-eggers-interview-circle-lifters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/22/dave-eggers-interview-circle-lifters","fields":{"headline":"Dave Eggers: ‘I always picture Trump hiding under a table’","bodyText":"I am attracted to purpose,” Dave Eggers says. People need it, he believes, and so do nations. Much of his fiction has reflected on the loss of an American sense of purpose, the decay of the dream; much of his non-fiction has told the stories of immigrants to the US who have shown the drive and generosity missing from the country as a whole. In person, as in his work, Eggers combines an openness to describing darkness and tragedy with a faith in the essential goodness of “everyday people”. He tells me that “whenever there’s a moment when people are inspired to make the world better, I get interested. I’m super corny that way.” The most recent of Eggers’s many books is The Lifters, a magic realist tale written for eight- to 12-year-olds, in which the “adults have lost hope, lost their way, and it’s the kids who say: ‘Here’s the task, let’s get to it.’” The setting is a town that used to be proudly defined by what it manufactured, but has been gutted by sadness and loss of identity. Carousel is collapsing in on itself, with sinkholes appearing everywhere; it is up to children – the “lifters” – to go underground and prop up its foundations, and those of other disconsolate places around the world. The Lifters begins with Gran, a boy new to Carousel and ignored by his classmates; he runs into a brick wall just to prove he exists. The only friend he makes is the enigmatic Catalina Catalan, whom he follows into the woods and one night sees disappear into a hillside. “You went into the hill,” he said. “No I didn’t,” she said … “I saw a handle in your hand … I saw a stairway … And a huge room … It was lit up like a church”. “No it wasn’t.” When Gran eventually becomes a lifter himself, the two take a journey to a convention of tunnel-dwellers deep in the Earth’s mantle and confront a force known as “the Hollows”. Catalina was the first character in his mind, the author says. He wanted to capture her knowledge that “she is solely responsible for holding up everything above ground … I am obsessed with giving kids responsibility. We want to protect them, so we give them less and less to do, but they respond to having a task. I mean, I’m not arguing for child labour, but … ” He has talked of children as “heroes in waiting, they just want to be given the opportunity to prove it”. In saying this, Eggers is drawing on his experience with “all the kids I’ve met here”: across the road from where we are talking in San Francisco is 826 Valencia, the young writers’ centre he founded in 2002, which is fronted by a shop selling pirate supplies. He asked students at the centre, and its equivalents across the US, to read The Lifters at proof stage: “They are the purest readers, because they want to be entertained, but they will also point out errors, inconsistencies.” He took all their edits. They are also discerning, he says, grasping “the connection straight away between the Hollows and the mood of the town. Children get it at a bone level; they generally know where there is pain in their house, and they speak about it candidly.” It sometimes seems as though Eggers is waging a one-man war against cynicism: both of the magazines with which he is associated, McSweeney’s and the Believer, were begun as responses to a more acerbic literary culture. Certainly, he is drawn to children’s sense of wonder, enthusiasm and fun. His mother (whose original name was McSweeney) was a “pre-school teacher … brilliant at knowing what kids really felt and liked”, and his teenage years were spent as a camp counsellor and running a sports camp: communicating to kids has been central to his life. Toph, the young brother the 21-year-old Eggers looked after following their parents’ deaths – as recounted in his career-making memoir A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius – joined the camp when he was four. Eggers trained as an illustrator, and it has felt natural “circling back” to write the clutch of children’s books that have followed his work on the screenplay of Maurice Sendak’s Where the Wild Things Are. There is, he continues, “no more fun you can have than writing a pure adventure story for the reader that you were at 10”. Eggers has said that, as a child, all he ever wore were grey and brown clothes; that his own parents not once went out in the evening; that his father drank and, like Gran’s, was sometimes out of work: “I can remember feeling responsible for my mother’s happiness.” Also, at school, there was his “ludicrous” name: I was Ham and Eggers,” he has recalled. “Egghead, Egg Beater. Eggs was the nicest way anyone would put it.” But he draws directly on only two personal experiences in his depiction of Gran: the excruciating time he wet himself at school, wearing khakis, and tried to cover it up at lunch by spilling milk over himself; and “the game the boys had in fifth grade when we’d form a circle and take turns to kick each other in the head”. A very early image Eggers had in writing The Lifters was a “sinkhole in the middle of Gran’s school”. The symbolism is obvious: “This country makes no lasting commitment to education; funding is woefully inadequate.” In the book, teachers simply work around the yawning hole in their building, as in life they adapt to insufficient money and just “reschedule a few classes … this is how we run our public education system. Spit and glue and ScotchTape, and no leadership from DC.” But before the sinkholes in his imagination were the hills. “I grew up in the flattest part of the country, the midwest,” he says. “And the landscape of my imagination was … stormy, grey, bright green hills.” Walking with his own two children (Eggers is married to the writer Vendela Vida) in just this kind of landscape north of his home in the Bay Area, he used to share a fantasy: “What if you had a handle and you could open up a door that led inside the hillside?” It’s a variation of such classic secret-door children’s fiction as the Narnia books, “The Pied Piper of Hamelin” and Coraline. When a few years ago he spent time in another hilly part of the country, rust-belt Pennsylvania, with its “crooked houses on the slopes, pawn shops and empty storefronts”, the narrative of The Lifters – in which purpose overcomes sadness to restore pride and identity – took shape. Eggers has long written about the decline of US manufacturing, not least in his novel A Hologram for the King (Tom Hanks starred as the dispossessed hero Alan Clay in the film adaptation), and is careful not to situate The Lifters specifically in the age of Trump. Finishing the story during the runup to the presidential election, however, he “couldn’t help” inserting the detail that one potential leader of Carousel campaigns on an imaginary threat from outsiders (in this case, the outsiders are moose). The opposing candidate runs on a platform of more cash for parks and schools. The election of Trump is “just absolutely crushing for anyone with an optimistic view of our citizenry,” Eggers says. This is especially the case as his understanding of American values is closely bound up with immigration. “It wasn’t until I moved to California,” in the early 1990s, “that I was able to appreciate how profoundly enriched I am, and we all are, by every new arrival … Our strength comes from our welcome and our identity as a haven and a blank canvas that anyone is free to paint on. And I’m enraged and offended by anyone who makes this into a fearful place. Maybe that’s a patriotic thing … I always picture Trump hiding under a table, because he’s afraid of everything: he’s afraid of Mexicans, Muslims, he’s afraid of change. He’s a deeply fearful human who has never acted courageously in his life.” “Any time immigrants are villainised, scapegoated or threatened,” he continues, “it’s an outrage. It comes from a cowardly place. You have a privileged 72-year-old white man who is villainising families from war-torn countries who are coming here for a better life – that’s pure ignorance, and it’s irrational and not strong and not American.” The day before we talk, Eggers has been organising an event with Valentino Deng, the Sudanese “Lost Boy” who found his way to the US, and whose traumatic experiences he channelled into What Is the What, a book Barack Obama advised every one of his White House aides to read. His second interview-based book to explore how outsiders remake America, Zeitoun, is the story of a Muslim house-painter from the Syrian town of Jableh, who helped the victims of Hurricane Katrina but was arrested as a terrorist. This year, Eggers published The Monk of Mokha, about the entrepreneur Mokhtar Alkhanshali, who narrowly escaped Yemen’s civil war, fleeing in a fishing boat with two cases of coffee. The stories of Abdulrahman Zeitoun and Alkhanshali turned out to be more complicated in real life, but Eggers says he is drawn to people, such as the latter, who are “so driven by an idea, and their ability to realise it, that they attract other humans to their light”. When dwelling on America’s loss of a clear sense of identity, Eggers often refers to the cancellation of the space shuttle programme. He has always been a space enthusiast and attended the final launch in 2011, an experience he tells me he found “very painful”. “Everyone was crying,” he has said: “The shuttle was such a powerful emblem of a sense of optimism and a can-do spirit.” The space programme finds a place in both A Hologram for the King and the less accomplished Your Fathers, Where Are They? And the Prophets, Do They Live Forever? The remaining novel in Eggers’s unofficial trilogy about a souring of the American spirit is the biggest seller – The Circle (a film last year). A broad-brushed dystopian thriller about privacy and digital technology, it was often referenced during the recent tribulations of Facebook. Published in 2013, it “was supposed to be set about five years in the future – so about now,” he says. “After it came out, I’d speak at colleges and ask the students: how conflicted are you about your relationship with technology and social media? About half of them would raise their hands. And I would ask: how many of you are suspicious of the motives and ethics of the companies who purvey this technology to you? Maybe a third would raise their hands. And then over time it changed. Perhaps a little before the election but certainly afterwards, 100% raised their hands in answer to each question. The trust in those companies is lost.” “It reminds me,” he says, “of what happened to the tobacco companies, which I covered as a journalist in the 1990s, where after a point nobody believed anything they said. If you smoked, you knew exactly what you were getting into – all the risks. You knew the companies were evil, but you did it because you were addicted. Well, people are addicted to social media. They know the companies are voraciously profit-driven and completely uninterested in privacy or any rights of the individual. But they carry on using the tools because their friends are using them and there’s nothing better. “Facebook is still Facebook. It went through a little dip; how many people deleted their accounts? People have a high tolerance for being surveilled. I think it will have to get even more poisonous and destructive before there’s a real change. Social media separates and isolates us … Any time you’re next to an actual human … you can find common ground. Humans in person are kind and giving and generous. But online, you see an inversion of every good quality … We are at our best in person.” The response of Eggers, who remains an untiring and inspiring literary activist, is to focus on personal stories. He mentions a young Ethiopian-American girl he has just encountered at one of the tutoring centres: “Any time you’re cynical about the world, meet a first-generation kid who writes about what she’s grateful for.” He admits he has found the last couple of years “crushing to a point when I do wake up paralysed sometimes” – and his next novel is “incredibly dark”; he has been wading through “terrible footage and files”. But writing children’s stories has helped. Plus his belief in individual drive and purpose is unwavering. “On this block,” he says, “I could introduce you to nine people whose stories would make interesting books … If you’re listening, the stories are never-ending” • • The Lifters is published by Scholastic.

Salvini, the leader of the League party, has long been at odds with Francis over the issue of migration, the pope’s outreach to Muslims and his calls for Europe to integrate migrant communities. The rift seemed to take a turn for the worse late last week, when a photograph emerged of an amicable meeting between Salvini and Burke, a staunch conservative. It was not their first encounter. The pair have met on two other occasions, according to a Vatican watcher who is close to Burke. The US cardinal, one of four to sign an openly critical letter to Francis last year questioning guidance that allows priests to determine whether remarried Catholics could receive communion, has praised Donald Trump and adopted a far more critical stance on migrants than the pope. The meeting was unusual because the new Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has not yet had a formal meeting with Francis. Salvini’s controversial decisions on migration have created the impression that he is setting Italy’s agenda. Burke is seen as the ringleader of a faction of the Catholic church opposed to Francis. Like Salvini, he counts the far-right populist Steve Bannon, who is Catholic and formerly served as a White House strategist for Trump, as a confidante. Salvini was criticised before the 4 March election when he brandished a rosary during an election event and swore to remain faithful to Italians. Salvini is Catholic and reportedly attends mass but he is divorced and lives with a partner. Any possible alliance between Salvini and Burke, a reactionary who has blamed “radical feminism” for marginalising men and was once demoted by Francis, is noteworthy given how critical Salvini has been about the pope. When a Catholic newspaper criticised Salvini in 2016, he responded by saying: “My pope is Benedict.” That was a reference to Francis’s conservative predecessor who resigned in 2013, an act not witnessed in the Catholic church for centuries. Francis has since been a tough critic of capitalism and the exploitation of the developing world, and has suggested it is a Christian duty to treat migrants with dignity and respect. He has, however, steered clear of becoming involved in Italian politics, preferring instead to focus on the “global church” and seeking to decentralise power away from Rome. He appeared to have a good relationship with Matteo Renzi, the former centre-left prime minister, but did not get involved in his campaign to make civil unions legal in Italy. The pope did, however, speak at length last week about the importance of treating migrants with respect. The fact that he made his comments as Salvini turned away the Aquarius rescue ship with 630 migrants on board and said all non-Italian ships would be barred from entering Italian ports, may not have been a coincidence. “I would like to point out that the issue of migration is not simply one of numbers, but of persons, each with his or her own history, culture, feelings and aspirations,” Francis said. “These persons, our brothers and sisters, need ongoing protection, independently of whatever migrant status they may have,.” His comments may not, however, carry much influence. “The church does not have the political influence it used to have,” said Giovanni Orsina, a political historian at Luiss University in Rome. “The Italian public opinion is with Salvini, and they don’t care what the church says.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/17/brexit-no-plan-except-obfuscation-theresa-may","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T06:00:07Z","webTitle":"Now there is no plan for Brexit except obfuscation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/17/brexit-no-plan-except-obfuscation-theresa-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/17/brexit-no-plan-except-obfuscation-theresa-may","fields":{"headline":"Now there is no plan for Brexit except obfuscation","bodyText":"‘Neither Labour nor the Tories have a credible plan for Brexit,” declared Lord Macpherson, former top official at the Treasury, on Twitter. This distinguished civil servant, who has seen ministers of both major parties grapple with economic crises, went on to ask: “Have the British people ever been so ill-served by the two main parties?” It is no wonder that the EU negotiator, the estimable Michel Barnier, finds himself, week in and week out, having to point out that all the imaginative solutions with which he is presented by the British have, indeed, to be left to the imagination. Theresa May’s “leadership” of the Conservative party, and, alas, of the nation, has become an exercise in obfuscation. Remain MPs emerge from private meetings with the premier to speak of reassurances, then are treated the following morning to a rather different spin being put on the meetings by No 10 – after, that is, enough of them have voted to save her parliamentary skin. The commentators inform us frequently that the reason why the prime minister is in such an ambivalent position is that she is trying to reconcile the two wings of her party. But this conjures up a false impression that the Leave and Remain wings are of equal weight. They are not. It is common knowledge that the majority of MPs are increasingly of the view that to go ahead with Brexit would be a mistake. It is just that the prominent Brexiters manage, well, to be all too prominent. As the economic news gets worse and worse, Brexit would, to use an old classical metaphor, be “to pile Pelion upon Ossa”. Since the referendum, our economy has slowed almost to stagnation, with industrial production actually falling in the latest three-month period. Within two years we have gone from being the fastest-growing of the major European economies to the slowest, with the Bank of England repeatedly having to eat its words about prospective increases in interest rates because the wage inflation it worries about keeps failing to materialise. The outgoing president of the CBI, Paul Drechsler, could hardly have been franker last week in saying what a mess the Brexit nonsense has created for businesspeople who, unlike the Brexit brigade, think plans have their uses. Drechsler said: “In the world of business, we’re frustrated. We’re angry.” Business was interested in the economy, the politicians were “playing politics”. Now, obviously politicians are by definition in the business of “playing politics”; the problem for UK plc in 2018 is that the leaders of both major parties are putting party above country when country faces the biggest economic crisis of my entire career. Now, losing no time in backtracking on the interpretation put on her Tuesday assurances, the prime minister has said that the latest “new amendment” would not permit parliament to “direct or micromanage” the final stage of exit talks. “I cannot,” says the Brexit-means-Brexit prime minister, “countenance parliament being able to overturn the will of the people.” The “will of the people” comes up time and time again. Insofar as it means anything, it means that on 23 June 2016 there was a referendum suggesting that 37% of the adult population said they wanted to leave the EU. In other words, this was the will of 37% of those eligible to vote (just over a third) and 51.9% of those who turned out to vote: the will of half the people. My point is that the 51.9%, or 37%, should now be asked, as the economic cost of even the prospect of Brexit becomes more evident, “did you vote to become poorer?” As a letter-writer to the Times wrote last week: “I cannot imagine that the vast swaths of voters in the north-east voted for a lower level of living standards and higher unemployment.” Now, although many commentators give the impression that most Brexit voters were deprived working-class people worried about immigration, I know plenty of well-heeled upper-middle-class voters who voted on the basis of a misunderstanding of the degree to which “Brussels” supposedly impinges on our sovereignty. But they can afford to become poorer, or take precautionary action: many have marvelled at the cheek of my old friend Lord Lawson taking up formal residency in France, and that oddball Jacob Rees-Mogg setting up an investment vehicle in Dublin. None of the alternative “soft Brexit” options is anywhere near as satisfactory as the “have your cake and eat it” position we are already in. I had hoped, and still do, that our elected representatives can come to the rescue. Meanwhile, Barnier and our continental friends are to be encouraged in their efforts to try to save Britain from itself."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/16/world-cup-expected-to-boost-uk-sales-of-big-screen-tvs","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T07:00:39Z","webTitle":"World Cup expected to boost UK sales of big-screen TVs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/16/world-cup-expected-to-boost-uk-sales-of-big-screen-tvs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/16/world-cup-expected-to-boost-uk-sales-of-big-screen-tvs","fields":{"headline":"World Cup expected to boost UK sales of big-screen TVs","bodyText":"Football fans are expected to go on a World Cup-fuelled TV buying binge this weekend before England’s first match of the 2018 tournament. John Lewis said it sold 140% more big-screen TVs, 55in (140cm) or more, on Thursday, when Robbie Williams performed at the opening ceremony in Moscow, compared with the same day last year. The retailer expects that pace of growth to continue, or even rise, this weekend. Advances in technology has led to ever larger screens. The best selling sizes this year are 55in and 70in, according to John Lewis. In 2010 the best sellers were 36in when South Africa hosted the World Cup. Overall sales of TVs at John Lewis so far this year are double the same period in 2017, while 70in screen sales increased 150% last week. “The World Cup definitely seems to be having a big effect on customers,” said Suddy Bhardwaj, TV buyer at the retailer. He said the increase in demand was not just about football but about a change in viewing habits, and that a fall in the price of big screen TVs was making them more affordable to families who increasingly wanted a “cinema experience” at home. While it has traditionally been men who drove demand for large televisions, Bhardwaj suggested that was now changing. “It feels like there’s a new market in the way people view TVs. Netflix and huge programmes like Game of Thrones coupled with services like Deliveroo and the ability to have restaurant-quality food at home means that people are bringing the cinema and dining experience home.” Sales of TV soundbars were doing particularly well, while drinks fridges were up by a fifth and corner sofas by 220%. Argos said its sales were up by more than a third this week, compared with the same time last year. It said sales of TVs with screens of 65 inches or more had nearly doubled in the last 12 months. Market research firm GfK predicts that ultra-high definition and 4K technology TVs will massively outsell other sets in May and June. “This year’s World Cup sees the most 4K-quality broadcasts than ever before, which is really driving customers to invest in 4K TVs as well as large screens,” said Nick Hill, consumer electronics trading manager at Argos. The mini sales boom is a fillip for retailers who are struggling amid rising costs just as shoppers rein in spending on non-essentials partly because of inflation in food and fuel prices. But they will be praying that England, who kick off their World Cup campaign on Monday, go beyond the group stages as an early exit could mean sales of 66,000 less TVs than hoped for, according to GfK. While predicting 8.8% more TVs will be sold this year than last, GfK says the long-term trend indicates a steady decline in TV set purchases. In 2010, 9.6m TVs were sold in the UK, falling to just 5m last year, according to the firm. And even with the World Cup boost this year only 5.5m TVs are expected to be sold compared with the 6.5m in 2014, the last World Cup year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2018/jun/19/jobs-a-good-un-how-students-can-fund-their-university-education","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T10:50:24Z","webTitle":"Job's a good 'un: how students can fund their university education","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jun/19/jobs-a-good-un-how-students-can-fund-their-university-education","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/jun/19/jobs-a-good-un-how-students-can-fund-their-university-education","fields":{"headline":"Job's a good 'un: how students can fund their university education","bodyText":"Advising your child about work and study can be tricky – both the pressures of university and the world of work have changed drastically over the past two decades. But rising fees and costs have forced more students into working to support themselves. Here’s how to help them get the most out of that part-time job. First, match jobs to studies if you can. There’s nothing wrong with working behind a bar or in a warehouse, but students should also consider trying to find something that’s relevant to their degree subject, or the career they are considering. “At the start of the autumn semester, many universities organise their own part-time jobs and volunteering fairs,” says Paul Fennell, head of careers and employability at the University of Sheffield. “There, students can meet employers with part-time vacancies in retail, finance, web development, customer service, marketing and more.” Second, find a balance. It’s generally recommended that students don’t work more than 12–16 hours per week if they are studying full-time – any more could adversely affect their studies. Encourage them to think about how they’re going to balance these demands, and keep lines of communication open. “Talk to your prospective students about the importance of staying connected with friends and loved ones,” says Priscilla Preston, director of student services at Leeds Beckett University. “Working and studying can feel overwhelming, becoming a barrier to maintaining those ties with others. Yet it’s those ties that can help to keep things in perspective if students are feeling lonely or isolated.” Also, bear in mind that many universities run their own job search agencies, where jobs are checked for fair rates. There’s also usually plenty of work available at the university itself, from working in the student shop to being a student ambassador. “We would always recommend students use their university job searching team as their first port of call when looking for work, as they can advise on local employers who recruit students and also what opportunities to avoid,” says Fennell. “If a job sounds too good to be true, it probably is!” Whatever job your child ends up with during their time at university, it’s a good idea for them to keep a log of the skills they acquire. Post-university job applications will all be boosted by skills and experience gained while working in those part-time positions – whether that’s communication skills learned behind a counter or working as a team when catering for a big event. They’ll all come in useful when it comes to compiling a CV."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/15/govia-thameslink-railway-boss-quits-over-timetable-fiasco","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T11:41:43Z","webTitle":"Govia Thameslink Railway boss quits over timetable fiasco","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/15/govia-thameslink-railway-boss-quits-over-timetable-fiasco","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/15/govia-thameslink-railway-boss-quits-over-timetable-fiasco","fields":{"headline":"Govia Thameslink Railway boss quits over timetable fiasco","bodyText":"The boss of Govia Thameslink Railway has quit over the rail timetable fiasco, after being singled out for blame by the transport secretary, Chris Grayling. Network Rail executives have also forfeited annual bonuses for their role in the timetable chaos. Charles Horton, chief executive of GTR, which includes Thameslink, Great Northern, Southern and Gatwick Express, said he recognised passengers’ huge frustration, after weeks of cancellations and severe delays to services following the introduction of new timetables on 20 May. Horton, who has overseen a tumultuous few years on Britain’s biggest commuter franchise, including years of strikes on Southern in the row over the future of guards, will remain in post for a short period until a temporary timetable to ease the present disruption is announced in July. GTR’s owners, the Go-Ahead group, said a successor would be announced in due course. David Brown, group chief executive of Go-Ahead, said: “I would like to thank Charles for his hard work with Govia for the past 15 years. Under often challenging conditions, he has built a team to deliver the largest railway change programme for decades, on a franchise that is not only the UK’s biggest, but which has also the highest passenger growth. “We are committed to working with the Department for Transport and Network Rail to address recent problems and to deliver a reliable, punctual service for passengers.” Horton said: “I recognise that passengers have been hugely frustrated at the significant disruption caused by the introduction of new timetables. It is the right time to hand leadership of GTR to a new pair of hands. “I am immensely proud of my team and I would like to thank my 7,000 colleagues at GTR for all their hard work over the past four years.” Meanwhile, the chief executive and chief financial officer of Network Rail have volunteered to forego bonuses of £74,000 and £38,000 respectively this year. Its chairman, Sir Peter Hendy, confirmed that Mark Carne and Jeremy Westlake both wrote to him on Thursday stating they would not accept any bonus for the last year, in which delays in engineering works and confirming timetables were a large contributory factor to rail chaos, particularly for passengers on Northern. Carne, who is the highest paid public sector official in Britain with a £750,000 annual salary, was made a CBE last week, ahead of his retirement later this year. Horton is due to appear with Network Rail representatives and others at a Commons transport select committee hearing on Monday to answer questions about GTR’s role in the timetable meltdown, which saw more than 8,000 trains cancelled in the first three weeks since the change on GTR, and 5,000-6,000 on Northern. Although blame has been shared by Network Rail, and many in the industry have questioned the actions of the Department for Transport, Grayling claimed Horton had assured him the timetable change would work in a meeting shortly before it was implemented. Emily Yates, of the Association of British Commuters, said Horton’s resignation was overdue, given years of trouble on Southern before the current crisis: “He should have been sacked a long time ago – along with the transport secretary.” The RMT union welcomed the resignation. The general secretary, Mick Cash said: “For well over two years now RMT members fighting to defend safety and access have been subjected to abuse and hostility under the regime led by Charles Horton. “The Horton resignation opens the door for this sorry chapter to be brought to a close and that means sweeping GTR away and returning the services to public ownership with safety, access and quality the guiding priorities.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2018/jun/15/flagship-free-school-had-group-of-predatory-pupils-roaming-grounds","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T13:04:38Z","webTitle":"Flagship free school had 'predatory pupils' roaming grounds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jun/15/flagship-free-school-had-group-of-predatory-pupils-roaming-grounds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/jun/15/flagship-free-school-had-group-of-predatory-pupils-roaming-grounds","fields":{"headline":"Flagship free school had 'predatory pupils' roaming grounds","bodyText":"Standards at a flagship free school have hit “rock bottom” with a group of “predatory pupils” roaming the institution and making others feel unsafe, a report has revealed. Teachers, students and parents were told last week, before the education watchdog released its report, that the Discovery school in Newcastle would close for good at the end of the academic year. Ofsted staff were called in for a snap inspection after safeguarding concerns were raised when a child was left in London during a school trip in March. Their report revealed that staff were unable to cope with bad and sometimes dangerous behaviour, while teaching quality plummeted and children were left “underachieving”. Inspectors said that last year the progress made by year 11 pupils was in the bottom 1% nationally and below minimum government standards. Rating the institution as “inadequate” the report said there was ineffective safeguarding and there had been several serious incidents. In more detailed findings about behaviour, Ofsted inspectors wrote: “A hard core of pupils display riotous behaviour and they roam the school in a predatory manner. The small numbers of girls and others who are singled out as different are vulnerable and do not always feel safe. “The frequency of dangerous and unacceptable behaviour is shockingly high.” Inspectors described the behaviour of year 9 pupils being so bad that they were barred from using machinery or the computer suite because of safety concerns. The report claimed racism, sexism and bullying were prevalent, with pupils sharing “depressing testimony of their ordeals and perceived lack of adult support” with inspectors. The government withdrew funding for the specialist science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (Stem) school before its second-ever Ofsted report. Opened in 2014, at a reported cost of £9m, the free school invited students from across north-east England to experience an “alternative option to a traditional school”. But during its first inspection in July 2017 inspectors said it had a “narrow and unbalanced” curriculum that was “failing to meet pupils’ needs”. Its governing body, overseen by the NCG group, which also runs Newcastle college, was told there were key failings in its responsibilities, including in overseeing safeguarding. The school has struggled to attract pupils; despite having capacity for up to 700 pupils, it currently has just 228 enrolled. The school will close at the end of the academic year. A spokesperson said: “Clearly this Ofsted report makes for difficult reading and the depth and severity of the comments were a key factor in the decision to close the school.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/16/1bn-needed-to-stave-off-crisis-say-social-care-bosses","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T23:01:29Z","webTitle":"£1bn needed to stave off crisis, say social care bosses","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/16/1bn-needed-to-stave-off-crisis-say-social-care-bosses","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/16/1bn-needed-to-stave-off-crisis-say-social-care-bosses","fields":{"headline":"£1bn needed to stave off crisis, say social care bosses","bodyText":"Social care bosses have written to the prime minister urging her to invest at least £1bn to stave off a growing crisis in services for elderly and disabled people and relieve pressure on the NHS. A letter to Theresa May from the president of the Association of Directors of Adult Services (Adass), Glen Garrod, says action to address immediate pressures faced by councils and care providers is becoming “increasingly urgent”. The intervention comes amid fears that while May is poised to invest up to £6bn extra in the NHS to mark its 70th anniversary, social care will be ignored, despite acknowledgement that health service fortunes are closely linked to those of social care. Earlier this week Adass warned that the social care market in parts of England was close to collapse after years of cuts, potentially leaving thousands of vulnerable adults without care. Since 2010, council social care budgets have shrunk by £7bn. The letter, seen by the Guardian, says that directors of adult social services “have never been more fearful” that a major private provider of care could go bust as a result of rising cost pressures, with potentially “calamitous” consequences for any older and disabled people left high and dry by such an outcome. It accepts that the public finances are tight, but says a £1bn fund to deliver specific goals, such as injecting cash into the struggling care homes sector and funding care at home for up to 50,000 older and disabled people, would both stabilise the care market and relieve pressure on the NHS. It says: “We agree that the NHS needs a longer term funding settlement ahead of the next spending review. But as the government has acknowledged, the NHS and social care are interdependent systems. The NHS will never work properly, whatever its level of funding, without adequate funding of adult social care services. “In the same way that the NHS needs a multi-year funding settlement ahead of the next spending review, adult social care needs additional investment ahead of the local government financial settlement and forthcoming green paper.” The government has promised a long term overhaul of social care funding via a green paper expected in the next few weeks. But social care leaders are optimistic that ministers recognise the urgency of the crisis facing the sector and are open to finding extra money for social care if it can guarantee specific benefits. Ministers last year provided an extra £2.6bn over three years for council social care budgets through a combination of grants and a special ringfenced council tax precept. But councils say this provided only temporary relief."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/21/love-songs-the-hidden-history-by-ted-gioia-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T09:00:07Z","webTitle":"Love Songs: The Hidden History by Ted Gioia review – a fascinating study of origins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/21/love-songs-the-hidden-history-by-ted-gioia-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/21/love-songs-the-hidden-history-by-ted-gioia-review","fields":{"headline":"Love Songs: The Hidden History by Ted Gioia review – a fascinating study of origins","bodyText":"In this wide-ranging and fascinating study, music historian Ted Gioia examines the surprisingly ancient and diverse origins of the love song and its enduring power over us. He argues that love songs are “as old as human history” and that rather than being a mere cultural meme, they are, a “quasi-biological necessity”. Although romantic love may not have been a subject in early societies, Gioia traces the love song’s origins back to ancient fertility rites, such as those performed some 4,000 years ago by Enheduanna, the high priestess and poetess of Ur, “the first female author”. Crucially, the ancient texts of Sumer, Egypt, Rome and China show that “human love can partake of the transcendent” as well as the orgasmic. In a remarkable chapter, heThe author reveals how our idealised notions of romance first emerged not with the troubadours, but in the songs of elite female slaves (the qiyan) in the medieval Arab culture of Spain. Taking in the contribution of African American slaves, he concludes that “the very essence of western song has been shaped by the mentality of the indentured and outcast”. • Love Songs: The Hidden History by Ted Gioia (Oxford, £17.99).

Why can’t we just do it?” The one-day summit, aimed at reducing the threat from nuclear-armed North Korea, went ahead as planned on Tuesday. But on Thursday night, citing two people “familiar with preparations for the event”, the Washington Post said the president’s impatience and a “tense” staff meeting with North Korean officials left “left some aides fearful that the entire summit might be in peril”. In a Friday morning interview on the White House lawn with Fox &amp; Friends, meanwhile, Trump risked provoking critics when he said the North Korean dictator was “the strong head” of his country. “He speaks and his people sit up at attention,” Trump said. “I want my people to do the same.” The president also claimed his predecessor in the White House, Barack Obama, had been “essentially ready to go to war with North Korea”, and claimed to have “solved” the problem of the nuclear threat from Pyongyang. The Post cited “people familiar with the talks” in reporting how Trump’s request to move the summit was parried by senior members of his administration. “Ultimately,” the Post wrote, “Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders persuaded Trump to stick with the original plan, arguing that the president and his team could use the time to prepare.” “They also,” the report said, “warned him that he might sacrifice wall-to-wall television coverage of his summit if he abruptly moved the long-planned date to Monday in Singapore, which would be Sunday night in the United States.” On Friday Trump’s remarks – and a video statement issued later – had to compete for TV attention with the president’s fierce criticism of a Department of Justice report, the FBI and its former director James Comey; the jailing of his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort; and the president’s announcement of tariffs against China, prompting retaliatory measures from Beijing. Trump’s preparation for the meeting with Kim was long a point of contention. In May, after North Korea criticised his vice-president, Mike Pence, Trump said the summit was cancelled. He later said his approach was not about preparation but “about attitude”, then told a press conference in Canada he would know “within the first minute” if the summit would be a success. After meeting Kim, he told reporters he and the dictator “got to know each other well in a very confined period of time”. The Trump-Kim summit has been widely criticised in the US, in most part for the failure to secure written commitment to North Korean denuclearisation, which the Trump administration has repeatedly demanded. Trump told Fox on Friday “it’s in the agreement, it says ‘he will denuclearise’” after a summit from which “we get everything”. Sanctions on North Korea would be “off when we’re sure there’s no more nuclear”, he said. In fact, the agreement says only that North Korea “commits to work towards complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”. Pompeo this week angrily told reporters the signed agreement did not contain all that was agreed in Singapore. In his video statement on Friday, Trump insisted: “This is the beginning of the process towards denuclearisation of North Korea. “I sometimes say, ‘the de-nuking of North Korea’ and those are beautiful words”. In Singapore, Trump also signalled a major concession to Pyongyang when he said he would cancel US-South Korean military exercises – to the surprise of South Korea and the US defense department. The Post report also said Trump laughingly praised North Korean state TV, joking “that even … Fox News was not as lavish in its praise”. Footage of the president saluting a North Korean general has also been widely criticised, as has Trump’s apparent dismissal of human rights concerns. The president repeatedly praised the North Korean leader for being “tough”. Trump told Fox on Friday: “He’s the head of a country, he’s the strong head, don’t let anyone think anything different. He speaks and his people sit up at attention. I want my people to do the same.” He later told a reporter he had been “kidding”. The reporter didn’t “understand sarcasm”, he said. Speaking to Fox, Trump also said: “When I was talking to President Obama, he was essentially ready to go to war with North Korea. I did ask him: ‘Have you spoken to him?’ He goes: ‘No.’ I said: ‘You think it would be a good idea to speak to him, maybe? OK?’” Speaking to reporters, Trump said Obama told him North Korea’s nuclear weapons were the “most dangerous problem” facing the US. “I have solved that problem,” Trump said. “Now we’re getting it memorialized and all but that problem is largely solved.” He also said he had given Kim “a very direct number” which meant the dictator could “call me if he has any difficulty”. “People are shocked,” the president said, boasting about talks that followed abuse and threats between Washington and Pyongyang. “They thought Trump was going to get in, he’s going to start throwing bombs all over the place. It’s actually the opposite.” Asked about his reluctance to criticise Kim’s human rights record, he said: “You know why? Because I don’t want to see a nuclear weapon to destroy you and your family.” Trump also told Fox of his request for the return of remains of “probably 7,500” US soldiers killed in the Korean war, which he claimed was already producing results. He said again that “parents” of such soldiers had appealed to him. The Korean war took place between 1950 and 1953, which would make the survival of any parents of soldiers killed in the war highly unlikely."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/24/figures-in-a-landscape-paul-theroux-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T08:00:21Z","webTitle":"Figures in a Landscape by Paul Theroux review – a writer driven by divided loyalties","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/24/figures-in-a-landscape-paul-theroux-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/24/figures-in-a-landscape-paul-theroux-review","fields":{"headline":"Figures in a Landscape by Paul Theroux review – a writer driven by divided loyalties","bodyText":"Who is Paul Theroux?

Theroux’s persona as a literary novelist who transformed his prospects overnight with a bestselling travel book, The Great Railway Bazaar, is well known and well established. We’re in the presence of a compulsive writer who sometimes maintains: that “I wrote as an act of rebellion”, but also to put food on the table.

This Greene-like split between art and commerce, financing the novel writing with journalistic assignments (here, an encounter with Oliver Sacks, and an essay on Hawaii), is further complicated by Theroux’s divided self. He is renowned as an expat American from Massachusetts who seems more than a little in thrall to the British literary tradition. Eleven of the 30 essays in this volume are about writers, but more than half describe non-Americans: Conrad, Maugham, Greene, Spark, Sacks and Bono. When he lived in London in the 1970s, Theroux mixed with Anthony Burgess, VS Naipaul and Jonathan Raban. In one of his most revealing sentences, echoing Greene, he says: “Misery helps, so does muddle and loving books, so does leaving home.” Generally, his mood is one of all passion spent. The ruthless brilliance he once deployed in his unsparing portrait of a literary friendship, Sir Vidia’s Shadow (1998), has gone missing here. Strikingly, Theroux rarely refers to interviews or hangs out with contemporary American writers. The literary fellows with whom he’s most at home are expats and oddballs: Henry Thoreau, William Burroughs, Hunter S Thompson and Paul Bowles. In this collection, they keep company with some notable weirdos: Liz Taylor, the goose-farmer EB White, a Manhattan dominatrix and Robin Williams. All of this adds up to a portrait of a writer who, with some justice, declares himself to be “alone in this world”, a solitary nomad who has chosen to live and presumably end his days (Theroux is 77) in the tolerant, balmy and remote society of Hawaii, writing in the mornings and paddling his kayak in the afternoon. Vis-a-vis the world, he declares himself to be “an alien” who enjoys quite a complicated relationship with his fans. Internally, too, there are conflicts. He writes as a man at odds with the world, worries he suffers from graphomania, but also says “writing is heaven”. He describes his preference for travelling incognito, in old clothes, at the margin, while in the next breath picturing himself as “a semi-well-known writer who can afford to fly first class”. At this point in our inquiries, it seems fair, as he puts it himself, “to ask the question that English people pose of oddballs, ‘Who is he when he’s at home?’” It’s here that the would-be magician in Theroux finds his smoke turning to mirrors in ways that he can’t quite control. On the one hand, he insists that the writer’s life is “almost unapproachable, full of ambiguities”. On the other, he defaults to the writer’s highest calling, his obligation “to be vigilant and unsparing”. Spend time with a writer, he declares, and what do you get? “Wool-gathering, silences, rants, evasions, the contents of a cracker barrel.” Those are hardly the words of a man who welcomes too much scrutiny. At the same time, he seems mildly gratified to be recognised as the author of novels such as Saint Jack, The Mosquito Coast and My Secret History. But then, on pages 374-75, in fewer than 500 words, he tells us all we need to know and it’s almost banal in its simplicity. His divided self derives from his parents. On his maternal side, he comes from upwardly mobile, highly successful Italian-American late-Victorian immigrants whose “competitiveness”, he declares, made the Dittami family “insufferably pretentious”. On his paternal side, his “dear old dad’s” people were “country folk, a kindly, laconic, unpretentious and uneducated family” who called him “Paulie”. As the smoke clears and the mirrors cease to dazzle, we encounter the “Paulie” who loves his dad and finds his mother “demanding, thin-skinned and impatient”. Her legacy to her son is “a horror of weak and vain, nagging and castrating women”. When Paulie hears the “snarl of the she-wolf”, he heads for the hills, driven by a determination never to become “the person my father became in his old age, reduced to dependency on an unhappy woman”. His parents’ influence is limited, however: “I had not become a writer to please my parents, only myself.” This mother-father conflict within Theroux yields a strange literary dividend that’s remarkable and exceedingly rare. Despite his evident addiction to the writing life and its notebooks, ink and pens, and despite the millions of words, there’s something missing. This, like the Conan Doyle dog that does not bark, is the giveaway. On the evidence of Figures in a Landscape, Theroux’s powerful persona is, oddly, not matched by an equal vox. Open a Burgess, or a Greene or a Naipaul collection of such picked-up pieces and you know at once, from the voice, who’s writing. There are several highly entertaining essays here, and some quotably arresting lines, but the voice is elusive, unfixed and dissonant – an echo of the divisions within. • Figures in a Landscape by Paul Theroux is published by Hamish Hamilton (£16.99).
