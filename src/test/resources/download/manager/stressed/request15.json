No one is a bigger fan of the striker than Kyle Walker, who says it a joy to be playing behind Agüero after years of struggling to contain him. “Facing him used to be a nightmare,” the former Tottenham right-back said. “I don’t know how many seasons I spent coming up against him but he always seemed to score against us. It was frustrating, he was so good, and having him on the same team for a change is a real bonus. “He’s a really good influence in the dressing room, always ready with a word of advice for the younger lads, and on the pitch he’s the type of player who can come up with a bit of magic to change a game if things aren’t going so well.” Walker has not been surprised by what he has seen in games from Agüero this season – City are off to a flying start in the Premier League and Champions League and the striker has scored seven goals in the two competitions already – although he admits he did not know what to expect from the forward in private. “Off the field he is a bit quieter than I thought but he has a positive presence,” Walker explained. “Like a few other players at this club he has a winning mentality. He only wants the best. Anything below par and he will be the first one to say come on, this isn’t right.” Agüero is likely to be rejoined by Gabriel Jesus for Tuesday’s Champions League game against Shakhtar Donetsk, the Brazilian having enjoyed the luxury of a day off while City were thrashing Crystal Palace 5-0 on Saturday. “Gabriel can help us a lot,” Pep Guardiola said. “There is no doubt about his capacity, the impact he had when he arrived. He can help Sergio to score goals, he gives us an extra option that means the striker at the top is not quite as isolated as he was at times last season and he contributes with his pressing and his dynamism. We know he has the quality to score goals but the most important thing is his age. “He is so young, just 21 [he is 20], and already the No9 for Brazil but he is keen to learn and improve. He fights every day in training, working hard and showing great desire to become one of the best players in world football. With Gabriel back I now have five strikers I trust a lot.” The manager is not getting too carried away by City’s succession of convincing wins this season. As he is fond of pointing out, they started last season equally as well, and also found themselves struggling to make progress at West Bromwich Albion in the second half of the Carabao Cup tie last week. also knows that this is the stage of the season when a bright start began to unravel last year after City were unexpectedly held to a draw by Celtic. That was away from home, while City face Shakhtar at the Etihad, although there is little chance of Guardiola underestimating the team from Ukraine. “I have come up against them seven times in my managerial career and before every game I have the same feeling,” the City manager said. “My scouts come back from watching them saying, ‘Wow’. Fernandinho was playing for them in those days and they had Douglas Costa and a lot of Brazilians, and my team were really impressed. We generally had good results against them with Barcelona but it was always tough. “If you look at Shakhtar Donetsk at the moment they still deserve a great deal of credit because they have just beaten Napoli. In my opinion Napoli are one of the best teams in the Italian league, so the group is tricky. I will be trying to make sure my players take them seriously because Shakhtar can be very dangerous in the group stages. They tend to go out when the knockout rounds are reached but that is usually because their season has stopped by then, the players are on holiday. At this time of year they are one of the best footballing teams around.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/25/david-davis-michel-barnier-brexit-bill-transition-period-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T17:34:35Z","webTitle":"Davis and Barnier at odds over Brexit bill and transition period","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/25/david-davis-michel-barnier-brexit-bill-transition-period-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/25/david-davis-michel-barnier-brexit-bill-transition-period-talks","fields":{"headline":"Davis and Barnier at odds over Brexit bill and transition period","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Brexit secretary, David Davis, and the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, have clashed over the UK’s exit bill and Britain’s request for a transition period after Theresa May’s speech in Florence last week failed to unlock the stalemate in negotiations. On the first day of the fourth round of talks, Barnier said the prime minister’s €20bn (£17.6bn) offer did not mean the UK would be given a transition period or that negotiations could move on to the detail of a future trading relationship. “It remains more necessary than ever to create the trust that we need to set up and build upon our future relationship,” he said, adding that it was up to Britain to provide clarity with time running out before it leaves. During a joint appearance in Brussels, Davis insisted there “could be no excuses for standing in the way” of progress this week and it was “obvious” that discussions on the financial settlement needed to be had in the context of talks over the future relationship. Barnier’s opening remarks are likely to disappoint No 10 and infuriate senior Brexit supporters in the government who believe May’s Florence speech was a generous offer to the EU. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, said during a visit to the Czech Republic that the “ball is in the [EU’s] court” after May promised to carry on paying into the EU until at least 2020 and offered to enshrine the rights of EU citizens living in the UK in the Brexit withdrawal treaty. “We are offering a great deal on citizens, a great deal on money and an unconditional commitment to the defence of Europe. Let’s hope we can move this thing forward and get these negotiations going,” Johnson said in Prague. He then headed to Romania and Slovakia as part of “mission to explain the Florence speech and what it means for our determination to get on with negotiations over Brexit”, while May placed an opinion article in a Czech newspaper, as the UK continued its efforts to bypass the European commission and take its arguments straight to member states. However, EU member states have made clear that authority over the talks lies with Barnier, who insists Brussels needs to see “sufficient progress” on citizens’ rights, the financial settlement and the Irish border before it will discuss future trade. Coming out of a meeting with EU ministers from the 27 other member states, Barnier suggested little had changed in the state of the discussions. “A discussion that is going to take place because the UK is asking for it on this transitional period does not mean we will no longer need to achieve sufficient progress,” he said. “We are not going to mix up discussions on debts and discussion on the past commitments. We are not going to mix up those subjects, which are part of an orderly withdrawal, on a discussion of our future relationship.” Davis said he still expected this week’s round of talks to build on May’s speech, saying the UK was “absolutely committed to working through the detail”. “We are laying out concrete proposals and there are no excuses for standing in the way of progress … It will take pragmatism from both sides to make headway and I hope we can achieve that this week.” But Barnier offered little succour to the UK’s cause and directly contradicted Davis’s claims over the weekend that Britain would no longer be under EU law in 2019, should it seek a transition period. “The EU has to decide whether to have a transitional period and whether it is in its interest. Any transition has to respect the regulatory and financial framework of the single market,” he said. “As we said, we are talking about prolonging and extending EU legislation for a certain amount of time. That would mean we would have to continue with [such] things as the budget, supervision, judicial control and controls of EU rules and regulations. So that would have to continue to apply.” May has accepted that the UK would have to abide by existing EU rules during the transition period but there are divisions within the cabinet over whether Britain should have to submit to new ones made during the two-year timeframe. Johnson has been fighting against submission to new rules and in favour of the minimum possible transition period and for the UK to make a clean break with the EU after 2021. But this has created divisions with Philip Hammond, the chancellor, who is in favour of a transition preserving the status quo, avoiding a “no-deal Brexit” at all costs and staying as close as possible to the single market after 2021. No 10 hoped May’s Florence speech would draw a line under her Brexit difficulties and allow her to focus on domestic policy during the Conservative party conference next week, but infighting within her cabinet and speculation over her leadership are likely to overshadow the event. At Labour’s conference, Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, accused May of “robotically marching towards an extreme Brexit, focused on her own survival not the national interest”. He said his party would consider a “new single-market relationship” with the EU. “Whether you’re in the front seat with Theresa May, or in the backseat with Boris Johnson, there’s nothing patriotic about joy-riding our country’s economy off a cliff,” Starmer said. Johnson’s actions over the past few weeks, including writing a 4,000-word personal blueprint for leaving the EU, published in the Telegraph, has been seen as a sign he is trying to goad May into sacking him over Brexit. Further tensions erupted over the weekend when Johnson’s allies claimed he was responsible for steering May away from a Norway-style soft Brexit in her Florence speech on Friday and for seeing off Hammond’s demands for a longer transition. Johnson’s attempt to cast himself as the saviour of a proper Brexit has been dismissed by Davis, while Hammond said on Monday he “was entirely in accord” with May’s proposal for a transition period of about two years.

But as he smoked a cigarette by the stadium concession stands Sunday evening, Jack (who did not want his last name used) wasn’t talking about love. He was talking about his vote. The 25-year-old, who has lived in Charlottesville most of his life, is a conservative in a liberal town. He said he had voted for Donald Trump, hoping that a political outsider would bring change. Then white supremacists had marched across his hometown carrying torches and chanting “You will not replace us” and “Jews will not replace us.” They carried guns and wore helmets and shields and fought with anti-fascists in the streets, generating news footage viewed around the world. As a white man, the kind of American these far-right groups claimed to represent, “I felt ashamed,” he said. His friends who are not white had been terrified, wondering if they would be safe going outside or walking around. In response, Trump, the president he had supported, repeatedly blamed “both sides” and “many sides” and said there were “very fine people” who marched alongside the neo-Nazis. Jack said he didn’t know if any mainstream conservatives had marched alongside neo-Nazis on 12 August. “If I saw a Nazi flag go up, I would be out of there,” he said. Charlottesville was definitely not the first time Trump had said something that made Jack uncomfortable, and it was was not the first time friends had shared their fears with him about how their race might make them vulnerable. When it came to police brutality, Jack said, he listened, but he also had his own relationship with the police as authority figures, and wanted to believe that most police officers would not simply racially profile people. “This was different,” he said. The white supremacists’ attitude towards other races was absolutely clear. Whether Trump was a white supremacist himself, he said, he did not know. But together with Trump’s “Rocket Man” jabs at North Korea, the president’s reaction to Charlottesville had convinced him that he would not be voting for Trump again, and that he needed to vet his candidates more carefully in the future. On Sunday, as tens of thousands of locals filled stadium seats and clustered on the field in front of the stage, the mood was relaxed and upbeat. But, like Jack, some white Charlottesville residents said that that watching fascists march through their streets had been a wake-up call. “It opened our eyes,” said Pat Sury, who lives outside Charlottesville. “That it’s here as well as everywhere else. We were living in a bubble.” “I think it got everybody talking a lot more about what’s going on in our community,” said Rosanna Lavin, 62, sitting with Sury and other friends at a small tailgating party in the parking lot. “We cannot be blind to some of the issues that we really don’t deal with,” including “alt-right hatred” and “race relations”. At work, Lavin said, she has tried to talk about race more with her colleagues of color. “I think we’re too afraid to approach subjects sometimes and get honest reactions,” she said. But the “bits and pieces” of conversation had not yet produced steps forward other than overall support. Conversations about racism “are not the funnest conversations to have or the easiest,” but they were happening with more urgency now, said Devin Welch, 33, who works for a solar energy company in Charlottesville, at a different tailgate party. Before the white supremacist protests, local entrepreneurs had already been discussing how to support and fund a more diverse set of start-up founders, ensuring that venture capital funding did not just stay within white social networks. After the protests, it’s not just a priority – “now it’s top,” he said. Welch said he believed that what Charlottesville had witnessed was the “death gasps of a dying ideology,” not the growth of something new. Malcolm Wills, 20, and Fernando Garay, 19, said that protests in Charlottesville had appeared to make people more comfortable openly saying racist things, particularly on Facebook. Both young men said they had been shocked to watch acquaintances defend white supremacists online, and that people they knew talked earnestly about their concerns about white people becoming a minority. The tension and anxiety of the first days after the white supremacists’ protests had faded, Wills said. The two young men said they hoped that if the neo-Nazis came back, the town would choose to let them protest without much reaction, rather than feeding their agenda with attention. A black fourth-year student at the University of Virginia, who said she did not want to give her name, said she was trying to enjoy her last year of university, and not let what happened define her experience. That wasn’t easy. As a peer counselor to younger students of color, she said she has fielded many questions from first-years about whether they should transfer to another school. She said she advised them to stay. “Sadly, wherever you are in America, you can probably experience these things,” she said. Inside the stadium, Susan Bro, the mother of Heather Heyer, the young woman killed when an alleged white supremacist drove a car into a crowd of counter-protesters, had received a standing ovation from the audience at the beginning of the concert, and urged listeners to continue her daughter’s legacy by showing up to confront hatred and discrimination. “Tragically, because Heather stood bravely against racism and hatred, she was taken from us,” Bro told the crowd, asking them to “turn our righteous anger into action.” Her daughter “loved humanity with an open heart. That’s what gave her the strength and compassion to stand up with her friends against hate. As Heather said, if you’re not outraged, you’re not paying attention.” Ariana Grande, whose young fans were targeted by a suicide bomber in Manchester in May, leaving 22 people killed and dozens more wounded, struck a similar note between her sets at the concert. The pop singer, who just finished a world tour, came to Charlottesville to participate in her second benefit concert following an act of terror in the space of just four months. She had hosted her own benefit, One Love Manchester, in June. America’s president usually serves as the country’s consoler-in-chief. But Trump, who had branded terrorists “evil losers” after the Manchester attack, had not come to Charlottesville to offer support. So it was the 24-year-old pop singer who took on that rhetorical role, mixing consolation with a reminder of their shared values. “I want to tell you how proud I am to be part of a generation that is so passionate about making a change,” she told the crowd. “Keep using your voices and making this a safer place for each other.” This article was amended on 26 September 2017 to remove the full name and photograph of an interviewee at their request."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/25/take-a-knee-how-conservative-media-is-reacting-to-nfl-protestors","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T16:56:01Z","webTitle":"Take a knee: how conservative media is reacting to NFL protesters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/25/take-a-knee-how-conservative-media-is-reacting-to-nfl-protestors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/25/take-a-knee-how-conservative-media-is-reacting-to-nfl-protestors","fields":{"headline":"Take a knee: how conservative media is reacting to NFL protesters","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s inflammatory comments about Colin Kaepernik’s protests late last week, where he called for any “son of a bitch” who kneeled during the anthem to be “fired”, drew a widespread response among NFL teams on Sunday. Players dropped to their knee during the anthem, and some were booed for their trouble. Conservative pundits, for the most part, wrote this up as evidence of Trump’s political genius: the arch populist had trolled pro football, and put himself on the side of popular sentiment. Whether they took this as an occasion for concern or for gloating largely depended on their prior opinions of the president. A far smaller group tried to put this into proportion alongside the other problems that the game, the president, and the country are experiencing. But none, as far as I can tell, took the protests seriously as a response to the brutal reality of white supremacy. Why Donald Trump is president Publication National Review Author Rich Lowry is editor of National Review, and a familiar face in these parts. Why you should read it Lowry has offered this and another post on National Review in the last couple of days, essentially arguing that the whole affair shows Trump’s mastery of populist politics. He may be right that Trump has used controversy as a way to align himself with “common sense” and pull his base closer, but this type of column depends on ignoring, or explicitly denying, that race is at the center of this “culture war”, and that Trump is appealing to white resentments about protests by black players against police violence. Extract “It is a classic example of Trump’s, at times, gut-level political savvy. This kind of thing is why he’s president. He takes a commonly held sentiment – most people don’t like the NFL protests – and states it in an inflammatory way guaranteed to get everyone’s attention and generate outrage among his critics. When those critics lash back at him, Trump is put in the position of getting attacked for a fairly commonsensical view.” Trump: wouldn’t you love to see NFL owners fire protesting players? Publication Hot Air Author Ed Morrissey is one of the early conservative blogosphere’s survivors – he started at his original home, the one-man “Captain’s Quarters”, in 2003. Since then he has become a widely published rightwing pundit. Why you should read it In this piece, written between Trump’s inflammatory comments and the weekend’s protests, Morrissey concedes that Trump’s comments were contextually inappropriate. But he also thinks that Trump is accelerating a dynamic that helps him: if the NFL protests continue through 2020, the resentment they fuel will help with the president’s re-election. Like Lowry, Morrissey avoids discussing the racial aspects of this resentment, and also the fact that black protest is the customary alibi for white racial reaction. Nevertheless, it’s hard to deny that this dynamic has been, and will be, the fuel of Trumpism. Extract “This fad may have petered out naturally after a few more months; Trump’s all but guaranteed that we’ll get it through the 2020 election. And that may mean that NFL players will need to keep it going through 2024, given the unpopularity of the protests everywhere else. It’s a win-win, I guess. However, as Michael Ramirez pointed out two days ago, the market provides a much more effective response than government pressure.” Hey, ‘kneelers’ – let’s get a few things straight Publication LifeZette Author Arch-Trumpist Laura Ingraham is the editor and founder of LifeZette. Her brand strategy is to give hardcore nationalism mom appeal by applying a peppy, pop-culture sheen to it. Ingraham divides her time between the website, talk radio, Fox News, and churning out bestselling conservative tomes. Why you should read it Ingraham argues that footballers taking the knee are misunderstanding the nature of the national anthem and its symbolism. She points our that even when conservatives disagree with the President (Obama) or the laws (abortion), they still sing The Star-Spangled Banner with their hands on their hearts. Extract “It’s a shame that so many young Americans – and so many NFL owners – don’t understand the basic meaning of a longstanding ritual that has been around for decades. We should probably be having a conversation about how to teach civics in this country. But in the meantime, someone needs to tell these young men that kneeling for the anthem is seen by most of us as an extremely offensive attack on the country. It’s a shame the president is apparently the only person in authority who is willing to do so.” Football is problematic, but not because of #TakeTheKnee Publication Foundation for Economic Education Author Jennifer Maffessanti is an editorial assistant at FEE. Here, she offers a take in keeping with the Foundation’s tendency to stake out a less overtly rightwing, less hard-edged, more culturally modern libertarianism. Why you should read it Maffessanti makes the obvious point, and asks the obvious question. If you really care about NFL, given everything else that has happened in the sport, why would this be the thing that turns you off the game? Extract “If you want to be done with the NFL and boycott them, fine. That’s your right. So, the rampant drug use, physical and sexual violence, animal abuse, and widespread brain damage were fine, but the peaceful exercise of free speech is not? Duly noted, guys.” Kaepernick and Curry pop the sports bubble Publication American Greatness Author Chris Buskirk is publisher and editor of American Greatness, which came to prominence as the Journal of American Greatness during the election campaign, and was briefly heralded as the organ of the intellectual vanguard of Trump nationalism. Following the departure of its most prominent writer, Michael Anton, for the White House, American Greatness has increasingly looked like just another rightwing hot-take factory. Why you should read it Buskirk’s article exemplifies the smirking triumphalism that conservatives have been exhibiting as a growing protest movement in the NFL has coincided with the sport’s apparent decline. He is more confident than he ought to be that there is a direct relationship between these two facts: surveys suggest that game delays, domestic violence scandals, and the abandonment of cable TV by “cord-cutters” have also played a big role in the game’s ratings slide. But you can expect the right to keep beating this drum. It offers a way to put pressure on the NFL and the protesters, and allows them to think that their own views line up with popular opinion. Extract “Several new studies prove what we already suspected: fans are leaving the NFL because of the players’ political activism that disrespects our country, its heritage, and its people. Sports executives such as CBS Sports chairman Sean McManus get it, too, but they’re caught in a crossfire that is only partly of their own making. “If they take a public stand against the anthem protesters, the backlash from the left would be swift and vicious. If they do nothing and allow the protests to run roughshod over the sensibilities of their customers the verdict of fans will be slower but more costly. Wall Street analysts are worried, forecasting losses of $200m from just a 10 percent shortfall in expectations this year.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/25/ian-williams-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T16:38:35Z","webTitle":"Ian Williams obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/25/ian-williams-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/25/ian-williams-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Ian Williams obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My friend and colleague Ian Williams, who had died of cancer aged 67, was a miner in east Kent. He was born into the industry: his grandfather was one of the many who walked from South Wales to find work in the county’s new fields during the 1920s. When coalmining ended, Ian had a vision for a new arts centre in the old buildings – it is a vision some are hoping will one day become a reality. Ian was born in Aylesham, one of three sons, to Edward, an electrical engineer for the National Coal Board, and his wife, Mary (nee Thomson). Ian went to school in the village and then on to secondary education in Hersden. He did his electrical engineering apprenticeship training at Canterbury College and at Chislet colliery. There were four productive mines in Kent: Chislet, Tilmanstone, Betteshanger and Snowdown. Ian worked at all of them except Snowdown, although he lived in the village. He was underground electrical shift engineer at Betteshanger, and in the mines rescue team at Tilmanstone and Betteshanger. Ian remarked that no matter what relations were like above ground, underground anyone’s life could depend on anyone else, and enmities were insignificant. The strike of 1984-85 was hard. Ian’s wife, Val, went to work at the local pub and Ian looked after their children, David and Kelly. The Kent miners held out longest in the strike but the collieries were all closed by 1989. Ian was passionate about promoting youth cycling with Velo Club Deal, where David was a star performer. When the cycle course made at Betteshanger as part of the regeneration was found to be flawed – spoil washed across the track in heavy rain, and ploughed-in metal exposed – he commissioned a report that led to remedial work. After the pit closures, Dover council and the South East England Development Agency drew up plans to flatten the Snowdown site for a business park, but with it would have gone the last built fabric of the Kent coalfield. Ian had the visionary idea of using the buildings to make what he called “another Aldeburgh”. He found me online, through my work for the Industrial Buildings Preservation Trust, and that is how we met. He said it was a beautiful site, but it was not until I visited that I really believed him. He envisaged a cultural site that would bring people from not just the local area but across the country (via the tiny station at Snowdown) and even from Europe, it being on the doorstep of the Channel tunnel. When a development agency representative said that most working-class people were not interested in opera, Ian was outraged. We celebrated when the agency was abolished. However, in the end we were unable to secure ownership of the site. With two buildings there now listed, I still hope we may one day see the opening of the Ian Williams Hall. The man and the industry deserve a memorial. He is survived by Val, their children and four grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/sep/25/turner-prize-2017-exhibition-review-a-snake-infested-garden-and-fat-cats-on-horseback","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T17:22:56Z","webTitle":"Turner prize 2017 exhibition review: a snake-infested garden and fat cats on horseback","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/25/turner-prize-2017-exhibition-review-a-snake-infested-garden-and-fat-cats-on-horseback","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/25/turner-prize-2017-exhibition-review-a-snake-infested-garden-and-fat-cats-on-horseback","fields":{"headline":"Turner prize 2017 exhibition review: a snake-infested garden and fat cats on horseback","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Opening at the Ferens Art Gallery in Hull, the 2017 Turner prize is an uneven and at times frustrating exhibition. Relaxing the upper age limit for nominated artists is a good thing. Some artists don’t hit their stride until relatively late or are, for various reasons, overlooked. For a long time Lubaina Himid, born in Zanzibar in 1954, was just such a case. In the last couple of years, major solo shows in Oxford and Bristol, and her inclusion in a survey of 1980s black art, have brought her a new audience and increased visibility. Her 1987 tableau, A Fashionable Marriage, is a take on William Hogarth’s Marriage a la Mode, restaged as a series of cut-out figures. It remains the best thing in Himid’s Turner prize exhibition, which is a pity. Her 2007 paintings on butter dishes, jugs, plates and tureens overlay the glazed crockery with fat-cat country squires lumbering about on horses, black servants and slaves, querulous ladies pondering the abolition of slavery, in a motley procession of 18th and 19th-century types. Riffing on the satirical prints of Gilray and Rowlandson, Himid shows what an accomplished graphic artist she is. In another series, she works over pages and spreads from the Guardian, between 2007-2015. There are knives, guns, teeth and abstract, optical patterning, all relating more or less directly to stories about black sportsmen and women, police killings in the US, street gangs in London, and a host of other stories. Himid’s adumbrations are well done but minor. Her one, recent painting is a still and stilted thing. Were it not for her earlier work, would she be in the Turner prize now? Too many paintings by Hurvin Anderson fill another gallery, in a survey of works from the last decade. I have always liked his barbershop paintings, and the way he uses the paraphernalia of bottles and products, the mirrors and posters and illustrations of haircuts on the walls as a kind of abstraction – they make you think of abstract expressionist Hans Hofman’s push-and-pull rectangles of dancing colour, and also at times of Dutch painter René Daniëls’ plays between figuration and abstraction. In some of Anderson’s work, this game becomes a more awkward play between quotation and derivation. It is almost impossible to paint without quotation. I’m less interested in Anderson’s paintings of trees and foliage. Sam Francis is in there, along with Peter Doig and George Shaw. One recent painting, commissioned for the Arts Council Collection, presents a series of barbershop portraits hovering over a small shelf-bound Manhattan of hair products. Many of the portraits are like photographic negatives, white on black. Only Malcolm X and Martin Luther King appear in full focus and full colour. Is it OK to be Black?, the title asks. But again, I kept thinking of other painters, and in particular of Luc Tuymans. Andrea Büttner and Rosalind Nashashibi’s shows are the best in this year’s prize. Büttner’s show is complicated, not least by a large display, called Simone Weil: The Most Dangerous Disease, borrowed from the Peace Library and Anti War Museum of the Evangelical Church of Berlin, which frequently lends it out. Mixing texts by the French thinker and activist Simone Weil, and large numbers of photographs, including harrowing Vietnam war images, American landscapes by Ansel Adams, August Sander’s portraits of national socialists, and much besides, the display is intended as an introduction to Weil’s times and thoughts. There’s a lot to read and look at before we even get to Büttner’s large woodcuts – a bare black silhouette of a hill, jaunty potatoes floating in a field of colour, a number of simplified images of a beggar, a body humped over, arms extended in supplication. An entire wall is covered in hi-vis yellow fabric, on which hangs a number of large-scale etchings derived from the fingerprints and smears on her smartphone screen. As well as erudition and gravity, there is a kind of musicality to Büttner’s exhibition. I don’t know what all this adds up to, or where Büttner’s identification with the ascetic, socialist, religious Weil is meant to take us. In her new film, Vivian’s Garden, Rosalind Nashashibi gives us a portrait of the relationship between a mother and daughter, Vivian Suter and Elisabeth Wild, in their rambling, ramshackle home and overgrown, snake-infested garden in Guatemala. We glimpse the daily comings and goings, their staff and numerous dogs, life behind a hefty gated entrance. Suter drags large canvases through the foliage. Her mother, in her wheelchair, glues together a collage by lamplight. The film is full of fractured glimpses, incomplete conversations, talk of departure and some violence in the past. Things hover that we can’t grasp. Nashashibi’s films are often extremely beautiful to look at, their slowness never a burden. For Vivian’s Garden alone, Nashashibi deserves to win. A second film, shot in Gaza in 2014, slides down alleys, cruises the streets in a car, watches a Hamas march and witnesses the queues and anxieties at the border crossing into Egypt. Sometimes the scene – young men talking and singing in a room, a view over the city, the awful architecture at the border – flips into animation. Towards the end of these weary scenes from ordinary, but extraordinarily difficult everyday life, a black dot grows to almost fill the screen, a strange and startling irruption. • The Turner Prize is at the Ferens Gallery, Hull, until 7 January."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/29/mother-died-year-ago-worried-support-father","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T14:00:05Z","webTitle":"My mother died a year ago and I’m worried I will have to support my father","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/29/mother-died-year-ago-worried-support-father","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/29/mother-died-year-ago-worried-support-father","fields":{"headline":"My mother died a year ago and I’m worried I will have to support my father","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My father is a generous if simple man who goes to work, the pub or home. He doesn’t have any friends outside of these places. He has no hobbies or friends. He is two years away from retirement and I have no idea what he will do when he does. I am in my 30s and my sister is in her late 20s. Our mother died last year. Our parents were rarely physically affectionate with each other, although we had lots of kisses and cuddles. I got the feeling my father didn’t like having children – he used to complain if babies or kids screamed and ran about in restaurants – and our parents grew apart but stayed together for us. When I was in my early teens, my mother once complained to me that she was getting no affection at all from him, not even cuddles let alone anything more. She was upset, but I think after that she resigned herself to having a loveless marriage. I remember my father staying up when we were younger watching late-night adult films but would always turn it over if we walked in. When we were younger, he would also get angry but never do anything, just threaten to throw things or pretend to throw things. He has chilled out a lot since getting older. I am with a loving, driven and creative fiancee and we had our firstborn baby three months ago. My father likes it when we visit – he’s a 20-minute drive away – but never offers to come over (he doesn’t drive, but there is a direct train) or offer to babysit. I visit for about an hour once a week but never look forward to it. He would be happy to live in a very dirty, grimy home, and just doesn’t see the health risks. Even one day after the cleaner comes, the house is in disarray, things are dirty again and I feel that it’s back to square one. Especially the kitchen, and bathroom, where somehow the toilet and seat are extremely dirty. It puts me off going round. My sister will go for the same amount of time and struggles to find anything to talk about with him. I keep having these dreams about what to do when he retires. I am not sure whether this is linked to losing my mother and having a baby. I’m really sorry to hear about your mother’s death and I think how you feel is definitely linked to this and having just had a baby – both seismic events. I got no idea at all from your longer letter what your mother was like, or what her influence on you or the family was (peacemaker, inspirer, go-getter etc), or how you got on with her. I do know that it is very early days, and that, when one person dies, relationships within families can change and shift in ways no one expects. Having a baby come into your life also makes you view your parents in a different light – you can become at once more appreciative of what they have done, but more judgmental. Not having your mother at this time can be incredibly hard, because that conversation can’t happen. I wonder if you are looking at your father and find him woefully lacking. Is he looking at himself and feeling he is letting you down? There was definitely an element, in your longer letter especially, of pointing out the negatives about your dad as if you were listing evidence of his failings. For whom? You have a new baby – it’s perfectly acceptable to stop going round to his for a while if you need to reset boundaries. Maybe your mother was your favourite parent and you are angry with your father for not providing you what your mother did. Maybe, despite the lack of a physical relationship with her, your father misses your mother more than he thought he would. I don’t know. But I do see the tentacles of grief – yours, your sister’s, your father’s – all the way through this letter. You started off talking about your father quite warmly but it descended into something bordering on disdain. He sounds depressed. I wonder if any of you have had grief counselling? (Try Cruse Bereavement Care, or your local hospice if your mother was in one.) This would be a safe place for you to explore your feelings. There are many positives in your life – a new baby, a supportive partner you love, a sibling you seem to get on with and a father who works, has some social life and is generous. Your father may not have liked other people’s children, but that doesn’t mean he didn’t like you. Incidentally, your mother should not have used you as a confidante about their lack of a physical relationship. That is crossing a boundary – and I wonder who told you they stayed together because of the children. That’s quite a burden. There was also an element of now feeling responsible for your father, and – maybe – resenting this. It is great you have got him a cleaner and you visit, but what he does with his life now is up to him. You are not responsible for him, but neither is he for you. Is this a space your mother filled for both of you, which is now vacant? I wonder why the dreams concern you so much. I always find that when I have recurring dreams it is because there is something in real life I am trying to not face up to – my subconscious knocking for attention.

Tony Benn had developed an important overall critique of Britain’s unwritten constitution based on the notion of popular sovereignty “loaned” by the people to parliament. This strong focus prevented him from imagining a European version of this concept. He wrongly predicted that “once you have elected members of a European parliament … then the House of Commons becomes an inferior assembly” (“Diaries”, 15 November 1974). He advocated rebuilding the UK economy “behind a wall of protection” (6 November 1975), including direct import controls – arguably still feasible back then but incapable of meeting today’s global economic challenges. Benn believed “we should build on national interests” (19 September 1975), excluding the prospect of Europe-wide leftwing campaigns to change EU policies. But today effective forms of public ownership of economic assets, even within existing EU laws, and new rights for insecure workers, can indeed be devised and should be actively pursued across Europe. John Chowcat Hythe, Kent • While Brexit may indeed be Labour’s achilles heel (Editorial, 25 September), a far greater threat lies in the growing intolerance of alternative views within the party. There is a delicious irony in Jon Lansman’s criticism of the authoritarian model of New Labour, preferring instead the authoritarianism of Old Labour stitching up the agenda and denying a debate on the most pressing political issue of our times. But then, irony was never a strong suit of the left. Much more serious are the threats to debate culminating in the disgrace of the BBC’s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, apparently requiring extra protection at the Labour conference this year. The implication of such intolerance is the destruction of Labour as a broad-based democratic party and its substitution by a cult. Open debate and freedom of expression are the hallmarks of a healthy society, not suppression of those with whom you disagree.

Even if we use only a small fraction of green belt land, large-scale additional housing will be supported by existing roads, destroying the natural breaks between town and villages, and causing endless urban sprawl. In many areas, the existing roads cannot cope with traffic. I live in Guildford, the sixth most congested place in the UK. We are under great pressure to build a lot of housing, because successive governments have lacked the foresight and imagination to ensure that all parts of the country have sufficient housing, jobs and the infrastructure to match. We can’t just think of “putting houses where the jobs are” – we also need to think about encouraging employment where there is the room, and cheap land, to build housing. In short, we need to build so that housing, transport and employment are sustainable. Over-burdening the already stressed areas will not work long term. Mike Hurdle Councillor, Guildford Greenbelt Group • Jonn Elledge’s comment piece is a good argument for greening the green belt, not building new homes in it, even a small bit of it (3.7% according to Elledge). It is by increments that we lose what we value. Contrary to his claims, we can accommodate the new homes we need within our cities by selectively and creatively building on brownfield land. We can do this without losing the green spaces within our cities, although we may need to modify the way development is financed and relax the requirements for 18-metre separation and in-curtilage parking, all of which would, in any case, bring contemporary planning in line with the best of our 19th-century streets. This is not only a problem with our green belts: all city edges are under threat by squanderous development practices that make our countryside more remote and our cities less liveable. Dr Lorens Holm Director, Geddes Institute for Urban Research, University of Dundee • Land is not the problem. The UK’s biggest housebuilders are already sitting on hundreds of thousands of plots of land with planning permission for housing. Without radical policy changes, such as rent controls, prioritisation of low-cost housing and even – potentially – restricting sales of UK housing to UK residents, the million new homes Jonn Elledge imagines would simply feed into the currently insatiable international investment market in housing, exacerbating the lack of affordability for those who just need somewhere to live. Frances Holliss Emeritus reader in architecture, London Metropolitan University • Danny Dorling’s findings, as published in his book All That Is Solid, show that there is little evidence of a shortfall in the housing stock. The crisis we suffer from is largely the result of acute maldistribution; an economic structure that encourages maximum consumption of a scarce resource, by those with the means to command the market, at the expense of the many with little or no access to capital. Land value taxation is one mechanism that would swiftly and relatively painlessly provide a counterbalance to this vicious cycle of ever-increasing disparity of wealth distribution. Kate Macintosh Winchester, Hampshire • Jonn Elledge’s article is right in principle, but infers impractical implementation: are his piecemeal brownfield areas capable of servicing homes with water, gas, electricity and drainage? Don’t his moral arguments point to sustainable new towns? A related point is access to our wonderful green belts: hedgerow-to-hedgerow country lanes are given over to motor traffic, often speed unrestricted, and one cannot advise family walking or cycling. There are footpaths, true, but can we create a network of farmer-friendly routes with healthy, and even staycation, spin-offs? Alan Doel Potters Bar, Hertfordshire • Far from lacking parks, London’s green belt contains many landscaped estates of former great houses and country parks. As for the agricultural land having limited access, a glance at an Ordnance Survey map shows that most of the green belt, including agricultural land and golf courses, is crisscrossed with rights of way. There are good reasons why so many people love the green belt. It is not helpful to rubbish a planning achievement that brings daily pleasures to millions of people who live in or near the protected land and which provides the huge population of inner London the chance to visit a country-like environment cheaply. Besides, building did not stop completely in the 1950s and today’s London green belt council map is smothered with so many dots representing present or proposed developments that one could be forgiven for thinking the current controls too lax. Margaret Dickinson London • Not for one moment do I wish to minimise the difficulties young people today face with getting somewhere to live, but I do not recognise David Willetts’ picture of housing life (Ex-minister says young people face a ‘housing catastrophe’, 20 September) in the 1960s and 1970s. I moved to London in 1971, and found that the rent and associated costs ate up at least a third of my income. For that, one would get, typically, half a bedroom in a flat-share between five or six people, or a small bedsit furnished with attic-stored relics from the 1940s or 1950s. Heating and hot water were in short supply, and often provided by lethal geysers and dodgy electric fires. Frequently, rental properties were overpriced dumps, particularly in the trendy areas of the time. The more acceptable and affordable property was often a long tube or bus ride away from the action. Houses might have been much cheaper than today but the travelling costs ate into the household budget just the same. Perhaps our perceived easy time also owed itself to the far lower living standards and expectations we had at the time. Most of us were a lot more shabby than chic, believe me.

Then it got worse","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"SNOWFLAKE. Pathetic. Fake news. “Not exactly Kate Adie in a war zone.” And that’s just a flavour of the way some people on social media greeted the news that the BBC’s political editor has been assigned a bodyguard to protect her at Labour party conference: by blaming the victim, not those who threaten violence against her. She’s making it up for attention! She was asking for it, what with her wilful refusal to report the news in a manner more to people’s liking! She should have known it was provocative even to set foot there! Evidently many Labour supporters will be as horrified as any other sane individual by the idea of journalists being physically intimidated at work, a thuggish phenomenon repeatedly observed at Donald Trump’s rallies, and associated with totalitarian regimes the world over. Many MPs and activists, including some close to Jeremy Corbyn, will doubtless go out of their way this week to show Laura Kuenssberg she is welcome in Brighton, and that those who mean her harm are cranks with no place in a democratic movement. But there is a small, self-righteous and aggressively entitled minority within the left who clearly don’t feel that way, and whose behaviour now risks tarnishing that wider movement. They may grudgingly accept that Kuenssberg needs physical protection – and it’s amazing how many people are confident in declaring from the comfort of their armchairs that she doesn’t really, despite not having a clue about her situation – but they sneer that it’s funny she doesn’t need saving from Tories, without pausing to consider whether this says less about Kuenssberg than it does about them. (For the record, she has been targeted by both far right and far left; and the BBC doesn’t employ security just for laughs.) The rage against her in some quarters is visceral, frenzied, beyond all reason. Some of it is doubtless rooted in a refusal to accept her professional judgment, an almost subconscious rejection of the idea that a woman – even a woman whose life’s work is covering politics – might know what she’s talking about. It’s striking that neither previous male holders of her job, nor the largely male political editors of titles overtly hostile to Corbyn, have been so singled out. But it can’t all be down to misogyny. People who were rightly horrified when the anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller had to hire bodyguards, or were outraged by the sickeningly racist and sexist abuse heaped on Diane Abbott, will bend over backwards to pretend that what’s happening to Kuenssberg is somehow different. It’s as if they can’t bear the thought of having to feel solidarity with someone they don’t like. You don’t have to like someone to know that physical intimidation of this kind has no place in a democracy. Kuenssberg is a good journalist doing a sterling job under pressure the like of which no other political editor at the BBC has ever experienced. But even if she wasn’t, the same statement of the bleeding obvious would hold true: threatening to kill someone merely because their opinions annoy you is wrong. It doesn’t matter if those threats are against Diane Abbott, or Jess Phillips, or Anna Soubry, or Nigel Farage, it is never acceptable to settle a political argument by threatening to hang one’s opponent or harm their children. Belittling and refusing to believe those on the receiving end of such threats, or contriving lame excuses for them, is if anything almost more depressing, because it legitimises violence and emboldens the genuinely dangerous. It’s embarrassing even to have to spell out something so basic, but people have a right to enter politics without fear for their lives and journalists have a right to do their jobs – to challenge, question, hold people to account and sometimes doubtless annoy – without being bullied into silence. So stop asking who Laura Kuenssberg thinks she is, wandering around Brighton with her security detail; start asking what we have become as a country that she should need one. • Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"news/2017/sep/26/weatherwatch-dream-of-forecast-supercomputer-that-became-a-reality","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T20:30:14Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: Dream of forecast supercomputer that became a reality","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/sep/26/weatherwatch-dream-of-forecast-supercomputer-that-became-a-reality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/sep/26/weatherwatch-dream-of-forecast-supercomputer-that-became-a-reality","fields":{"headline":"Weatherwatch: Dream of forecast supercomputer that became a reality","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Lewis Fry Richardson, who died on 30 September 1953, was a British mathematician and meteorologist who developed a new type of weather prediction. Existing methods were approximations based on known weather patterns and how they had moved in the past. Richardson planned to predict weather using mathematical techniques he had developed to model the flow of water through peat. The only problem was the volume of data involved. In his 1922 book, Weather Prediction by Numerical Process, Richardson described a “forecast factory”, a vast hall filled with “computers” – people working with slide-rules. Each team of computers worked on a small geographical area and passed their results to the adjacent teams. A central conductor kept all the teams synchronised with coloured signal lights. Richardson estimated it would take 60,000 human computers to keep up with the weather, making mathematical forecasting “a dream”. His dream has become reality. By the 1960s the Met Office already had machines that were far faster than manual methods. Their latest Cray XC-40 supercomputer can carry out 14,000 trillion calculations a second. These calculate weather patterns exactly as Richardson imagined, but in far more detail and further ahead than he would have believed possible. Richardson was a Quaker and pacifist who resigned from the Met Office when it was taken over by the air ministry in 1920. His other great project was predicting another sort of storm – mathematical analysis of communications between countries to spot when they were sliding towards war, and avert it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2017/sep/26/reading-group-jerusalem-the-golden-by-margaret-drabble-is-octobers-book","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T09:57:59Z","webTitle":"Reading group: Jerusalem the Golden by Margaret Drabble is October's book","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/sep/26/reading-group-jerusalem-the-golden-by-margaret-drabble-is-octobers-book","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2017/sep/26/reading-group-jerusalem-the-golden-by-margaret-drabble-is-octobers-book","fields":{"headline":"Reading group: Jerusalem the Golden by Margaret Drabble is October's book","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s 50 years since the publication of Jerusalem the Golden by Margaret Drabble, her fourth novel and the winner of the James Tait Black prize in 1967. Margaret Drabble is an important, thought-provoking novelist; she has edited two editions of the Oxford Companion to English Literature and is also a biographer of note. She is worth reading at any time. Even so, I’m aware that this is one of the quieter literary anniversaries of 2017. A few readers may be wondering why we’re commemorating this book. But if you are perplexed, that’s all the more reason to stick with us. I’m hoping we’ll show that there’s a strong case for saying that Jerusalem the Golden deserves to be at least as well read as its more famous predecessor, The Millstone. The anniversary is also significant because this novel provides such an interesting way-marker in our culture. As Lisa Allardice explained this article, Drabble is cautious about claiming she was writing explicitly feminist novels so much as “writing about the world around her and her own experiences as a young woman”. Allardice quotes her saying: “When I started writing, there was no women’s movement … Feminist criticism was born in 1968 precisely.” In which case, an unapologetically frank novel about the female experience published in 1967 seems all the more significant. As does the fact that this was a book touching on sexual liberation published so close to the so-called Summer of Love. And if all that isn’t enough, we might also be able to take the opportunity to look at another of Drabble’s other novels later in the month. Many of them are admirably short and there are 20 to choose from. That’s right: 20. Not bad for an author who claimed she never really wanted to be a writer: “I didn’t want to. I just happened to write a novel when I was pregnant and had nothing to do.” While I’m quoting, this contemporary review from the New York Times might also encourage you to read the book: The author is an accomplished stylist who has been highly praised. Jerusalem the Golden says rather more than it would appear to do on a cursory reading. Which makes it all the more unfortunate that the book contains misprints galore. The final one tells us that the author, a former actress, has appeared with the Royal Shakespeare Company at ‘Strafford’. I’m curious to check if the current edition has fixed the error. And happily, we can, because thanks to Penguin we have copies of the novel to give to the first five people in the UK to post “I want a copy please”, along with a nice, constructive suggestion in the comments section below.

Could I go to Liverpool to interview Wolf Alice on camera? Another fly-on-the-wall tour project, I assumed, filmed on an iPhone by a mate of the band. The brief was similarly basic, suggesting I ask them: “How they got their name, how they got together and what it’s like being a woman in music.” At London Euston, all the Liverpool trains were cancelled due to flooding. “Go to Warrington,” an urgent email read, “we’ll send a runner.” A runner? To Warrington? For Wolf Alice’s mate’s documentary? Three hours later, climbing into the stressed assistant’s car and setting off at pace towards Liverpool Arts Club, the smoke cleared. “Are you an actor?” “No”. “You’re an actual journalist! He’s a genius, isn’t he, Michael.” “Michael?” “You know, Michael Winterbottom.” Winterbottom. The 24 Hour Party People guy. The Trip guy. That one with the couple having actual sex between Franz Ferdinand gigs guy. The auteur film-maker with a predilection for blurring fact and fiction, slotting scripted action into real-life environments and chipping at the wall between cinema and reality. After my closeups – three takes of my arriving-late scene and a 40-minute interview on the challenges of the rising guitar band, sexual politics in rock and their name sounding like “Rolf Harris” – the band fill me in. They claim to be merely the backdrop of Winterbottom’s new project On the Road. Estelle, the “new management rep” who had met me at the venue, was actually an actor called Leah Harvey, inserted into Wolf Alice’s retinue for the entirety of the 16-date UK tour alongside a “regular crew member” called Joe (James McArdle). Over the course of the tour, the pair become embroiled in a sweet, scripted affair, making On the Road half-love story and half-accurate inside-view of life on tour: the repetition, rootlessness and releases-of-steam laid unflinchingly bare and glamour-free. “For me, the idea of film is for the fiction to feel as natural and connected to the real world as possible,” Winterbottom says, six months later. “As a teenager I loved French new wave, where you’d see people looking in the camera because they were filming in the street. That sense of having things happen because it’s improvised, because there are other people in the street, I like that texture.” So I was hired authenticity? Is that why I wasn’t told in advance what film I was going to be in? “Ha ha! I don’t think we knew what film you were in!” In the unfinished edit of On the Road I watch, my appearance is reduced to a bumbling third-take arrival and the question: “How did you get the name?” Essentially I’m a real-life music journalist representing the tirade of inane, self-important press grunts that plague every touring band like rider-filching cockroaches. The germ of On the Road has been incubating for many years. Always wishing he could have used the original Factory bands for his 2002 Tony Wilson biopic 24 Hour Party People rather than recreate them, Michael got chatting to Northern Irish rock band Ash “ages ago” in New York. “They described their lives as being in a new place every night. That was the start of the idea, this equivalent of being in the circus or a fair, that travelling life. It seemed quite romantic, but in other ways completely horrific. An enclosed world where there was a huge amount of repetition; an extreme version of what all jobs and lives are like.” Ostensibly a forensic study of this sanity-testing cocoon, On the Road’s actors and love-story plotline were added to provide an insight into the hopelessness of transient tour relationships. “Part of being in a crew is you make friends with some people, you make love to some people,” Winterbottom says. “I wanted that sense of intimacy to be part of the world of the film. And it had to be within the crew because you can’t insert people into the band.” Moments of real camaraderie – the band carry Joe around a bar singing “Joe’s a fucking legend” at one point – suggest the actors integrated as the tour went on. “The crew took Joe under their wing,” says Winterbottom. “They gave him a hard time in the way they give each other a hard time, that way that crews have of surviving.” “He got lumbered with all the load-ins, the suckiest part of touring,” says Wolf Alice drummer Joel Amey, “so he method-acted very well. He’d set up all my gear and I was giving him little drum lessons.” Amey says that in the film, “we’re not chucking stuff out of hotel rooms and being dicks. But there definitely is that whole motion of the tour: it keeps going and going and going. For a month you just focus on an hour each day, and that one hour is the most intense hour of anything else you’ve ever done in your life. Hopefully the film captures that.” What was Winterbottom’s experience of being on the road? A shuddering laugh. “The thing I hate most in the world is camping, and this was a horrific form of camping. The whole thing where you’ve got to wait to get into the venue before you can have a shower; it was far worse than I imagined it would be. They have to be incredibly dedicated to that on an endless basis because it’s hard, and very disruptive to normal life. I have more respect for people who do it now.” Visions of a Life by Wolf Alice is out now; On the Road is in UK cinemas from 6 Oct"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/29/my-family-values-gillian-burke-bbc-wildlife","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T12:00:03Z","webTitle":"Gillian Burke: ‘I am a product of generations of people moving between continents’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/29/my-family-values-gillian-burke-bbc-wildlife","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/29/my-family-values-gillian-burke-bbc-wildlife","fields":{"headline":"Gillian Burke: ‘I am a product of generations of people moving between continents’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Where we grew up on the outskirts of Nairobi was this very outdoors existence. On a clear day we could see across the north to Mount Kenya. In the holidays my brother, James, who is five years older than me, and his friends had motocross bikes and we used to tear around. We had experiments: testing our parachute-making skills with bedsheets and launching ourselves off the roof. I tended to jump first because I trusted him so much. It was a single-storey house, so no one got hurt. My family moved from Kenya to Vienna when I was 10 for my mother’s work with the UN, so I spent my teenage years in Austria. The first thing that struck me about Vienna was I could not believe white people were refuse collectors, emptying the garbage. I had never seen anything like it in my life. I admire my parents, they were quite unconventional. They married late, they had children late. My mum, Enid, was very career-oriented, I believe she was the first black female journalist in east Africa. My mum had the professional career and my dad James was a mechanic. In Vienna, he wasn’t able to work because of visa restrictions, so he manned the house. He is an amazing cook, and my mum is a terrible cook – she won’t mind me saying that at all. My dad ran the house in the way a man would. My brother and I both had jobs, we all had to pull our weight. Our home ran well, and with military precision. Dad was a great entertainer – the house was always full, and our Christmases were packed. If people didn’t have family to spend Christmas with, he would say “come to our house”, and we would be peeling potatoes for two days. Vienna has great public transport, so I had a lot of independence, but being one of the few black families in the city in the late 80s had its moments. When I was 16, I got off a tram and realised the crowd at the stop were all skinheads, and all looking at me. The tram had pulled away and I started running alongside, the driver just opened the doors, and I jumped inside with these guys banging on the doors. I have always been drawn to the water and as soon as I could get a summer job, I put myself through scuba-diving training. My grandmothers are both from Seychelles. A lot of our family holidays were visiting my maternal grandmother. The house had a corrugated tin roof and no windows, and I spent most of my holidays in the water. No one really comes from Seychelles: everybody arrived through trade or other means. My grandmothers were from Mauritius and Somalia. We’re all creole. I am a product of generations of people having moved between continents. My paternal grandfather was born in Trinidad, the son of a freed slave and a Seminole Indian. My brother’s name, James Burke, has been handed down from firstborn son to firstborn son. Now I live in Cornwall with my son and daughter, and, because of the kind of mum I am, they inevitably spend a lot of time outdoors. In the early years they went to an ecological school, centred on children doing best when they have as much time as possible outdoors. Even though there was good provision in my small town, I still chose to drive more than 10 miles each way to make sure they felt comfortable outdoors. Not being worried about getting dirty, or jumping off things or climbing trees – that’s a big part of who I am. I was a stay-at-home mum for five years of my children’s lives and finding a community was hard, particularly in Bristol, where I went to university, and where everyone I knew was still at work. When I moved down to Cornwall I expected more of the same, but I’ve been absolutely welcomed into it. • Autumnwatch returns to BBC2 in October"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/26/little-brother-die-persistent-vegetative-state-death-court-family","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T07:00:36Z","webTitle":"Why I needed to let my little brother die | Cathy Rentzenbrink","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/26/little-brother-die-persistent-vegetative-state-death-court-family","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/26/little-brother-die-persistent-vegetative-state-death-court-family","fields":{"headline":"Why I needed to let my little brother die","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My little brother Matty was knocked over by a car on his way home from a snooker hall near Snaith in Yorkshire in 1990. He was 16 and we desperately wanted him to survive. If Matty’s accident had happened a few years earlier he would have died in the road – but he was intubated, resuscitated, and had some holes drilled in his skull to relieve the pressure on his brain. So he remained in a critical condition for a few days, and then opened his eyes at the rate of a few millimetres a day, and that was really all he ever did. He couldn’t go to rehabilitation because there was nothing to rehabilitate. So we brought him home and built a bungalow extension on to the pub where we lived, and carried on hoping and dreaming that if we loved him enough we could reverse his brain damage. It was when I saw Tony Bland, who was left in a persistent vegetative state (PVS) after the Hillsborough disaster, on the news that I realised there was a legal way out. Bland died after his treatment was withdrawn in 1993. But it wasn’t until 1998, when Matty was 24, that we went to court and a judge agreed that Matty’s feeding tube should be withdrawn so that he could die. Everyone involved was compassionate, and I have always felt grateful that they tried not to make it horrible for us. But it was horrible. That’s why I welcomed last week’s ruling by Mr Justice Peter Jackson that in future, where doctors and families are in agreement they should not have to go to court to seek permission for treatment to be withdrawn from patients in a persistent vegetative or minimally conscious state. I know lots of people will jump up and down and say we’re all going to start murdering our relatives, but this is a modest, compassionate step. Obviously vulnerable people need to be protected, but when something so terrible happens to a member of your family, anything that eases the burden is a good thing. The reason court proceedings are so hard for families is that not only do you have to agree that you want the person to die, you have to administer it – make statements and swear affadavits – so you feel implicated. It took a year for the case that led to last week’s judgment to go through court, and it’s incredibly hard to be with someone, to care for them, when you know they’re going to die. You still don’t want them to get bed sores. You still want them to have physiotherapy so their limbs don’t get more twisted. The surgeon Henry Marsh in his book Do No Harm says it’s very easy to save someone’s life with brain surgery – you drill some holes, let out some blood. But what we don’t know is what to do then, with those people who make no progression beyond having a beating heart. If you haven’t been with someone with severe brain damage you might think that such people should be kept alive just in case of some kind of sleeping beauty scenario. But with new developments in medicine, death is no longer the worst outcome. It took me about four years to realise that Matty wouldn’t have wanted to live like that. Of course there are connections with the wider debate about assisted dying, but I think these cases are right out there on their own. Often people who object to assisted dying do so for religious reasons, but Matty wasn’t alive because of the will of god. He was alive because of a human intervention that probably shouldn’t have been made. The right to life argument can’t be applied in the same way across the board. People are worried about creating precedents, but when someone wants to talk to me about all this, and has views they want to discuss, I’m always interested in whether they’ve spent time with someone in a PVS; if they have, then I’m quite interested, but if they haven’t then I’m not. Until you’ve spent time with someone, and stared into their blank eyes and seen that they are no longer there because their brain has been mashed out, I just don’t care about your legal or academic arguments. I’m glad the book I wrote about what happened to Matty is on a syllabus for law students. But what they should also do is go and spend a day with people who are never getting better. Artificial nutrition and hydration is wonderful, but it was invented to keep people alive for a few days so doctors could make a life-saving intervention. No one would have said when they developed tube feeding, “and we’ll be able to keep people alive for decades while their limbs twist up and their families disintegrate around them”. It is a travesty. There are no good outcomes in these situations; it’s about damage limitation. It’s profoundly psychologically and morally confusing to realise that you want the person you love most in the world to die. Having to go to court is by no means the worst thing that happened to my family as a result of Matty being hit by a car, but it is one thing that can be changed. The judge is right. It should be, so others are spared that ordeal. • Cathy Rentzenbrink is the author of The Last Act of Love"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/25/taking-a-knee-donald-trump-new-era-total-protest-nfl","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T16:35:56Z","webTitle":"Taking a knee and Trump: the new era of total protest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/25/taking-a-knee-donald-trump-new-era-total-protest-nfl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/25/taking-a-knee-donald-trump-new-era-total-protest-nfl","fields":{"headline":"Taking a knee and Trump: the new era of total protest","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Colin Kaepernick first kneeled during The Star-Spangled Banner last August, when he was still a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers and Barack Obama was still president. He was protesting against the killing of African Americans by police officers. The date is worth repeating because it seems likely that, in the near future, Kaepernick’s gesture will be misremembered as a protest against Donald Trump. Trump has made sure of that. His great and terrible skill as a politician is to make everything about Donald Trump. Last Friday, at a rally in Alabama, Trump ranted, unprovoked, about football players who took the knee during the national anthem, calling on NFL owners (“friends of mine”) to fire any “son of a bitch” who dared to protest. There was no need in the case of Kaepernick, who is in limbo as a free agent with no NFL teams willing to touch him. Later, on Twitter, he retracted an invitation to NBA champions the Golden State Warriors to visit the White House after the team’s star player, Stephen Curry, expressed reservations. In a stroke, he ensured that Kaepernick’s form of protest went viral. Dozens of NFL stars and other athletes took the knee over the weekend, as did musicians Stevie Wonder, Pharrell Williams and John Legend, and this time the target was clearly Trump. LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers tweeted in Curry’s defence: “U bum … Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up!” The benighted presidency of Donald Trump might be the most powerful spur to protest that the US has ever seen. Of course, black athletes and entertainers have been taking a stand for decades. Think of baseball hero Jackie Robinson abandoning Barry Goldwater’s Republican party in 1964, saying that he now had “a better understanding of how it must have felt to be a Jew in Hitler’s Germany”. Muhammad Ali risking jail and ruin by refusing the Vietnam draft in 1967. Track stars Tommie Smith and John Carlos raising their gloved fists in the Black Power salute at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics. Stevie Wonder taunting Richard Nixon in You Haven’t Done Nothin’, which topped the US charts the week that Nixon resigned. More recently, Kanye West claimed “George Bush doesn’t care about black people” on live television after Hurricane Katrina. Those protests, however, were wide-ranging. Some were directed at individual politicians; others were inspired by the civil rights movement or Vietnam. In 2017, Trump is the alpha and omega of political dissent. Unable even to condemn neo-Nazis without reservation, he has made himself synonymous with every issue that enrages progressives, from racist policing to climate change denial. His capacity to bear grudges and escalate feuds is bottomless. Worse, he seems to thrive on opposition. It is dangerous to assume long-term strategic thinking on the part of a vindictive, impetuous bully with the attention span of a small child, but Trump is instinctively drawn to the rhetoric that Kevin Phillips, a strategist for Richard Nixon and his grievance-stoking vice-president Spiro Agnew, christened “positive polarisation”. It was summarised in a 1970 report by the National Committee for an Effective Congress as “working the hidden veins of fear, racism and resentment which lie deep in Middle America. Respect for the past, distrust of the future, the politics of ‘againstness.’” This strategy of division became known as the culture wars. Culture wars have been central to the conservative playbook ever since, with Republicans using such divisive subjects as gay marriage and abortion rights as “wedge issues” to intensify tribal loyalty. To Trump, pretty much everything is a wedge issue. His culture war is total war. It feels as if he will not rest until there isn’t a single corner of American life that isn’t manacled to a political binary. This is, not coincidentally, the goal of Trump’s former adviser Steve Bannon and his late colleague Andrew Breitbart, who liked to say: “Politics is downstream from culture. I want to change the cultural narrative.” The propaganda documentaries that Bannon made before taking over the Trump campaign pushed a hyperbolic, Manichean view of politics with no room for compromise or shared values, and that became the intellectual and emotional rocket fuel that powered Trumpism. The scale and ferocity of this polarisation is unprecedented. Even Republican presidents who exploited resentment and division paid lip service to the idea of national unity, and they didn’t have Twitter to play with. After Kaepernick’s protest a year ago, conservatives blamed “social justice warriors” for politicising activities that should bring Americans together. “This country was founded on the notion that politics should not govern every important issue in our lives,” wrote Jonah Goldberg in the conservative journal National Review. Sport, he said, was too important to be contaminated by political opinions. “Rich and poor, black and white, liberal and conservative, southerner and northerner: people from all walks of life can engage in friendly conversation about this widely shared cultural institution.” Well, somebody energetically trashed that harmonious vision over the weekend, and it wasn’t somebody on the left. Trump’s total culture war infects everything, forcing his ugly binary where it doesn’t belong. One critic recently described Taylor Swift’s single Look What You Made Me Do as “the first pure, truly emblematic, undeniable piece of art of the Trump era”. Another criticised the good-natured pop trio Haim for representing “a dream come true” in an era when “we have daily nightmares”, as if even old-fashioned pop escapism were now suspect. The Oscar race between Moonlight and La La Land became yet another proxy war. “This year’s final Oscar vote will be a referendum of sorts on Trump,” said the LA Times. It is increasingly hard to find any cultural debate that isn’t a referendum of sorts on Trump. You can imagine a point where every movie, record, TV show or football game is a battleground. Over the weekend, the New Yorker editor, David Remnick, wrote that “the damage he does, speech after speech, tweet after tweet, deepens like a coastal shelf. Every day, his presidency takes a toll on our national fabric.” How do you fight somebody who feeds on “againstness”? Positive polarisation is one of the most poisonous innovations in the history of American democracy and Trump has upped the dosage to levels that make Nixon seem reserved. (Ruthless, cynical and corrupt though he was, Tricky Dick didn’t conduct race-baiting feuds in public.) Some would advise restraint. On Sunday, Senator Ben Sasse, Trump’s most prominent Republican critic, tweeted: “Trump wants you to kneel – because it divides the nation, with him and the flag on the same side. Don’t give him the attention he wants.” There’s some truth in that, and yet to refrain from protest feels like an admission of defeat. Even if to not be cowed or silenced is to play by his rules, what is the alternative? At least there is safety in numbers. Fourteen years ago, the Dixie Chicks’ career was irreparably damaged by a single phrase: “We’re ashamed that the president of the United States is from Texas.” Kanye West caused uproar with his attack on Bush. We still remember these statements because they were so unusual that they made headlines and shaped reputations. Among the many norms that Trump has shattered is the assumption that the office of president merits a certain amount of respect and the wrong insult extracts a heavy price. Now LeBron James can call Trump “u bum” and it feels like par for the course. Even Kathy Griffin, who was savaged for a photograph of a decapitated Trump effigy, has bounced back with an unapologetic standup tour. The Resistance is everywhere. The challenge is how to beat Trump rather than just fuelling his fire. The history of protest in the US teaches us an important lesson. Progressives win when they successfully resist attempts to label them un-American. To supply the flag hawks with ammunition, as Jane Fonda did with her 1972 trip to North Vietnam (“a huge, huge mistake,” she later said), is disastrous. Like all nationalist demagogues, Trump wants to wrap himself in the flag and dismiss his opponents as insufficiently America-loving, but John Legend has written a powerful article for Slate that frames the protesters, not the president, as the true patriots. “Trump may love the flag, but he doesn’t love anything it’s supposed to stand for,” Legend wrote. He concluded: “These protests are their own form of a pledge-of-allegiance … they are the definition of patriotism.” Last summer, Kaepernick said that he hoped a serious, empathetic national conversation about race could “unify this country”. LeBron James said in a recent video message: “It’s not about dividing. We as American people need to just come together even more strongly.” That national reunion may be a long way off, but at least some people are talking about the importance of unity and the lasting civic damage of calculated polarisation. Like Jackie Robinson or Stevie Wonder before them, they require no lessons in American values from the bum in the White House."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/17/iphone-x-apple-how-to-sell-old-smartphone-new-release-november","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T10:25:00Z","webTitle":"iPhone X: how to sell your old device in preparation for Apple's new release","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/17/iphone-x-apple-how-to-sell-old-smartphone-new-release-november","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/17/iphone-x-apple-how-to-sell-old-smartphone-new-release-november","fields":{"headline":"iPhone X: how to sell your old device in preparation for Apple's new release","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The iPhone X is coming soon, and if you want to be able to afford it, you have three options: travel back in time and buy a shedload of bitcoin; sell a kidney; or sell your existing phone and hope you get a good price. That third option is probably the best. But if you haven’t sold a phone, it can be daunting: may people like to hang on to their old model, “just in case”, and even if it just sits gathering dust in a drawer somewhere, that’s less stressful than having to deal with exchanging cash on the internet. Good news, then. It’s generally quite easy to sell a phone online these days. Comparison sites such as Sell My Mobile allow you to pit the numerous resale sites against each other: currently, for instance, Phones 2 Pounds will offer you £272 for a 128GB iPhone 6s, while Money for your Phone will give you the best price for the Plus version of the same vintage – £276. For those looking for a bit more cash, eBay remains the best place to turn. The same phone that will net you £272 from Phones 2 Pounds is selling for around £400 on the online marketplace – and prices for faulty or otherwise damaged phones are also pretty good, even cracked and smashed phones going for more than £200. It’s also hugely popular. According to the company, “iPhone” has been the most popular search term on the entire site over the last year, with sales exceeding £1bn over the same period. The increase in buyers is evened out by the increase in sellers, so don’t expect the demand to boost your earnings too much, but the liquid market means you can be certain you’ll sell. The downside is that eBay carries a bit more risk than the commercial buyers. The site’s anti-fraud mechanisms are weighed heavily in the buyer’s favour, making it important to do things by the book on the off chance that you end up the victim of a scammer (or just an overly demanding buyer). That means documenting everything, posting the phone through recorded delivery, and taking care to note suspicious signs from buyers – like requests to ship to PO Boxes, or strange payment methods. If you want to get the highest price, then Sunday evenings are the most popular time to browse for a new phone, eBay says – so make sure your auction ends that night. Regardless of which way you want to do it, it may be worth either selling your phone a bit before, or a while after, the iPhone X comes out. A glut in supply can serve to drive prices down, as everyone races to upgrade at the same time. “After the release of the iPhone 7 in September 2016, iPhone 6 and 6s dropped by an average of £43 or 13%,” said a spokesperson from Sell My Mobile. “We expected the same with this latest release but the depreciation has actually not been as sharp as anticipated. We attribute this to people holding on to their handsets as the 8 failed to set the market on fire and Apple fans possibly are waiting to see how the X compares when it is released later in the year. “Phone shoppers are savvier than ever before when it comes to upgrading with so much choice in the market, and handset providers need to work harder to wow them. Whilst the optimum time has passed, there is still significant money to be made, on Apple as well as other handsets, and the longer you wait, the less you will inevitably get.” It’s not like you’re going to be able to pick up the £999 phone at launch anyway – supply is expected to be heavily constrained. Flying to US to get an iPhone X is cheaper than buying in Europe.

The North Korean foreign minister Ri Yong-ho said: “The whole world should clearly remember it was the US who first declared war on our country.” He referred in particular to Trump’s tweet on Sunday that warned that the regime’s leaders “won’t be around much longer”. In his first address to the UN last Tuesday, Trump had also warned that if the US and its allies were attacked, he would “totally destroy” North Korea. Ri said the UN and the international community had hoped that the war of words between the two countries would not turn into “real action”. “However, last weekend Trump claimed that our leadership won’t be around much longer, and hence at last he declared war on our country,” Ri said, speaking to journalists through an interpreter outside the UN general assembly in New York. “Given the fact that this came from someone who holds the seat of the US presidency, this is clearly a declaration of war.” Ri added: “Since the United States declared war on our country, we will have every right to make counter-measures, including the right to shoot down United States strategic bombers even when they are not yet inside the airspace border of our country. “The question of who won’t be around much longer will be answered then. The US denied it had declared war but warned it had military options if North Korea does take further “provocative” actions. “Frankly, the suggestion of that is absurd,” said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. “Our goal is still the same: we continue to seek the peaceful denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” she said. “That’s our focus – doing that through both the most maximum economic and diplomatic pressures as possible at this point.” Katina Adams, a spokeswoman for the state department, said “The United States has not ‘declared war’ on North Korea. We continue to seek a peaceful denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. No nation has the right to fire on other nations’ aircraft or ships in international airspace or waters.” Meanwhile, the Pentagon said it had the right to fly sorties off the North Korean coast and would continue to do so. Col Robert Manning, a defence department spokesman said that the US had weighed military options in confronting the threat from North Korea. “If North Korea does not stop their provocative actions … we will make sure that we provide options to the president to deal with North Korea,” Manning said. Ri’s threat came after a week in which tensions between the US and North Korea escalated rapidly, with an exchange of insults between Trump and Kim Jong-un, the North Korean dictator, and which culminated in Trump’s Sunday tweet and a sortie by US B-1B heavy bombers escorted by fighter planes off the North Korean coast – the first time this century that US warplanes have flown north of the demilitarized zone that has separated North and South Korea since the 1950-53 war. The US and North Korea have remained at war ever since, formally speaking. There was no peace treaty, and a UN armistice has remained in force since 1953. North Korea claims its national airspace as more than 50 miles off its coast, while the US recognizes only the international norm of 12 nautical miles. It is not clear how close Saturday’s flight came to the North Korean coast. Nor is it entirely clear whether Pyongyang’s anti-aircraft missiles could shoot down a US bomber. Its KN-06 missiles have an estimated range of nearly 100 miles, but it is not known whether it has the means to target and hit an offshore target. “It is easier to prevent penetration than strike an aircraft that is offshore. The US military will be calibrating how and where it flies,” said Adam Mount, a senior fellow at the Centre for American Progress. “It will be tough to take shots, but we can’t assume that they would fail.” “It’s difficult to respond to a nuclear test – but if a US aircraft is shot at, there is a straightforward response, and many will want to shoot back at the missile site,” Mount added. “So a conventional provocation is even more dangerous.” This is not the first time the Pyongyang regime has accused the US of declaring war, and it has previously shot down US aircraft, a navy surveillance plane in 1969, killing 31 servicemen, and an army helicopter in 1994, killing a pilot. However, experts and officials say the risks of all out war are now substantially greater. North Korea, officially known as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), has developed and tested a nuclear warhead, probably a hydrogen bomb, and long range missiles, while the leaders of both countries have made the confrontation between their two countries, a personal test of strength. Vipin Narang, an expert on the Korean peninsula showdown at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said that the Pyongyang regime “really hates the B-1B flights. They’re clearly making the regime nervous about a surprise attack. This is how war by miscalculation starts.” “Yesterday’s flight went further north than any this century, though still in international airspace east of DPRK,” Narang said. “But Kim seems to be worried, and reasonably so, that such a flight is exactly how a surprise decapitation or counterforce strike could start. So what we intend as a ‘show of strength’ could easily be mistaken as a prelude to a surprise attack, forcing Kim to go preemptively.” He said: “It is unclear to me what the more aggressive shows of strength achieve – we can deter DPRK and reassure our allies in a multitude of other ways that are less risky and don’t throw poison ivy all over Kim’s itchy finger trigger.” The UN secretary general, António Guterres, warned that heated rhetoric could only increases the risk of confrontation. “Fiery talk can lead to fatal misunderstandings,” UN spokesman Stéphane Dujarric told reporters. “The only solution for this is a political solution.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/sep/25/addison-lee-wrongly-classed-drivers-as-self-employed-tribunal-rules","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T15:35:11Z","webTitle":"Addison Lee wrongly classed drivers as self-employed, tribunal rules","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/sep/25/addison-lee-wrongly-classed-drivers-as-self-employed-tribunal-rules","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/sep/25/addison-lee-wrongly-classed-drivers-as-self-employed-tribunal-rules","fields":{"headline":"Addison Lee wrongly classed drivers as self-employed, tribunal rules","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Drivers for London-based minicab company Addison Lee could be owed wages and holiday pay after an employment tribunal test case found that some had been wrongly classed as self-employed. The tribunal in central London ruled that three drivers, who claimed they earned the equivalent of about £5 an hour as self-employed contractors, should have been treated as workers. That means they must receive the minimum wage of £7.50 an hour, plus holiday pay, and will be owed back pay. Addison Lee uses 3,800 self-employed drivers in the capital, who are all potentially affected by the case brought by Michaell Lange, Mark Morahan and Mieczysław Olszewski. Their lawyers estimate that holiday pay for each worker could amount to £4,000, with wages yet to be calculated. The verdict is the latest legal blow to companies operating in the gig economy and raises the stakes for the appeal against a similar ruling against rival minicab operator Uber, which opens at the employment appeals tribunal on Wednesday. In October 2016 Uber lost a tribunal case brought by two of its 40,000 drivers, who argued successfully they should be treated as workers. Neither ruling automatically mean all self-employed drivers will receive worker rights, but unless the firms change the contractual arrangements, they would be left open to mass claims in the employment courts. Addison Lee said it was disappointed with the ruling, which was handed down by employment judge David Pearl. He concluded its defence of the self-employment arrangement “defied evidential gravity”. “We have always had, and are committed to maintaining, a flexible and fair relationship, which generates work for 3,800 drivers,” a spokesman for the company said, adding that it would review the decision. Addison Lee made £61m in profit last year. It is owned by the private equity giant Carlyle Group, which brought it in 2013 for about £300m from owners including founder John Griffin, a former minicab driver, who set up the company in 1975. During the tribunal, Addison Lee conceded that it had implied the drivers in its branded cars were part of its organisation, but argued that in reality each was running a small business. However, the tribunal did not accept this after hearing that drivers faced fixed costs of hiring Addison Lee-liveried Ford Galaxy cars, which typically cost between 25 and 30 hours work a week to pay off. It heard they were obliged to accept jobs once logged on to the company’s booking system, comply with a dress code and a code of conduct that, among other things, required asking customers if they had a preferred route. They were also told they must not “pull away” from a job without the consent of the control base, again suggesting they were not self-employed. Pearl ruled that “the drivers were not in any realistic sense contracting with Addison Lee”, rather that “they were in a subordinate position”. Morahan, 63, who worked as an Addison Lee driver for more than a year before bringing the case, said he had watched drivers’ earnings falling and that he was very pleased with the verdict. “This combined with the Uber case will ensure that these American companies play by the rules,” he said. “They are happy to drop prices but it is the drivers who end up paying for it. When people are desperate for a job they have no option but to work longer hours and they are taken advantage of.” Liana Wood, solicitor at Leigh Day, which represented the drivers, said Addison Lee had “sought to deny its drivers the most basic workers’ rights” and that its drivers “very often work very long hours, in excess of 60 hours a week, in order to just earn enough to cover their basic living costs”. She said: “This decision will not just have an impact on the thousands of Addison Lee drivers but, following on from the decision in Uber, on all workers in the so-called gig economy whose employers classify them as self-employed and deny them the rights to which they are entitled.” Maria Ludkin, legal director of the GMB trade union, which backed the claim, said: “This ruling means yet another logistics firm has been forced to obey the law and honour responsibilities to employees. GMB will continue to pursue these exploitative companies on behalf of our members.” Similar employment tribunal cases considering worker rights for self-employed gig economy workers are due to be heard early next year involving couriers for the delivery companies Hermes and DX."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/30/universe-review-our-starry-night-seen-all-angles-phaidon","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T18:00:40Z","webTitle":"Universe review: our starry night, seen from all angles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/30/universe-review-our-starry-night-seen-all-angles-phaidon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/30/universe-review-our-starry-night-seen-all-angles-phaidon","fields":{"headline":"Universe review: our starry night, seen from all angles","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Many poetic descriptions of the universe have found their way into print over the millennia that humankind has been fascinated with outer space. The starry vault, the firmament, the void, heaven – all express something of the awe and mystery we naturally feel when confronted with infinity. Perhaps the most apparently incongruous, yet simultaneously most appropriate description is to be found in the works of William Herschel, the 18th-century astronomer who discovered the planet Uranus. He called the universe a “luxuriant garden”. He lived in Bath with his sister Caroline at a time when botanists were travelling the world to classify its myriad plants. Herschel saw a direct parallel to his own efforts to catalogue the celestial objects that he and his sister were discovering in the night sky. Each curiosity appeared as a sculpted twist of dim light in his telescope, as plentiful and as diverse as wildflowers in a meadow, hence his horticultural description. As I flipped through the pages of the new Phaidon book Universe, I found myself experiencing a sense of Herschelian wonder at the sheer beauty of deep space. But what makes this book unique is that as well as the breathtaking images taken with telescopes and the drawings of historical astronomers, it also includes the creative representations that have sprung from the mind of artists. The result is a weighty tome that contains more than 300 evocative pictures. It was once popular to call publications of this sort “coffee table books”, but Universe deserves more serious consideration than as a visual distraction while taking a caffeine hit. “The pictures had to have art-historical interest, aesthetic value and/or curiosity value, and above all be provocative,” says Professor Paul Murdin, an astronomer from the University of Cambridge, who wrote the book’s introduction. It is a refreshing perspective to bring to an astronomy book, and reflects perfectly the quiet rise of “one culture” thinking that places art and science on level pegging as equally valid ways to bring meaning to our place in nature. Perhaps this is because the book’s editor is Rosie Pickles, an art historian rather than an astronomer, who put together a group of consultants to advise on pictures that were significant and/or fresh, and spanned a number of cultures. “Artists have a way of seeing that is different from us scientists,” says Murdin, “We let nature provide the originality and beauty, artists get inspiration from sources that is less constrained.” Thus, a high-definition image of the galaxy Centaurus A is placed opposite a diptych from artist Jane Grisewood. Centaurus A contains a supermassive black hole in its core that is disturbing space so much that jets of particles can be seen shooting out of it, and Grisewood’s piece reflects her interest in black holes. It uses two black-and-white artworks to visualise the power of gravity, both to hold shining objects together and to hide things from view within a heart of utter darkness. Elsewhere in the book, a 1582 alchemical representation of the sun, complete with a ray halo and a human face, is juxtaposed with a 21st-century computer simulation of a sunspot. Immediately noticeable are the tendrils that reach out from the sunspot, emulating the artistic representation of the sun’s rays in the artwork. Although this works well, the approach could perhaps have been more clearly signposted on the cover. Subtitling the book Exploring the Astronomical World does mean that it is going to disappoint anyone who purchases it as an easy way to learn astronomy. Unapologetically, it sometimes requires the reader to closely examine the captions to separate scientific fact from artistic fiction. For example, I was surprised to learn that the picture of Titan is in fact a piece of art by Daniel Zeller. Conversely, it was almost a shock to discover that the impressionistic swirls, rather pretentiously (I thought) called Dunes on Mars, was in fact a picture, from the HIRISE camera on Nasa’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, of actual dunes on Mars. The piece that brought the biggest smile to my face was Totality by Scottish artist Katie Paterson. She constructed a disco ball, each mirrored tile depicting a different solar eclipse. It reminds me of all the times I’ve secretly stood beneath one and imagined that I’m in deep space. The book contains images of genuine surprise. One such is 1971’s Fallen Astronaut by Paul van Hoeydonck. The Belgian artist fashioned a 8.5cm tall human figure out of aluminium as a tribute to the six Soviet cosmonauts and the eight US astronauts who had died in the exploration of space. What makes it truly extraordinary, however, is that the image shows it lying in the dust on the surface of the moon. Apollo 15 astronaut Dave Scott had smuggled it aboard his lunar capsule and deposited it there without the approval or knowledge of Nasa during a moon walk. As there is no atmosphere on the moon, the small statue could now rest there undisturbed for millennia. Elsewhere, there is a possible explanation for the detail in Vincent Van Gogh’s 1889 painting The Starry Night. Created by the artist while recovering from his infamous ear-severing incident, the night sky is alive with stars and a curious swirl of blue. The caption here suggests that the inspiration for this styling is an image reproduced on page 30 of the book. This is an 1845 drawing made at the eyepiece of a telescope at Birr Castle, County Offaly, Ireland by the third Earl of Rosse. It shows the swirl of light he glimpsed that we now know is the Whirlpool Galaxy, a giant collection of hundreds of billions of stars some 25m light years away. Van Gogh’s inclusion of the swirl is rather like the way more modern Hollywood artists look at the latest cosmic images for verisimilitude in their science-fiction film backdrops. To prove that point, there is David Morton’s Vulcan and Sister Planet and its Moon from the 2001 director’s edition of 1979’s Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Here is an exotic landscape with a sky full of other planetary bodies – strikingly similar in both composition and colour palette to the unearthly vistas being returned by Nasa’s early Pioneer and Voyager missions to the outer planets. One of Murdin’s own favourite images is of Buzz Aldrin’s footprint on the lunar surface. The reason, he says, is because “the picture is about everything you can’t see in the picture”. That itself is an important theme running throughout. The images are designed to stimulate our thinking about different ways humans have visualised the universe and our place within it. Murdin says that he hopes the reader will take away “pride at being human in a vast and fascinating universe”. There are not many books that can claim that level of ambition. While some will balk at the interdisciplinary approach, it is worth remembering that many of the most popular astronomy books, even from the giants like Stephen Hawking, contain their elements of fiction. By that I mean that there is a modern fashion for neglecting to differentiate mere hypotheses from established fact. At least here, the origin of the image is detailed in the caption.

Thirty years on, hung in a brightly lit room in the Whitechapel Gallery, they retain their power to unsettle, not least because of their uniformity, their almost forensic detachment. Everyone looks ordinary, neither flattered by Ruff’s camera nor aggrandised by the monumental prints. If anything, his subjects’ shared middle-class conformity is emphasised by the scale and detail. Ruff’s head-and-shoulder studies are a deadpan retort to Bernhard’s salvo against photography as “a perverse and treacherous falsification”. Nevertheless, Ruff includes Bernhard’s broadside in the catalogue for this London retrospective under a section entitled Fragments, in which he cites several sources, from Bertolt Brecht to Michel Houellebecq, that have influenced his work. One can see why. In ways he could not have imagined, Bernhard’s scathing summation of photography’s power to mesmerise, flatter and falsify has come to pass in the age of Instagram and the selfie. For that reason alone, this is a timely show, a chance to see the full breadth and prescient power of Ruff’s exploration of how photography has been put to use – by artists, scientists, archivists, curators as well as photographers – over the last four decades. There is nothing straightforward about Ruff’s engagement with the medium. Instead, his images are often oblique, referencing art history from modernism to the present, and increasingly engaging not so much with photography as with the image culture that it is now enmeshed in. Like Christopher William, also the subject of a recent Whitechapel retrospective, Ruff makes photography about photography. Both his early interiors – functional, neat, inordinately tidy – and the Portraits series nod to the formal typologies of his art school teachers, Bernd and Hilla Becher, founders of the so-called Düsseldorf School, which Ruff – like Thomas Struth and Candida Höfer – has been bracketed under. Ruff appropriates and reworks found photographs culled from press archives, the internet and even outer space. He has blown up jpegs until their low resolution becomes a kind of pixellated abstraction, turning internet pornography into a kind of blurred – in every sense of the word – eroticism. To wander through the Whitechapel show is to wonder at how photography has become as much about remaking images as making them – and to witness how deeply Ruff’s magpie imagination has engaged with the limits of photography in an age of image overload. Once you have passed through that bright room of big, almost uncannily blank portraits, there are several small surprises. A series called Other Portraits comprises just two large monochrome head-and-shoulders studies that, on first glance, appear to be of an anonymous man and woman. They are in fact composites of the two, one set of features imposed on the other. The results are unsettling, recalling blown up passport photos or criminal mugshots, but with a haunting – and haunted – quality. His Nudes series, created between 1990 and 2012 by enlarging and blurring images of internet porn, possesses an unreal aura that is oddly beautiful. That aura also attends his Night series, made in German cities throughout the 1990s using a night-vision camera. Here, noirish streets and buildings seem shrouded in a misty aquamarine glow that recalls 1950s sci-fi films or noir thrillers. Sometimes, as in the room where the Victorian negatives (their colours inverted to even more ghostly effect) share space uneasily with Soviet-style images of machinery, one could be forgiven for thinking that each series is the work of a different photographer. It is a testament to Ruff’s rigour that such experimentation only occasionally fractures what is somehow, against all the odds, a sustained signature. Of late, though, Ruff has tended towards pure texture. Three large-scale images from a recent series, entitled ma.r.s, are close-ups of the planet, in which the surface has been enhanced digitally to make it look even more alien, but also aesthetically arresting. One huge crater is a bas-relief that requires 3D glasses for the full effect. Elsewhere, there are exercises in abstraction and photograms that echo the experiments of modernist masters like Man Ray and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, and – surprisingly – a selection of more recent images in which press archive photographs have been overlaid with the information written on the back of the prints. Given his preceding experiments with enhanced colour and form, this seems almost like a backwards step, the one note in the show when Ruff’s work seems to lag behind contemporary photography (its ongoing obsession with archives and found images) rather than anticipating it. Ruff has come a long way from the almost dadaist provocation of one of his earliest series, shown here, in which he draped himself in absurd poses over his living room furniture – poking fun, it seems, at the formal constrictions of traditional portraiture and the excesses of staged, postmodern self-representation. Somewhere in this challenging retrospective, that sense of mischief gets lost amid all the inter-referentiality but, in this too, Ruff was ahead of the game. He anticipated the vibrant crisis that photography finds itself in, amid the deluge of online immateriality. And, for all that, he makes beautiful prints that echo the values of another time, one whose craft and modernist rigour still haunts our profligate image culture. • Thomas Ruff: Photographs 1979–2017 is at the Whitechapel Gallery, London, 27 September to 21 January."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/27/logical-family-by-armistead-maupin-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T06:29:26Z","webTitle":"Logical Family by Armistead Maupin review – how the Tales of the City author was transformed\r\n","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/27/logical-family-by-armistead-maupin-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/27/logical-family-by-armistead-maupin-review","fields":{"headline":"Logical Family by Armistead Maupin review – how the Tales of the City author was transformed\r\n","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Armistead Maupin’s memoir has two contrasting halves. The first 10 chapters constitute a confession; the last 10 a celebration of the turned-around new life he adopted well into adulthood and far from home. He grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina, among conservative, racist Republicans. His father was a Confederate nostalgist, pro-segregation and intolerant of any view more liberal than his own. When he built a playhouse for his son, he used his wife’s nail polish to inscribe above the little porch: “SAVE YOUR CONFEDERATE MONEY! THE SOUTH WILL RISE AGAIN.” Armistead’s mother, a more temperate character, was nonetheless racist. When her son referred to a “coloured lady”, she corrected him: “No, darling, she’s a coloured woman. There are no colored ladies. Only white ladies are ladies.” Maupin himself, who as a child rarely encountered black people, was a conservative Republican – with gusto – until he was nearly 30. His preoccupation as a child was the unavailable approval of his “Daddy”, who was cold and homophobic. Maupin was completely closeted and a virgin well into his 20s. He served with enthusiasm in the navy in Vietnam (and was still a virgin when he got home). “I had wasted my youth trying to be my father,” he writes. Which seems to be sad and true. He dropped out of law school and worked as a reporter on a Charleston newspaper. Then, having recently discovered the joy of gay sex, he was offered a job as a journalist in San Francisco. He moved there, carrying with him a “framed ancestral portrait of Grandpa Branch” (a Confederate general shot off his horse while speaking to General Lee) and wearing a new “Irish setter-coloured houndstooth tweed suit”. He drove in a new sports car, which he later mentions in passing having totalled “in a head-on collision on Russian Hill”. On his way west, he stopped to visit a friend in Iowa. During dinner, the phone rang. It was the White House calling; President Nixon’s office had been trying urgently to reach him. Officer Maupin was wanted for a press event in the Oval Office touting a Vietnam veterans initiative he had volunteered for in 1971, age 27. The “Cat Lai Commune” was a hastily contrived project that purported to help the Vietnamese people by building a 20-unit housing complex for disabled veterans. Maupin spent most of his time writing “inspirational pieces” about his experience there, one of which was published in William F Buckley’s notorious National Review. So Maupin drove his new sports car east again, back to Washington to meet the president, unsure of what to expect. Nixon wrapped up their conversation by joking about “those little girls” in Vietnam, “riding down the street on their bicycles with the tails of their silk ao dais blowing in the wind … they look like little butterflies”. Maupin realised, to his horror, “that Nixon was trying to talk sex with us – a little wink wink, nudge nudge with the troops – but, as his lousy luck would have it, he had chosen to do so with the only cocksucker in sight”. This meeting with the president was the climax of Maupin’s 28-year stint as a deeply conservative good old boy. His life was steadily transformed, at first by easy access to plentiful sex with (many) fellow enthusiasts: “If anything delivered me from the privileged white elitism of my youth it was the red-lit cubicles and darkened hallways and even darker mazes of Dave’s Baths. Everyone went there, pilgrims united on a quest for cock.” That and the roaring success, just a few years later, of his serial Tales of the City, a daily fictional column published by the San Francisco Chronicle beginning in 1976, which was followed by several books of the stories turned into bestselling novels that made Maupin famous. He became one of Rock Hudson’s friends-with-benefits. Having come bursting out of the closet (Maupin publicly outed Hudson when the movie star became ill with Aids), he renounced the bigotry and intolerance of his past. He had a 12‑year relationship with one man and later married another. Each of the 20 chapters of Maupin’s memoir reads like a well-made scene for TV: tidy and arced, with a punchline. Details are few, particularly about his parents and grandparents – his illogical, biological family. Potentially juicy episodes are mentioned in passing, as when he notes having performed, at 13, in a production of The Desperate Hours, the role of “a suburban boy who was kidnapped by thugs and, all too briefly for my taste, manhandled by them”. Or in high school, writing a report on the origins of the maypole and, after referring to the encyclopedia entry for “phallic symbols”, reading aloud to his teacher and classmates about pagans and penises. Those must have been richly odd experiences for a boy growing up among people such as his strictly untheatrical and unpagan parents and their friends. His thespian grandmother is a primary figure in the book, but there is barely a word more about young Armistead’s own experience of a theatrical milieu or his adolescent consciousness of the phallus. The book covers six decades, and at 304 pages with lots of white space per page, it’s a spare selection of anecdotes that are supposed to interpret and shape the meaning of Maupin’s life – a lot has been left out. There are brief scenes featuring his friends Laura Linney, Ian McKellen and Christopher Isherwood. But conspicuously missing from a memoir called Logical Family is any description of an ordinary, intimate circle of San Francisco friends and lovers, the people presumably referred to by the title and inspirations for the characters in Tales of the City. There’s very little about Christopher Turner, Maupin’s husband and the book’s dedicatee. A more apt title for this autobiographical story about changing from one type (conservative, chaste and clueless about the unjust plights of others) to its opposite (liberal, promiscuous and focused to some extent on diversity, equality and freedom) would have been “A Different Person”. But that title was taken by the American poet James Merrill’s superb 1993 memoir, in which another privileged white boy goes gay and good. (“Logical Family” might likewise have been a suitable title for Merrill’s memoir, which is about going to Europe to begin the lifelong effort to replace his biological folks with a memorable clan of misfit friends, mostly artists of one sort or another, many of them writers, some of them not famous.) If I had to choose between rereading one of the two – well, never mind. Logical Family, like all of Maupin’s books, is best read quickly, and just once. That’s entertainment. • Rick Whitaker’s books include Assuming the Position: A Memoir of Hustling. Logical Family is published by Doubleday.

Senior officials also told activists who head the3million campaign group that EU citizens already in the UK will not have to meet a minimum income threshold or have private health insurance to stay in the country after Brexit. The summary of the main points of the meeting was agreed via email with the Home Office and was due to be released publicly on Monday as part of the3million’s efforts to keep up the pressure on the government as it enters the fourth round of Brexit talks in Brussels this week. It read: “The Home Office has confirmed ... its position that EU citizens will not have to have comprehensive sickness insurance [private health insurance], will not have to meet an income threshold, will not have to submit fingerprints; will not be issued with an ID card.” They were told this was the Home Office position on EU citizens already in the UK and not post-Brexit migrants. However, the3million, which has previously written to the European commission to say it does not trust the Home Office with EU citizens’ futures, remains sceptical. While they see it as a “great news” for people like students and stay-at-home parents who previously required CSI [comprehensive sickness insurance], they say they are “reserving judgment” on any future system. The Home Office has indicated to the3million that the new registration system would result in a “digital” document and not a card to be carried around. It has also pointed to agreement with the EU Brexit negotiators in the August round of talks that fingerprints would not be used for ID. “The fact is that they will probably need de facto ID cards to prove that they were existing residents rather than new entrants, because it looks like new entrants will have to register,” said immigration barrister Colin Yeo. Nicolas Hatton, the chairman of the3million said it found it difficult to believe government promises given the “confusion at the top” over post-Brexit rights. “On Friday we had Theresa May saying we would have the same rights as before, and on Sunday we have David Davis saying we won’t have reunification and we won’t have registration,” said Nicolas Hatton, co-founder of the3million. He was referring to the Brexit secretary’s interview with the BBC’s Andrew Marr in which he said that in future EU citizens would not be allowed to have a spouse or other relative from a non-EU country join them in the UK, as is currently permitted under EU freedom of movement rules. “In the long run that won’t happen and we have to get to a situation where British – British citizens and the 3 million or so Europeans who are here – are on a level standing,” Davis said. He told Marr this was currently one of the areas on which British and EU negotiators had clashed. Two days earlier May painted a different picture, reassuring EU citizens that every right they had now would be preserved. “It has been, and it remains, one of my first goals in this negotiation is to ensure that you can carry on living your lives as before,” May said. Davis’s view appears to chime with the leaked immigration paper, which proposes a crackdown on the rights of EU citizens to bring in family members, even those of EU nationalities. The reassurances the3million received on 15 September also strike a radically different tone to the clampdown on immigration proposed in the leaked immigration document, which was written on 7 August, and leaked to the Guardian. The document said that during the Brexit transition phase people who wanted to reside in the UK for an extended period would have to provide proof of citizenship either with a passport “or a Home Office biometric immigration document”, which critics say amounts to an ID card system. On fingerprinting, the document stated that “in order to protect against identity fraud, we may also wish to take the fingerprints of those new arrivals who are registering”. Hatton says the continuing disparities between May and Davis does not augur well for Brexit talks this week. “I think they will struggle to persuade the EU, if they do not have a clear idea of what their aim for negotiations are,” said Hatton. The right of EU citizens to bring in third-country spouses is already testing the Home Office, with officials threatening wives and husbands with deportation. Last week the Guardian reported on the case of a Japanese woman who had been told to leave the country, had her child benefit stopped and her driving licence cancelled even though she was legally in the country as the spouse of an EU national for more than a decade. “The lack of the grasp of the detail in politicians’ minds on this issue is telling,” Hatton added. “The statement issued by the3million group today reiterates our public position on these issues,” said a spokesman for the Home Office."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/25/labour-pfi-contracts-john-mcdonnell","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T16:35:48Z","webTitle":"Labour's PFI pledge would be expensive – but isn't a blank cheque | Larry Elliott","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/25/labour-pfi-contracts-john-mcdonnell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/25/labour-pfi-contracts-john-mcdonnell","fields":{"headline":"Labour's PFI pledge would be expensive – but it isn't a blank cheque","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The private finance initiative was the live now, pay later method of building hospitals, schools and other bits of public infrastructure. Governments that were short of cash could get companies to put up the cost of shiny new investment and pay the money back in instalments over many decades. But as John McDonnell stressed in his speech to Labour’s conference, PFI has proved a rotten deal for taxpayers because the accumulated annual payments have dwarfed the initial building costs. In the long run, it would have been cheaper for ministers to borrow the money rather than sign what were essentially expensive mortgage deals with the private sector. That was the case even when interest rates were 5% or more. It has been doubly true since the collapse of official borrowing costs in the 10 years since the financial crisis to barely more than zero. PFI deals were dreamed up when Britain crashed out of the exchange rate mechanism 25 years ago and were falling out of favour with the Tories when Gordon Brown backed them strongly following the 1997 election. McDonnell’s PFI pledge has two parts to it. The first part – no future PFI deals – is uncontroversial. Philip Hammond is not especially keen on them either. The other part – to wind up all existing PFI contracts – is a bit trickier. In theory, it would be possible for a future Labour government to say that the public had already paid many times over for their schools and hospitals and that therefore the contracts were being terminated without compensation. In reality, compensation would have to be paid. Lawyers made a small fortune from drawing up PFI deals, and these will guarantee the private contractors financial redress in the event that contracts are terminated. McDonnell is not even thinking of going down the no-compensation route, which is just as well since it would end up in a battle in the courts that he would almost certainly lose. Instead, the plan is that parliament will assess the appropriate level of compensation at the point at which contracts are brought back in-house, and shareholders will be compensated in the form of government bonds, which will be exchanged for shares. The idea that parliament, which has skin in the game, should decide on the level of compensation could itself be subject to a legal challenge. More importantly, though, the final figure for compensation is going to be high, no matter how it is arrived at. Estimates put the cost at between £50bn and £60bn for the NHS alone, to be financed by extra borrowing. Aware that there might be other – perhaps more pressing – demands for a future Labour government, McDonnell left himself some room for manoeuvre. The press notice sent out to accompany his speech did not say that Labour would wind up every PFI deal. Rather, it said a Jeremy Corbyn government would review all PFI contracts and, “if necessary”, take over outstanding contracts and bring them back in-house. That “if necessary” is important."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/filmblog/2017/sep/26/terminator-6-franchise-hollywood-linda-hamilton-james-cameron","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T05:00:34Z","webTitle":"Never go back: why the Terminator reunion may be a recipe for failure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2017/sep/26/terminator-6-franchise-hollywood-linda-hamilton-james-cameron","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2017/sep/26/terminator-6-franchise-hollywood-linda-hamilton-james-cameron","fields":{"headline":"Never go back: why the Terminator reunion may be a recipe for failure","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In the realm of Hollywood sci-fi, only one future is guaranteed. If a movie finds even a modicum of success with audiences, it will eventually be remade or turned into the starting point for a franchise. Who would have thought that a well-received but largely forgotten 1973 thriller about a wild west-style amusement park whose android cowboys turn on their guests would spark the best new television show of last year, in HBO’s Westworld? And who might have imagined in 1984 that The Terminator, a low budget futuristic vision from rookie film-maker James Cameron, would still be knocking around Hollywood 20 years after the date upon which the machines were supposed to have destroyed human civilisation? Ever since his last turn at the controls, 1991’s Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Cameron has been forced to watch from the sidelines as the laser-honed perfection of his original vision has been twisted into a malfunctioning mess by a series of lesser film-makers. But now he and his original cast – Arnold Schwarzenegger and the criminally underused Linda Hamilton – are back to reclaim the franchise from the Hollywood machine. Arnie has reportedly told a fan site that the new film will ignore the non-Cameron Terminator movies, with events taking their cue from Terminator and T2 only. We also know that the Avatar director will take a hands-on producer’s role, rather than directing, this time around. Deadpool’s Tim Miller is set to take charge for the first film, which is intended to mark the beginning of a new trilogy. On paper, Terminator 6 (or 2.5), sounds like it should have all the ingredients for success. Yet history tells us that famous Hollywood film-makers who revisit past glories often find it impossible to catch lightning in a bottle a second time around. Perhaps the most obvious case is that of Ridley Scott, whose return to the Alien franchise was hailed as an opportunity to recapture the brooding tone of his original 1979 venture, when he signed on to direct the film that eventually became Prometheus in 2009. Instead, the saga has lost its way horribly, with Scott seemingly obsessed with explaining elements of the Alien mythos that would be better off remaining as enigmas. Sure, we all really wanted to know where the “space jockey” from Alien came from, but not enough that we would pay to see a whole new movie about that hitherto innocuous extra-terrestrial species – especially as the original xenomorphs were far more grimly fascinating. And yes, okay, the madness of Michael Fassbender’s David was probably the most interesting thing about Prometheus (though there was not much competition). But that does not mean we wanted an entire episode (as was the case with this year’s Alien: Covenant) devoted to seeing how far the Machiavellian android was prepared to push his freakishly grotesque envelope. Scott is also returning as a producer on the imminent Blade Runner 2049, which at this stage looks rather more promising. With a little bit of luck, director Denis Villeneuve will have been given licence to pursue a vision that expands the original movie’s fascinating conversation about the nature of humanity, Because if Scott had been directing, we might easily have found ourselves watching a movie about the continuing adventures of the guy who serves Harrison Ford’s Rick Deckard his noodles. The British film-maker is not the only director to have come a cropper when revisiting past glories. Steven Spielberg’s final Indiana Jones movie ought to have been 1989’s The Last Crusade, but the three-time Oscar-winner was persuaded to return by his friend George Lucas for 2008’s ill-conceived Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, a movie now best known for the “nuke the fridge” scene, some dodgy CGI gophers and the unwelcome addition of Shia LaBeouf’s Mutt Williams. Not to be put off, Spielberg will be back alongside Ford’s whip-cracking archaeologist for more, in a new, Disney-backed episode next year. Then there is Peter Jackson, whose remarkable, Oscar-winning achievement in adapting JRR Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings was tarnished by his undercooked, over-stretched Hobbit trilogy, a decade later. Let’s not even mention Lucas’s damnable Star Wars prequels. Naturally there are exceptions to the rule that one should never go back – George Miller’s Mad Max: Fury Road being the clearest example. Why did that particular movie manage to buck the trend? And what can Cameron learn from his Australian contemporary? Instead of expanding the mythos into increasingly portentous territory, as Scott might have done, Miller simply gave us a better Mad Max movie than any we had seen before, trimming off extraneous fat and treating audiences to a thrillingly realised chase thriller of heavy-metal blood and thunder. If Cameron can repeat the trick, and give us a new Terminator film that feels like the definitive episode in the saga, most fans will be more than willing to pretend that the last three movies in the series were wiped out of existence the moment Cameron fired up the time displacement gizmo and set the old electricity a crackling once again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/25/it-doesnt-make-sense-to-leave-alcohol-out-of-the-drugs-debate","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T17:46:39Z","webTitle":"It doesn’t make sense to leave alcohol out of the drugs debate | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/25/it-doesnt-make-sense-to-leave-alcohol-out-of-the-drugs-debate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/25/it-doesnt-make-sense-to-leave-alcohol-out-of-the-drugs-debate","fields":{"headline":"It doesn’t make sense to leave alcohol out of the drugs debate","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It was interesting and puzzling to see John Harris’s piece on illegal drugs (I was relaxed about Britain’s drug culture evolution… , 23 September) two days on from the five points of view on whether or not drugs should be legalised (G2, 21 September).

Blaine Stothard London • What most commentators on drug legalisation ignore is that until the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, most drugs were legally obtainable in the UK (the exceptions were LSD and amphetamines). Before the act came into effect there were about 900 registered heroin addicts in the country, most of them members of the medical profession, and most in employment. It was the prohibition of heroin in 1971 that led directly to the huge increase in drugs misuse and the enormous, illegal industry to manufacture and supply them. Legalisation would simply be to recognise the disaster that was caused by the criminalisation of drugs in 1971.

Thief!” as a big rat races away into a nearby hole for refuge. It has rained and the drains are clogged with waste: the water pools on the road and fills the potholes along the thoroughfare leading to Lagos’s famous Ikosi fruit market. One of the largest of its kind in the city, the market is a popular spot for trading vegetables and fruit like pineapples, bananas and plantains. But here, like most parts of Nigeria, there is rarely a steady power supply – according to the World Bank, 75 million people in a country of 186 million don’t have access to electricity. “The light issue is a big one here. When there is no light, we have no choice but to close early, especially when we are witnessing shorter days and longer nights,” says market trader Ajose Abosede. A few metres away is a large abandoned biogas plant, tucked away in a corner of the market that overlooks a field littered with fruit waste. This was supposed to be the answer for Abosede and the other stallholders. Lagos, the biggest megacity in Africa, generates more than 13,000 tonnes of garbage a day, of which 50% is organic waste, says Lanre Gbajulaye of the Lagos State Waste Management Authority (Lawma). A huge amount of that waste comes from more than 30 markets – and therein lies surprising potential. Experts believe Lagos can be energy self-sufficient if it can tap into the latent power of its organic garbage. But it’s taking a little longer than they hoped. In 2013, the state government partnered with Midori Environmental Solutions (MES), a Lagos-based environmental company, to explore the possibilities of converting waste from the market into electricity using a biogas system. Food leftovers would be ground into paste and then broken down by bacteria in a biodigester, releasing biogas in the process. Once filtered, the gas would fuel a generator and produce enough electricity for up to 50 stalls and lock-up shops. The market produces 5,000 tonnes of waste a day – and the traders were more than happy to give this to the generator instead of paying to have it taken away. Banana seller Saliu Adenekan thought at first that the plan was a joke. “As old as I am, I have not seen or heard of how waste is used to generate light. I know that there must have been a way that people abroad treat and use their waste, but I have no idea we can do [the] same here in Nigeria, to say nothing of it working in Ikosi,” he says. For a while it looked as if it was all going ahead. MES was given a licence to build a “low-technology” facility, for what would be a flagship project – a symbol of the state’s innovative drive to solve its energy crisis, applauded by local and international observers. Not long after it was built, the biogas plant was up and running. At last, there was light. Nigeria’s energy system is a conundrum that no one seems able to solve. Despite having the largest gas and oil reserves in Africa, the country struggles to supply its power plants with adequate gas to generate electricity, and regularly appears to run out of petrol. On 31 March 2016, at exactly 12.58pm, Nigeria’s power grid collapsed and not a single megawatt of electricity was generated for three hours. This was unprecedented. The country’s three-pronged energy infrastructure consists of generation companies, distribution companies (DisCos) and the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), now operated by a mixture of the state and private companies after a privatisation drive in 2014, which some believe was bungled. The problems have been exacerbated by alleged financial mismanagement of some of the distribution companies – to say nothing of the frequent vandalism of gas pipelines in the country’s oil-rich Niger Delta by local militants fighting for resource control. According to Aliyu Wabba, president of the Nigeria Labour Congress, the deplorable state of the power sector has stifled Nigeria’s economy. Industries have not been thriving, which in turn inhibits employment opportunities for young Nigerians. “The economy continues to grow without jobs, bringing benefits to only a few. We demand an economy that provides jobs and other benefits,” Wabba told a Nigerian newspaper. In 2014, landmark reforms allowed private sector participation in the energy sector, particularly in power generation and distribution, but many believe the process has been deeply flawed, due to factors like corruption or poor leadership, and there have been calls for a full audit of the whole process. The government failed to check that investors who bought distribution companies were appropriately capitalised, or that they understood the technology of the enterprises they would own, says economist and former finance minister Kalu Idika Kalu. Yemi Oke, associate professor of energy and electricity law at the University of Lagos, believes the problems are largely man-made. “Some of the distribution companies are owned by corrupt and wealthy people who thought there is free money to be made in the power sector. They borrowed money and bought the distribution companies only to say that they won’t incur the liabilities of the company,” Oke says at his office in Lagos. According to Oke, the nation’s recent economic meltdown reveals that the private investors were neither as technically or as financially sound as they should have been before taking over as distribution companies. And when the price of oil tanked – and with it the value of the naira, Nigeria’s currency – the problems only multiplied. However, the government says the country will not review the 2014 privatisation of the power sector even as many Nigerians continue to feel the brunt of poor electricity supply. Increasingly, those who can afford it buy their own generators (sales rose from N29.48bn – £60m – in the second half of 2015 to N66.99bn – £138m – in the same period in 2016). As a short-term measure, the Nigerian government has decided to develop an incremental power strategy that would aim to sort out the human and administrative challenges bedevilling the power sector, while also harnessing every available megawatt of power. This is where ideas like generating energy from garbage come in. The government seems to be finally recognising the immense renewable potential in Nigeria. One report found that Nigeria’s concentrated solar thermal power potential stood at over 427,000MW – about 85 times more than the present level of power generation in the country. And the new emphasis on renewable energy has already started yielding results. In 2016, US$2.5bn (£1.85bn) was committed to 14 renewable energy projects by private investors, with the intention of adding a combined 1,000 megawatts to the national grid. So is the huge amount of waste in Lagos state the key to generating some of this electricity? Banana trader Adenekan’s excitement vanished a few months after work had begun on the Ikosi market biogas generator, when the government asked the contractor to hand it over. Lawma took over the initiative with the idea that it would be replicated in other markets across the state. That turned out not to be the case. A change in leadership at the waste management body saw the project shut down and abandoned. Three years on, the facility has ceased to operate and Ikosi fruit market has gone back to how it used to be: a community of traders, waste and pests competing for space in darkness. But they have not given up. “Waste is money,” says Ajani Ojo. Nicknamed the “waste converter” by his colleagues, Ojo is a plantain trader who now makes his cash from setting up low-tech biogas facilities for people. He says he learned all he knows about converting waste to value from MES, the contractor who handled the Ikosi project. Ojo wants the government to resuscitate the project. “When the facility was working, waste scattered all over the market was reduced, especially around the banana section,” he says, pointing to a field near the facility. “Apart from that, we didn’t have to pay the waste collector money to take our waste. We gave it up for free to the facility to generate electricity for our use.” Unfortunately, although some steps are being taken to deal with the waste, there are no signs of plans to reopen the plant. For Ojo, as for many, it is clear that the government should pursue this path more wholeheartedly. He believes that there is a need for better appreciation and commitment to solving two problems using a simple technology. With the realisation of the huge opportunities that renewable energy presents, Nigeria should apply itself to harnessing these opportunities as part of a mosaic solution to its energy crises. Even Ojo, who has seen the problems of converting waste to biogas, is convinced this is the right path for the country. “My eyes have been opened,” he says. “And the government’s eyes should be wider.” This content was produced with the support of the Access to Energy Journalism Fellowship and Discourse Media"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/25/kidnapping-uk-model-italy-may-have-been-a-sham-says-lawyer","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T15:20:43Z","webTitle":"Kidnapping of UK model in Italy may have been a 'sham', says lawyer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/25/kidnapping-uk-model-italy-may-have-been-a-sham-says-lawyer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/25/kidnapping-uk-model-italy-may-have-been-a-sham-says-lawyer","fields":{"headline":"Kidnapping of UK model in Italy may have been a 'sham', says lawyer","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The kidnapping of a British model in Italy may have been faked as a publicity stunt, a lawyer for one of the men suspected of carrying it out has told a court. The claim was made on Monday during extradition proceedings against Michal Herba, who is wanted by Milanese authorities in relation to the allegations. His brother, Lukasz Herba, is in custody in Italy. “There is a real risk that the entire case is a sham,” Michal Herba’s lawyer told Westminster magistrates court on Monday. During the hearing, George Hepburne Scott called into question the reliability of the model, Chloe Ayling. “The same complainant, it seems, generated publicity from the fact she was nearby the scene of a terrorist attack at the Champs Élysées in Paris,” he said. He also referred to claims that her alleged kidnapper in Italy had tried to tip off British newspapers. Furthermore, Herba’s lawyer told the court about claims that the 20-year-old model and her captor went shopping for shoes, calling it a “wholly anomalous feature of a hostage situation”. He said: “It would amount to an abuse of process of the court if there was any evidence to suggest this was a publicity stunt.” Michal Herba is fighting extradition, having been arrested by the National Crime Agency (NCA), which was acting on a European arrest warrant issued by the Italian authorities last month. On Monday, the prosecutor, Florence Iveson, said the 36-year-old had been requested by the court of Milan in relation to a single offence of kidnapping arising from events between 11 and 17 July. “The allegation is that Mr Herba acted in complicity with his brother, Lukasz Herba, and other unidentified persons to kidnap the victim in Milan. It is said she was drugged and kidnapped and a €300,000 ransom was demanded.” His 30-year-old brother, Lukasz, was arrested after taking Ayling to the British consulate in Milan on 17 July – six days after she was allegedly kidnapped. The judge pointed out that much of the material relied on by Scott came from press reports, which he said did not prove any of the theories in the case. He is due to give his ruling on Friday. During Monday’s hearing, Michal Herba – wearing a blue sweater and mauve tracksuit bottoms – limped to the witness box to be questioned over claims he has a heavily pregnant girlfriend in the UK. His lawyers argued any extradition could breach his right to a family life, provided for by article 8 of the European convention on human rights. Herba refused to name the woman, citing his fear that she would be harassed by journalists. Scott also said there was a lack of “particularity” in the allegations against his client, which refer to a “strong body of evidence”, including DNA samples, statements from the victim, and telephone wire taps. He said the prosecution case did not set out whether his client was one of the men alleged to have drugged and kidnapped Ayling, or if he was said to have hired the car and the farmhouse used in the alleged offence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/25/deep-purpls-accountant-banned-as-director","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T17:05:52Z","webTitle":"Deep Purple's ex-accountant banned as director for 'misappropriating £2m'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/25/deep-purpls-accountant-banned-as-director","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/25/deep-purpls-accountant-banned-as-director","fields":{"headline":"Deep Purple's ex-accountant banned as director for 'misappropriating £2m'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Rock group Deep Purple’s former accountant has been banned as a company director for misappropriating at least £2m from two entities controlling their catalogue of hits. Dipak Rao, who worked for the band behind the hit Smoke on the Water between 1992 and 2014, has been disqualified for 11 years following an investigation by the Insolvency Service. It found he siphoned money into his personal accounts from two companies, Deep Purple (Overseas) Ltd and HEC Enterprises Ltd, between 2008 and 2014. The 69-year-old, who lives in Worcester Park, south-west London, concealed what he had done by ensuring that the transactions did not appear in financial accounts and restricted access to the companies’ bank statements, the Insolvency Service said. He resigned in November 2014 as a director of both firms – which control the copyrights of many of the band’s recordings – before they went into administration in January last year. Sue Macleod, the Insolvency Service’s chief investigator, said: “Rao misappropriated company funds, causing detriment to the company and its creditors, to his own personal benefit.” The Times reported in January that lead singer, Ian Gillan, 72, the bassist, Roger Glover, 71, and Ian Paice, 69, the drummer, as well as the estate of Jon Lord, the keyboard player who died in 2012, sued Rao in the high court over his management of their financial affairs. The case, which is believed to be ongoing, is separate to the Insolvency Service investigation. The newspaper said the high court granted a £4m freezing order against the assets of Rao and his wife, Anvita. It said Rao admitted “borrowing” or “lending” at least £2.27m of the companies’ money, and that the Deep Purple companies had recovered about £477,000 so far. Formed in 1968, Deep Purple became one of the world’s biggest rock bands, filling stadiums around the world. The group split in 1976 amid drug addiction and exhaustion, before reforming in 1984. The band become the latest music stars to be caught in a tussle over money. Leonard Cohen sued his former manager Kelley Lynch in 2005, claiming she had stolen $5m (£3.7m) from his personal accounts. The court found in his favour and ordered Lynch to pay him $9.5m. The Rolling Stones sued their former manager, Allen Klein, in a long-running legal dispute that was eventually settled out of court. After releasing their 20th album, InFinite, in April, Deep Purple are on the road with their The Long Goodbye tour. • This article was amended on 26 September 2017.

The decision he made with his uncle and cousins to go to the riverbank. To confront the men mining sand near his village. Not to run when the miners went to their vehicles and returned with guns. “We were telling them to stop taking the sand,” he says, standing by the same river on the outskirts of Jatpura, his village in the east Indian state of Jharkhand. “They said, who are you to stop us? If we want to lift sand, we will. Then they lifted their guns and fired.” His cousin, Niranjan Yadav, died first, he says. Then his uncle, Uday, who threw himself on his son’s body. The miners then turned their guns on Vimlesh, the second son. Postmortem reports show all three were shot at close range in the chest. “They also fired at me,” Yadav says. “To save myself, I jumped back and hid behind one of the trucks, and then in a hole behind a nearby bush.” He stayed in the hole, he says, “shivering in fear” for minutes until other villagers arrived at the river. “It is by sheer luck that I managed to escape death that day.” The three Yadav men shot in May were victims of an unlikely environmental crisis. Virtually every facet of modern construction depends on sand. Heated, it becomes glass. Mixed with gravel, asphalt. Bound with cement, concrete. With Asia in the midst of history’s largest ever building spree, awareness is growing of the extent to which the world’s supplies are dwindling. China used more cement between 2011 and 2013 than the US used in the entire 20th century. In India, by some estimates, the amount of sand used for construction has tripled since 2000. Demand is expected to keep soaring: the country plans to build at least 60m new houses by 2024. “Demand for sand now outstrips that of any other raw material,” says Sumaira Abdulali, the convener of the Awaaz Foundation, an activist group that campaigns against illegal sand extraction. As supplies of sand close to major cities such as Delhi and Mumbai have become exhausted, developers are turning to more remote regions to source it, bringing them into conflict with smaller, usually vulnerable, communities. Groundwater shortages, flooding, and depletion of fish and other animal life often follow in the wake of unsustainable mining, which activists claim can also weaken bridges and barrages along the path of heavily mined rivers, leading some to collapse. No reliable data exists for the amount of sand currently being mined in India, Abdulali says. “But it’s quite clear when you visit the countryside in India, there is hardly a creek, river or beach where you don’t see the effect of sand mining.” Also unknown is the toll of the hundreds of conflicts erupting in small communities across the country between those who hold mining leases and local residents. “But we know the violence is extremely widespread,” Abdulali says. Jatpura is a long way from the burgeoning cities of urban India. Ranchi, the Jharkhand state capital, has just over one million residents – tiny by Indian standards – and is six hours away by car, along patchy highways that degrade and narrow as Jatpura nears. The sand miners arrived at the beginning of the year, using excavators and industrial vacuums that could slurp vast quantities of sand from the riverbed. Watching over them were men the villagers called “lathait” – Hindi for someone skilled at wielding a club. Niranjan Yadav led the opposition to the project. The mining was veering close to a patch on the banks of the river where Hindu villagers traditionally burned their dead. Local people worried they would wake up one morning to find the sacred earth heaped in the back of a truck. The dredging also made the river treacherous. Holes began to appear beneath the surface, sometimes 20ft deep. Villagers said that in April, weeks before the Yadavs confronted the miners, a 12-year-old boy had been playing in the water when he slipped into a crevice and drowned. Resentment grew with each chunk of riverbed that was carted away. “People who are in distant areas, rich people – like a mafia – are becoming richer,” says another Jatpura resident, Sudama Ram. “We feel very helpless. But we have our brothers with us in the village. The whole village is with us. We are fighting.” His remarks were met with approving murmurs among the other Jatpura residents. It was true the village was fighting, but Ram had exaggerated its helplessness. The pressure of runaway resource extraction had not just turned the people of Jatpura into victims. Some believe it made them into killers, too. Satinder Singh was a manager from a nearby village who oversaw the sand mining in Jatpura and other sites. After the Yadav men were shot and the alleged gunmen fled, he remained close to the river “to keep watch”, according to Neha Arora, the deputy commissioner for Garwha. Officers found him beaten to death, and the house he had been renting in Jatpura razed. Police believe that he was attacked by a mob, “but it’s difficult to pinpoint who was involved,” Arora says. “Nobody is talking.” The bodies are gone, but the rest of the scene that confronted police when they arrived at the riverbank that morning is unchanged. The shovel of one of the excavators is still half-buried in the sand, as if its owner fled in a hurry. Several other vehicles are strewn about the site, warped and gutted by fire. Conflict has frequently accompanied mining operations in the Garwha district. “It happens anywhere there is excavation of resources,” Arora says. The mining licence for Jatpura was held by Dharambeer Singh, a small contractor from a nearby district. His lease permitted him to mine sand close to the cremation ground, but not to use heavy machinery. Arora says that he had been advised, like all contractors, to be “sensitive to the issues of the villages”, to clearly demarcate the mine’s boundaries, and to try to employ the villagers as labourers in order to cushion their discontent. “But I would not say that sensitivity is what they keep in mind,” she says. The amount of money at stake and the nature of the business models discourage it. “The [contractors] are target-driven, profit-driven,” Arora says. The shooting in Jatpura triggered protests in Garwha town and was raised in the Jharkhand state assembly. The state has since amended its mining policies. Lifting sand is now permitted only from large rivers, which officials say can be mined more sustainably. The river by Jatpura, classified as medium-sized, is out of bounds. Arora says she is unsure why the use of heavy machinery, among other legal breaches, continued in Jatpura for months without officials being alerted. “We did not know what tension was brewing there,” she says. In other cases, she says, village chiefs – or “mukhias” – have struck deals with the miners to overlook their operations in exchange for a cut of the profits. It is a lesser-known consequence of the vast demand for sand: as well as environmental degradation, soaring sand prices encourage corruption and spark conflicts within villages. The fires that gutted the trucks and excavators on the morning of the killings in May were not the last to be set on the riverbank that day. After midnight, more than 500 men gathered at the cremation ground, metres from where the Yadav men were shot. They watched silently as the three bodies were placed on a wooden pyre. It burned until dawn, until the men’s ashes caught in the wind and settled with the sand in the riverbank.

Piutau, a dynamic full-back who can also play on the wing, will become the world’s most highly paid rugby player when he joins Bristol. Yet his motives are more than mercenary and reflect his arduous childhood as well as the growing problems for Test rugby. “When I was in New Zealand it felt like the All Blacks were everything. It felt like you were going to play forever. You felt invincible. But, taking a step back, you realise it’s such a short career. For me, what really hit home was remembering everything my parents had done for me and my siblings. They left Tonga for New Zealand to give us better opportunities. And for me, coming here, I had the same chance to do something similar for my family.” Piutau is the youngest of 10 children who grew up in the tough Auckland suburb of Mangere. Five girls were born before, in a matching rush, five boys followed. Piutau and his four brothers “lived in the garage”. He says: “We had three beds and a couple of bunk beds. I guess they were hard times but it never felt like that. It speaks volumes for my parents that I never thought ‘I’m still hungry’ or ‘I need clothes.’ But you look back at 12 people needing to be fed and you think: ‘How did they do it?’ I just take the positives – the love they showed and the discipline they taught us.” On an unusually sunny day in Belfast, at the gleaming Ulster fortress of the Kingspan Stadium, Piutau is in an expansive mood after signing a contract to join Bristol next season. It is a two-year deal, earning Piutau £1m a season, which has been described as “sensational” and one to send “shockwaves” through world rugby because the 25-year-old should be at the peak of his Test career. Bristol play in the Championship against teams such as Hartpury College and Rotherham Titans. It’s a long way from Test rugby and Piutau will join Bristol even in the unlikely event they are not promoted. But they are bankrolled by their billionaire owner Stephen Lansdown and Bristol will probably swagger into the Premiership and unleash Piutau – the Pro12 Players’ Player of the Year for his thunderous exploits in an Ulster shirt last season. His huge deal with Bristol could represent a lasting sea-change – with players choosing lucrative club contracts over a Test career – as it has been accompanied by troubling introspection for international rugby. Australia and Argentina are frail imitations of their usual Test-match selves – with the Wallabies struggling to draw a crowd of 14,000 for their most recent home match and the Pumas losing 13 of their past 15 Tests. South Africa, who are New Zealand’s greatest rivals, were humiliated 57-0 by the All Blacks this month. The gap between New Zealand and the rest appears significant – even if England, while winning 19 of their past 20 Tests, have not faced the world champions for three years. Piutau made his All Black debut in June 2013, against France, and won his 17th and last cap against a combative Springbok side in July 2015. Those memories light up his face and suggest that, despite his obvious happiness playing for Ulster, he still misses Test rugby. “I only played the last 10 minutes against France but I was so happy. You dream about that moment for so long – and so it felt surreal. At the same time it felt right and amazing. And then my last Test at Ellis Park was very tough. So I have great memories and I was lucky enough to have a perfect record. Played 17, won 17.” Surely Piutau still feels a little ache when thinking of the All Blacks? “It was more like that when you first come over and you’re looking back: ‘Oh man, how nice it was playing in that jersey.’ You miss it. But I’ve become an All Black fan now. I just cheer them on. You see guys you played alongside that are still doing well in the jersey and you’re happy for them.” Did he follow the compelling series between New Zealand and the British &amp; Irish Lions? “I was in Auckland for the first Test,” he says enthusiastically. “I saw the other two games on TV but it meant so much to see that first Test at Eden Park because I played there for the Blues. It was awesome.” In swapping a black Test jersey for Ulster’s white shirt, Piutau endured the disappointment of exclusion from New Zealand’s 2015 World Cup squad. He could have kept his decision a secret but he announced in March 2015 that he would be joining Ulster 16 months later. The All Blacks head coach, Steve Hansen, was reputedly angry and the New Zealand Rugby Union was intransigent. “That was the hardest point in my career so far,” Piutau says. “It was another dream to play in a World Cup – and falling short was tough. But the Ulster offer came out of the blue. I was counting on my agent agreeing a contract with New Zealand and he had to tell me about Ulster the night before we were meant to finalise things. I was like: ‘You’ve got to give me two weeks to think about this.’ I wasn’t thinking of coming overseas.” Once he was axed from Hansen’s squad the NZRU refused to endorse an extension of Piutau’s contract with the Blues. He faced seven months outside of rugby and was relieved to be offered a short-term deal in England. He did well at Wasps, alongside his brother Siale, with whom he will be reunited at Bristol, and made the Premiership team of the 2015-16 season. “London is a big, busy city,” Piutau says, “but I prefer Belfast. During my first few weeks in London I’d be walking around smiling at people and they look at you like you’re weird. But in Belfast you’ve got people stopping and chatting to you, laughing and joking around. It took a while to get the accent but now, when my family come over, I’m almost translating.” Piutau laughs before underlining his rapturous reception at Ulster. “The club have really welcomed me. I remember my first game against Dragons – running out and hearing the crowd singing the Ulster song and the band playing and everyone cheering me. Even the quietness before kicks stood out. In the southern hemisphere you get abused. So it’s been very special.” Does the southern hemisphere’s disparaging attitude towards rugby in the north continue? “Definitely. I was the same. I was oblivious to northern hemisphere rugby. There are lots of closed mindsets towards rugby here. But Ulster has been an eye-opener. I thought they’d kick a lot but the style is changing and sides are running more. The quality is pretty much the equal of the southern hemisphere.” Ulster lead Conference B in the expanded Pro14 competition, which now includes two South African teams, and have won all four opening matches. That upbeat start matches a vibrant Belfast – which has changed so much since the darkness of the Troubles. “I knew nothing at all,” Piutau says when asked if he had a rudimentary knowledge of the sectarian conflict. “Once I signed everyone would tell me their version of what happened and I was like: ‘Are you sure?’ It wasn’t until I got here that I looked into things. I’ve found it very interesting and it’s awesome how far they’ve come. Seeing different communities supporting us at this stadium is very special. It’s not like soccer where you still keep the two communities a little separate. This is the beauty of rugby uniting people.” As Piutau is such a warm and gregarious man he must have found it hard to tell his team-mates he was leaving them for Bristol? “That’s always the hardest – saying goodbye to team‑mates, friends, coaches, management and the fans. But everyone has been understanding and it helped I could speak to the team first. I said: ‘This has been a very hard decision but I hope you all know I’ll give 100% this season. We’ve still got so much to do together.’ I was nervous at the start but I spoke from my heart. We have a lot of potential and I really want to make it a special farewell season.” Piutau has also been enticed to Bristol by the presence his brother, and of their new coach Pat Lam and his friend and another former All Black, Steven Luatua. “Pat gave me my first Super Rugby opportunity. I only had two weeks with him at Auckland before he came to Connacht. But you could see his character and before he left he advised me to keep working hard and staying hungry to learn. It’s incredible we’ll work together again and I’ll be there with my brother and Steven – who I’ve played with since we were kids. Those familiar faces were a big pull.” Piutau will become rugby’s first million-pound man but he seems too grounded and bright to be blinded by that tag. “I’m still a Pacific Island kid who remembers our upbringing – and I hope to inspire other Pacific Island kids that you can do whatever you want to do. I’ve taken a place on the board of the Pacific Rugby Players’ Welfare (PRPW) association because we come from a very small community which is big on family and village support. Lots of guys end up in Europe and find it difficult to transition. We support them.” Michael Jones, the great All Black, once told me how he struggled to conquer the innate reserve embedded into his Polynesian upbringing. How did Piutau overcome his own diffidence away from the heat of battle? “It took a while but funnily enough I led a hip-hop dance group in high school. That really helped as I was leading 60 guys and I was also head prefect at school. So I got used to speaking in front of people.” Is he still breakdancing to old school hip-hop? Piutau laughs. “I’m not sure my body’s up to that. But in terms of music now I could go from country to opera. I grew up listening to music my siblings played and opera just grew on me. There are young Pacific Islanders into opera now and we’ve got a three-man opera group called Sole Mio. I’ve seen them live and they’re great.” Away from Test rugby, Piutau can open himself to new experiences whether it’s living in the Titanic Quarter in Belfast or listening to opera. He remains committed to Ulster this season and Bristol next year and the future of international rugby is in the hands of others. Piutau can concentrate on his own career and those who mean most to him. “I speak to my dad about his early struggles when he moved to Auckland. He’d be working three different jobs – labouring and taxi driving. It was really hard for my parents but we’ve come a long way and one of the best feelings is knowing that my family are happy and secure. They’re proud of what I’m doing and where I am.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/26/terry-wogan-voted-greatest-bbc-radio-presenter","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T23:01:26Z","webTitle":"Terry Wogan voted greatest BBC radio presenter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/26/terry-wogan-voted-greatest-bbc-radio-presenter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/26/terry-wogan-voted-greatest-bbc-radio-presenter","fields":{"headline":"Terry Wogan voted greatest BBC radio presenter","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Sir Terry Wogan has been voted the greatest BBC radio presenter, in a survey of leading figures in broadcasting to mark the 50th anniversary of Radios 1, 2, 3 and 4. Wogan topped the poll ahead of John Peel, Sue MacGregor, Annie Nightingale and Alistair Cooke. Chris Evans, who was paid at least £2.2m last year by the BBC and is its highest paid on-air star, according to its official pay list, ranked 26th. Wogan joined the BBC in 1966 and went on to present the Radio 2 breakfast show for 28 years across two stints. Wake Up to Wogan attracted more than 8 million listeners and at its peak was the most popular radio programme in Europe. Wogan, who was knighted in 2005, died last year. The Radio Times polled 39 men and 39 women working in broadcasting, including the Today presenter John Humphrys, the author Philip Pullman and the BBC’s former director of radio Helen Boaden, asking them each to name their top 15 broadcasters on BBC radio. Second-placed Peel was renowned for promoting new artists on Radio 1 and also presented Home Truths on Radio 4. MacGregor, who ranked third, has presented Woman’s Hour and the Today programme, and still fronts The Reunion on Radio 4. Nightingale was Radio 1’s first female presenter when she joined the service in the late 1960s. Now 77, she still has a show on Radio 1 and is its longest-serving DJ. Fifth-placed Cooke wrote and presented Letter from America from 1946 to 2004. The BBC is hosting a series of events to mark the 50th anniversary of its radio services, including a “live lounge month” on Radio 1 and a pop-up digital station, Radio 1 Vintage, launching at 6am Friday. Tony Blackburn, who spoke the first words on Radio 1 in 1967, will present a programme on Vintage alongside the current Radio 1 breakfast show host, Nick Grimshaw, and there will be 50 one-hour shows, including archive material from the likes of Peel and Zoë Ball. Also among the top 10 presenters in the Radio Times poll were Kenny Everett, one of Radio 1’s original DJs and twice fired by the BBC; Jane Garvey, the Woman’s Hour presenter who has led the criticism of the gender pay gap at the BBC; the jazz presenter Humphrey Lyttelton; Radio 4’s PM host Eddie Mair; and Garvey’s co-presenter on Woman’s Hour, Jenni Murray.

It’s more than two decades since a stranger arrived in the north of London Town, pulled up his wagon outside Highbury Stadium, and started to shift bottles of Dr Arsène’s Amazing Restorative Hydrogen-and-Oxygen-Flavored Polar Inorganic Compound™ from the back. As he launched into his sales spiel – “It’s the taste!” – suggestible members of the local soccer team gathered round to sample the miracle elixir. “Coo!” they thought as they began to feel some strength return to their legs, their temples started throbbing a little less alarmingly, and that strange dull stabbing sensation in their side went away. As they cheerfully emptied their pockets to purchase as many bottles of the magical liniment as they could afford, Dr Arsène gathered up the falling coins and quietly asked his assistant to dig out his old rainmaking kit, and maybe mark up that old crate of broccoli by 400% while he was at it. But familiarity breeds contempt. And it seems the soccer stars of today no longer listen to Dr Arsène quite as intently as players once did. Now, instead of aiding recovery by simply washing down a large plate of steamed greens with a delicious pitcher of room-temperature Compound™, then putting their feet up for a nice snooze, players are experimenting with cryotherapy, a modern technique which involves freezing muscles in the hope of de-jiggering them at double-quick speed. “Is it smoke and mirrors?” asks a clearly irritated Dr Arsène. “Yes!” An unambiguous blast of righteous ire, and he’s not just worried because, as players seek revitalisation elsewhere, sales of his once-trendy Compound Beverage™ and Green Snack® meal deal have fallen back to the record lows of the Merso-Adamian era. “If you read the science, some have proved [cryotherapy] works and some have proved it doesn’t,” sniffed the good doctor, as he moodily implemented a two-for-one discount across his entire agricultural-produce range. “At the end of the day, we have improved a lot the medical treatment. But if you have a muscle problem, it takes 21 days. It took 21 days 30 years ago. We have to respect nature.” At which point Dr Arsène stumbled over a sack of kale he can’t get shot of, then stubbed his toe into one of the many unopened boxes lying around. Effing Compound™!

Nearly 50 years ago, John Wooden, the legendary UCLA basketball coach, winner of 10 national championships, kept his teams in the locker room during the anthem to support his players’ stands against racial intolerance. Wooden, who died in 2010 at the age of 99, was beloved in the sports world – heralded as a brilliant teacher. His pyramid of success, built on the concepts of faith and patience, used concepts like poise, self-control, friendship, loyalty and cooperation to build greatness. His methods are still taught in corporate America. No one would accuse the genius Wooden of showing disrespect to the flag as President Donald Trump has done to NFL players who also refused to stand for the national anthem. But long before Colin Kaepernick, Wooden’s UCLA Bruins had a player who would not stand for the anthem. His name was Lew Alcindor, later known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Then college basketball’s best player and later a six-time NBA Most Valuable Player, he converted to Islam before his senior season and began sitting during the anthem much like Kaepernick has done to protest the treatment of African Americans in the US. Mindful of Abdul-Jabbar’s stand, Wooden stopped bringing the Bruins on the court for the anthem. It’s something he continued for years after Abdul-Jabbar left for the NBA. “We were aware of (the anthem author) Francis Scott Key being racist,” Marques Johnson, a UCLA star in the mid-1970s told the Guardian last year in describing Wooden’s decision to keep them off the court. “We knew about the missing third stanza that criticizes the slaves who joined the British Army so they could be free. I think we were aware of all that.” If the great Wooden could continue winning national titles while holding his players away from the anthem what’s to keep NFL teams from not doing the same? On Sunday, two days after Trump said in an address: ‘Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now,” Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll responded with a statement of his own. “We stand for love and justice and civility,” Carroll said. “We stand for our players and their constitutional rights, just as we stand for equality for all people.” When neither the Seahawks nor the Titans came onto the field for their game – eventually won by Tennessee – it made for a surreal sight. The stands were filled, a color guard stood at the 30-yard line but the sidelines, normally loaded with players and coaches, were empty. In some ways, it was a more effective protest than those conducted by other teams whose players linked arms with coaches, and in some cases, the club owners. Will other teams do what so many colleges did when Wooden kept UCLA in the locker room and follow Pittsburgh, Seattle and Tennessee in remaining in the locker room? Given the fact this weekend’s protests were the strongest yet since Kaepernick began sitting or kneeling last year, it seems likely Sunday’s stances might be the new normal in the NFL for some time. According to the Seattle Times, the Seahawks chose to stay inside during the anthem to do something as a team after considering kneeling as a group and holding a flag at half-mast. When asked Sunday, if the Seahawks will continue their protest next week, star cornerback Richard Sherman replied: “With the president, what’s next? Your guess is as good as mine.” But if they choose to stay off the field again renumber they are doing nothing different from the man considered to be college basketball’s best coach ever. It’s hard to imagine anyone calling John Wooden a “son of a bitch.” Fantasy player of the week Case Keenum. Once Teddy Bridgewater was supposed to be the future of the Minnesota Vikings. Then his gruesome injury before last season gave the opportunity to Sam Bradford who seemed he might be the quarterback to take Minnesota through the next several years. But has Case Keenum seized that role? With a knee injury keeping Bradford out for a second-straight week, Keenum tore apart Tampa Bay in a 34-17 victory completing 75 percent of his passes, throwing for 369 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions. His passer rating was 142.1, which is very close to perfect. Of course, Keenum has played some of his best games against Tampa Bay and the Bucs defense was thinned by injuries, still 369 yards is 369 yards – especially from a journeyman quarterback who has been nobody’s idea of a team’s big future. Stat of the week 28. This is the number of passing yards Baltimore quarterback Joe Flacco had in the Ravens 44-7 loss to Jacksonville. On Sunday, in London, Flacco had one of the worst games of his career completing just eight of 18 passes. He was intercepted twice and was pulled in the second half with a passer rating of just 12. Yes, 12. Flacco, who missed much of training camp with a back injury, has not been sharp this season despite the Ravens’ 2-0 record coming into Sunday. Of course, the Ravens failure to sign Kaepernick as a backup was a significant conversation topic in August. While Kaepernick might really help Baltimore, the Ravens current backup, Ryan Mallett, played well when replacing Flacco on Sunday throwing a touchdown pass and completing 2/3 of his attempts. Quote of the week “Tough man, it’s a tough way to lose.” – Golden Tate After believing he had scored a game-winning touchdown, Detroit receiver Golden Tate was left to absorb the bitter truth that an Atlanta Falcons defender had actually touched him as he fell to the ground less than a foot from the end zone with :08 left. It was a devastating end to an excellent game for the Lions who were on the verge of going 3-0. Instead, last year’s NFC champion Falcons are the ones who remain undefeated. Atlanta quarterback Matt Ryan was not particularly sharp with three interceptions, including one that went for a Detroit touchdown. But the Falcons got a huge break when replays showed Tate had not scored and because a new league rule says that if replays showed the play should not have stopped the clock officials are required to run 10 seconds off the clock, in this case, ending the game. A bitter loss for Detroit indeed. Gif of the week What fun it must be for a player to go into New England, seize on a Patriots mistake, score a touchdown and then mock Pats star Rob Gronkowski? Houston defensive end Jadeveon Clowney found a rare Tom Brady fumble flying his way in the second quarter of the Texans-Patriots game on Sunday. He caught the ball, sprinted to his left and raced into the touchdown for his first career touchdown. Thrilled to be in an end zone with the ball in his hands, especially in a game as essential as Sunday’s he couldn’t help himself and slammed the ball onto the ground in his best imitation of a Gronkowski ball spike. Unfortunately for Houston, the Patriots got the last laugh (or spike) as Tom Brady threw the last of his five touchdown passes with 23 seconds left to give New England a come-from-behind 36-33 victory and quiet what would have been a certain chorus of “What’s wrong with the Patriots?” questions next week. Elsewhere around the league • Denver’s Trevor Siemian thudded back to earth after a huge game against Dallas last weekend. He was intercepted twice in the Broncos 26-16 loss at Buffalo. • The Jets proved woeful at tanking with their 20-6 victory over Miami. Dolphins quarterback Jay Cutler was intercepted once and sacked three times in his second game out of retirement. • The Browns have picked up this year right where last season left off. They are already 0-3 after a 31-28 loss at Indianapolis. Cleveland rookie quarterback DeShone Kizer continued to show promise with two passing and one rushing touchdown but he also was intercepted three times. • Seattle continues to struggle. This time their sputtering offense put up 433 yards but the Seahawks’ still-vaunted defense gave up 21 straight points in the third quarter in a 33-27 loss to Tennessee. • Washington’s defense sacked Oakland quarterback Derek Carr four times and intercepted him twice in a 27-10 beating of an AFC favorite. Washington’s Kirk Cousins threw for 369 yards and three touchdowns."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/26/bali-volcano-eruption-seismic-activity-mount-agung","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T11:04:14Z","webTitle":"Bali volcano eruption could be hours away after unprecedented seismic activity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/26/bali-volcano-eruption-seismic-activity-mount-agung","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/26/bali-volcano-eruption-seismic-activity-mount-agung","fields":{"headline":"Bali volcano eruption could be hours away after unprecedented seismic activity","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Mount Agung in Bali is experiencing unprecedented levels of seismic activity and could erupt in a “matter of hours” if tremors continue, Indonesia’s volcanology centre has said. More than 75,000 people have been evacuated in the last few days as Agung, the highest point of the island, has experienced hundreds of internal volcanic earthquakes. “Instrumentally we have never recorded such high energy or seismicity from Mount Agung,” Devy Kamil Syahbana, a seismologist from Indonesia’s centre for volcanology and geological hazard mitigation, told the Guardian. Data showed that Mount Agung experienced 844 volcanic earthquakes on Monday, and 300 to 400 earthquakes by midday on Tuesday, he said. “We need to pay attention because these kinds of earthquakes indicate the movement of magma and increase the probability of an eruption.” Evacuated people have sought shelter in hundreds of village halls and sports centres and in the homes of relatives in more than nine districts. President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuees at several camps on Tuesday. Authorities have urged people to stay out the danger zone, a designated five- to seven-mile radius of the volcano. The increasing frequency of deep and shallow volcanic earthquakes, as well as local tectonic tremors, is an indication that magma continues to move toward the surface. The alert status of Agung was raised to the highest level on Friday evening following a significant spike in seismic activity. Kasbani, the head of the volcanology centre, told local media that if tremors continued, an eruption – the first in more than half a century – could be a “matter of hours” away. The volcanology agency is also drawing data from GPS and satellite imagery, including a thermal camera. Readings from these measurements are in line with the increase in volcanic tremors. Syahbana said it was impossible to say that Agung would definitely erupt, only that the data showed there was an increasing probability that it would. “There is no volcanologist in the world who could predict precisely when a volcano will erupt,” he said. “Volcanoes are a stochastic system, many complexities are unknown by the human brain and technology.” Mount Agung last erupted in 1963, when more than 1,000 people were killed. That event was preceded by an increased frequency in earthquakes. One of the difficulties in predicting the likelihood and timing of an eruption on Agung is that monitoring of the volcano began only after the 1963 eruption. Other volcanoes in Indonesia that have erupted more recently offer a greater wealth of data for seismologists to compare and assess. “But for Agung we have no instrumental documentation,” said Syahbana. “The only records that we have is of the phenomena that were observed and reported by people around the volcano prior to the 1963 eruption.” Bali’s Ngurah Rai international airport, which is about 47 miles from the volcano, remains open, with flights running as normal on Tuesday. In the event of an eruption and ash clouds that could disrupt air travel, authorities have made preparations for flights to be diverted to seven regional airports, including on Java and Lombok islands. The UK, Australia and the US are among several countries that have issued travel advisories in recent days, warning that volcanic activity on Agung could interfere with travel plans. Mount Agung is one of many active volcanoes in the ring of fire, a string of volcanoes and seismic activity that runs through the Indonesian archipelago and the edges of the Pacific Ocean. James Wilson, 28 from Bristol, is staying near Mount Agung with his fiancé and they have plans to climb the nearby Mount Batur on Wednesday morning. He said: “It’s always been our plan to come to Bali and go up Mount Batur so we’re quite keen to continue if we can.” Wilson, who is staying in the Volcano Terrace Bali hotel around 10km from Agung, said there are mixed feelings in the local community. He said: “Some people are quite relaxed and others are quite worried because of the evacuations. “We did see smoke this morning above Agung though, and our hotel shook a bit earlier in what I assume was a tremor. “I’m not sure why we haven’t been evacuated. In some respects it might be foolhardy to stay and in another we want to get on with our holiday as much as we can.” Additional reporting by Rachel Obordo"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/27/schools-are-a-microcosm-of-society-the-quest-to-close-australias-education-gap","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T00:59:28Z","webTitle":"‘Schools are a microcosm of society’: the quest to close Australia’s education gap","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/27/schools-are-a-microcosm-of-society-the-quest-to-close-australias-education-gap","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/27/schools-are-a-microcosm-of-society-the-quest-to-close-australias-education-gap","fields":{"headline":"‘Schools are a microcosm of society’: the quest to close Australia’s education gap","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"At Keilor Views primary school in Melbourne’s western suburbs, teachers are always talking about “hitting the zone”. “The zone of proximal development,” Helen Butler, the school’s assistant principal explains. “It’s the difference between what a student can and can’t do … the aim of every lesson is to hit the ZPD, to make sure every student is challenged. “If it’s not working, we’re asking, ‘How do we go about hitting the zone for this kid?’” By most measures, Keilor is a typical Australian public school. The socioeconomic background of its students is roughly standard, Naplan results are about the average and there is a growing cohort of students from a multicultural background. But about 18 months ago Keilor began using the Evidence for Learning toolkit, a global database of education research that schools can use to introduce new teaching programs into the classroom. The difference between it and the multitude of other education fads? The material is evidence-based and has plenty of research behind it. These days, in classrooms and staff meetings, Kielor’s teachers and students are speaking and acting like education researchers. “We started from the premise of simply looking at what works in the classroom,” Butler says. “For our teachers it’s about developing the capacity to identify the most effective research, employing it, and then evaluating it to make sure it has been working.” The Evidence for Learning toolkit was introduced in Australia by the not-for-profit Social Ventures Australia (SVA), but was developed by the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) in the UK. The foundation was set up in 2011 with a £125m grant from the British government and a brief to establish a research base to help schools make better-informed choices as new needs-based funding was rolled out. It’s an issue Australia is now grappling with. After the federal government secured the passage of the Gonski 2.0 funding arrangement in June, the education minister, Simon Birmingham, established a review panel to look at how the extra money should be spent. Its terms of reference ruled out revisiting funding calculations and instead focused on how to improve student outcomes and Australia’s national performance, as measured by national and international assessments of student achievement. The panel, headed by David Gonski, is due to report its recommendations to the government next year. In the meantime, Sir Kevan Collins, the head of the EEF and the UK government’s newly appointed education “evidence champion”, is in the country on behalf of SVA to meet policymakers to push for the establishment of a similar foundation in Australia. He has already met Birmingham, who said Collins and the SVA had made “valuable contributions to the education systems in the UK and Australia and I had an engaging discussion with them”. Since 2011 Collins, through the EEF, has helped commission hundreds of research projects with the aim of breaking the link between social disadvantage and education achievement. “One of the features we see in many education systems including Australia is that outcomes for students from lower incomes are nowhere near what they are for other families,” he told the Guardian Australia. “We’re always trying to work out how to improve outcomes for everyone, but at the same time we need to focus on how do you narrow that gap.” In Australia, that gap is only growing. In December the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development released its latest Program for International Student Assessment report, which found the performance of Australian students in science, maths and reading had declined over the past decade. It also found significant gaps between states and territories, particularly Tasmania and the Northern Territory, which were both below the OECD average. Collins believes the best way to bridge that gap is with evidence-based research. “The key thing is that in the last 20 years or so there’s been a pattern where people have been telling teachers what to do – sometimes they’re people who know what they’re talking about, and sometimes they’re people with just another opinion,” he said. “But what teachers need are insights and information that give them the chance to make better decisions.” He’s not the only one to make that suggestion. In December the Productivity Commission released a report titled the National Education Evidence Base, which called for an institution to develop research priorities and commission research in Australia. It recommended the institution be run by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority, and suggested the states have “veto power in the selection of research projects”. But not everyone in the sector believes research alone will help. Stewart Riddle, a senior lecturer in the school of teacher education and early childhood at the University of Southern Queensland, believes the impact of evidence-based learning on inequality is limited by factors outside of the school gate. “Schools kind of work as a little microcosm of society, and you can tell a lot about a society from its schools,” he said. “But the current policy focus ignores that to a large degree because … there is a policy desire to just make teaching better. “Meaning, we just need to improve the evidence of the effectiveness of teaching methods, or the curriculum just needs to be better manifested, and if we do that it will solve everything. “The assumption that underlies all of this is we have a problem with teachers and schools [but] none of it addresses the material, social, economical, political and cultural inequalities that preexist when a student walks into a classroom.” He points to the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority’s 2015 technical report on Naplan results, which found that almost 80% of the variant in scores was attributable to socioeconomic status. “It’s almost a perfect fit,” he said. But if results in education aren’t really about what happens in the classroom, what impact can policymakers have? “You could start by acknowledging that advantage breeds advantage and that the reason some schools do well has nothing to do with having better teachers or better instruction,” Riddle says. “We’re focused on the wrong thing. “I’m not against having good teachers or resources – but it’s not the real problem. Teaching is like every profession, there’s good ones and there’s bad ones.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/26/steve-bannon-praise-honor-trump-rival-alabama-candidate","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T03:39:30Z","webTitle":"Steve Bannon offers 'praise and honor' to Trump – while backing rival Alabama candidate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/26/steve-bannon-praise-honor-trump-rival-alabama-candidate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/26/steve-bannon-praise-honor-trump-rival-alabama-candidate","fields":{"headline":"Steve Bannon offers 'praise and honor' to Trump – while backing rival Alabama candidate","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Steve Bannon made his debut as a political surrogate on Monday in a fiery speech in opposition to a Republican candidate endorsed by his former boss Donald Trump. But at a rally on behalf of Senate candidate Roy Moore in Alabama, the former White House adviser insisted, in a deliberate echo of Mark Antony’s funeral oration for Julius Caesar: “We did not come here to defy Donald Trump – we came here to praise and honor him.” The specter hanging over the event was the fact that Trump himself has endorsed Moore’s opponent, appointed incumbent Luther Strange. Speakers at the rally depicted Trump as someone who had been led astray and insisted that a vote for Moore was the right decision for supporters of the president. Bannon – who repeatedly denounced Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell while laying out his economic nationalist vision – even ended his remarks by proclaiming: “A vote for Judge Roy Moore is a vote for Donald J Trump and a vote for Donald J Trump is a vote to Make America Great Again.” The rally, held in a barn about 30 minutes outside Mobile, Alabama, also included Bannon ally Nigel Farage as well as former reality star Phil Robertson in an event that seemed to demonstrate the two critical strands of the Trump base: social conservatives and those who embrace the Breitbart strain of populism. While Farage and Bannon denounced elites, big business and media, Moore and Robertson were far more prone to quote the Bible. Farage denounced “career politicians, big banks and multinational corporations” and compared what he saw as Washington Republicans’ betrayal of the Trump agenda to the UK Conservatives’ attempts to “delay” and “water down” Brexit. He also made a slightly incongruous plea to Alabamians to “fill their motorcars” before they go to vote on Tuesday. Meanwhile Moore recited passages from the Book of Hosea from memory and Robertson even brought a copy of the Bible on stage. However, those differences were papered over by their shared disdain for McConnell and the Washington establishment. As former Mississippi US Senate candidate Chris McDaniel told reporters before the event when asked if he was invited by Moore or Bannon: “Aren’t they one and the same?” Moore, who painted the race as a stand “against the Washington establishment”, insisted he would support Trump on conservative priorities, asking rhetorically: “How hard is it to repeal Obamacare?” He also rebutted attack ads suggesting he was “soft” on the second amendment by brandishing a revolver on stage. Margaret McMinn of Gulf Shore, Alabama, showed up with a sign that said: “Thank You Lord Jesus for Senator Roy Moore.” McMinn – a loyal Trump supporter who made a similar sign for his 2015 rally in Mobile – told the Guardian that God had told her then that Trump would be president and she was unconcerned now about his endorsement of Strange. “He was given bad information,” she said. Much of the energy from the crowd came when speakers attacked those they believed had misled Trump. Bannon received energetic applause when he taunted the attendees with what he claimed McConnell and the Washington Republican establishment thought of them: “They think you’re a pack of morons, they think you’re nothing but rubes.” The former White House aide went on to slam several Republican consultants in Washington by name as he assailed “economic hate crimes done on the working class of this country”. Bannon did strike one dissonant note, insisting his message of economic nationalism would unite Americans regardless of race, religion or sexual preference. Moore has suggested that homosexuality be subject to criminal punishment and was removed from office as Alabama’s chief justice in 2016 for attempting to defy the supreme court’s ruling on same-sex marriage. Bannon appeared to distance himself from some of Moore’s more controversial remarks, noting: “Judge Moore is not perfect. Judge Moore does not claim to be perfect.” The rally came as vice-president Mike Pence was appearing on Strange’s behalf in Birmingham, three days after Trump held a rally for the candidate. Trump issued a tweet as the rally ended, saying: “Big election tomorrow in the Great State of Alabama. Vote for Senator Luther Strange, tough on crime &amp; border – will never let you down!” However, with polls showing Moore likely to win on Tuesday, the election is poised to present a major crisis for Republicans in Washington. Both Moore and Bannon have tried to turn the election into a referendum on McConnell. Bannon accused Strange of being owned by the Senate majority leader “lock, stock and barrel”, and Moore received his biggest applause of the night by declaring: “Mitch McConnell needs to be replaced.” With Bannon allies already salivating over the prospect of primary challenges in 2018 against a number of incumbent Republican senators who are viewed as insufficiently conservative, this race will serve as a test of whether ties to McConnell can be used as a negative in a Republican primary. If so, Bannon is likely to be hitting the stump against McConnell a lot more in the coming year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/26/vietnams-state-largest-crackdown-on-dissidents-years","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T03:35:26Z","webTitle":"Vietnam's harsh summer: state launches largest crackdown on dissidents in years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/26/vietnams-state-largest-crackdown-on-dissidents-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/26/vietnams-state-largest-crackdown-on-dissidents-years","fields":{"headline":"Vietnam's harsh summer: state launches largest crackdown on dissidents in years","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ho Thi Chau, 25, was left alone and blacklisted after her husband was returned to jail for “attempting to overthrow the [Vietnamese] government” last week. An activist from the north central province of Nghe An, Nguyen Van Oai was arrested on 18 September on charges of violating the conditions of his 2015 release from prison. Oai, an anti-government dissident, is a citizen journalist and co-founder of the Association of Catholic Former Prisoners of Conscience. Following his conviction, he will serve a five-year prison sentence plus four years of house arrest. Chau, a former garment factory worker, does not know how to support their newborn daughter. As she is the wife of a man branded a “reactionary” by Vietnam’s single party communist state, employers are reluctant to hire her. “When we were preparing for our wedding I was sacked because of our engagement and they didn’t hire me any more,” she said. Vietnam’s summer has been particularly harsh for dissidents, with at least 11 having been arrested, charged or convicted, while another was stripped of his citizenship and deported to France. Human Rights Watch has described it as an “all-out effort” to clamp down on criticism, while Amnesty International has expressed fears that imprisoned dissidents are being tortured. The US embassy and EU delegation in Hanoi have repeatedly expressed their alarm. ‘I have my way of living in a difficult situation’ Those who remain out of prison ponder if they will be the next detained. Mai Khoi, a former pop star who was banished from the Vietnamese music industry when she began expressing pro-democracy views in 2016, was surprised on 22 July when dozens of police arrived at her private show in Hanoi’s Tay Ho district. The authorities had a complaint: the studio hosting Khoi did not have a permit for the show and it must be stopped. While no one was arrested, Khoi, whose band Mai Khoi and the Dissidents have lyrics peppered with criticisms of the government, was evicted the next day by her landlord, who told her he was breaking the lease due to police pressure. Since the raid Khoi has been forced to stop playing her shows, which fuse traditional Vietnamese music with American-style blues. She is now living in a secret location in Hanoi in a flat leased under a friend’s name as she tries to work out her next move. “It doesn’t really scare me, because I have my way of living in a difficult situation,” said Khoi. “Ai Weiwei was in jail and he’s still doing his thing,” she added, referring to the Chinese visual artist turned dissident who spent 81 days in jail in 2011 for alleged economic crimes. While Khoi remains free, members of the Brotherhood for Democracy, a loose association of anti-government activists that exists primarily in cyberspace, have born the brunt of the crackdown. Nguyen Thi Kim Thanh said she was with her husband, Truong Minh Duc, when he was abruptly snatched off the street the morning of 30 July. He is accused of being a member of the Brotherhood, though his wife said she has no knowledge of his participation. While driving to a pharmacy to buy heart medication, Duc, vice-president of the unregistered Free Viet Labour Federation – which advocates for workers’ rights in the absence of independent unions in Vietnam – was pulled over along with Thanh. He was thrown into a car and transported to Hanoi, where he is being detained on charges of attempting to overthrow the government. Thanh denies her husband is guilty, adding he merely criticised government policy. “He was just helping workers who were experiencing unjust behaviour,” she said, adding she worried that Duc, who has a history of heart attacks, won’t survive his incarceration. Three other activists who were arrested separately across the country on the same day also received the same charge along with human rights lawyer and Brotherhood for Democracy founder Nguyen Van Dai, who has been in prison since 2015 awaiting trial, and his colleague Le Thu Ha. If found guilty they could face the death penalty. “We prepare inside our minds for arrest, and talk to our family members, and I ask for advice from former prisoners of conscience about the life inside the prison,” said Nguyen Tuong Thuy, the 65-year-old vice-chairman of the Independent Journalist Association and a Brotherhood member. Nguyen Thuy Hanh, a 54-year-old member who works as a public relations manger for an Indian company, said most of the group’s key functionaries were arrested in July. “It’s the biggest challenge we’ve had since the birth of the Brotherhood for Democracy in 2013 until now,” she said. While the Brotherhood for Democracy has no formal membership roll, it boasts almost 37,000 followers on Facebook. Causes represented by its members range from environmental activism to anti-China nationalism. But while the Brotherhood has been hit the hardest by the crackdown, targets have included activists from across the spectrum of Vietnamese dissidence. Some, such as Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, the activist also known as Mother Mushroom who was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment in June, were prominent bloggers, while others, including Oai, were members of the Viet Tan, a banned self-described political party based in California. Khoi, who avoids formal associations and public concerts, said the police will have a hard time building a legal case against her. She added, however, that it would not take much for her to be imprisoned. “If I want to be in jail for two days or three days, I’d just go into the street and sing my songs,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/26/push-to-dispel-myths-about-long-lasting-contraception","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T01:21:34Z","webTitle":"Push to dispel myths about long-lasting contraception","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/26/push-to-dispel-myths-about-long-lasting-contraception","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/26/push-to-dispel-myths-about-long-lasting-contraception","fields":{"headline":"Push to dispel myths about long-lasting contraception","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Misplaced concerns and myths about long-acting reversible contraceptives have prompted medical experts to release Australia’s first consensus statement, saying they are more reliable and effective than condoms or the pill. Despite their safety, efficacy and widespread use internationally, the uptake of long-acting reversible contraceptives (Larcs) is low in Australia. On Tuesday the Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association released a consensus statement on the use of Larcs in an attempt to educate women and their doctors about the devices available. The medical director of Family Planning New South Wales, Deborah Bateson, said Larcs such as the progestogen-only implant and hormonal and copper intrauterine devices were more reliable and effective than condoms or the pill, and had benefits for women unrelated to preventing pregnancy, such as reducing menstrual bleeding. “But women I see sometimes go on Google and read misinformation including that Larcs are not suitable for young women, or that they have a lasting effect on future fertility,” Bateson said. “There are also misplaced concerns about infection risk, and I think some women also feel concerned about the procedure itself, whether it’s one of the devices placed under the skin under the arm or an IUD being implanted into the uterus. So this consensus statement is about women and doctors having access to good, reliable information.” But doctors’ clinics were often not equipped to perform the procedure, or were not providing enough information to women about the different kinds of Larcs and their pros and cons, she said. Women wary of hormonal contraceptives might wish to consider the copper IUD, for example, but weren’t necessarily being given this information. “There is a bit of a move away from the pill and we need to get into the mindset of being aware of these other methods, which have benefits beyond reliably providing long-term contraception,” Bateson said. “Women who have heavy bleeding and who can become anaemic because of this might benefits from Larcs, and the hormonal IUD can cut down on blood loss during periods by up to 90%. The copper IUD can be used as a form of emergency contraception if inserted within five days of unprotected intercourse but many women don’t know they have this alternative to the emergency contraceptive pill [sometimes referred to as the morning-after pill].” It has been estimated that 33% of women are using oral contraceptives, 30% condoms and 19% sterilisation as their primary contraceptive method. A study by Monash University researchers found that around one in seven sexually active Australians use no contraception, and a further one in seven use “natural” contraceptive methods, such as withdrawal or fertility awareness-based methods. According to the consensus statement, 60% of Australian women who have had an unintended pregnancy were using at least one form of contraception, with the oral contraceptive pill the form most frequently cited (43%), followed by condoms (22%). Failure of contraception with oral contraceptive pills is largely attributable to not taking the pill as prescribed, for example missing a day. “A key way to reduce unintended pregnancy is to use more effective, less user-dependent methods of contraception, such as the long-acting reversible contraceptive,” the statement says. “However, when women are provided with comprehensive, accurate, unbiased counselling, Larc methods are preferred and have been shown to have the highest rates of satisfaction and 12-month continuation compared with other combined hormonal methods.” The chief executive of the Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association, Alison Verhoeven, said this did not mean that Larcs were for everyone or that women should be pressured to use them. But women had a right to good quality information about all of the available contraceptive methods, she said. “Part of the issue is insertion of a Larc can sometimes require more than one visit to a GP, which becomes expensive if doctors don’t bulk bill, but also there is a geographic barrier in that some regional and rural clinics may not have the facilities to insert the devices,” Verhoeven said. The federal government needed to ensure Medicare benefits schedule items for insertions and removals reflected the cost of providing the service, and took into account the wider public health benefit. “Training programs for health professionals in implant and IUD insertion and removal should be made easily available,” she said. In particular, nurses, midwives and nurse practitioners can and should have increased involvement in Larc procedures.” Women should also receive education about Larcs in school, she added. The development of the consensus statement was supported by funding from Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme, and followed consultation with consumers, leading health professionals and experts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/26/national-park-plastics-bottled-water-ban","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T09:00:38Z","webTitle":"National park ban saved 2m plastic bottles – and still Trump reversed it","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/26/national-park-plastics-bottled-water-ban","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/26/national-park-plastics-bottled-water-ban","fields":{"headline":"National park ban saved 2m plastic bottles – and still Trump reversed it","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A ban on bottled water in 23 national parks prevented up to 2m plastic bottles from being used and discarded every year, a US national park service study found. That is equivalent to up to 326 barrels of oil worth of emissions, 419 cubic yards of landfill space and 111,743lb of plastic, according to the May study. Despite that, the Trump administration reversed the bottled water ban just three months later, a decision that horrified conservationists and pleased the bottled water industry. “The bottled water industry has led a years-long campaign against this commonsense policy, all to protect its bottom line,” said Lauren DeRusha Florez, an associate campaign director at Corporate Accountability International. “The fact that Trump administration officials knew the benefits of this policy back in May but still decided to rescind it last month sure looks to me like the bottled water industry’s lobbying dollars at work,” she said. The plan to curb pollution in America’s most famous wilderness areas was spurred when arguably its most famous park, the Grand Canyon, banned the sale of plastic water bottles in its gift shops, according to the report. Approximately 331 million people visit US national parks each year. The program was meant to support a “life cycle” approach to plastic, which activists say is the largest global threat to the environment behind climate change. One million plastic bottles are sold per minute, according to a Guardian analysis. The top six drink companies in the world use an average of just 6.6% recycled plastic. At the same time, new research has shown that plastics which find their way into the sea have entered the food supply. Scientists have found plastic particles in sea salt, honey, fish, beer and tap water. The National Park Service released the report in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. In a cover sheet to the report, the agency said it was originally developed to help management make decisions, but that the agency has “lacked the data necessary to ensure the report’s findings”. The agency started allowing parks to ban bottled water in 2011. Since then, the bottled water industry argued that the ban was unfair and eliminated a healthy beverage option, even though hydration stations with free water were installed in parks. When the National Park Service ended the ban in August, it echoed an industry argument: “It should be up to our visitors to decide how best to keep themselves and their families hydrated during a visit to a national park, particularly during hot summer visitation periods,” said the acting service director, Michael Reynolds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/25/shakhtar-donetsk-manchester-city-champions-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T21:26:43Z","webTitle":"Homeless Shakhtar Donetsk target another Champions League upset | Barry Glendenning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/25/shakhtar-donetsk-manchester-city-champions-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/25/shakhtar-donetsk-manchester-city-champions-league","fields":{"headline":"Homeless Shakhtar Donetsk target another Champions League upset","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Shakhtar Donetsk took little time to hurl the cat among the pigeons in a Champions League group most observers expected to be dominated by Napoli and Manchester City, with the Ukrainian side and Feyenoord making up the numbers. While the Dutch champions duly crumbled at home against City in the last round of fixtures, the Ukrainian side’s 2-1 victory against the Italian league leaders was one of few surprises across the competition. Shakhtar still have plenty more to do to break the perceived duopoly established at the group stage draw in Monaco a month ago. Next up are City and bookmakers make Paulo Fonseca’s side big-priced outsiders to secure even a draw at the Etihad Stadium against a team who put four past Feyenoord and average more than three goals a game in the Premier League. Playing away from home is unlikely to be much of an inconvenience for Shakhtar players who have got used to travelling long distances. The ongoing conflict between Ukrainian armed forces and pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk means Shakhtar last played at their own Donbass Arena in 2014 and they hold home games at the OSK Metalist Stadium in Kharkiv, almost 500km from their training base in Kyiv. Shakhtar fans wishing to watch their team play in their current lodgings face a 600km round trip from Donetsk to this former home of the now defunct FC Metalist Kharkiv, who went out of business last year. This is the first meeting of City and Shakhtar, although the clubs do have previous in the transfer market. The City midfielder Fernandinho arrived from the Ukrainian side in 2013, and before him Elano established himself as a fan favourite during a two-year stay. The famously lucrative “Brazilian colony” from which both players came was established at Shakhtar by the former manager Mircea Lucescu and remains very much in place, with the club currently boasting seven in the squad. One of them, Taison, scored their opener against Napoli, while the wingers Bernard and Marlos are also first-team regulars. In the outstanding Fred they have a footballer recently cited by his own manager as the best Brazilian midfielder currently playing the game. Heavily linked with Everton before Ronald Koeman got the manager’s job at Goodison Park, Fonseca had exceedingly big boots to fill after taking over from the iconic Romanian Lucescu, who won eight league titles, six Ukrainian cups and the Europa League during his 12 years in charge of Shakhtar. Following an undistinguished playing career as a central defender, Fonseca won the Portuguese Cup with FC Braga, having first made his name during two managerial stints at Paços Ferreira which bookended an unsuccessful spell at Porto. In May last year the 44-year-old was unveiled as Lucescu’s successor and went on to win the domestic treble of league, cup and super cup in his first season, earning the club a return to the Champions League after a one-year absence. Shakhtar finished 13 points clear of their closest rival, Dynamo Kyiv, last season, a swing of 20 from when they came second to Dynamo in Lucescu’s final campaign. Having lost just once in 12 matches in all competitions this season, Shakhtar arrive in Manchester in fine form and despite City’s impressive start to the season, seem unlikely to be the pushovers odds-compilers expect. In Ukraine, against largely inferior opposition, Fonseca’s side play an expansive, possession-based attacking style, spending as much time as possible in the final third and making good use of their wide men to deliver crosses. In Europe, however, the manager has conceded he needs to rein in his baser impulses and against Napoli, Shakhtar scored an early goal and sat back before nicking another on the break. A penalty from Arkadiusz Milik left them worried towards the end, but with the defence creaking they managed to hold on for a win the Italian side’s manager, Maurizio Sarri, magnanimously insisted they deserved. “We changed our preparations a bit but we need to keep faith with our style,” Fonseca had said in the buildup. “It’s not a physical game. We like to dominate the play and have plenty of the ball.” Having already lost the central defender Serhiy Kryvtsov indefinitely to a fractured knee cap, Fonseca will also be without his talismanic on-field mouthpiece and adopted son of Shakhtar, Darijo Srna, for the foreseeable future. A player with Shakhtar since 2003, the Croatian full-back was informed he had failed a drug test last week and is taking a self-imposed break from football to try and clear his name. Srna insists he is innocent and the 35-year-old’s absence will be keenly felt by a team that has already been forced to overcome more than its fair share of problems on and off the pitch in recent years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2017/oct/18/what-should-i-teach-my-children-to-prepare-them-for-jobs-in-their-era","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T11:00:01Z","webTitle":"What should I teach my children to prepare them to race with the robots?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/oct/18/what-should-i-teach-my-children-to-prepare-them-for-jobs-in-their-era","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/oct/18/what-should-i-teach-my-children-to-prepare-them-for-jobs-in-their-era","fields":{"headline":"What should I teach my children to prepare them to race with the robots?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Years ago, as a reporter in Seattle, I watched Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer decry Washington state’s education system. He said Microsoft couldn’t hire enough locals because our schools don’t produce the kinds of minds he needed. At the time, I was angry. He and his cohort, most notably Jeff Bezos of Amazon, contributed serious money to the campaign against a state income tax on the wealthy that would have funneled billions to our schools. Now I feel a pinch deep in my stomach, an emotion so primal I hesitate to name it. As a mother, my time is come, or nearly done, and my children’s just begun. Automation will absorb all of the jobs it can reach, whether on the factory floor or in an office. Artificial intelligence has already taken over the corporate earnings analyses I once produced as a business journalist. By the best measures I’ve been able to find, machines will displace about half of American jobs by the time my toddlers look for work. This new era has been called the second machine age, the fourth industrial revolution, the information economy. From certain angles, Seattle residents seem well positioned to access the highly paid and creative jobs that arise from combining cutting-edge technologies with the exponential powers of computing and big data. My city is now considered a global city not because of the port, which put our state on the maps when they were still being drawn, but because of the presence of Microsoft, Amazon and numerous tech startups. Amazon occupies one fifth of all office space in downtown Seattle, a short ride from my neighborhood on light rail. Incoming waves of well-educated tech workers have helped double the median home price during the past five years. Many of these rich young people call themselves progressive. Are they proud to be joining the nation’s most regressive tax structure? In our state, poor people pay eight times as much of their family income to taxes as the wealthy 1%. Lacking a personal income tax, Washington state relies on sales tax and has long looked to levies to fund schools, parks and other social needs. When I moved to Seattle in 2004, I marveled that the state didn’t take a cut of my income from the now-defunct Seattle Post-Intelligencer. It took me a while to contemplate what it means for an entire society to act against the interests of its children. College-level tuitions before college To survive the extinction of an entire class, I must prepare my two- and three-year-old sons to race with the robots, and not against them. Our kids are going to meet an economy with far fewer entry-level positions and will have to clamber up a receding ladder. That means being in schools equipped to exceed the averages, not rising to meet them. Washington state has underfunded our schools so long that our government’s negligence was deemed unconstitutional by our state supreme court, which fined the state $100,000 a day for failing to provide a future for our children. Years into this public shaming, the legislature came up with a multibillion-dollar package to fund basic education in our state, though they didn’t manage to pass a capital budget before students went back to school after a long, dry summer. From my porch, I can see the chain-link fence blur into gray around the asphalt playground of our neighborhood public school. On weekday mornings, my closest friends walk to Hawthorne Elementary with their children, ducklings that cluster at crosswalks along streets known for gunfire. A new home just sold for nearly a million dollars at the end of our block, but people keep getting shot and dying at our community playfield. Despite valiant efforts by its admirable principal, committed educators, engaged parents and resilient students, Hawthorne has been labeled “failing” since long before my husband and I bought a peeling house from a nice couple who raised their family here. Less than half of the school’s fourth and fifth graders meet the state’s standards in math, which makes me doubt that our educational system is preparing these kids to thrive in the glittering economy they were born under. Five years ago, the office of the superintendent of public instruction ranked Hawthorne among the bottom 5% of the state, according to test passage rates. This, in a city known for minting billionaires. In The Second Machine Age, authors Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, both MIT professors, recommend Montessori programs to prepare children for their future, with a focus on science, technology, engineering, arts and math. That’s Steam, for those not versed in educational acronyms. Developed to help poor children realize their own innate potential, Montessori schools practice self-directed learning with tactile materials that encourage the freewheeling creativity that formed tech CEOs such as Bezos and Google’s co-founders. The private bilingual Montessori kindergarten I found 30 minutes away costs $20,000 a year. Despite college-level tuitions, about one quarter of Seattle students opt out of the public school system to study at private or parochial schools. To send my sons to Seattle’s best private schools would cost more than $700,000, and that’s before they get to college. A survey of public schools in Seattle shows no Montessori options that my children can access, though a nearby program in Leschi was a success at first, drawing wealthier students into the public school system, bringing with them the engagement of their families. The Leschi teachers were so distressed by the resulting racial, linguistic and housing disparities between the traditional and Montessori classes that they melded the programs, rather than working to recruit more students of color into the Montessori program, which they could not afford to expand. A taskforce opted against including technology in the curriculum, fearful they would attract too many white families. I believe in diversity; my own blood is blended. A first generation Latinx, I’ve invested years of effort to raise my sons to be bilingual. I also want to work toward equity in a city whose neighborhood schools reflect the segregation compelled by redlining and white flight. Leschi’s students are learning hard truths about equity, but they’re improving together. Maybe that’s enough. But I worry when well-intentioned people – lacking the resources to serve their students equally – decide against teaching technology, the lingua franca of our world. Even the state administers student tests by computer. I sought answers from Chris Reykdal, state superintendent of public instruction. “The injustice of it all is that we have never seen technology as a core learning,” Reykdal said. “Do we still consider technology an enrichment, or should it be a more profound part of basic education? The state hasn’t made that decision yet.” Washington has hundreds of school districts overseen by elected boards that enact tangled mandates without the resources to see them through. All over the state, schools used levy monies to take care of basics and pay their teachers, rather than acquiring and teaching technology. Deb Merle is Governor Jay Inslee’s K-12 education adviser. Merle said that designating technology as part of basic education, which would ensure that the dollars flowed to their purpose, is not a state priority, though she recognized that Reykdal’s predecessor also advocated for keeping technology funds separate. “I don’t think we teach enough science, period. That’s what I spend a lot of time worrying about, not what kind of science,” Merle said. “Our elementary schools teach less than one hour per week of science.” Steam as a social justice issue I kept dialing, determined to maintain the education-fueled trajectory of my family. My kin have lived in dictatorship-induced diaspora since famine swept Spain under Franco; they later fled Batista, who ruled Cuba before Castro. I am not conditioned to expect social stability as a condition of being for any country. The meeting I most dreaded was closest to home. On the short walk to our neighborhood school, I decided to come right out and tell its principal, Sandra Scott, that I am afraid to send my kids to Hawthorne because the school’s test scores, though on the rise, are low enough to make me wince. Luckily, Scott is a pragmatic visionary, the kind of principal who inspires parents to put down the remote and join the PTA. Since 2009, Scott has led Hawthorne’s revitalization, winning admiration and awards from Johns Hopkins University for her program of school, family and community partnerships. “Test scores don’t define who the students are. Our kids are not a number,” Scott said. “There were things we needed to do differently or better” – like “improving the academics and the school culture to bring families back into the community”. Recognizing the opportunity that Seattle’s tech economy presents, Scott retooled Hawthorne to focus on Steam programming. Rather than cluster the high-performing test takers together – which has segregated programs within diverse schools – Hawthorne distributes them throughout classrooms. If a student excels in math, outstripping peers in that grade’s curriculum, the teacher walks that child to the next grade for math. When it comes to fifth-grade science, those efforts more than doubled the test passage rates over three years, from 20% to 46%. I ache upon rereading that last sentence – the hope and pride in the increase, the grimace I can’t help but make at where they started, and what remains to be accomplished. Scott and her staff find ways to make progress. But she doesn’t have the funds for a technology teacher or trainings, so the lab will be largely unused this year. As a mother who cares about the kids who go to Hawthorne, I can’t afford to wait for someone else to find those resources. The leaders of this school are working to undo the effects of intergenerational poverty that dates back to slavery and other forced migrations. More than half of the students are eligible for free and reduced lunches. A quarter of the students are learning the language they’re taught in. Scores reflect circumstances, which is why Reykdal is refocusing the state on “racial gaps, poverty gaps and English language gaps, down to the school level”. Many of the jobs first displaced by automation belong to peoples of color, women and others who depend on a combination of part-time positions. A federal council of economic advisers found an 83% likelihood that, by 2040, automation would displace jobs paying less than $20 per hour. In Washington, Steam-related jobs pay double the median wage, for starters. The people moving here to work for Microsoft, Amazon and Boeing make much more. When we choose not to provide public schools with the resources needed to provide educational access to those opportunities, we are consigning local students to lesser-paid sectors of the economy, the very same that are vulnerable to automation. In other words, we are allowing our government to consecrate our children to poverty in real time. Mass unemployment would make American society more violent, our law enforcement more brutal and our peoples more vulnerable to genocide. Automation is a social justice issue, and if history is any teacher, it shows us that vast swaths of disenfranchised peoples are a harbinger of war. Problems that reflect the world Whenever I have a problem that’s too big to solve, I call my dad, and we argue about what to do. He told me the solution was simple. I should move. The only financially feasible choice would be the suburbs. Something in me balks at leaving a city I love, and especially our neighborhood, where my children are happy. As a community, we just celebrated our 10th annual block party, a Cuban pig roast that my husband and I organize for our wedding anniversary. Our neighbors come bearing side dishes, canopies and games, and we dance until the DJs stop playing. The conversations we start on that night have lasted a decade. I want to stay. As native Spanish speakers, my sons could option into the bilingual public schools on the other side of our gridlocked downtown, north of the covenants which kept people of color from buying homes. Those schools’ wait lists are legendary, but I am uncomfortable with the mostly white and relatively well-off demographics produced by saving only 15% of seats for native speakers. I want my kids to feel at home in a country that contains multitudes, which is why we moved to one of our nation’s most diverse zip codes. Computers solve the problems they’re given. And so we must ask ourselves what we value, and whom. Not every child wants to be a robotics engineer. But without the modes of thought elicited by learning computer science from an early age, many Washington state students will not be competitive for the jobs that remain. I want my own sons to be chosen – and better yet, able to choose – as I was, though I fell for a profession whose financial structures imploded five years after my college graduation. I hope my privileged vulnerability encourages you to reflect on those truly trapped by our system. This essay invokes my worries as a mother, and with them, my socioeconomic position. Hawthorne is a happy place with diverse classrooms whose problems reflect the world, but I am glad of the years I have left to decide what my kids truly need to learn. There can be no denying that I am one of the gentrifiers of this neighborhood, and with the honor of living here comes the responsibility to contribute. Looking at what’s coming in the second machine age – tremendous opportunities, to be sure, but also massive loss of what we’ve known as jobs – I feel compelled to join those working toward a better future, minds whirring whenever problems arise. Two nonprofits, FIRST Washington and XBOT Robotics, have offered support and equipment for Hawthorne to start a Lego robotics league after school. Four parents signed up to lead teams during last night’s PTA meeting, my very first. It’s a start. Get involved To bolster Steam education for students, hybridized systems have sprung up as non-profits seek to prepare our children for the economy we will leave to them. First Washington: This nonprofit helps start and sustain after-school Lego robotics leagues from K-12. XBOT Robotics: Operating in one of the nation’s most diverse zip codes, offering robotics programming K-12. Code.org: Free online programming for learners at all levels. Work through problems with your kids. Technology Access Foundation: Helping people of color access Stem-related education in middle school, high school and beyond. Washington State Opportunity Scholarship: A non-profit that funds thousands of Stem scholarships for Washington’s college-bound high school graduates. More than half of those scholarship recipients are students of color, women and/or the first in their family to access a higher education, if not all three.

Though Twain’s biographer later noted that there’s no analogue for “Shania” in Ojibwe, it was an exceptional bit of branding: Twain’s narrative is one of rare upward mobility from hardscrabble beginnings to first-name-only fame. Along the way, Twain forged a singular artistic path. The 1990s saw uncommon prosperity and changing points of view among women in country music – while the “Victim Queen” persona of Reba McEntire reigned in the early part of the decade, Twain later foregrounded a woman’s agency in hit singles like Any Man of Mine and Man! I Feel Like a Woman! Backed by her then husband Mutt Lange’s arena-rock production, Twain’s aesthetic and her perspective were unlike anything that had come before. In Heartaches by the Number, the writer Bill Friskics-Warren likened the opening of Any Man of Mine to the detonation of a bomb. and described Twain’s sound as “at once more pop and more country than the Nashville norm” – something no other artist since has been able to replicate with the same verve. But Twain’s journey has taken her far from the recording studio. Her last proper studio album, Up!, is nearly 15 years old, and she’s released only a handful of individual tracks – singles like 2011’s Today Is Your Day and a lovely cover of Coat of Many Colors from a 2003 tribute album to Dolly Parton – in the interim. As she prepares for this week’s release of Now, it’s unclear how the artist who has sold more albums than any woman in country music history will fit back into a genre she reshaped a generation ago. Twain’s last top 10 hit on country radio was a full 13 years ago, when Party for Two, a duet with a then unknown Billy Currington, peaked at No 7. The last of her No 1 hits, Honey, I’m Home, came all the way back in 1998. Even at the time of Twain’s biggest radio hits, it was rare for a woman over the age of 40 to land singles in the top 10 with any consistency. While Twain far outsold all of her contemporaries at the time, country radio’s biases against women have only become more entrenched in the two years since Keith Hill launched the #SaladGate controversy by referring to women as the “tomatoes” in the salad of country radio. This week’s country radio chart includes only four women in the top 40 (Carly Pearce, Maren Morris, Miranda Lambert and Kelsea Ballerini, in descending chart position). Of those women, Lambert is the oldest, at 33. Twain is now 52. To say that both her age and her gender augur ill for a comeback on the radio is an understatement. Indeed, the first single from Now, Life’s About to Get Good, peaked at No 33 and dropped off the chart in under two months. The tepid response from country radio’s increasingly myopic programming directors isn’t necessarily a surprise. Perhaps more noteworthy is how little influence Twain’s music has had on the songs that are in heavy rotation. She and Lange prominently featured traditional country instruments in their outsized pop-rock arrangements, but many of today’s most successful pop-country acts – Sam Hunt, Thomas Rhett, Morris and Ballerini – avoid even token genre signifiers in their production, which draws more heavily from the adult top 40 and R&amp;B of the early part of the century. Moreover, Ballerini’s output has been criticized for how she has adopted the same regressive, limited view of women that characterized the peak of bro-country and has lingered into the genre’s current trends. Carrie Underwood is perhaps the only contemporary country artist whose artistic identity is directly within Twain’s lineage, but she’s currently between album cycles. Twain is, at the moment, an artist without a country. Her fanbase remains fiercely devoted to her, and Now seems poised to post robust sales out of the gate, though no one is expecting another sales juggernaut like Come On Over. But the longevity of Now as a bona fide comeback will require that her songs find an audience that connects to them. That connection was always Twain’s strength: the plainspokenness of her songwriting, coupled with her relentless optimism and surefooted confidence, made her music relatable. But even when genre purists were at their loudest in railing against her, Twainhas never faced the kind of obstacles that are set up against her now. Though it would reverse some of its most problematic trends were it to embrace Twain in her comeback bid, country radio is probably a dead end. The adult top 40 and adult contemporary formats have morphed into nothing more than repertories for hits that have been on recurrent status for months. Her music is still far too pop-leaning to gain traction with the growing Americana crowd. If Twain is still on her way, it’s no longer clear where she has the options to go."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/26/donald-trump-nfl-kneeling-national-anthem","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T06:00:35Z","webTitle":"Remember this about Donald Trump.

He knows the depths of American bigotry","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Two Sundays ago, after a night of tense confrontations, police in St Louis trooped through the city chanting: “Whose streets? Our streets.” They were mocking marchers protesting at the acquittal of a former police officer, who had fatally shot a black man after a high-speed pursuit. This in the city just a few miles away from Ferguson, where Michael Brown was shot dead in the middle of the day in 2014. Then last Friday, Donald Trump went to Alabama and branded NFL players who have been expressing their support for Black Lives Matter by kneeling during the pre-game national anthem, “sons of bitches”. To cheers from the crowd, he said: “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. He is fired. He’s fired! … Total disrespect of our heritage, a total disrespect of everything that we stand for. Everything that we stand for.” This in the state that kept its local ban on interracial marriage until 2000. The battle lines in America’s struggle against racism and white supremacy are become increasingly clear to a degree not seen since the 60s. With the balm of Barack Obama’s presence in the White House having so quickly evaporated, the contradictions of the post-civil rights era are once again laid bare. The codified obstacles to freedom and equality have been removed, but the legacy of those obstacles and the system that produced them remains. Black Americans are far more likely than white people to be stopped, frisked, arrested, jailed, shot and executed by the state, while the racial gaps in unemployment are the same as 40 years ago, the racial disparity in wealth and income is worse than 50 years ago. They have the right to eat in any restaurant they wish; the trouble is, many can’t afford what’s on the menu. “The Negro today finds himself stymied by obstacles of far greater magnitude than the legal barriers he was attacking before,” wrote the civil rights leader Bayard Rustin, presciently, in 1965. “Problems which, while conditioned by Jim Crow, do not vanish upon its demise. They are deeply rooted in our socio-economic order.” So on one side of these battle lines, alongside elders of the struggle, a generation of young activists kneels in rebellion against that “socio-economic order”. Informed by a decade or more of activism ranging from Black Lives Matter to Occupy Wall Street, they have been schooled in resistance against war, austerity, police shootings, homophobia, immigration and a range of other issues. This is the generation that produced Colin Kaepernick, the young black San Francisco 49ers quarterback who caused a sensation last year by refusing to stand for the national anthem: “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of colour,” he said. “There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.” He would continue until “[the American flag] represents what it’s supposed to represent”. Others soon followed suit. In 2012 I asked John Carlos, one of the US Olympians who raised his fist in a black power salute in Mexico in 1968, if he saw any prospect of political resistance emerging again through sport. “Today, if an athlete doesn’t have a view of their history before them, then they have a view of just that big cheque in front of them,” he told me. “It’s not the responsibility of the oppressor to educate us. We have to educate ourselves and our own.” Clearly there has been a lot more education going on than anyone realised. Kaepernick’s protest had been brewing for a while. Since the killing of Brown in 2014, a number of black athletes had been wearing protest T-shirts related to police shootings. Kaepernick took it to the next level by pitting the reality of American racism against the mythology of American patriotism. This was a high-stakes move. Football is a multibillion-dollar business. No one ever got rich leading a popular protest against racism. (Indeed, Kaepernick was let go by the 49ers for this season). And no one ever went broke betting on the popular appeal of American racism either. For on the other side of the divide stand the defenders of white supremacy, resentful at eight years of a black president and bewildered by the broader geo-political decline that has seen lost wars, lost trade and stagnant wages. With white America set to become a minority within a generation, they are desperate not only to protect privilege but to contort history. Defending everything from the statues of confederate generals to the right of police to shoot unarmed African Americans, they have found an advocate in the White House. Sooner or later we are going to have to stop being shocked by the racial obscenity of this presidency. As a candidate, Trump stood as an unvarnished racist, a shameless xenophobe – he has been as good as his word. When he stokes racial enmity he is merely fulfilling the promise of his campaign. The bigotry he expresses is not new. What is new is that it should have found such a brazen voice in so high an office. In the past couple of months he has equivocated on condemning neo-Nazis, called some of those who marched with neo-Nazis “fine people” and encouraged the police to rough up suspects. Racism in American politics used to rely on clear symbols and plausible deniability. “You have to face the fact that the whole problem is really the blacks,” Nixon once told his chief of staff, Bob Haldeman. “The key is to devise a system that recognises that while not appearing to.” Now it seems appearances don’t matter. It’s not a dog whistle when everyone can hear it. It’s just a straight up whistle. But if the battle lines are clear, the outcome of this particular battle remains in doubt. America was 200 years a slave state; 100 years an apartheid state; and just over 50 years a non-racial democracy. The concept of equality is relatively new. Not everyone got the memo. Trump knows his base. Those who knelt were booed in some stadiums. While white Americans overwhelmingly oppose the idea of white supremacy, its core message still holds considerable appeal: almost half of white Americans believe “white America is under attack” and a third think “America should protect and preserve its white European heritage”. That said, after Trump’s tirade many more NFL players knelt this weekend. Other teams refused to come out for the anthem. A range of entertainers and other sportspeople have joined in. Coaches, owners and the NFL itself slammed Trump for his comments. It remains to be seen if that coalition will hold. But for now it is growing in size and confidence. That, in itself, is cause for hope. • Gary Younge is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/25/jeremy-corbyn-power-labour-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T19:30:51Z","webTitle":"Corbyn is a changed man – and he’s forging a path to power | Polly Toynbee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/25/jeremy-corbyn-power-labour-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/25/jeremy-corbyn-power-labour-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Corbyn is a changed man – and he’s forging a path to power","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“We are the grown-ups now.” So said several speakers. In the grotesque political playground of Brexit Britain, Labour has indeed become the nation’s adults, the sensibles, the party least likely to wreck the country’s future. How short a time ago Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell were regarded as delinquent adolescents who had never grown out of the 1970s. They may be the masters soon. What a transformation. Remember how early in the general election campaign they fell 11 points behind in dismal local council results? Whatever Labour leaders say sourly now to those of us who feared the worst, waiting for that exit poll in June they too were braced for heavy losses, never expecting a crushing humiliation for Theresa May. Cynics say Labour is lucky: who could fail to shine in contrast to the most chaotic and shameless government in living memory, wrestling each other to death even as they drag the country over a precipice of their own devising? This mutinous Tory crew, who loathe one another with tigerish ferocity, are responsible for an economy in a dire state. Paul Johnson, the head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the great referee of truth in a fake-fact world, warned a Resolution Foundation meeting here at Labour’s conference that everyone was underestimating the situation’s severity. Labour says living standards haven’t fallen so far since Napoleonic times; Johnson says not since the 1750s, with productivity the worst ever recorded. We are, he says, in frighteningly uncharted territory. He adds the Office for Budget Responsibility’s warning that Brexit will worsen public finances: making trade more expensive “is guaranteed to reduce living standards further”. Strictly non-partisan, Johnson criticises many Labour spending promises – but these are the economic facts the country faces as GDP per capita falls further behind the rest of the EU, national and personal debt rises and our credit rating tumbles. Surely any opposition would soar after years of such mismanagement, even one led by two people recently regarded as leftovers of Labour’s looniest era? But success changes all, and the sudden prospect of power has transformed Corbyn, McDonnell and their team. Those of us who doubted them feared that winning elections was not their aim: they would prefer to ride their ideological hobby horses regardless of what the public wanted. But now they’ve tasted electoral nectar, they want more. Emily Thornberry, effusive about Corbyn, said he had done so well because “nothing is stronger, nothing on earth than a person of principle … whose unshakeable values will carry him to Downing Street”. Well, up to a point. What’s encouraging is how his team has embraced pragmatism. The brilliant manifesto that overnight shifted Labour’s fortunes mid-election was pure retail politics: for large sums they enticed calculated demographics – the young with tuition fees, the old with the unmerited triple lock and, less noticed, a pledge to never raise the pension age, however how long we live. They promised no tax rises except for the top 5% and corporations. But only crumbs for the poor: an ironist might say that the slogan “for the many not the few” meant for the majority of voters, not the few who struggle with least. Gordon Brown and Tony Blair did great good to the poorest, with tax credits, Sure Starts and much more - but they too did it by stealth, fearing that redistribution was no election winner. Now Corbyn and McDonnell do likewise, listening to the public mood, being careful not to alienate too many, fudging the tricky issues. Here is a party in pursuit of power, making compromises, offering electoral blandishments, doing (almost) whatever it takes to keep Conservatives out of power because a Labour government will always improve the lot of those in most need. Graciously, McDonnell’s speech praised the good done by every Labour government: Attlee, Wilson, and yes, Blair and Brown too. Who would have thought they would be so Wilsonian? But he is their model for blurring their Brexit dilemma. Corbyn is a free movement, pro-migration man, but he stifles that: he is anti-single market and more or less stifles that too. The vast majority of Labour members and two-thirds of Labour voters are appalled by Brexit – but pragmatism warns the party against losing northern Brexit seats. Keir Starmer has led them cleverly along a wobbly tightrope towards near-as-damn-it-but-not-quite-yet staying in the single market and customs union, without affronting northern Brexiters. Timing is everything, even if it infuriates passionate anti-Brexiters who marched and rallied in Brighton. Forget Corbyn’s pitch about giving the party back to the members: an old fashioned top-down stitch-up denied delegates the chance to commit the party to free movement and the single market. Corbyn, that serial rebel, has learned that discipline is essential for any party serious about power. For a reminder, he need only glance across at how indiscipline is wrecking May’s party. Momentum is merging into mainstream Labour: if grabbing the party’s levers of power obsesses a few old-style plotters, the people here, so swollen in numbers, are the same decent people you find in any local party, the people who keep local public services running against the odds, who run the credit unions, food banks and citizens advice bureaus, as well as knocking on doors and running raffles. There are vanishingly few zombie Derek Hattons risen from the Militant grave. If these ordinary members now have more say on policy, the party looks safe enough in their hands. Leading figures from Labour’s many eras are here, some bereft, some bewildered by new, unfamiliar shadow ministers. Like the rings on a tree trunk you can find the circles of old old Labour, old New Labour, overtaken Brownites and once-dashing Milibandists, some of yesterday’s younger people perplexed at the rise of an older generation. But the best have recovered from the shock, finding Corbyn’s Labour not such an alien beast after all, embracing the new radicalism and plans they would like to have dared to make themselves – taking back control of utilities and PFIs. No one in their right mind would predict anything. Corbyn could be prime minister next year, in five years or never. The scale of the Brexit calamity and its political fallout is unknowable. But Labour looks more credible by the day, its senior team more impressive: one reminder here is the roster of excellent Labour mayors and leaders running the country’s best councils, while Kensington and Chelsea stands as the Tory’s sorry emblem. The hard truth is that Labour’s fate hangs less on its own talents than on the unpredictable fate and Euro-irrationality of the chaotic party in power. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/27/young-sheldon-tv-prequels-sopranos-louie-ck","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T10:00:31Z","webTitle":"Wonder Years: which TV characters most deserve their own prequels?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/27/young-sheldon-tv-prequels-sopranos-louie-ck","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/27/young-sheldon-tv-prequels-sopranos-louie-ck","fields":{"headline":"Wonder Years: which TV characters most deserve their own prequels?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"With the unveiling of its Big Bang Theory prequel Young Sheldon, CBS has made the audacious bet that what didn’t work for The Carrie Diaries will work for the network – namely, the notion that audiences are willing to love a pint-size version of their favorite TV characters just as much as the genuine article. While previews of Young Sheldon have not inspired optimism, the original’s success was always baffling in its own way, so who’s to say this won’t be a mega hit as well? With that in mind, we’ve compiled a pitch memo in an effort to get out in front of the wave of youthsploitation soon to overtake the airwaves. Young Tony Soprano Saturday Night Live went and made an anachronistic mockery out of the concept, but Tony’s childhood did factor significantly into The Sopranos’ unsparing psychological dissection of its subject. The show’s creator, David Chase, was liable to slip back in time for the occasional flashback to formative traumas in Tony’s boyhood years during the late 60s and early 70s; one incident involving misappropriated deli meats wields all the terrifying emotional power of a buried youth memory. What fun it would be, then, to get a full series’ worth of the chilling normalized abuse that ran rampant in the Soprano household! It’d have all the classic pop and rock musical cues of the original series, with at least three times the panic attacks and stress-vomiting. Plus, viewers can get to know Tony’s enigmatic father, Johnny Boy, and bear witness to the full brunt of a prime-years Livia Soprano’s boundless contempt. Louie’s teen years Louis CK’s semi-autobiographical existential comedy traverses the entire breadth of human experience in its interrogations of everything from parenthood to coming-of-age to coming-of-middle-age. A few interludes look back on a nervous, flawed Louie during his boyhood years, joining him as he has a junior crisis of faith in one instance, and while he purchases cannabis from a sketchy neighborhood fellow in another. CK is particularly astute when it comes to putting the looming anxieties and confusions of early ages into visual terms; he can create the same stomach-pit fear a trip to the headmaster’s office brings. Teen Louie would chronicle the comic’s adolescence, sparing no sexual humiliation or depressive episode. But of course there’s a gimmick: just as Louie freely recast recurring roles from episode to episode, the teenaged reboot would hire a new actor for the lead role in each installment, almost like an anthology of personnel. Slap a red wig and prosthetic paunch on pretty much anyone, and they’re good to go. Lil’ Dick Whitman This spiritual follow-up to The Sopranos also spun a backstory of woe for its troubled protagonist, linked a bit more closely to the ethically compromised origins of his nation. Our man Don Draper was born a penniless country boy, Dick Whitman, a prostitute’s orphaned son who grew up picking johns’ pockets at the local brothel. Dick swaps identities with a dead soldier during the chaos of a firefight during the Korean war, and upon his return to the US, he completely reinvents himself as a distinctly American sort of striver. There’s great drama and pathos baked right into his life story, but that means the challenge lies in figuring out the benefits to making explicit that which was previously left implied. Obvious work-around: super-hot Dick Whitman. The teens will eat it up like so much theft-reward chocolate – a joke that this show’s undoubtedly vast audience will come to appreciate. I Love Lucy: The Early Years The mother of all domestic sitcoms always took a greater interest in Lucy and Ricky’s present than their past. One episode detailed the auspicious meeting of the romantic leads during a 1940 cruise to Cuba that Lucy took with her trusty galpal Ethel, where she met and summarily fell for the bewitching Ricky while he was working as her tour guide. Lucy scored the musician a traveling orchestra gig that got him passage to the US, and the rest is history; but so much of that history has gone unwritten. Picture an epic romance bridging racial boundaries in a time of intolerance, with nothing short of global war as its backdrop. As the United States decides to intervene in the second world war, Lucy and Ricky navigate treacherous social waters in New York City during their wholesome courtship. Of course there would be hijinks galore, and of course they’d be sleeping in separate beds. How better to capture the coveted “viewers who have fallen asleep tuned into TV Land” demographic? Bluth Family Memories Few TV families have baby books as disturbing, emotionally sadistic, and lightly treasonous as the main clan from cult sitcom Arrested Development. Indeed, the rearing of Michael, Buster, GOB, and Lindsay at the hands of their diabolical mother, Lucille, was the butt of constant jokes over their three seasons. From the amateur child-sparring videos sold under the title Boyfights, to the one-armed man used to scare the kids straight, to the all-out war of attrition Lucille waged on Buster’s fragile psyche, their family tree is gnarled and diseased. The jokes all but wrote themselves when the polarizing fourth season stepped back in time to cast Kristen Wiig and Seth Rogen as the Bluth parents’ younger selves. They’re practically figures of Greek tragedy in their stuporous hubris, and watching the kids get caught in the crossfire was a reliable source of laughs. If nothing else, turn the show into a solo vehicle for Baby Buster."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/26/nick-cave-and-the-bad-seeds-review-joyous-and-unexpectedly-triumphant","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T23:52:28Z","webTitle":"Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds review – joyous and unexpectedly triumphant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/26/nick-cave-and-the-bad-seeds-review-joyous-and-unexpectedly-triumphant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/26/nick-cave-and-the-bad-seeds-review-joyous-and-unexpectedly-triumphant","fields":{"headline":"Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds review – joyous and unexpectedly triumphant","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The moment Nick Cave walks on to the Manchester Arena stage, before a note of music is played, a gruff male voice from the crowd bellows “I LOVE YOU!” The singer nods. “I’m glad we’ve got that sorted out,” he mutters. Thirty-four years into their career, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds are a band that inspire a certain kind of undying devotion among their fans: perhaps uniquely among his peers, Cave recently became the antihero of a phantasmagoric graphic novel, Reinhard Kleist’s Mercy On Me. Nevertheless, even the most devoted might be forgiven for approaching their current tour with a certain degree of trepidation. On the face of it, it looks like a spectacular mismatch. After four decades, they find themselves playing the Sheds, as the music industry colloquially refers to Britain’s arena-sized venues. It’s testament to how popular an uncompromising artist can eventually become if they’re as good at what they do as Nick Cave is, but seems an unlikely fit given their recent musical history. A huge chunk of the set list is derived from their last album, Skeleton Tree, a remarkable and potent work even by their standards, but one that seems almost singularly unsuited to ringing out around the kind of vast venues that usually play host to stadium rock bands, production-heavy pop extravaganzas and indeed the deathless hilarity of funnyman Michael McIntyre. The issue isn’t so much the devastating emotional tenor of an album recorded in the wake of Cave’s son’s death, although the fact that listening to Skeleton Tree frequently feels uncomfortably like intruding on someone’s grief is hard to get away from – “I want the shows to be uplifting and inspiring and for people to walk away feeling better than when they came, not some sort of empathetic contagion that goes through the crowd and people walk out feeling like shit,” Cave recently told the Guardian. It’s more the actual sound of the album: as abstract and unruly in its own way as anything Cave’s old mob the Birthday Party came up with, a mass of electronic loops, ragged vocals, rhythms that clatter out of time with the rest of the track, songs that keep vanishing beneath grinding noise. It’s about as far removed from the kind of music built to rouse arena audiences as it’s possible to get: opening the set with a salvo of three Skeleton Tree tracks – the first, Anthrocene, the most abstract and unruly of the lot – seems an undertaking that in theory is either extremely brave or suicidal. But there was something else Cave said in the same interview, about songs taking on a life of their own: “Songs are strange things … they’re patient, and wait for the meaning, and the meaning changes through the years.” And so it proves tonight. While the lyrics of Red Right Hand are subtly updated – the murderous protagonist now sends “angry little tweets” – Anthrocene and the other tracks from Skeleton Tree appear stripped back and tightened up, with most of the short-circuiting sonic turmoil removed to reveal something beautiful and stately, not a million miles removed from the beautifully drawn ballads Cave and the Bad Seeds pluck from their back catalogue on stage. You can draw a direct line between the heartbreakingly beautiful Girl in Amber and The Ship Song or Into My Arms. They reserve a sense of barely contained chaos for the earliest songs they perform, 1984’s From Her to Eternity and the following year’s Tupelo: tonight, both are genuinely awe-inspiring exercises in explosive, tumultuous fury. The Bad Seeds sound fantastic – it’s hard to think of another band that can shift so seamlessly from elegance and control to white-knuckled bedlam. Cave himself, meanwhile, remains as magnetic an onstage presence as ever. He starts the gig seated, but quickly repairs to a barrier at the front of the stage, balanced precariously in front of the crowd, gripping the front row’s hands for support as he sings, breaking off from a particularly coruscating version of From Her to Eternity to thank an audience member for passing him a tissue: “That’s incredibly considerate of you.” At one point, he starts beckoning the audience forward, and the entire standing area of the venue starts moving towards him. When it comes to the encore, he removes his sock and hands it to a fan he earlier admonished for taking photographs of his ankles, then begins plucking out people from the crowd until the stage is filled with fans, among them a child who looks about 10 and, a little disturbingly, appears to have a word-perfect knowledge of The Bad Seeds’ spectacularly foul-mouthed reimagining of the 100-year-old American folk song Stagger Lee. It’s a joyous and unexpected finale to a joyous and unexpectedly triumphant gig."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/26/facebook-user-survey-poll","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T17:55:09Z","webTitle":"Facebook wants to know: is it good or bad?

Turnbull has written to the New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, and the Northern Territory chief minister, Michael Gunner, asking them to lift their “blanket moratoriums” on new gas production and saying they are putting Australia’s energy security and industries at risk. He has also warned the heads of Australia’s energy companies that the commonwealth may have to impose strong export controls to keep more gas onshore for domestic use, after experts warned of a huge gas shortage next year. The Australian Energy Market Operator warned on Monday that next year’s gas supply shortfall could be “higher than expected”, with Australia’s eastern states facing an energy shortfall three times higher than forecast next year, leading to much higher energy prices, particularly for industry, which accounts for almost 40% of gas usage. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission also warned of a coming shortfall. “Blanket moratoriums on new gas development in some states and territories are putting our energy security, industries and Australian jobs at risk,” Turnbull wrote to the governments of NSW, Victoria and the Northern Territory. But Don Harwin, the NSW resources and energy minister, has rejected Turnbull’s criticism. Harwin says NSW has more gas projects in the pipeline than any other state, while new areas identified for exploration will take years to yield. He says the controversial Narrabri coal seam gas field in northern NSW, which could produce a large annual output, has faced strong opposition from farming and environmental groups over the practice of fracking. Turnbull has criticised NSW for not moving quickly to approve the Narrabri gas project. Wade Noonan, Victoria’s resources minister, has also hit back at Turnbull’s criticism, saying Victoria’s ban on fracking was legislated and supported by every political party. “Our agricultural sector is very important to the Victorian economy and simply attacking the states such as Victoria is not showing any leadership on Malcolm Turnbull’s behalf,” Noonan told ABC radio. Turnbull has threatened to trigger gas export controls if exporters fail to make more supply available locally and earlier this year started the process to enact it. Labor has been calling on the government to start the process up but to make sure it was “fit for purpose”, while Turnbull has been pushing back against the pressure, saying it needed to be a process of “careful consultation”. “Had we made a determination a week ago, we would have done so on the basis of information which was inaccurate,” Turnbull said on Monday. “If we are not able to receive the assurances from the industry to our satisfaction, and that of the ACCC, then we will impose those export controls.” Turnbull will speak to gas company bosses again during the week, seeking concrete plans on how they will avoid running out of gas for the domestic market. The Business Council of Australia believes the gas shortfall problem is due to the states restricting supply. “Unless we fix that problem we’re not going to fix the entire problem in the medium term,” the council’s chief Jennifer Westacott told ABC radio. “The commonwealth has to look at the means by which it can actually exert pressure on the states.” Australian Associated Press contributed to this report"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/29/pine-ridge-indian-reservation-south-dakota","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T07:00:19Z","webTitle":"Liquid genocide: alcohol destroyed Pine Ridge reservation – then they fought back","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/29/pine-ridge-indian-reservation-south-dakota","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/29/pine-ridge-indian-reservation-south-dakota","fields":{"headline":"Liquid genocide: alcohol destroyed Pine Ridge reservation – then they fought back","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Dashing through wild sunflowers and tall grass, Joe Pulliam slid through the barbed-wire fence that marks the state border. With two large wooden tipi poles slung over his shoulder, sweating in the morning sun, he knew it was trespassing. But this was about something bigger. Behind him, to the south, was the Pine Ridge Indian reservation – a vast, 3,500-sq mile rectangle of land at the south-western base of South Dakota, home to 20,000 Oglala Lakota Sioux tribe members and where the sale of alcohol is banned. In front of him, on the ground he was now striding across, was Whiteclay, Nebraska. The town has no local government and only 14 residents. For over a century, its primary purpose has been to sell alcohol to the reservation’s residents. Four million cans of beer left the stores here each year – 11,000 a day. Activists have long argued it has decimated the tribe. This summer marked the first time that the four liquor stores in Whiteclay had stopped selling. In April, after a history of lawlessness and a recent spate of unsolved murders, the Nebraska state liquor commission voted to temporarily revoke all four licenses. On this day, as the last days of a long, humid summer had started to evaporate, the state’s supreme court would hear arguments on whether to make the closures permanent. As Pulliam and a group of six other Lakota men went about planting the poles in the ground, wrapping rope around the apex, they wanted to make a lasting statement. “This tipi rising here represents the end of that oppression, the end of that colonialism,” he said, regaining his breath. “Whiteclay was the destruction.” “I’m hoping that Nebraska can look at themselves and their Christian ways and ask themselves: will they continue to profit off our people’s addiction?” On Friday, the Nebraska supreme court ruled unanimously to keep Whiteclay’s liquor stores closed. * * * Addiction is endemic here. Up to two-thirds of adults live with alcoholism. One in four children are born with fetal alcohol syndrome. Life expectancy is just 66.8 years. Fueled by poverty and addiction – the unemployment rate hovers around 80% – the suicide rate is over four times the national average. During dozens of interviews during a week spent on the reservation, every single person who spoke to the Guardian said they had either battled addiction themselves or had a family member who had. Whiteclay had become the focal point of the tribe’s attempts to target abuse head on. Its closure, even if it turned out to be temporary, marked a victory for campaigners who have pushed for years to see the liquor stores gone. But already many here, just as on other Indian reservations in America, are coming to terms with a struggle that will get even harder in an era of federal budget cuts and austerity. The Trump administration has already made clear its intention to roll back federal funds, a move likely to have a devastating effect on people here, who rely on grant money to keep many basic public programs in operation. * * * Pine Ridge is the only reservation in South Dakota where the sale and possession of alcohol is illegal. A tribal vote in 2013 to legalize sales was never implemented and “dry” status has been enforced almost entirely since foundation in 1889. Whiteclay, established around the same time, was created as a non-permanent 50-mile buffer zone to prevent the sale of alcohol close by. But in 1904, after an executive order signed by Theodore Roosevelt reduced the dry zone to a single mile, traders poured into the area, building so-called whiskey ranches that plied the nearby Lakota community with liquor. Olowan Martinez, a 43-year-old Lakota woman, was 11 the first time she visited the town, accompanying her alcoholic mother, who came almost every day. She recalled sitting in the back seat of their car, watching her mother drink and witnessing brawls from out the window. “Whiteclay is a hole,” she said, standing in a prayer camp just inside the reservation that was constructed by Pulliam and others shortly after the liquor licenses were revoked. “It’s been based on liquid genocide for generations.” Martinez started drinking at 14, but sobered up 12 years ago when her mother died, in her early 50s, due to chronic liver damage. “The town killed her. But it wasn’t just alcohol. It was the historical trauma that happened to our nations, too.” History simmers to the top of many conversations here – from the systemic destruction and criminalisation of Lakota culture through federal laws in the late 19th century, to the 1890 massacre at Wounded Knee, in the reservation’s south, where up to 300 Lakota men, women and children were mowed down by US cavalrymen, their frozen bodies dumped in a mass grave days later. The cluster of at least four unsolved murders in the past two decades at Whiteclay, where no permanent police presence led to a de facto state of lawlessness, is also etched in people’s memories. Pulliam lost two uncles, Wallace Black Elk and Ron Hard Heart, whose body was found mutilated in a ditch just outside the town in 1999. “It was such a dangerous place,” he said looking at the site their bodies were recovered. “It was so violent and dirty. It was really hell on earth.” But today, the town is almost silent. Tumbleweed rolls across the dusty streets, the front doors to State Line Liquor, D&amp;S Pioneer Service and the Arrowhead Inn bolted shut, each behind reinforced iron gates. “I feel a sense of pride when I look at it now,” said Martinez. “Because I don’t see my relatives littered on the street like trash.” The lawyers representing the four store owners did not return requests for an interview. But Loren L Paul, a Nebraskan county commissioner who supported the owners and had voted to try to keep their businesses open, argued the issue was simply supply and demand. “It’s market forces,” said Paul at his home in the small city of Gordon. “I don’t think there’s racism involved. [Whiteclay] is there because there’s a need and somebody is going to supply that need.” * * * The calls came in at a frantic pace as Lt Jason Lone Hill struggled to understand just what sort of emergency he was speeding towards. The late shift is the loneliest and most dangerous patrol for the tribal police on the reservation. The department is already stretched beyond its limit. After a loss of grant money under the George W Bush administration, there are now just 32 officers in the entire department – 10 years ago, it was more than 100. That evening, just three officers were patrolling the entire western sector, an area of around one and a half thousand square miles – larger than the state of Rhode Island. The night before, Lone Hill, a Lakota man who has lived on the reservation his entire life, had been called out to a gang brawl in one of the higher-crime areas in the reservation’s centre. The homicide rate almost doubled here last year, from nine murders in 2015 to 17 in 2016. Police partially attribute the rise to a surge in methamphetamine abuse. But just as Whiteclay’s closure has brought hope and opportunity to people here, so has it intensified other problems. Bootlegging has surged. In every housing cluster, in every district, Lone Hill said, there were now people selling alcohol illegally. “They’re killing our people, over greed and money,” he said. Vodka has become the drink of choice, over the beers that were once on sale at Whiteclay. Local bootleggers now travel further afield, to the towns of Rushville and Chadron in Nebraska, about 30 miles from the south of the reservation, to buy gallons of cheap spirits, dilute them with water and sell a 500ml bottle for around $10 – about a 1,000% markup. This summer the police department reassigned its specialist drug taskforce of four officers to target bootleggers by running undercover stings. But the demand supersedes resources here, and the cops are fighting a losing battle. As Lone Hill pulled up to the small three-bed home in the Old Crazy Horse neighbourhood in the reservation’s south, following more than a dozen 911 calls, the scene was one of distressing familiarity. A man in his 30s lay prone on the floor outside. His brother was passed out in the doorway while a group of eight young children scampered around in the darkness. It was difficult to tell if the two men were alive or dead. “Hey! Wake up!” Lone Hill shouted. “Wake up! It’s the police.” Eventually both men stirred and Lone Hill was forced to place one in handcuffs and send him off to jail for detox. “Taking him to jail ain’t helping, because we’re going to be back tomorrow night. And the next night. It’s a revolving door. “Nowadays,” Lone Hill said, “nine out of ten people will be like that, in that condition, because it used to be beer, and now it’s vodka, and vodka gets in your system and messes you up a lot faster.” * * * Donald Trump’s fraught history with Native Americans continues to resonate here. In 2000, as the expanding Native American casino industry in upstate New York threatened his own gambling interests in New Jersey, the businessman took aim at the St Regis Mohawk tribe. Trump secretly spent $1m on local newspaper adverts that portrayed the tribe as organised criminals and cocaine pushers. Under a photograph of syringes and lines of powder ran the question: “Are these the new neighbors we want?” “It showed us what he really thinks of us,” said Eileen Janis, a community leader who runs the Oglala Lakota’s only suicide intervention program with her colleague Yvonne “Tiny” DeCory. Now in office, Trump threatens to decimate the small gains ushered in by the closure of Whiteclay. “We know a young mother who used to get together $5 and go up to Whiteclay and buy a big can of beer all the time. One of those big cans gets you drunk. But now she can’t do that. So now she spends her money on her kids, or buys food with it. That is progress,” said Janis. But Trump’s proposed 25% budget cuts to the food stamp programme (on which at least 49% of people here relied in 2009) would make many more children go hungry here, she said. The administration is also proposing a range of cuts to federal departments the tribe relies on for grant money attached to a range of public services including education, public health and policing. “It’s going to be bad,” Janis said. “And that’s for all of us.” Janis lost the federal health grant that paid her salary earlier in the year and is now essentially a full-time volunteer. She and DeCory work seven days a week, mentoring children and providing mental health outreach in the absence of specialist facilities in the reservation’s only hospital. They often accompany police to domestic disturbances and mental health emergencies. Janis, 56, recently bought a Taser as the intensity of their late-night callouts has grown. That afternoon, the pair headed deep into the reservation’s centre to a vigil for 22-year-old Tyler Dubray, a college student who had taken his own life four days earlier. It was the 11th suicide on the reservation since April. Dubray’s death took people here by surprise. The Lakota man, with bright green eyes and deep dimples, mentored younger children and taught them traditional weaving. His friends and family all referred to him as outwardly content. “He was full of life,” DeCory told the roughly 200 people clutching candles and lanterns on the grass outside the Dubray family’s small home, where complete darkness engulfed the surrounding empty expanse. “And you all should know that you loved him unconditionally. Know that you were good to him, and you have no regrets for the way you treated him.” * * * The tipi still stood on the entrance to Whiteclay days after Pulliam had built it up. The men had placed a sign next to it that fluttered in the wind and read: “Sober Indian, Dangerous Indian”. Olowan Martinez, optimistic the supreme court would keep the liquor stores closed, was among a minority of people who refused to worry about a new era of austerity. “He could cut whatever he wants. We already know who our oppressor is. That [government] is the oppressor. “This is our land, our territory, and we’ll be fine,” she said. “I wish Mother Earth would shake her back and we’d have to start all over. Only the strong will survive.” In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In the UK the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

Uber’s private equity backers knew there was little hope of getting the taxi service firm’s shares listed on a stock market while Kalanick was at the helm, annoying regulators and inflaming every dispute that crossed his desk. Khosrowshahi, fresh out of Expedia, would be the antidote to the co-founder’s aggression. It should be no surprise, then, that the new man has adopted a gentler tone in response to Transport for London’s decision last week not to renew Uber’s licence. “On behalf of everyone at Uber globally,” declared Khosrowshahi on Monday, “I apologise for the mistakes we’ve made.” What mistakes was he referring to? He didn’t say, which makes it impossible to tell which of TfL’s four complaints he regards as a fair cop and which (if any) he thinks are groundless. But he was clear that Uber will be appealing against the ban anyway. To many minds, this vague “apology” will be seen as a welcome first step in defusing the affair before Uber’s cars disappear from London’s roads. That is probably how the story will end, but it is hard to understand why Sadiq Khan, who backed TfL vigorously on Friday, already seems to be running towards compromise. The mayor welcomed the apology and said he had asked TfL to meet Khosrowshahi. Why? TfL’s charges against Uber are all serious, ranging from failures to report criminal offences to being less than transparent about the use of a “Greyball” software programme that may deceive regulators. If Khosrowshahi had addressed those points directly, and made specific binding commitments, there might a case for Khan to offer an olive branch. But Uber didn’t do that. Khan is in the strange position of complaining about Uber’s strong-arm PR tactics while seemingly taking some content-free warbling about “humility, integrity and passion” seriously. Bizarre. Bank needs to admit role in soaring debt The Bank of England has left it late to start worrying about surging levels of unsecured consumer debt, but there’s a whiff of panic in the air now. At the end of June, Threadneedle Street told lenders to start amassing £11.4bn of extra capital in the next 18 months to protect the financial system from the 10% rise in consumer lending over the past year. The following month Alex Brazier, the Bank’s director of financial stability, spoke about a “spiral of complacency” with lenders assuming low levels of default can continue forever. Now comes another a second intervention on capital within just three months. Lenders will have to find another £10bn on top to protect against the risk of £30bn of losses during a nasty recession. The net effect for consumers is that getting an unsecured loan, or extending a credit card facility, is likely to become harder or more expensive, or both. The Bank is at pains to point out that the rapid growth of consumer credit amounts to only “a pocket of risk” within “a benign overall domestic credit environment”. Well, maybe, but the Bank is also oddly reticent about acknowledging its own role in this build-up of debt. In cut interest rates to 0.25% in August last year and introduced a £100bn facility for banks called the Term Funding Scheme to ensure the cheaper money reached households and businesses. Those actions were designed to ease the economy over humps created by the vote for Brexit. Maybe the policy worked, in the sense that consumers kept on spending, but surely the moment to issue stark warnings about the long-term dangers of lax lending standards was when even-cheaper money was being pumped into the system. If there is a spiral of complacency, the Bank was part of it, say its critics. It’s a fair point. Who will pay the price of PFI? The PFI wheeze was always a Pretty Farcical Idea, as the old gag had it, and as any number of studies over the years have concluded. Try a sober Treasury select committee report from 2011: “The out-turn costs of construction and service provision are broadly similar between PFI and traditional procured projects, although in some areas PFI seems to perform more poorly.” So you can’t blame John McDonell for wondering whether past wrongs can be righted, even if it was always New Labour that was most obsessed by PFI. The shadow chancellor pledged to bring existing PFI contracts “back in-house”. If he’s serious, there is a simple way to proceed, as described in the same select committee report: “The most straightforward way of dealing with current PFI contracts is for the government to buy up the debt (and possibly also the equity) once the construction stage is over ... Although government debt levels would be higher the public finances would not be any less sustainable. This is because it would become more affordable to service the visible government debt rather than the hidden PFI debt.” It could be done, in other words. The critical political detail, however, is the price the government would pay. Saying, as Labour did, that “parliament will assess the appropriate level of compensation” is hopelessly vague. Without that detail, the policy is impossible to assess meaningfully. If the idea is to pay less than the market price, remember that not every owner of a PFI asset is an offshore hedge fund. Some are our pension funds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/sep/26/premier-league-tv-rights-simon-green-bt-silicon-valley","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T07:29:36Z","webTitle":"Premier League TV rights: Simon Green backs BT to fend off Silicon Valley threat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/26/premier-league-tv-rights-simon-green-bt-silicon-valley","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/sep/26/premier-league-tv-rights-simon-green-bt-silicon-valley","fields":{"headline":"Premier League TV rights: Simon Green backs BT to fend off Silicon Valley threat","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"If Simon Green is concerned about the prediction that Premier League TV rights are about to get billions of pounds more expensive then he is not showing it. The head of BT Sport is noticeably anxious but only because it is the broadcaster’s busiest live night in history. At its cavernous studios on an industrial park in east London, runners and producers buzz around as Gary Lineker records the opening sequence, pausing briefly to pose for a photograph for his Instagram feed. It is the first round of the Champions League with Chelsea, Manchester United and Celtic all at home and a crack team of pundits assembled. Frank Lampard and Rio Ferdinand are already in makeup with Steven Gerrard hurrying down from Liverpool slightly later because he has been coaching the club’s under-18 team. In the boardroom overlooking the main studio Green is already thinking ahead to the next Premier League broadcasting-rights battle. Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman of Manchester United, predicted last week that digital giants like Facebook, Amazon and Netflix could muscle in on the Sky and BT duopoly, forcing the price even further through the roof. The tender is expected before the end of the year and a heated auction will no doubt follow. Some analysts have estimated that Sky might have to pay a premium of up to 45% on the near £4.2bn it paid last time by the time the deal is completed, probably in February. That means a further £1.8bn, or £600m per season. For BT, which paid £960m over three years for 42 matches per season, it would amount to an extra £432m to fend off the Silicon Valley threat. But Green does not see the tech firms changing the broadcasting landscape drastically for the next auction, which covers the 2019‑22 period. “It’s hard to say how the sporting-rights market is going to play out with those brands,” he said. “The only one which has really dipped its toe into the water is Amazon, who bought the rights to the ATP tennis. What’s Amazon’s business model? Is it to sell tennis rackets on the back of showing it? Over a five- or 10-year span, I don’t see those brands competing in the sports-rights buying market in the way ourselves and other established broadcasters are.” Green has been at BT Sport since its inception four years ago. He is better placed than most to judge the potential for growth in relation to Sky Sports having joined the then fledgling broadcaster in the early 1990s and also spent two years at Fox Sports in LA. He remains confident BT can retain the same number of exclusive Premier League TV matches and possibly more. “It takes an awful long time to establish yourself as a sport broadcaster in this country,” he said. “We have a very-difficult-to-please public, more so than anywhere else in the world, when presented with change. With football the public genuinely believe deep down that it’s theirs. We’re picking up what they own on a Saturday evening and plonking it down in their sitting rooms. To do it exactly the way they want all the time is a very difficult ask.” Green claims one of his biggest challenges is persuading rival sets of supporters that there is no favouritism in the way it schedule matches, only what makes most sense from a business point of view. This season has seen viewing figures improve in large part, Green thinks, because Manchester United are playing well. “Manchester United are the biggest team in the UK with a UK audience,” he added. “Much as we enjoyed having Leicester in the Champions League last season, having Man U back does lift the competition as well as having Liverpool in it. We get accused on air sometimes of favouring United and get in trouble with City fans and Liverpool fans. Peoples’ rationality goes out of the window when we’re talking football. “It’s difficult sometimes to have a rational conversation with a Manchester City fan and a Manchester United fan in the same room, whether it be about who should be on TV or who’s got the best left-back. That’s why it’s such a great soap opera and I never want it to end.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/29/poppies-of-iraq-by-brigitte-findakly-paperback-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T10:00:22Z","webTitle":"Poppies of Iraq by Brigitte Findakly review – childhood memories of Mosul","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/29/poppies-of-iraq-by-brigitte-findakly-paperback-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/29/poppies-of-iraq-by-brigitte-findakly-paperback-review","fields":{"headline":"Poppies of Iraq by Brigitte Findakly review – childhood memories of Mosul","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The events of recent years make it hard to imagine Mosul without seeing a city shattered by war.

Marika Sherwood, a Jewish survivor of the Budapest ghetto, was due to give a talk in March about Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians, headlined: “You’re doing to the Palestinians what the Nazis did to me.” But after a visit by Mark Regev, the Israeli ambassador, and his civil affairs attaché, university officials banned organisers from using the “unduly provocative” title and set out a range of conditions before it could go ahead. Students had booked Sherwood to speak as part of Israeli Apartheid Week, a series of events organised by the university’s student committee of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign. The Israeli diplomats visited Manchester on 22 February and met the university’s head of student experience, Tim Westlake. Later that day in an email, Michael Freeman, the embassy’s counsellor for civil society affairs, wrote to Westlake and thanked him for discussing the “difficult issues that we face”, including the “offensively titled” Israeli Apartheid Week. Mentioning the title of Sherwood’s talk, Freeman said it breached the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism. He also made accusations of antisemitism against two speakers booked for a separate event, citing tweets and their refusal to condemn antisemitic behaviour. “Both of these events will to [sic] cause Jewish students to feel uncomfortable on campus and that they are being targeted and harassed for their identity as a people and connection to the Jewish state of Israel,” Freeman told Westlake. “I would be grateful if you could look into these events and take the appropriate action.” The correspondence emerged after the Information Commissioner’s Office forced Manchester to disclose to a student “all correspondence between the University of Manchester and the Israeli lobby” between 1 February and 3 March. The release included Freeman’s email. In that email, Freeman wrote: “We welcome debate and discussion and see it as an essential part of a healthy democracy and open society. In the case of these two particular events, we feel that this is not legitimate criticism but has rather crossed the line into hate speech.” The next day, a university official emailed Huda Ammori, the event’s organiser, with conditions. Academics chosen to chair the meetings were replaced by university appointees, publicity was limited to students and staff, and the organisers were told talks would be recorded. Ammori was told: “For ‘A Holocaust survivor’s story and the Balfour declaration’ the use of the title or subheading, ‘You’re doing to the Palestinians what the Nazis did to me’ is not to be permitted, because of its unduly provocative nature.” Ammori said: “In educational institutions there shouldn’t be any sort of lobbying from foreign governments. You couldn’t imagine them sitting down with the Saudi embassy for an event about what’s going on in Yemen.” The Sherwood event went ahead under a revised billing with the subtitle removed. She denied that the title of her talk could be characterised as antisemitic. “I was just speaking of my experience of what the Nazis were doing to me as a Jewish child,” she said. “I had to move away from where I was living, because Jews couldn’t live there. I couldn’t go to school. I would have died were it not for the Christians who baptised us and shared papers with us to save us. “I can’t say I’m a Palestinian, but my experiences as a child are not dissimilar to what Palestinian children are experiencing now.” A spokesman for the Israeli embassy said he did not recognise the meeting as lobbying, as meetings between embassies and universities were common. He noted that Freeman’s email welcomed debate and discussion. On Sherwood’s talk, he said: “Comparing Israel to the Nazi regime could reasonably be considered antisemitic, given the context, according to IHRA’s working definition of antisemitism, which is accepted by the British government, the Labour party, the NUS [National Union of Students] and most British universities.” Manchester University said a free speech code of practice applied to all campus events involving outside speakers and controversial topics, and that officials checked relevant laws, including the Equality Act 2010, before approving them. “In this case the university allowed the events to proceed in line with the requirements of the act and our commitment to principles of freedom of speech and expression,” its spokesperson said, without addressing the meeting with diplomats."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/25/tony-skelton-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T17:04:03Z","webTitle":"Tony Skelton obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/25/tony-skelton-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/25/tony-skelton-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Tony Skelton obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My father Tony Skelton, who has died aged 82, was a painter and decorator who lived and worked in Sheffield for his entire life. He was born in the city to Thomas, a rolling mill labourer in the steelworks, and his wife, Annie (nee Turner), who worked in a wartime munitions factory. Although Tony was registered as Thomas, at some early stage he decided that he preferred Tony, and so Tony it remained. He went to Shirecliffe secondary school, where he was a promising footballer and had trials with Doncaster Rovers. However, a broken leg put paid to any possibility of a career in that direction, and instead he moved into painting and decorating. As his reputation spread throughout Sheffield he took on a number of interesting jobs both in the city and further afield. My brother Richard and I worked with him for periods in the school holidays, during which I remember we decorated Haddon Hall, a country house in Derbyshire. Filming was taking place while we were there, but my father’s attempts to be discovered as a movie star went sadly unrewarded. We also decorated the ladies’ lavatories in the city’s Castle Fish Market, which was an education for a young lad. Tony was a fanatical Sheffield Wednesday supporter and remained a season ticket holder at Hillsborough until the age of 81. An incredibly welcoming and optimistic individual, he was never shy about giving his opinions on football tactics to anyone who might be interested, and would often share these in the supermarket when he would bump into Jack Charlton during his tenure as manager of Sheffield Wednesday. After a stroke in 2016 robbed Tony of his mobility and a degree of his cognitive ability, he moved into a care home, where he was extraordinarily popular with the staff and received visitors on a daily basis. A series of severe strokes this year worsened his condition.

The huge sale follows Ryanair’s recent PR catastrophe, in which the low-cost airline was forced to cancel 2,100 flights, affecting the travel plans of 315,000 customers. Despite Ryanair refunding or rerouting affected passengers, many have had their travel plans disrupted and may struggle to claim back lost expenses as a result. Under EU flight delay legislation, passengers who have their flight cancelled are entitled to receive a full refund or choose an alternative flight. This legislation also covers “out of pocket” expenses - direct costs incurred from the delay of a flight, such as the cost of staying at an airport hotel and any meals eaten while waiting for an alternative flight. Any passengers who receive less than 14 days notice of the cancellation can also claim compensation. However “consequential losses”, costs such as other flights, hotels that have already been paid for and other expenses such as excursions or events, are not covered under this legislation. Despite pressure from consumer rights groups, airlines are not obliged to pay for them, and they are not necessarily covered by travel insurance. Research by the advisory website Travel Insurance Explained found that although the majority of standard policies do not cover consequential losses, seven out of 10 British travellers assume their travel insurance covers the cost of rebooking a missed flight, as well as all connected travel and accommodation expenses. “The majority of people buy travel insurance by price,” said Fiona Macrae of Travel Insurance Explained. “Standard policies won’t cover any expenses like pre-paid hotels, car hire, event tickets. Even if you have a cancellation clause with a limit of thousands of pounds, it might only cover cancellation under certain circumstances, such as illness.” She added: “We’re saying travellers need to be looking for a policy that has a little bit of extra cover. When it comes to cancellations, the phrase to look out for is that they will cover you for any cause beyond your reasonable control.” According to Macrae, this could cost as little as £9 extra for a family policy, or “about as much as you’d spend on magazines in the airport”. Consumer rights group Which? has criticised Ryanair’s communication of compensation. It called on on the airline to promptly pay out-of-pocket expenses for those affected by rerouting as well as reasonable additional expenses. Which? has also flagged up the airline’s poor track record when dealing with compensation claims. In July, it analysed data from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and found that where passengers took a compensation complaint against Ryanair to the regulator, Ryanair was in the wrong in 77% of cases. The airline then failed to pay out in 19% of cases despite being ruled against. Alex Neill, Which? managing director of home products and services, said: “Ryanair’s approach to informing affected passengers about compensation falls woefully short. It is legally required to spell out compensation rules when a flight is cancelled and, in our view, has so far failed to do that, leaving passengers hunting around for information.” She added: “This is another blow for the thousands of passengers who have already had to endure huge inconvenience as a result of this fiasco. The airline must now automatically compensate eligible passengers without them having to go through the additional hassle of making a claim.” When it comes to claiming consequential losses, the Civil Aviation Authority said passengers may be able to claim - under the conditions provided for by the Montreal Convention - for damages arising from breach of a contract of carriage by air. It advises passengers to keep any receipts or other information in order to pursue such claims and to make their claim first to the airline. In addition, passengers should check their travel insurance policy or with their credit card company. According to Ryanair, by Sunday alternative routings or refunds had been processed for over 97% of affected customers and the remaining 3% had yet to contact the airline. The airline could be forced to pay out over €20m in refunds and compensation as a result of the blunder. Despite the scandal, it continues to aggresively market against other airlines, launching a one million seat sale this week, with flights to destinations across Europe, including Prague, Berlin, Mallorca and Barcelona for under £10 one-way. • This article was amended on 26 September 2017.

There has been a spate of thefts and attacks by moped and motorbike gangs recently, in which necklaces, jewellery and phones have been snatched. The policing minister, Nick Hurd, said the review was needed because officers needed to have “confidence to protect the public by pursuing offenders where it is safe to do so”. A forum this month on motorcycle-related crime heard there was a perception among the public and some officers that police would not pursue suspected offenders riding vehicles at high speeds. In particular, the forum, which included representatives of the police, motorcycle industry and government departments, heard concerns that officers would not pursue a rider who was not wearing a helmet. Police staff associations say high-speed pursuits have been abandoned because of concerns that officers are at risk of prosecution if a pursuit ends in a crash. Figures from the Independent Police Complaints Commission show 28 people died in police pursuits in 2016/17, compared with 13 in 2015/16. In 2014 an 18-year-old man, Henry Hicks, was killed after colliding with a vehicle while he was on a moped. He was being pursued by two unmarked police cars in Islington, north London. Hicks knew police were chasing him before the crash, an inquest found. The police have said that since then there have been strict conditions put on officers pursuing suspects on mopeds. This month a detective chief inspector, Mark Franklin, told the Croydon Advertiser: “After Henry Hicks, they [offenders] will speed off as fast as they can and then take their helmets off because they know we can’t chase them. “We have to phone the control room and say what kind of condition they are in. We have to say how many people there are and if they’re wearing helmets. You could say there’s two people, no helmets, and they will tell you to terminate it in case you injure them.” The Home Office said there was no ban on pursuits where the rider was helmetless, and the review would clarify when a pursuit was justified. Hurd said: “This government is determined to get ahead of and tackle emerging threats like motorcycle-related crimes, including those involving mopeds and scooters. People must be able to go about their daily lives without fear of harassment or attack and criminals must not think they can get away with a crime by riding or driving in a certain way or on a certain type of vehicle. “Police have made us aware of the concern among some officers over the legal position when pursuing suspected offenders, including those on mopeds and scooters. While it is clearly vital that we protect public safety and that officers are accountable for their actions, it is also important that skilled officers have the confidence to protect the public by pursuing offenders where it is safe to do so.” Tim Rogers, the lead on the issue for the Police Federation of England and Wales, welcomed the review. “Trained professionals are being judged by the same standards as a member of the public in any normal driving situation with no differentiation in law to recognise the professional training emergency response drivers undertake,” he said. • This article was amended on 27 September 2017.

So they took it off its hinges. “[We] were confronted immediately by a wall of garbage, decades upon decades of accumulated detritus,” says Sarah Krasnostein, author of The Trauma Cleaner. Dorothy’s impenetrable house was in a wealthy suburb, not far from a cafe that made raw almond milk. Krasnostein had arrived there with Sandra Pankhurst, the 63-year-old owner and operator of Specialised Trauma Cleaning Services. “The floor wasn’t the floor, it started three or four feet up the wall, and through her rooms was the solid glacial mass of garbage fused together.” In the four years Krasnostein spent writing and researching her book, she trailed Pankhurst to more than 20 grotesque and garbage-filled sites in suburban Melbourne. “People think ‘cleaning’ and that you need a bucket of water and a cloth,” Pankhurst told her as they stood together in the midst of Dorothy’s house. “We need crowbars, spades, rakes, a sledgehammer.” Pankhurst is portrayed as a remarkable woman: a goddess in white sneakers, marching through decrepit homes and commanding staff in hazmat suits on the correct chemicals for bodily fluids. Her genius lies in the kind and delicate way she speaks to her clients, bizarre characters hiding from the outside world in caves of filth. Originally an essay published online, Krasnostein’s playful yet heartfelt debut is one of the most arresting works of biography you will read in a long time. Guardian Australia spoke to the writer about shit stains, bed bugs, cleaning and compassion. Guardian Australia: What is a trauma cleaner? Sarah Krasnostein: A trauma cleaner cleans crime scenes. But what I didn’t know was that they also deal with many living clients. Sandra’s business involves going to the home of hoarders. She encounters both “wet squalor” – things that you would flush down a toilet – and “dry squalor”, garbage that has collected over time. How would you describe the smell of death? Once it hits you, it’s both intimate and alien at the same time. An awful, awful smell. At the first job I went on, a woman who was my age at the time, 35, had died of a heroin overdose; her body was discovered after two weeks. When you reduce a human to just carbon matter decaying over time, it’s profoundly disturbing. What sort of scenes were you going into? In Marilyn’s house, the foyer was densely covered by about 40 grocery bags, full of rotting food. There was fruit liquefying on her bed, where she slept. The bathroom was … she couldn’t always make it to the toilet. Marilyn was witty and well-read, but her world was falling in on her. She did have cancer, she was probably alcoholic. This was the physical manifestation of the pain and isolation in which she was living. In each of the jobs was the unsettling sense of pain and mental illness. There was only one job where I couldn’t make it inside. When Sandra opened the door, the woman’s house was completely dark, full of rabbits and dogs, and it was very hot. The smell – I started dry retching, and Sandra gave me shit about it for the remainder of the day. I had a very elaborate process for avoiding cross-contamination – Sandra’s terminology. In the boot of my own car I had a change of shoes, and a plastic bag to put my work shoes in before I went home. Preparing for work used to mean remembering to bring extra pens, but now it meant figuring out what clothes to wear – I had to be able to throw them out if they got particularly gross. Like one job, the toilet was continually flooded. We’re walking on carpet that had been penetrated by human faeces. And who is Sandra, who does this work every day? She goes into homes of people who have been broken and cleans through their pain. Sandra had an awful childhood. She was adopted through the Catholic church to a family in West Footscray, Melbourne. The father was an extremely violent alcoholic and both parents were physically and emotionally abusive. She was forced to live in a bungalow that her father built and she was excluded from the family home. They would deny her food and access to the bathroom. She was born male, and as a little child I believe she would have been very gentle and effeminate. As hardcore Catholics, the mother developed a hatred of her for being what she believed to be homosexual. So Sandra was stigmatised by the people who were meant to be including her. She met Linda. They were flatmates and got married when she was 19, and they had two boys in quick succession. Sandra started exploring the gay community in Melbourne and became aware of trans people. She realised that was what she had to do – staying was not an option. So she made a clean break and began dancing in clubs in St Kilda. That’s when she began doing street prostitution. Even though she was intelligent and had great social skills, she was locked out of professional fields because she chose to live full-time as a woman as she was transitioning, a process that took about eight years. After surgery, Sandra was attacked when working in a brothel – but then she pressed charges. It was remarkable [thing to do], to talk to the police as a transgender sex worker … She exercised such agency and resilience. And now she goes into homes of people who have been broken, and cleans through their pain. You write that Sandra imposes order on the world. What does this mean? Things that had happened to clients decades ago still had hands over their mouths. They were suffocating. These people are still at the mercy of these living, ravaging experiences. It’s the difference between a zoo and a museum. When Sandra talks to me about her trauma, it’s like seeing a tiger in a museum. It’s not going to come out and rip your face off. It’s static behind glass. How do we move forward and make what we can of this one life? It’s putting everything in its place, becoming more powerful than the things that hold us down. It’s what Sandra does physically – imposing order where she lives and works."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/27/women-have-the-right-to-know-about-injuries-of-vaginal-birth-beforehand","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T05:18:42Z","webTitle":"Women have the right to know about injuries of vaginal birth beforehand | Sascha Callaghan and Amy Corderoy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/27/women-have-the-right-to-know-about-injuries-of-vaginal-birth-beforehand","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/27/women-have-the-right-to-know-about-injuries-of-vaginal-birth-beforehand","fields":{"headline":"Women have the right to know about injuries of vaginal birth beforehand","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s not just the constant pain. After a while, you learn to adjust to that new normal. It’s the feeling that you weren’t warned; that you never gave your consent for the risks you were exposed to. That is the message coming out of the Senate inquiry into the use of vaginal mesh products to treat women who have vaginal prolapses. The submissions are heartbreaking. Many are handwritten, intimate portraits of lives interrupted by constant infections and pain, of relationships disrupted. One woman writes how she never had an orgasm again after her surgery. Another describes a procedure performed on her: “It was the most painful experience and I screamed very loud and was crying. [The doctor] scolded me and told me I had scared the patients in the waiting room”. Many say they were never warned of the risks of the mesh, never understood the treatment they were about to undertake. Despite the clear importance of these stories finally being heard, there is concern in some quarters that speaking out loud about injuries after a vaginal birth is a dangerous thing. In their submission to the senate enquiry, the Australian College of Midwives’ submission warns that coverage of the issue “has increased fear around childbirth”. “It is important that the issues surrounding the transvaginal mesh implants are separated from the issues surrounding vaginal birth,” they write. The truth is however, that these injuries and others, such as prolapse, scarring, incontinence, chronic pain, and fistula are all risks of vaginal birth – particularly where complications necessitate the use of instruments such as forceps. The risk of these complications increases with the age of the mother, her BMI, and the size of the baby relative to the mother’s pelvis. We expect women to be strong enough to run these risks when they give birth, but many clinicians and natural birth advocates seem to imagine that telling women about them beforehand might be too scary for them to handle. This rhetoric is now so entrenched in health services that official birth policy in NSW emphasises that only one type of birth – vaginal birth – is “normal”. The policy states that “all pregnant women [should be informed] about the benefits of normal birth”, but does not specify that patients must be informed of risks of vaginal births. Many hospitals now aggressively pursue vaginal births, encouraging vaginal births after caesarean section, discouraging the use of effective epidural pain relief and aiming to use alternative interventions such as forceps to ensure babies can be delivered vaginally. All without fully informing patients of the known risks associated with that approach. Clinicians now actively promote the role for forceps in childbirth, even if they do note in their academic research the “trade-offs between risks of maternal and neonatal trauma”. These “trade-offs” include a four-times greater risk of stress incontinence and an eight-times greater risk of prolapse compared to no use of instruments, and a five-times greater risk of facial injury for the baby (compared to the use of a vacuum device). Yet all this is in aid of producing a “normal” birth, so there is apparently no need to ensure informed consent on the woman’s part. This increasing trend towards paternalism in childbirth is not only disturbing, but it can also be unlawful. In a 2015 UK case, obstetrician Dina McLellan was found to have negligently harmed Nadine Montgomery and her baby because of a failure to inform Montgomery about a substantial risk that her large baby would become stuck in her pelvis during an attempt at vaginal birth. This was despite the fact that Montgomery, who had diabetes, had repeatedly asked about these risks and said she would have elected to have caesarean had she had been properly informed. The obstetrician gave evidence that she did not spend a lot of time, or indeed any time at all, discussing these risks with her patients. This is despite the fact that should a baby become trapped in the mother’s pelvis due to a complication known as shoulder dystocia, highly invasive manipulations are required to free the baby. In this case, this included pressing down on the mother’s pubis with clenched fists, while two midwives forced her legs back; pushing the baby’s head back up into the uterus, so as to be able to perform an emergency caesarean section, forceps, and an attempted symphysiotomy. This is a surgical procedure that involves breaking the pelvis to free the baby. Despite these known risks, Dr McLellan took the view that if such “small” risks were mentioned “most women will actually say, ‘I’d rather have a caesarean section’”. Dr McLellan felt this was undesirable because “it’s not in the maternal interests for women to have caesarean sections”. For this reason she did not discuss the risks with her patient. In this case, there were terrible outcomes for mother and baby. But even in the normal run of things, the law is designed to protect a patient’s right to autonomy – the freedom to decide what can be done to their bodies in a medical setting. Healthcare professionals must not only give patients enough information to get consent to a procedure, but enough to ensure that the patient’s right of autonomy, and control over their bodies, is protected. That includes giving information about the risks of having no procedure, as in the case of an attempt at vaginal birth, where known risk factors are present. Much important work was done by our feminist foremothers in fighting for women to have the right to make choices about their births, to take control of their labours with active, natural births if they want them, and to be free of unnecessary interventions. This shift has been welcomed by many women, and is in line with international trends. But we cannot lose sight of the fact that the goal of these shifts in practice has been to empower women, and in order to achieve that aim we cannot throw the baby out with the bathwater – so to speak – by deciding that all women have the same priorities and that it is acceptable to hinder informed decision-making in the cause of achieving those priorities. The fact is that in modern medical practice, we have long let go of keeping the “awful truth” from patients. We let patients decide what is best for them – by informing them of risks as well as benefits, and allowing women to choose which set of risks they are more comfortable taking. Two perfectly well informed, intelligent women may have totally differing opinions about the type of intervention they are comfortable with. One might feel that a vaginal birth is an experience they value highly, and that the surgery involved in a caesarean section (with its associated recovery time, potential for complications, and increasing risk with each additional pregnancy) is something they would like to avoid at almost any cost. Another women may feel her personal circumstances make vaginal delivery unappealing, and believe that if such a delivery needed forceps then it is a risk that she would not be willing to take. Many more will fall somewhere between these two views. Either way, the days of medical paternalism are over. Midwives and doctors must ensure women are fully informed, and their wishes known, before the labour, so that they can inform clinical decision-making during it. There is no easy way to give birth to a baby, and most first-time mothers are apprehensive about labour and aware that once it begins you simply cannot have full control over what happens next. Ensuring women are fully informed should not scare them off vaginal birth, but it will ensure that if something does go wrong they will not feel betrayed by the healthcare system itself.

Melbourne, of course, is the home of football exclaimed one VC. “No, Adelaide is,” crowed professor Mike Brooks the interim head at the University of Adelaide. It raised a laugh but, tellingly, broached little dissent. A year ago this week, the southern city sat in darkness as storms tore into electricity transmission lines. The upshot was an unprecedented state-wide blackout and discomfit. The lights had gone out in South Australia and it was deeply unnerving. “Generator capacity” and “outage” became political capital and damnation for months. Much is different today. Despite a hike in ticket prices to almost rival the power surge of last September, almost 54,000 fans packed the Adelaide Oval last Friday to herald the Crows’ first grand final in 19 years. They believe their team will prevail again this weekend. It would be crass to paint football as redemptive of the unemployment and governance woes that plague South Australia but we have been here before, says John Olsen, the Liberal premier when the Crows claimed a first premiership flag in 1997. “The state needs it, there is apprehension and real concerns,” Olsen says. “People place a lot on sport but it is about feeling good, you want to feel good about your family and workplace and environment. We are the butt of jokes interstate, we have slipped off their radar. When Tasmania does better than us in the economy you are not going to be taken seriously.” Aside from some huge recent investment in the city, the direction of the last few decades has been downhill, with blue collar manufacturing and cars no long a sustainable economy. The backdrop is that the public looks to sport. Nods to the Crows are dotted around the CBD: there is this week a yellow mobile van in Rundle Mall, the city’s main shopping thoroughfare. “CROWMania” is a double window affair and guernseys, glasses, key rings are its staple, while the Coles supermarket has dozens of red, yellow and blue balloons across its fresh food section. The splendid, 130-year-old Adelaide Arcade has perhaps 50 Crows flags hanging from its vast dome, a Christmas and Hogwarts fusion. Throngs of schoolchildren are in town for the International Astronautical Congress bringing with it Australia’s first ever astronaut, Andy Thomas, who underneath his spacesuit on his inaugural space trip, wore a shirt emblazoned with a cloth Adelaide Crows FC emblem, the Crow thus the first bird in space. Still, it would be wrong to say Adelaide is fizzing – yet. The searing electricity of Friday’s preliminary final win ebbed away pretty quickly and public displays of support are far from city-wide. But excitement in the city will bubble to the surface as the clock ticks down to Saturday’s decider, according to a former Crows board member, who says the club’s make-up is behind the muted atmosphere. Put simply, the Crows have a strong hinterland yet no pinpointed home and their followers come from across South Australia. A club for the community yes, but less so a community club. The Crows have been a-calling since 1991, when the club was born as an amalgamation of the best players from all SANFL sides, Port Adelaide excepted – but they offer an aspiration for all South Australians. You can gravitate there on different levels of emotion and that is its pull for its near 57,000 members. Olsen recalls the 1997 final vividly. “We had just won and [media magnate] Kerry Stokes turned and said to me, ‘really you must not underestimate the psychological impact this will have’. West Coast [with Stokes in charge] experienced this the year before. It became very clear the ’97 win was significant, it did a lot to restore state pride. “We’d just lost grand prix [to Melbourne in 1995] and the state bank collapse was still raw and lingering. It was as if we had had the confidence squeezed out of us, the win had a cascading effect across the whole state.” A private jet was rustled up to take the cup out to small towns and players were rostered on for a show-and-tell few could quite believe, yet there was better yet to come: the following year, national AFL, men’s and women’s basketball and netball titles all flooded into Adelaide. “Adelaide was known as tidal town, it means something for a state of one point something million people,” says then Adelaide 36ers (basketball) physio Mike Woodcock. “The VFL was seen as the home of football but the SANFL is almost as old. It’s good for a kid brother to stick it up his big brother.” Former managing director of the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra, Rainer Jozeps, will be keeping tabs on Saturday’s game with his Crows-mad sons from his inner Adelaide home via a high tech hook up. His 31-year-son Sam, a digital marketer for a co-working space, will be in Leipzig, Germany, with sibling Felix (33) much nearer to home, albeit in Sydney. “The AFL grand final means a great deal to me, especially as I’m currently working in Germany, it’s a day to share with my family back home in particular,” Sam says. “Two weeks ago I watched the Crows win the prelim final from Vilnius, Lithuania, and I’ll be glued to my laptop this Saturday at 6am [local time]. We’ll hook up with each another via WhatsApp to throw a few comments around and dissect the game. The game connects me with my family and my country. I love that”. Film maker Felix, who is about to showcase his new film at the Austen Film Festival, says his family all love AFL and the Crows. “I’ll be watching in an AFL-friendly pub in Sydney,” Felix says. “But the distance between us doesn’t matter, we’ll be together online, sharing every kick, mark, tackle and goal.” “Twenty years ago, as kids, we celebrated the Crows’ grand final wins with family and friends in Blackwood. Now we’ve all grown up and moved on but time will stand still for 100 minutes on Saturday. We’ll relive the excitement of the spectacle and feel grateful to live in Australia”. Eleven-year-old Chloe Woodcock attends Rose Park primary in Adelaide’s eastern suburbs where she is in year 6 and has been a Crows fan ever since year 1 or 2, she says. It was not up for debate. “I was influenced by my dad and elder brothers and I kind of had no choice in being a Crows fan,” she says, adding that ruckman Sam Jacobs is her favourite player, bar none. “He takes very good marks and is also the third person to have won three Showdown medals [Crows v Port]. He’s really good at rucking and will win the medal for the best player in the grand final. “I also like Rory Sloane but Sam is my favourite. He’s tough but I don’t really think about him getting injured, I try to think about good things.” That thinking extends to her prediction for Saturday, when she’ll be heading to South Australian chic surfing hangout Goolwa for the long weekend and will watch the final at a beachside BBQ. “I believe the Crows will win the final by six goals,” she says. And on the final whistle? “I’ll probably yell out.” She won’t be alone."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/27/labor-says-gas-companies-could-hold-turnbull-to-ransom","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T04:31:20Z","webTitle":"Government strikes deal with exporters to fill Australia's gas shortfall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/27/labor-says-gas-companies-could-hold-turnbull-to-ransom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/27/labor-says-gas-companies-could-hold-turnbull-to-ransom","fields":{"headline":"Government strikes deal with exporters to fill Australia's gas shortfall","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Major gas companies have agreed to fill the domestic shortfall in Australia’s gas market next year, saving the government from having to enact its export control trigger. In a move being hailed as a win by the government, Santos, Origin Energy and Shell have agreed to quarantine additional supply from the gas market following a meeting between the companies and the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, his deputy, Barnaby Joyce, and the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg. But the government did not confirm how many additional petajoules were being set aside, with Turnbull only saying another meeting had been scheduled for next Tuesday. “They have given us a guarantee that they will offer to the domestic market the gas that was identified as the expected demand shortfall by Aemo in 2018,” he said. “They stated that they will provide a similar guarantee over two years, that’s their intention, and will respond further in more detail on 2019 when we meet again next week. “They’ve stated that they will offer first, as a first priority, domestic customers any un-contracted gas in the future as a priority. “They have also given commitment to provide regular reporting to the ACCC on sales, offers by them to sell gas, and bids to buy gas, from customers they have declined.” The agreement means the government does not have to pull the trigger, which it began laying the groundwork for earlier this year but became complicated by the citizenship saga that engulfed parliament. Joyce became the minister responsible for pulling the trigger following the resignation of Matt Canavan from the cabinet. But given Joyce’s eligibility to sit in parliament also came under question, concerns were raised over the validity of him making the decision. The government said it was waiting for reports it had ordered into the gas situation to return, which occurred on Monday. Both the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Australian Energy Market Operator warned of a shortfall of up to three times higher than the government first anticipated, which led to the Wednesday’s meeting. Turnbull described the “very constructive meeting” as “a good outcome” but continued his attack on New South Wales and Victoria for their gas moratorium policies. “The failure of Victoria and NSW to unlock their onshore gas resources means more gas will have to be shipped south at greater expense,” he said. “It will mean that Victorians and residents of NSW will be paying more. “An extra $2 a gigajoule, which is around the cost of shipping gas from Queensland, is about 11% on the gas bill of a typical household in Melbourne. “The failure of the states of Victoria and NSW to get their gas resources, onshore gas resources, developed means residents of NSW and Victoria and businesses in those states are going to continue to pay more for gas than they otherwise would.” However, Labor warned on Wednesday the major gas companies could hold Turnbull to ransom if he accepted their offer to fill next year’s looming domestic gas shortfall at the right price. AGL Energy has also delivered another political headache for Turnbull, with its chairman telling shareholders on Wednesday that the sale of the Liddell power plant would be “challenging”, despite the Coalition’s wishes. The gas executives told Turnbull all the gas needed to avoid the projected shortfall next year could be made available for sale but Australia’s domestic buyers would have to sign contracts for the gas rather than hoping for cheaper prices. Ian Macfarlane, a former federal resources minister turned Queensland gas lobbyist, said Queensland’s gas exporters would offer to sell it back to Australia’s domestic market for the LNG netback price – under $10 per gigajoule – but domestic buyers had to guarantee they would buy it by signing contracts. “If people say they need gas, and gas is set aside for them, then they need to take it. That is a normal commercial arrangement,” Macfarlane told the ABC’s radio national program. “If a company says, ‘We need this many petajoules this year’ and Shell ... or Santos set that gas aside and don’t export it, and then the company doesn’t take it, obviously the exporters are left in the lurch. “It’s only fair to say if companies want to take gas, if they need gas, fair enough, sign up, sign the contract ... That way the export company knows that it’s not going to be left with a bundle of gas if a domestic customer may have inadvertently overestimated their own demand.” Tanya Plibersek, the acting opposition leader, warned earlier on Wednesday that Turnbull would be walking into the Sydney meeting with “little to no bargaining power” because he had not pulled the trigger on export controls to force the gas exporters to make more supply available locally. “What we mean by pulling the trigger is that the prime minister says to the companies ‘2018 is predicted to be the year of gas shortage, we need you to keep some of your gas at home”,” she said. “Without having that sort of bargaining power in this discussion the gas companies can just hold him to ransom. “I mean, what do they mean when they say they’ve got enough gas to supply the domestic market at the right price? “We’ve already seen wholesale energy prices double under this government. We still have a serious issue here in Australia.” On Wednesday, the outgoing AGL Energy chairman, Jerry Maycock, created another headache for Turnbull by telling shareholders that the sale of the Liddell coal-fired power station would be “challenging” and the costs of prolonging its life would be “substantial”. The Greens MP Adam Bandt has jumped on Maycock’s statement, saying it demonstrates beyond doubt that there is no reason for Liddell to stay open. “AGL’s plan shows that the only way Liddell is staying open is if Malcolm Turnbull uses public money to bankroll ageing technology,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/27/thousands-qatar-world-cup-workers-life-threatening-heat","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T02:59:22Z","webTitle":"Thousands of Qatar World Cup workers ‘subjected to life-threatening heat’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/27/thousands-qatar-world-cup-workers-life-threatening-heat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/27/thousands-qatar-world-cup-workers-life-threatening-heat","fields":{"headline":"Thousands of Qatar World Cup workers ‘subjected to life-threatening heat’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Many thousands of migrant workers on construction sites in Qatar, including those building stadiums for the 2022 World Cup, are being subjected to potentially life-threatening heat and humidity, according to new research on the extreme summer conditions in the Gulf. Hundreds of workers are dying every year, the campaign group Human Rights Watch (HRW) has said in a strong statement, but they claim that the Qatar authorities have refused to make necessary information public or adequately investigate the deaths, which could be caused by labouring in the region’s fierce climate. HRW argues that millions of workers are in jeopardy, including those in the other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries – Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – because statutory work breaks imposed during summer midday hours do not protect them sufficiently. An analysis of the weather in Doha last summer has also shown that workers on World Cup construction projects were in danger, despite the more advanced system used by the tournament organiser, Humidex, which measures safety levels of heat and humidity. “Enforcing appropriate restrictions on outdoor work and regularly investigating and publicising information about worker deaths is essential to protect the health and lives of construction workers in Qatar,” Sarah Leah Whitson, HRW’s Middle East director, said. “Limiting work hours to safe temperatures, not set by a clock or calendar, is well within the capacity of the Qatari government and will help protect hundreds of thousands of workers.” In 2012, the Qatari government revealed 520 people from Bangladesh, India and Nepal – whose citizens travel in their hundreds of thousands to do construction work in the Gulf – had died. Of these, 385, or almost three-quarters, had died “from causes that the authorities neither explained nor investigated”, HRW said. Last year the Qatari government told HRW that 35 workers died, “mostly from falls, presumably at construction sites”, but this did not take into account hundreds more people who died from heart attacks and other “natural causes”, patchily reported by their countries’ embassies and unexplained by the authorities. The “Supreme Committee” organising the 2022 World Cup, which Fifa originally voted in 2010 could be played in the summer but has since been moved to winter, is striving to enact higher welfare standards than those generally applied for the two million migrant workers in Qatar. It has disclosed that 10 workers on World Cup projects died between October 2015 and July this year, classifying eight of these, three of them men in their 20s, as “non-work related” because they resulted from cardiac arrest or respiratory failure. HRW argues that these classifications are meaningless, effectively only a statement that the person has died because their heart and breathing stopped. HRW said in its statement that such descriptions “obscure the underlying cause of deaths and make it impossible to determine whether [the workers’ deaths] may be related to working conditions, such as heat stress.” One World Cup construction worker who died, Jaleshwar Prasad, 48, was stated by the Supreme Committee to have suffered cardiac arrest, with the hospital reporting that “work duties were not a contributory factor”. The temperature in Qatar the day before Prasad died, 26 April 2016, peaked at 39C, HRW said. Nicholas McGeehan, who carried out the research for HRW, accused the Qatari government and the Supreme Committee of a “wilful abdication of responsibility” for the health and safety of workers. “Their heat protection system is inappropriate and data shows that its enforcement is seriously deficient,” McGeehan said. “That means they are putting stadium workers’ lives at risk.” Outdoor workers generally in Qatar must not be made to work between 11.30am and 3pm from 15 June to 31 August, according to a government decree issued in 2007. HRW describes that measure, which it said is broadly reproduced by the other GCC countries, as “rudimentary” because it does not relate breaks to the actual working conditions outside those hours. Analysis of the UK Meteorological Office climate record for Doha last year, seen by the Guardian, showed that according to the Humidex measure, it was not safe for an acclimatised person to do even moderately strenuous work outside, for 1,176 hours, including night time. The statutory government break added up to only 273 hours last summer, while the Supreme Committee, using the Humidex system, said that it imposed only an additional 150 hours of breaks to that government total. HRW has called on the Qatari and other Gulf country authorities, including the Supreme Committee, to use a different heat stress measure, the wet bulb global temperature (WBGT), which also takes sunlight into account, to avoid “potentially fatal heat-related illnesses.” The extreme climate in the Gulf, measured against the WBGT and the Humidex system, makes working at almost any time of day or night in July, August and the first half of September dangerous, McGeehan said. Approximately two million immigrants do the overwhelming bulk of manual work in Qatar, where the indigenous population, the world’s wealthiest on average due to the country’s vast reserves of natural gas, numbers only around 300,000. Approximately 800,000 men from the poorer south Asian countries work on the country’s huge construction projects, including 12,000, expected to rise to 35,000, building the World Cup stadiums. During the hot months, migrant workers are frequently the only people seen spending any extended time outside the country’s air-conditioned buildings and vehicles. The HRW statement criticises the Qatari government for failing to implement the recommendations of a 2014 report by the law firm DLA Piper, which the government itself commissioned. The report followed an international outcry over the number of workers dying in Qatar just as the massive new infrastructure programme was being commissioned. It noted that the number of deaths in Qatar attributed to cardiac arrest was “seemingly high” and called for transparent publication and investigation, including a legal reform to permit postmortem examinations in cases of sudden deaths. That recommendation has also not been implemented and legal constraints continue. HRW argues that this has prevented inquiries being conducted into how workers are dying and adequate measures being put in place to protect their health and safety. “We need data on deaths, new laws on heat protection and immediate investigations, otherwise the death toll will continue to rise,” McGeehan said. The Supreme Committee sent the Guardian a detailed explanation of how its breaks system works using the Humidex measure, and of the restrictions on postmortems in Qatar, but has not yet responded to the criticisms. A spokesman for the Qatari government said it is committed to labour reforms, and confirmed that it did make public last year deaths and injuries that were “work-related”. “The government investigates all migrant worker deaths in Qatar and coordinates with the embassies of labour-sending countries to repatriate the deceased,” the spokesman said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/26/twitter-increases-character-limit-trump-north-korea","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T22:28:10Z","webTitle":"Twice as much Trump?

Twitter doubles its character limit on tweets","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Twitter has doubled the character limit on tweets to allow its users to convey more meaning or emotion – or, in the case of Donald Trump, more elaborate war threats to North Korea. “This is a small change, but a big move for us. 140 was an arbitrary choice based on the 160-character SMS limit,” said chief executive Jack Dorsey, announcing the update on Tuesday. The decision was motivated by research carried out by the social network that showed you can convey double the amount of information per character in languages like Japanese, Korean and Chinese than you can in languages like English, Spanish, Portuguese or French. “Our research shows us that the character limit is a major cause of frustration for people Tweeting in English, but it is not for those Tweeting in Japanese,” said Twitter product manager Aliza Rosen in a blogpost. The team found that only 0.4% of tweets sent in Japanese hit the 140-character limit, while a much higher percentage of tweets in English (9%) hit the limit. “When people don’t have to cram their thoughts into 140 characters and actually have some to spare we see more people tweeting – which is awesome,” Rosen added. She acknowledged that some people have an “emotional attachment” to 140 characters – “we felt it, too” – but that when the team tried it they “fell in love with this new, still brief, constraint”. Twitter is testing the new feature with a small subset of its 328 million users before deciding whether to launch it to everyone. The announcement polarized Twitter users, with some arguing that the company should have prioritized an editing tool or a clampdown on white nationalists using the platform. For others the focus was on Donald Trump who recently posted a tweet that North Korea has interpreted as a “clear declaration of war”. In response to a speech by North Korea’s Ri Yong-ho at the United Nations on Sunday, Trump wrote that if the foreign minister “echoed” the thoughts of Kim Jong-un, the two men “won’t be around for much longer”. It was the latest in a series of hostile statements between the two countries. Twitter’s terms of service forbid making violent threats, but the company refused to take the tweet down, arguing that Trump’s statement was “newsworthy” and in the public interest. It is not yet clear whether Trump is among the test group of users to have access to the additional characters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/27/bushfires-hit-nsw-and-queensland-as-spring-heat-threatens-record","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T22:29:19Z","webTitle":"Bushfires hit NSW and Queensland as spring heat threatens record","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/27/bushfires-hit-nsw-and-queensland-as-spring-heat-threatens-record","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/27/bushfires-hit-nsw-and-queensland-as-spring-heat-threatens-record","fields":{"headline":"Bushfires hit NSW and Queensland as spring heat threatens record","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Total fire bans remain in place in the far western district of New South Wales and eastern and south-eastern Queensland, with hot, dry conditions causing grass and bushfires throughout the states. Forecasters say the heatwave could rival the record for Australia’s hottest spring day. The mercury in Birdsville, western Queensland, is forecast to peak at 43C, just shy of Australia’s spring record of 43.1C set in Roebuck, outside Broome in Western Australia, in 2003, also on 27 September. Brisbane could experience a record for the city on Thursday. NSW rural fire crews contended with more than 100 blazes across the state on Tuesday, including in the Royal national park. The NSW Rural Fire Service said that as of 7.30am Wednesday morning, there were still 110 active fires, 35 of them not yet contained. Residents living in Waterfall and Campbelltown could expect to experience smoke, the fire service said. A total fire ban is in place for the far western fire area, including the Bourke, Brewarrina, Broken Hill, Central Darling and Cobar areas. In some areas of the far west of NSW, temperatures will exceed 40C, average wind speeds may reach 50km/h and the relative humidity will hover around 5%. A forecaster, Rob Taggart, said there was a trough approaching from the south-west with strong and hot winds ahead of it. “Those winds are dragging a really hot air mass from central northern Australia,” he said. “That’s bringing really hot conditions from out near the Northern Territory into the north-west of NSW.” The fire danger level was rated as severe for the far western region and very high for the upper central west plains, north western and northern slopes districts. In Queensland smoke will affect residents living in Birtinya on the Sunshine Coast. On Wednesday morning Queensland Fire and Emergency Services urged residents of the area to close windows and doors and, if suffering from respiratory conditions, to keep medications close by. Fire bans remain in place in a number of local government areas stretching from the Gold Coast to Ipswich, the Lockyer Valley, Brisbane, the Sunshine Coast, Noosa, Gympie and South Burnett."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/27/football-transfer-rumours-real-madrid-swap-deal-dele-alli","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T07:33:51Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Real Madrid planning swap deal for Dele Alli?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/27/football-transfer-rumours-real-madrid-swap-deal-dele-alli","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/27/football-transfer-rumours-real-madrid-swap-deal-dele-alli","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Real Madrid planning swap deal for Dele Alli?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Mill is only one of an assortment of hacks weeping salt tears at the news that Diego Costa’s £57m move to Atlético Madrid is finally done, bringing the curtain down on one of the great interminable transfer sagas of our age. Chelsea will look to swiftly move on from Costa’s departure by tying Eden Hazard to an eye-watering £300,000-per-week deal. Should their long-term target stay at Stamford Bridge, Real Madrid suits will hop on the London Overground to Tottenham and try to prise Dele Alli away with a swap deal involving fringe player Mateo Kovacic and, presumably, several bags of cash. Real Madrid also like the cut of US tyro Christian Pulisic’s jib – whatever Alexi Lalas may say – and have the Dortmund winger next on their wish-list. Staying with Europe’s bright young things, Monaco midfielder Youri Tielemans has explained he didn’t fancy a move to Arsenal because of concerns about game time. “I had to be honest with myself and take a look at the midfielders Arsenal have got,” Tielemans said, as Francis Coquelin and Granit Xhaka ran directly into each other behind him. Arsenal are tracking another wonderkid – MK Dons’ 16-year-old striker Dylan Asonganyi, who is also wanted by Manchester United. Jürgen Klopp has run the rule over his jet-heeled, profligate Liverpool charges and decided what he needs is a new pacy winger, in the form of Spartak Moscow’s Quincy Promes. The Holland international was injured for the 1-1 draw on Tuesday, but Klopp still waxed lyrical about him in his press conference. “He has speed, he’s good in one v one situations and all that stuff,” Klopp cooed. With those attributes, a cool £50m should do it. Not every Premier League manager can daydream about making it rain in January. Slaven Bilic has been on the brink at West Ham for so long, he practically is the brink – but should his reign come to an end this weekend, Huddersfield’s David Wagner and former Dortmund manager Thomas Tuchel are top of the list to pace the London Stadium’s two-mile technical area. Bayern Munich are keen on Lyon’s Willem Geubbels, who made his Ligue 1 debut this weekend despite being born in 2001. That’s made the Mill feel even older than usual, but there are a few 30-somethings still in demand, including Edinson Cavani and Antonio Candreva, wanted to beef up Chelsea’s squad in January. Then there’s Atlético Madrid striker Kevin Gameiro, who’s the latest inconsistent striker to be linked with Everton. Finally, with Christian Benteke out injured and not that good even when he wasn’t, Roy Hodgson hopes to solve Crystal Palace’s goalscoring woes with a move for – and you’ll like this – free agent Rickie Lambert."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/26/man-who-thought-he-had-lung-cancer-finds-lump-was-a-toy-traffic-cone","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T21:03:43Z","webTitle":"'Cancer patient' finds lump was toy traffic cone inhaled in 1977","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/26/man-who-thought-he-had-lung-cancer-finds-lump-was-a-toy-traffic-cone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/26/man-who-thought-he-had-lung-cancer-finds-lump-was-a-toy-traffic-cone","fields":{"headline":"'Cancer patient' finds lump was toy traffic cone inhaled in 1977","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A toy traffic cone has been found in the lung of a man 40 years after he inhaled it. It was originally thought that the unnamed 47-year-old man from Preston might have cancer. He was referred to a respiratory clinic after complaining of coughing up yellow mucus and feeling unwell for over a year. Medics initially thought the patient, who had also recently suffered pneumonia and had been a long-term smoker, had a tumour after an x-ray showed a mass in a lung. However during a bronchoscopy, which was carried out to help aid diagnosis, they realised it was a “long-lost Playmobil traffic cone” the patient had received on his seventh birthday. The miniature plastic cone, about 1cm in length, was removed with biopsy forceps. Doctors writing in BMJ Case Reports said: “Following the procedure, the patient reported that he regularly played with and even swallowed pieces of Playmobil during his childhood. “He recalled being given this Playmobil set for his seventh birthday and believes he aspirated the toy traffic cone soon after.” While it is a common occurrence for children to accidentally inhale small objects, “a case in which the onset of symptoms occurs so long after initial aspiration is unheard of”. The doctors said that to their knowledge, it was the first reported case of a tracheobronchial foreign body that was overlooked for 40 years. “This may be because aspiration occurred at such a young age that the patient’s airway was able to remodel and adapt to the presence of this foreign body,” the report said. They added that during childhood, the object may have been absorbed into the lining of the lung, which developed around it. Four months after the removal of the tiny traffic cone, the patient’s cough had nearly cleared and his other symptoms had markedly improved. The medics said: “On a positive note, his symptoms improved markedly and he finally found his long-lost Playmobil traffic cone in the very last place he would look.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/26/the-guardian-view-on-macrons-europe-speech-a-bold-vision","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T18:45:24Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Macron’s Europe speech: a bold vision | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/26/the-guardian-view-on-macrons-europe-speech-a-bold-vision","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/26/the-guardian-view-on-macrons-europe-speech-a-bold-vision","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Macron’s Europe speech: a bold vision","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The speech Emmanuel Macron delivered on Tuesday about the future of Europe could easily have been anticipated as an exercise in wishful thinking, or just another attempt to boost EU morale. Speaking only two days after the German election had rattled nerves with a far-right surge, the French president was well aware that his words – and especially the way he would lay out his plans for deeper eurozone integration – would be scrutinised, at a time when Angela Merkel’s prospective coalition partners wouldn’t all necessarily be keen to endorse them. For all its potential pitfalls, this was a welcome, forward-looking speech for the continent. The Brexit vote, Donald Trump, migration and the rise of populism have delivered blows to the EU. Even if the club’s economic prospects seem to be improving, its fragility remains real. Europe’s neighbourhood, conflicts in the Middle East, Vladimir Putin’s Russia, and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Turkey are all sources of concern. Mr Macron is not the first to try to instil more confidence in the EU’s prospects after the hazardous years the club has just experienced. This month, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the EU commission, tried to strike an upbeat tone, saying the EU could now “catch the wind in its sails”. Days later, struggling with her own Brexit quandary, Theresa May spoke in Florence of a deep partnership between the EU and Britain after its departure, with security cooperation described as central. In this European autumn of speeches, it remains to be seen whether words can be matched by realities. Eurosceptics will sneer at some of the flowing rhetoric, but Mr Macron can hardly be faulted for trying to set a vision for the continent when so many uncertainties remain. Now is the time, the French president said, for the EU to be rebooted as a project harnessing “genuine sovereignty, unity and democracy”. He listed priorities: security cooperation, defence (the creation of a “European rapid response force” by 2020), a common asylum policy, a digital union, education (the creation of “European universities”), and the environment (the introduction of a “European carbon tax”). He called for pan-European lists to be set up for the 2019 European parliament election – implying the emergence of pan-European parties – and wants “democratic conventions” to be organised across the continent next year, giving citizens a more direct say on what Europe should become. This was a speech seeking to reinvigorate a European spirit, of the sort the founding fathers created after the devastation of the wars of the 20th century. Europe would increasingly be multi-speed, Macron said, with groups of member states moving forward on some projects unimpeded by the refusal – or lack of readiness – of others to join them. Deeper eurozone integration was mentioned, but cautiously, no doubt keeping in mind that difficult coalition talks lie ahead in Germany. Mr Macron said he was confident that Mrs Merkel would demonstrate the same “European commitment”, “audacity” and “sense of history”. Mr Macron no doubt wants to hoist his country into Europe’s driving seat, alongside Germany. Much is at stake for him, as he undergoes difficult economic reforms in his own country. Some of what he has said may remain a wishlist, but the impetus he’s trying to create is laudable. It was telling that Brexit was only briefly mentioned (as “ongoing discussions that do not define the future of Europe”). But an important message was delivered all the same: as Europe transforms, deepens its integration and envisages further enlargements (the Balkans), Britain will, “if it so wishes”, one day “again find the place that belongs to it”, Mr Macron suggested. Speeches do matter. They can infuse energy, rally support, set goals, and they help understand challenges in a way that makes it easier to confront them. Mr Macron’s message needs to be heeded: Europe needs more, not fewer, ambitions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/27/larissa-waters-may-return-to-senate-regardless-of-high-court-outcome","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T02:41:10Z","webTitle":"Larissa Waters may return to Senate regardless of high court outcome","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/27/larissa-waters-may-return-to-senate-regardless-of-high-court-outcome","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/27/larissa-waters-may-return-to-senate-regardless-of-high-court-outcome","fields":{"headline":"Larissa Waters may return to Senate regardless of high court outcome","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Greens member Larissa Waters may find her way back to the Senate – but not necessarily because the attorney general, George Brandis, is arguing she should still be there. The popular former senator is expected to announce her plans, after speaking with the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, following Brandis’s inclusion of her in his argument to keep three government MPs in their jobs – that not being aware of dual citizenship is not a breach of the constitution. But the Greens maintain the legal advice which led to Waters resignation in July, after her colleague Scott Ludlam’s discovery of New Zealand citizenship prompted the Canadian-born Queenslander to check her own status, was solid. If Waters returns to the Senate, the party believes it will be because the Queensland members will it, not Brandis. “The key thing from my perspective is that I have renounced and am ready and willing to return to the job when the Queensland party wills it,” she told Guardian Australia on Wednesday morning. Discussions have been occurring within the Queensland branch over the future of its state Senate spot, with Andrew Bartlett, the number two on the ticket and beneficiary of any recount, saying it was a work in progress. “The Queensland Greens are focused on the state election, we can’t control what the high court does,” he said. “But if it decides on a recount, than I would take on that seat until next year at least and see what happens after that.” Di Natale maintains his party was the only one involved in the section 44 saga which showed integrity. “Although our dual citizenship laws are a relic of the past, the law is very clear that dual citizens are ineligible to stand and that ignorance is no defence. Only the Greens have acted with integrity throughout this process because we believe that for people to have faith in democracy, people within the system need to act with integrity,” he said. “If the high court decide to overturn decades of precedent and change the interpretation of section 44 of the constitution so that she was eligible for election despite being a dual national, we would welcome back Larissa Waters return to parliament with open arms.” In his submission to the high court, released on Tuesday afternoon, Brandis argued Barnaby Joyce, Fiona Nash and Matt Canavan, who all received citizenship by descent from their foreign-born parent, had not voluntarily obtained dual citizenship. Waters and Nick Xenophon, who was referred to the court after discovering he was a British overseas citizen through his Cypriot-born father, have been included under Brandis’s argument. Malcolm Roberts and Ludlam have been excluded, with Brandis claiming they don’t meet the test, arguing they knew about their dual citizenship conflict upon nominating. “A person who becomes aware that he or she is a foreign citizen, or who becomes aware [ie subjectively appreciates] that there is a considerable, serious or sizeable prospect that he or she has that status, voluntarily retains that status unless he or she takes all reasonable steps to renounce it within a reasonable time of becoming so aware. “Alternatively, where a person has no knowledge that they are, or ever were, a foreign citizen, the requirement to take ‘all reasonable steps’ to renounce that foreign citizenship does not require the person to take any steps. Taking no steps is reasonable in these circumstances,” Brandis said. In an op-ed published in the Australian Financial Review last month, constitutional expert Anne Twomey argued it was “doubtful the high court would accept that ignorance of dual citizenship is enough to avoid disqualification”. “While it is certainly arguable that the purpose of the provision is to avoid conflicting allegiance and one cannot have a conflict if one is not aware of having dual citizenship, this would appear to reward those who put their head in the sand and neglected to check their citizenship status before nominating,” Twomey wrote. “The media investigations into the citizenship status of members of parliament have revealed some did make the effort to find out they had citizenship by descent and took the required steps to renounce it, while others simply failed to do so. “It is therefore a weak argument that it is unreasonable to expect a candidate to anticipate and deal with the possibility of dual citizenship, when many others in equivalent circumstances have dealt with it effectively. “The problem here is really one concerning the rigour of party nomination procedures, rather than a constitutional problem.” In his August National Press Club address, Professor George Williams argued a similar point. “It is hard to see why the high court would excuse a person in these circumstances,” he said. “Ignorance is not a plausible explanation when citizenship by descent is so common, and the barest inquiry would have identified the problem. “Joyce’s case, and those of the Greens members, speak less of a problem with the constitution and more of complacency and inadequate party vetting processes.” The high court is scheduled to hear the cases next month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/27/aduts-triumph-the-australian-refugee-taking-on-the-fashion-world","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T04:13:31Z","webTitle":"Adut's triumph: the Australian refugee taking on the fashion world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/27/aduts-triumph-the-australian-refugee-taking-on-the-fashion-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/27/aduts-triumph-the-australian-refugee-taking-on-the-fashion-world","fields":{"headline":"Adut's triumph: the Australian refugee taking on the fashion world","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Adut Akech was packing her bags when we spoke on Friday. She’d finished high school just the day before, and that night the 17-year-old from Adelaide would be flying to France to take part in the Saint Laurent show, which marked the start of this year’s Paris fashion week. On Wednesday morning shots of her marching down the runway flew across fashionistas’ social media accounts; wearing a dramatic black-and-white top, short shorts and furry boots, hers was the final outfit in the much-applauded show. Akech has arrived. It’s a remarkable moment for any teenager – and even more so for the model now known by the moniker Adut, who was born in war-torn South Sudan and spent her early years in the Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya before arriving in Australia as a seven-year-old. On the phone, she sounds giddy with her newfound freedom, admitting it hasn’t quite sunken yet in that she has finished high school and is about to become a full-time model. In fact, she’s something of a Saint Laurent veteran. She made her international catwalk debut last September and has walked exclusively for the fashion house for the last two seasons. This year she’ll be doing the full schedule – and if Tuesday night’s show is anything to go by, she’ll be busy. It’s a strong start for Akech, who has been photographed for ID magazine, 10 magazine and Vogue Australia in the past year. She’s also featured in the much anticipated all-black Pirelli calendar for 2018, shot by Tim Walker, styled by the incoming Vogue UK editor Edward Enniful, and starring Naomi Campbell, Diddy and Whoopi Goldberg. Although the lineup is dazzling, the person Akech was most excited to meet was the actor Lupita Ngong’o, one of her role models, alongside Campbell and Alek Wek. It sounds as though Ngong’o may take her under her wing. “She told me to get in touch with her when I go down to New York, so I’m gonna do that,” says Akech, excitement creeping into her voice. “She said if I ever need any help or I need anything when I get to New York, just to get in touch with her.” And so this year, after the whirl of Paris fashion week, she won’t head home to Australia. “I’ll probably come back in the next two months to visit my family but yeah, I might be in Paris for a couple of weeks and then probably head down to New York,” she says. For a 17-year-old, Akech is well and truly a seasoned traveller. She doesn’t remember Sudan or the refugee camp but does recall the family settling in Nairobi before being transferred to Australia. She desperately wanted to attend the local school but it was too expensive for her single mother. “There were times when I’d walk to my cousin’s school to take her lunch there and I would just be at the gate, looking at all the kids playing in the playground and it kind of made me sad. I wished that was me.” School was what she was most excited about when the family found out they would be moving to Australia. “The free education and having the choice to actually go to school,” she said. “Back then I didn’t have a choice.” The family left Kenya with nothing more than a few clothes, and it was an exciting but nerve-wracking time for the six-year-old Akech. She was curious about who she would meet. “Back in Kenya, it was rare to see any white people, and I was like, ‘Wow what is it going to be like, being in this country?’ I’d heard that there were a lot of white people but we weren’t used to seeing white people so that was one of the things that was always on my mind.” She hesitates when I ask if landing in Adelaide was a culture shock. “It was different, it was something different,” she says cautiously, “but I was really looking forward to everything.” They settled into the community quickly, and for the most part, the family felt welcome. “Everybody has [discrimination], when you go to school and stuff, because you don’t know how to speak English that well. I had a few kids laugh at me but it’s like, we all didn’t really know how to speak English so that’s why we went to an English school.” Akech wanted to fit in as quickly as possible: “I just worked hard, I was like, I’m going to do the work that I get given and graduate from English school, so I can actually go to a normal school like a normal person.” But her world hasn’t been completely untainted by racism. Earlier this year Akech was picked to take part in the David Jones spring/summer campaign, and as the face of the retailer’s beauty book. It’s a significant milestone in a model’s career and her wide, smiling face is featured on billboards across Australia’s capital cities. But a Gold Coast woman took exception to her casting, complaining via David Jones’ Facebook account that the model didn’t represent “the general population of Australia”. Elizabeth Ballard wrote: “How on earth am I expected to relate to this cover? I can’t wear any of her make-up, I don’t know ANYONE who looks like her … she could have been used on the back page … You people have really missed the mark here, and I’m pissed off and sick of big companys [sic] going for the minority feel good. Please think about your shoppers next time.” David Jones came under fire when one of their social media moderators responded to the comment with: “We are so sorry you feel this way. We have passed your feedback on to our Marketing Department for their information and consideration,” before the post was deleted. Akech didn’t say much at the time. That was deliberate. “I really took the time to think about it – am I going to overreact, or am I just not going to let this thing get to me? I chose not to let it get to me because that was the first time I had a stupid racist comment made about me.” She was celebrating the fact that she had made the cover, and didn’t want anything to distract from that. “My thing wasn’t so much about the lady’s comment because everyone is entitled to their opinion – she’s not happy about it, it is what it is, it’s her opinion, there’s nothing she can do about it. It was more about the David Jones response. “But I thought about it in the end, I’m like, I’m pretty sure David Jones choosing me was not a mistake, and just because one person felt the need to apologise and this is probably all interpreted in the way that it did get interpreted, that’s probably not the way it was meant to be.” The Australian model Duckie Thot, also a rising star, has spoken out about the lack of diversity in the Australian fashion industry. Adut agrees, but thinks things are getting better. “There’s always room for improvement. I feel like they could do better [and] use a range of different girls. You are starting to see dark-skinned girls and Asian girls and things like that, so that really makes me happy.” Akech has big ambitions for her modelling career – “I would love to get Victoria’s Secret” – but is also thinking about her life after fashion. She wants to study business and entrepreneurship, and hopes to set up a foundation to help with poverty and homelessness. She recalls a stay in Sydney, just before she returned to Adelaide, when she cooked up her remaining food and distributed it to the homeless people she saw camped out across the city. Akech says she feels connected to the homeless community because of her own background. “My family didn’t have all these luxurious foods and all these nice things, so I did kind of see what it was like.” When she appeared in October on a Channel Seven TV interview about the Adelaide fashion festival, billed as a refugee, there were complaints that she was being pigeonholed and unfairly treated. But Akech wasn’t fazed: “A lot of people were like, ‘Why are you guys classifying her as a refugee, she’s Australian?’ … I am a refugee, that’s who I am, I’m not ashamed of it, and I shouldn’t be mad about it,” she says. “Yes, I am an Australian citizen, I am a South Sudanese Australian, but I’m still a refugee.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/27/uber-london-ban-sexual-assault-california-case-police","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T09:00:29Z","webTitle":"Uber attacked over pattern of ignoring police and victims before London ban","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/27/uber-london-ban-sexual-assault-california-case-police","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/sep/27/uber-london-ban-sexual-assault-california-case-police","fields":{"headline":"Uber attacked over pattern of ignoring police and victims before London ban","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When Uber refused to comply with a warrant in a California sexual assault case, police, prosecutors and the judge were bewildered. Lt Brian South told the Guardian that in more than 15 years on the job, he had never seen anyone so brazenly defy a judge’s order for records. A prosecutor testified that Uber was actively preventing law enforcement from protecting riders from violence, and a judge attacked the ride-share corporation for a “horrific” pattern of ignoring police, describing its typical response as “give as little as possible, be as uncooperative as possible”. The judge’s forceful rebuke – in a criminal case where a driver was accused of restraining and attacking a female passenger – is one of many allegations across the globe of Uber neglecting the safety of riders and drivers by failing to work with law enforcement and ignoring standard regulations. Last week, Uber lost its license in London in part due to the government’s concerns about the company’s failure to report sexual assaults to police. While Uber is fighting London to stay in operation there, critics throughout the world are pushing other local municipalities to follow suit – and some say the law enforcement concerns cited in the UK are far from unique. Several women in the US, who say they were sexually assaulted in Uber cars, are now filing fresh lawsuits against the company and spoke exclusively with the Guardian this week about their claims of fundamental public safety problems at Uber. The San Francisco-based firm is facing widespread pressure after months of bad press surrounding corporate misconduct and sexual harassment, shady tactics to evade law enforcement and claims that Uber mistreats and underpays its drivers. In Moraga, a city 20 miles east of Uber’s San Francisco headquarters, court records reveal particularly damning allegations related to the company’s evasion of police. After a driver was arrested on suspicion of sexual battery in May, prosecutors successfully obtained a warrant for information related to the more than 1,000 rides the suspect had given in the previous 90 days. Uber claimed the order was overly broad, ignored the warrant, missed the deadline imposed by the judge and failed to properly communicate with police, according to a court transcript. Prosecutors were then forced to delay the investigation and bring Uber to court in an unusual hearing where Judge Clare Maier sanctioned the company and angrily demanded it comply with the order she had already signed. “The reputation of Uber for cooperating with law enforcement is horrific,” said Maier, whose $1,000 sanction was first reported in the East Bay Times. “The fact that Uber resists search warrants gives me grave concern that there is an ulterior motive here and not any desire to cooperate.” The judge said she was further concerned Uber was blocking an investigation into a man who could be a repeat offender. “I don’t think you have the authority to just resist a search warrant,” the judge later said. “You’ve dragged your feet on every aspect of it.” South, the police lieutenant on the case, said in an interview: “I’ve never had somebody flat-out refuse to comply with a search warrant.” Uber’s lawyer Candace Kelly testified that it was a “technology company” that put strangers together in cars where “bad things” can happen, and that Uber did not “want to be the cause of delay in solving those incidents”. A spokesperson for Uber, which subsequently complied with the warrant, declined to comment. ‘They turn their back on women’ Women who say they have been attacked during Uber trips said the company should be liable and should have done more to help police hold assailants accountable. “Uber is allowing this to happen and providing the means to make it so easy for predators,” said Indra, a Virginia woman who said she was sexually assaulted by a driver last year and requested not to use her full name. Her subsequent conversations with Uber left her with the impression that the company’s position was “this kind of thing is common and they just didn’t care”, she said. “That’s just abhorrent. They didn’t seem concerned about me as a person.” Indra, 38, is one of several women who is now bringing lawsuits against Uber with Lisa Bloom, a high-profile California attorney who has brought sexual misconduct cases against Fox News, Bill Cosby and Donald Trump. A Los Angeles woman, who filed a case anonymously as Jane Doe on Tuesday, alleged in a lawsuit that after she reported a driver fondling her in a car, an Uber representative told her: “Do whatever you want to about the incident.” In an interview, Jane Doe, 25, said Uber never even refunded her ride or followed up with her to let her know if the driver had been permanently banned. She said it was not clear whether Uber had done everything it could to work with police: “If there’s any sort of battery or sexual assault claims – anything that’s putting a driver or passenger at risk – they should be fully willing to comply with the police and give them any information they need.” Uber typically does not disclose information to passengers or drivers about alleged assailants, citing privacy concerns, and complies with law enforcement requests for data only when given subpoenas. The Jane Doe suit alleges that this policy can hamper police investigations and discourage criminal charges, arguing that “non-cooperation with law enforcement agencies means that Uber has provided its drivers with tacit assurance that their misconduct will not be detected by law enforcement”. Uber’s failure to work with police means that for some victims, their only option is to file a civil suit, Bloom said in an interview. “They have all this information. It’s a very simple matter for them to cooperate,” she said. “It’s just shocking how they are turning their back on women customers and allowing this to go on.” Bloom also filed a lawsuit Tuesday on behalf of a passenger who claimed she was sexually harassed and falsely imprisoned by an Uber driver. A recent lawsuit filed in Kansas City alleged that an Uber passenger was raped by a driver a month after Uber was explicitly warned by a member of the public that the man was dangerous. The driver had also previously been convicted of attempted first-degree murder, according to the suit. Kate Lewis, a former Uber driver, also publicly accused the company of failing to do enough to support a criminal investigation after she reported that a passenger had groped and sexually assaulted her throughout a ride last year. “They were very defensive and not very sympathetic,” she said in a recent interview, adding that police told her that lack of communication by Uber was impeding the investigation. “Uber made it worse by not letting me get closure.” Police, however, claimed Uber cooperated in that investigation. Uber declined to comment on specific cases. The company said it has a 24/7 customer support team and employs former law enforcement professionals who work with police."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/26/keaton-jennings-lancashire-somerset-middlesex-warwickshire-hampshire","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T19:32:13Z","webTitle":"Keaton Jennings leaves Durham to sign four-year contract at Lancashire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/26/keaton-jennings-lancashire-somerset-middlesex-warwickshire-hampshire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/26/keaton-jennings-lancashire-somerset-middlesex-warwickshire-hampshire","fields":{"headline":"Keaton Jennings leaves Durham to sign four-year contract at Lancashire","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"As Keaton Jennings joined the Durham exodus – signing for four years at Lancashire citing the need for top-flight cricket to rebuild his stalling international career – thrilling, fascinating, three-way scraps for promotion and relegation neared their climax; the lure of Division One is inescapable. This represented the latest tough day in the recent history of Durham, who were relegated last year for financial irregularities. Jennings will be joined at Lancashire by the club’s leading first‑class wicket-taker Graham Onions, who has signed a two-year deal that may involve coaching. They did, at least, announce the return from Hampshire of Will Smith, their captain when they won the 2009 County Championship. Jennings said: “It was an extremely difficult decision to leave Durham, but I am hugely excited about joining Lancashire. It is a fantastic opportunity for me to play Division One cricket for a club with such a great history and tradition.” Onions will replace Kyle Jarvis, after he left the club to resume his international career with Zimbabwe, while on a busy day at Old Trafford Paul Allott was confirmed as director of cricket and Andrew Flintoff joined the club’s board. On the field, Lancashire were bowled out for 268, a first-innings lead of 67 (Steven Croft made 115) over Surrey, which Mark Stoneman and Rory Burns wrote off by stumps. Surrey lead by 12, and will finish second if they avoid defeat. More pressing cricket took place in the relegation bunfight on a bunsen at Taunton, where Somerset – who know that if they beat Middlesex they survive – are right in charge, leading by 253 with seven second-innings wickets in hand. As Middlesex were bowled out for 142, trailing by 94, with Jack Leach picking up four wickets (but Craig Overton three), focus remained on the pitch, and whether the cricket liaison officer, Wayne Noon, would dock Somerset points. But as Somerset extended that lead to 253 three down, with James Hildreth 82 not out, the chatter quietened. Middlesex’s frontline spinner Ravi Patel, who took seven first-innings wickets, tired and Hildreth and Tom Abell put on 100. Noon can probably stand down. If Warwickshire beat Hampshire, Middlesex will be handed an unlikely reprieve. Warwickshire were 12 for four but, thanks to Dom Sibley carrying his bat for 92, they wriggled to 188, and promptly dismissed Hampshire for 116 to lead by 72 at stumps. Hampshire need all five points from a draw to survive. The top of Division Two is every bit as tense. Worcestershire, after being led to 335 by Joe Clarke and Ravichandran Ashwin, need just four wickets in 71 overs for full bowling points and promotion, with Durham 142 for five. Nottinghamshire’s promotion, which for so long seemed a certainty, is in grave doubt after centuries for Michael Burgess and Chris Jordan set up 565 for Sussex, who then reduced the visitors to 108 for five. If Northamptonshire beat Leicestershire (with two first‑innings wickets in hand, Northants lead by 71), Nottinghamshire must avoid defeat, and equal Northants’ haul of batting bonus points to go up. The champions, Essex, have plenty to play for against Yorkshire: the first unbeaten Championship season in their history, and they look very well placed to do so, after Dan Lawrence’s classy unbeaten 75 swelled their lead over Yorkshire – which was 116 on first innings – to 250 by stumps. Yorkshire were equal parts careless and unfortunate (Gary Ballance was run out backing up) in being out bowled out for 111, with Jamie Porter picking up three wickets to move to 73 in the Championship this season. There were also three each for Simon Harmer and Neil Wagner, the pick of the bowlers. Essex lost Varun Chopra and Ravi Bopara in the space of three balls, both lbw to Jack Brooks, with their second innings score on six, but Lawrence and Nick Browne (53*) dug in – with the occasional flourish from Lawrence, as ever, to reassert their dominance, because that is what Champions do."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/26/brendan-rodgers-celtic-anderlecht-champions-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T21:30:15Z","webTitle":"Brendan Rodgers uses PSG ‘reality check’ to spur Celtic against Anderlecht","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/26/brendan-rodgers-celtic-anderlecht-champions-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/26/brendan-rodgers-celtic-anderlecht-champions-league","fields":{"headline":"Brendan Rodgers uses PSG ‘reality check’ to spur Celtic against Anderlecht","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Brendan Rodgers has urged his Celtic players to use memories from a “reality check” against Paris Saint-Germain to kick-start their Champions League campaign at Anderlecht on Wednesday. Celtic endured a record-equalling home defeat when they were beaten 5-0 by PSG in Glasgow, with Rodgers uncharacteristically critical of his team. “I think games like the PSG one are little reality checks,” Rodgers said. “That’s what it’s like at this level. I always tend to think there is learning in every situation. It’s about facing problems you want to solve afterwards. The lesson learned for us in that first game means we hope to be better in the future games. “Obviously, they’re very humbling experiences for players. It’s boys who are used to winning and when you come up against that level of play at the very top level of the game then it’s tough and it’s humbling. But we’ve got an honest group. They’ve got spirit and we feel they’ll improve over the course of the campaign. “We didn’t plan and focus on being that timid in the PSG game. But this is a level where you are learning all the time. Just because we have been on the domestic run we’ve been on for the last 15 months or so doesn’t mean you’re not susceptible to not good performances. “It’s important for us as a team and a club that we don’t just see the qualification as the success, I want to try to create a mentality here that we can come and believe that we can get a result wherever we go. That’s going to be over time, to have the confidence at this level.” Anderlecht clearly represented a different level of opponent for Celtic even before a dismal start to the season. The side are seventh in the Belgian League and sacked their manager, René Weiler, last week. “This is a competition they will view as an opportunity to turn fortunes around,” Rodgers said. “You never know what happens with a change of manager, sometimes there is a bounce effect. There is a clean slate for everybody. “I don’t really know the depth of the level in the domestic league here. But they are the champions of their country. If you look at the other champions we have played – Astana were a good side, Rosenborg beat Ajax who were the Europa League finalists last season. Anderlecht reached the quarter-finals of the Europa League, so they are still a very tough opponent. They are no mugs, they are a good side with a good history. They haven’t started the season as they would have wanted but the Champions League is a great motivating factor for them to kick on.” Nicolás Frutos, who is in caretaker charge of Anderlecht, believes his team should win despite background chaos. Their players are sitting on bonuses reportedly worth £40,000 per man should they defeat the Scottish champions. “Of course we are favourites because we are at home,” he said. “If Celtic were at home in Glasgow they would be the favourites.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/26/the-guardian-view-on-north-korea-and-the-us-shouting-into-the-wind","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T18:44:08Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on North Korea and the US: shouting into the wind | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/26/the-guardian-view-on-north-korea-and-the-us-shouting-into-the-wind","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/26/the-guardian-view-on-north-korea-and-the-us-shouting-into-the-wind","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on North Korea and the US: shouting into the wind","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The escalating rhetoric of both North Korea and the US president is prone to polarise its audience, resulting in two contradictory and equally imprudent strains of reaction. The first is panic. As the Trumpian tweets and blasts of Pyongyang propaganda grow more extreme, the spectre of war coalesces in the public mind. But it is still a spectre, and the most likely outcome is that the immediate crisis will pass as the others have: without satisfactory resolution, but also without catastrophe. The Korean peninsula is unlikely to go up in flames just yet, despite the fondness of both sides for threats of fire and ashes. The second is premature relief as the insults and missiles fly without resulting in any real-life casualties, unless one counts the egos of Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump. These bombastic, swaggering adversaries could be straight from the pages of a satirical novel; the tendency to treat North Korea as comic relief is understandable, but profoundly wrong. There is nothing funny about the US telling a leadership with good reason to fear regime change that it “won’t be around much longer” and threatening to “totally destroy” a country it previously carpet-bombed. Nor about North Korea describing the first remark as a “declaration of war” and threatening in response to shoot down US bombers outside its airspace. Both sides are prone to bluster; to talking big without taking action. But if their statements should not be taken at face value, they should nonetheless be taken seriously. They may not set out policies clearly, but they indicate possible intentions, to be analysed and weighed. Beyond that, words themselves have consequences. They make certain possibilities more concrete, raise the temperature, and increase the risk of a terrible mistake or miscalculation for which many would pay, foremost the North Korean people, already suffering so much, but also US allies, expatriates and military personnel. Two men who hold their positions in large part thanks to reputations for talking tough and acting likewise must beware backing down as well as going too far; both perceived weakness and reckless action imperil them. The situation has been deliberately personalised, with Mr Trump attacking “Little Rocket Man” and Mr Kim – in a highly unusual signed statement – calling Mr Trump deranged, a dotard and a gangster. Each new remark ups the ante further. If they are just more bluffing, that too carries a cost; empty threats weaken credibility. The slanging match is riskier still because neither side understands the rules they are playing by. The closed nature and intense secrecy of North Korea leaves the US in the dark as to how Mr Kim and the elite think, react and operate. The emaciation of the Department of State, at the cost of essential expertise and experience, makes that far worse. Mr Trump seems unwilling to listen to much of the advice he does get. And the incomprehension is mutual – it is evident that Pyongyang officials have quite basic questions about who makes decisions in the US and how. In fairness, under Mr Trump, this is a question being asked around the world and in Washington as well. US allies and officials too are uncertain of its policy. The “strategic patience” of the Obama years showed that inattention or paralysed inaction is not a solution when it comes to North Korea. And a war of words, of course, is far preferable to the real kind. But neither of those truths makes the current situation any better or less perilous. Two sides are screaming into the wind, and the only snatches loud enough to be heard are worsening matters, not mending them. Talking to North Korea is not “rewarding” it. It is essential as the very start of finding a possible solution to the problem. Without communication, Washington is unlikely to learn more about Pyongyang’s mechanisms of power, ideas and intentions. For their own sakes, and everyone else’s, both sides need to start listening. There is no sign that they will."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/26/nfl-trump-rule-changes-concussion","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T19:26:19Z","webTitle":"The NFL now has a new offensive formation – it’s called Trump | Tim Dowling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/26/nfl-trump-rule-changes-concussion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/26/nfl-trump-rule-changes-concussion","fields":{"headline":"The NFL now has a new offensive formation – it’s called Trump","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"You can tell it’s about to happen when he pauses and juts his chin out: Donald Trump has decided to stop reading out the mildly crazy things on his autocue in order to say something totally crazy off the top of his head. He did it again at a rally in Alabama on Friday. Seemingly triggered by the words “respect” and “flag” in his prepared remarks, Trump embarked on that dog-whistle rant about black NFL players taking a knee during the national anthem. The resulting controversy put him on the wrong side of almost everyone. But a Trump tangent is not complete without an even more incoherent rant-within-a-rant, nested there to thwart anyone still trying to follow the president’s train of thought. This time he was further sidetracked by the NFL’s ratings (“down massively”) and some rule changes. “If you hit too hard – 15 yards! They had that last week,” he said. “I watched for a couple of minutes. Two guys, just really, beautiful tackle. Boom! Fifteen yards. The referee gets on television, his wife is sitting at home, she’s so proud of him. They’re ruining the game!” Trump seemed to be criticising changes aimed at reducing head injuries, but he’s a little bit behind the curve here. It was in 2010 that the NFL introduced a prohibition on a player “launching himself off the ground and using his helmet to strike a player in a defenseless posture in the head or neck”. In 2013 they made a rule against running backs “lowering the crown” of their helmets in certain circumstances. Violations of either result in a 15-yard penalty. Despite these and other precautions, there were 244 concussions in the NFL last season. Autopsies performed on deceased former players have shown that 99% had chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a brain disease caused by repeated impact. In 2015, the NFL settled a lawsuit with more than 5,000 ex-players over head trauma. And Trump’s take? “They’re ruining the game!” His message to players seems to be: respect the flag, and take your traumatic brain injury like a man. As for his insinuation that referees are handing out penalties to impress their wives, your guess is as good as mine. An amicable split The demise of the general ban on split infinitives – apparently their use has increased fourfold over the past few decades – is welcome. As an American I used to split infinitives without thinking about it, but when I arrived in the UK I soon learned that even if I split an infinitive with intent, there was every chance a subeditor would stick it back together for me, often with hideous results. The Guardian’s style guide says: “It is perfectly acceptable, and often desirable, to sensibly split infinitives.” But not everyone is so enlightened, and over the years I came up with a rule of my own: when faced with what seems a difficult choice between splitting an infinitive and leaving it intact, nine out of 10 times what you’re actually looking at is an adverb you don’t need. Forget “to boldly go” and “to go boldly”. What’s wrong with “to go”? I tried explaining my rule to some writing students once, but none of them knew what a split infinitive was. Good for them. Fifty not out The Turner prize is said to have been revitalised by the abolition of a maximum age limit of 50. Two of the shortlisted artists would not otherwise qualify: Hurvin Anderson is 52; Lubaina Himid, 63. The rule was instituted only in 1991 to give younger artists a chance, and if you’d asked me at the time I might have agreed that anybody looking to win a Turner really ought to have his or her act together by 49. Ever since I turned 50, however, I’ve considered the restriction an outrage. In fact any rule that excludes me on a technicality is an outrage. I’m still irritated that I can never win a first-novel prize because I accidentally wrote a non-prizewinning one a long time ago. Can I not get it annulled?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/26/like-night-and-day-labour-celebrates-a-conference-united-under-corbyn","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T18:12:09Z","webTitle":"'Like night and day': Labour smiles push last year's tensions aside","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/26/like-night-and-day-labour-celebrates-a-conference-united-under-corbyn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/26/like-night-and-day-labour-celebrates-a-conference-united-under-corbyn","fields":{"headline":"'Like night and day': Labour smiles push last year's tensions aside","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Only a year ago, the talk at the Labour conference in Liverpool was about whether the party was facing a historic split. Jeremy Corbyn’s critics wandered miserably around the main conference centre predicting total wipeout at the next election, while celebrations over his second decisive leadership victory were largely confined to the Momentum-backed World Transformed festival in a different part of the city. There could not be a bigger difference with the jubilant atmosphere suffusing the Brighton conference centre this year, with a packed main hall, hundreds queuing to get into fringe events and even a sold-out business day. Labour supporters are still flocking to World Transformed events across Brighton but Corbynite members are utterly dominant at the main conference as well, which has cut the slots given to senior politicians to allow more speaking time for the 13,000 ordinary members attending. “It’s like night and day,” said Ian Lavery, a Labour MP and party chairman, noting that it was the first time in years he had seen delegates with smiles on their faces. “Conference last year became very difficult and we’ve had discord within the party for two years. Before that conferences were hugely stage-managed and at the end of the Blair years people were of the view: ‘What’s the use of coming to conference, I can’t get up to speak. I haven’t got any real role as a delegate.’” Lavery attributed the difference in atmosphere partly to Corbyn’s election result, putting the party within touching distance of power again, and partly to rule changes that mean members are more involved in debate. “What’s happened since then is that we’ve changed things,” he said. “We’ve had resistance from the shadow cabinet. There has been resistance from frontbenchers because they like to get up at conference. But we’ve been saying we need more people from the constituencies, the communities, to get up there and express their views. And we’ve had some great discussions. Elderly people, young people, people in between and goodness me, they are gems.” Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, agreed that the dark mood hanging over last year’s conference had completely lifted. “You compare it to last year that was really quite tense. This is just different … I keep meeting new delegates. People are bouncing with ideas and it’s how conference ought to be,” she said. Corbyn’s critics in the parliamentary party, who tried to oust him after the Brexit referendum, have kept largely quiet while he has been riding high in the polls since 8 June. Some of the biggest and most senior thorns in the Labour leader’s side last year – Sadiq Khan and Tom Watson – have spent the conference going out of their way to praise their leader from the conference platform. The mayor of London said Corbyn was entirely responsible for Labour’s election gains, while Watson, the deputy leader, tried to lead the hall in a rendition of “oh, Jeremy Corbyn” and thanked him for showing the party what was possible. Meanwhile, other MPs such as Jonathan Ashworth and Lisa Nandy have displayed their openness to Corbynism by appearing at World Transformed events, ending the segregation between the two conferences that existed in 2016. “We’ve got to suck it up,” said one MP critical of Corbyn from the start. “It’s difficult to say you are disappointed with the massively increased membership and more colleagues in parliament. But I wouldn’t say I’m happy.” A number of his colleagues said they had reached a state of acceptance and accommodation about both the left’s entrenchment at the top of the party and the change in the nature of the membership. “We are now just feeling very Monsieur Zen about it, as Jeremy would say,” said one senior Labour MP who returned to the backbenches under Corbyn. Not all feel the same, though, with some MPs worried there is too much self-congratulation and not enough realism about the party’s electoral prospects next time, given the Tories will probably put up a better fight. Others have persistent worries about the possibility of deselections before the next election, with Lucy Powell in Manchester, Thangam Debbonaire in Bristol, Hilary Benn in Leeds and Stella Creasy in London among those who fear they could be targeted. Their concerns are fuelled by the ascendancy of Corbyn supporters on the national executive committee, which means changes to the rules could be tabled at the last minute before next year’s conference. But senior Labour figures firmly deny that any such changes to the selection rules will be made. There have been a few minor skirmishes in the open at conference, including Corbyn-supporting members shouting at Corbyn critics from Labour First that they should go to the Tory conference in Manchester next week instead. On the final night of conference, one of the hottest tickets was a pub quiz hosted by former leader Ed Miliband in the basement of Komedia, an arts venue in the trendy Lanes area of Brighton. Hundreds of people queued for more than an hour around the block to get into the quiz but the crowd inside were young Momentum activists, with no teams of fellow MPs in sight to hear Miliband’s four rounds of questions on current affairs and niche Labour history. “This has been a long ambition of mine,” Miliband said, arriving on stage. “Ever since that exit poll came out in 2015.” Other rebel Labour MPs are principally concerned about the leadership’s position on Brexit, and had hoped to use the conference as a forum for highlighting the membership’s pro-EU position on the single market and free movement. But a well-organised campaign by allies of Corbyn kept that level of debate off the conference floor, to the frustration of MPs such as Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie, who are pushing for a soft Brexit. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, who is credited with brokering a fragile truce on the party’s position over the summer, insisted debate on the EU was still happening at conference. “The position we arrived at over the summer has got really strong, near-universal support. But are people talking about Brexit and concerned about Brexit? You bet,” he said. “Most of the fringe meetings have been full to breaking point with hundreds of people not getting in. That tells you the enthusiasm for debate about Brexit and that is a good thing.” Other senior figures allied to Corbyn are less convinced that Labour MPs trying to change the party’s position over Brexit are doing so for the right reason. One senior source close to the leadership said they believed those who wanted to cause trouble for Corbyn were channelling their efforts into Brexit in the hope of destabilising the leadership. But despite the divisions, Lavery said he believed the party had “largely overcome” the open warfare of the past two years. “There is different views and you’ve always had a left wing and a right wing and I cannot say it’s different at this moment in times,” he said. “If MPs weren’t bought into the Jeremy Corbyn project, they have got to be buoyed by this conference – the difference, the change, the atmosphere, the way people feel part of the party. And it’s just the beginning, and we are going to hopefully grab them keys off Theresa May so that Jeremy is prime minister.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/27/football-quiz-which-stadium-older-camp-nou-bernabeu","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T10:20:23Z","webTitle":"Football quiz: which stadium is older?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/27/football-quiz-which-stadium-older-camp-nou-bernabeu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/27/football-quiz-which-stadium-older-camp-nou-bernabeu","fields":{"headline":"Football quiz: which stadium is older?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/26/jeff-sessions-defends-free-speech-moments-before-siding-with-trump-on-nfl","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T18:17:14Z","webTitle":"Jeff Sessions defends free speech moments before siding with Trump on NFL","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/26/jeff-sessions-defends-free-speech-moments-before-siding-with-trump-on-nfl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/26/jeff-sessions-defends-free-speech-moments-before-siding-with-trump-on-nfl","fields":{"headline":"Jeff Sessions defends free speech moments before siding with Trump on NFL","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"US attorney general Jeff Sessions faced accusations of hypocrisy after he delivered an impassioned defense of free speech, then moments later backed Donald Trump’s claim that athletes who kneel during the national anthem should be fired. Sessions waded into the argument about free speech on campuses, condemning protesters he said were “now routinely shutting down speeches and debates across the country in an effort to silence voices that insufficiently conform with their views”. In a speech at the Georgetown University law center in Washington DC, he denounced American universities for “transforming into an echo chamber of political correctness and homogenous thought, a shelter for fragile egos”. His remarks came after alt-right speakers have sparked angry protests or been barred from speaking on campuses. But moments after he declared “Who decides what is offensive and what is acceptable?”, Sessions turned to Trump’s attempt to shut down peaceful protests by NFL football players who have drawn attention to police brutality by refusing to stand for the national anthem. “The president has free speech rights, too,” the attorney general said during a brief question-and-answer session, adding that those engaging in peaceful protest during the national anthem were “denigrating the symbols of our nation”. “I agree there’s a big mistake to protest in that fashion, because it weakens the commitment we have to this nation that has provided us this freedom,” Sessions said, while noting the players “aren’t subject to any prosecution”. “I would condemn their actions, but not them as human beings,” he said. Sessions’ comments came amid an escalating feud between Trump and the NFL. The president launched a stunning attack on the league at a rally in Sessions’ home state of Alabama on Friday, where he said: “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now’.” Trump’s remarks prompted a firestorm of criticism from the NFL’s officials, owners, coaches and players, as well as black athletes across the nation. The trend of kneeling during the anthem began with Colin Kaepernick, a black quarterback who wished to draw attention to police brutality and the killings of unarmed black men. But the president was characteristically unwilling to back down during a White House press conference on Tuesday, insisting he was “ashamed” of some players’ actions while denying that he is preoccupied with the controversy at the expense of other issues, such as the hurricane relief effort in Puerto Rico. “I’ve heard that before, about, was I preoccupied? Not at all. I have plenty of time on my hands. All I do is work,” Trump said. “And to be honest with you, that’s an important function of working: it’s called respect for our country.” Trump again sought to portray the kneeling protests as an insult to military veterans who had been killed or maimed in the line of duty. “Many people have died, many, many people,” he continued. “Many people are so horribly injured. I was at Walter Reed hospital recently and I saw so many great young people and their missing legs and their missing arms and they’ve been so badly injured and they were fighting for our country, they were fighting for our flag, they were fighting for our national anthem. And for people to disrespect that by kneeling during the playing of our national anthem I think is disgraceful.” When Sessions arrived at the Georgetown law building, dozens of demonstrators stood at the steps of the building in protest. Several brandished signs invoking Trump’s disregard for the free speech of black athletes, with one stating, “What about Kap?” in a reference to Kaepernick. Sessions came to address free speech on college campuses, a subject that has emerged as a political flashpoint as students have vigorously decried controversial speakers. “There are those who will say that certain speech isn’t deserving of protection. They will say that some speech is hurtful – even hateful,” Sessions said. “They will point to the very speech and beliefs that we abhor as Americans. But the right of free speech does not exist only to protect the ideas upon which most agree at a given moment in time.” Sessions criticized school administrators who “bend to this behavior,” saying to do so was to “coddle it and encourage it”. The speech followed protests at the University of California, Berkeley, over a rally held by rightwing commentator Milo Yiannopoulos. Yiannopoulous, a former senior editor for Breitbart News, had planned a four-day “free speech week” that was set to feature other alt-right figures, such as rightwing commentator Ann Coulter, but was canceled by organizers due to logistical complications. Yiannopoulos spoke at the school in February in a more formal capacity, resulting in protests that occasionally turned violent. Berkeley has spent at least $1.4m on security since February over planned appearances by Yiannopoulos and Coulter, the latter of which was canceled in April following an outcry from students. Sessions’ own presence at Georgetown garnered significant backlash ahead of his speech. On Monday, 44 members the law school’s faculty signed a statement condemning the attorney general. “A man who fails to recognize paradigmatic violations of the first amendment is a poor choice to speak about free speech on campuses,” the letter stated. The invite-only event did not fill the auditorium where it was held and met with polite applause from attendees. As Sessions concluded his remarks, one row of protesters stood at the center of the room and placed black tape over their mouths. Ambur Smith, a third-year student who protested outside, said the juxtaposition of Sessions’ defense of free speech and Trump’s attempts to crack down on peaceful protests by black athletes “continues to cut away at their legitimacy”. “Irony is one word, hypocrisy is definitely another,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/27/uk-could-rescue-energy-efficient-homes-policy-with-few-key-steps","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T23:01:17Z","webTitle":"UK could rescue energy efficient homes policy with few key steps","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/27/uk-could-rescue-energy-efficient-homes-policy-with-few-key-steps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/27/uk-could-rescue-energy-efficient-homes-policy-with-few-key-steps","fields":{"headline":"UK could rescue energy efficient homes policy with few key steps","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Progress in making Britain’s homes more energy efficient has stalled, but the government could salvage billions in wastage by taking a few key steps, a new report with wide backing has found. Ministers are preparing a new “clean growth” plan after the scrapping of the green deal, which left the UK without a government policy on making homes more energy efficient and tackling fuel poverty. Ministers have also abandoned regulations for all new homes to be constructed to zero-carbon standards, leaving housebuilders with little obligation to build new homes to energy efficient specifications. As a result, the rapid improvements to efficiency in the UK’s housing stock seen before 2015 have stalled. Now a new report, Affordable warmth, clean growth written by Frontier Economics, has won the backing of more than 20 organisations, including green campaigners, thinktanks, companies selling insulation and services, and the energy companies E.ON and Npower. The 88-page report recommends: reinstating a requirement for new homes to be zero carbon by 2020 bringing all existing homes up to an energy performance rating of C, midway on the current A to G scale, by 2035 assisting all low-income households to achieve such a rating by 2030, through subsidies changing stamp duty to offer rebates on buying homes that are improved to a good standard tax breaks for private sector landlords who install efficiency measures, such as insulation 50% subsidies to social sector landlords, such as housing associations, which make their housing stock more energy efficient In the decade from 2004 to 2015, gas consumption for typical dual fuel households fell by 37% and electricity usage by 18%. This was in part because of the installation of insulation, but also improvements in technology, such as new boilers and new lightbulbs. However, after the demise of the green deal in 2015, there has been a halving of the annual investment in domestic energy efficiency, and an 80% decline in the number of improvement measures installed in homes between 2012 and 2015. This leaves huge scope for cost savings, which could benefit UK consumers to the tune of more than £7bn if improvements were carried out, or the equivalent of six Hinkley Point C nuclear reactors, according to a recent report by the UK Energy Research Centre. Gus O’Donnell, the former Cabinet secretary, said: “In a world where it is difficult to guarantee getting a return above inflation on any investment, it makes sense to invest in improving the energy efficiency of your home. This cuts bills, allowing you to stay warm and help tackle climate change. Government needs to do more to encourage this investment, and this report provides some practical proposals on how they can do it.” Lord Deben, chairman of the statutory Committee on Climate Change, also backed the proposals, saying they should be adopted as part of the government’s “clean growth” strategy, soon to be announced by ministers. “If housebuilders were required [to build homes to higher standards] the cost of doing so would shrink. This would benefit homeowners.” He said fitting existing houses with insulation, such as modern cavity wall insulation and better windows, would also benefit poorer families, and be a cost-efficient way of improving health and lives."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/26/brazil-backtracks-on-plan-to-open-up-amazon-forest-to-mining","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T14:04:59Z","webTitle":"Brazil backtracks on plan to open up Amazon forest to mining","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/26/brazil-backtracks-on-plan-to-open-up-amazon-forest-to-mining","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/26/brazil-backtracks-on-plan-to-open-up-amazon-forest-to-mining","fields":{"headline":"Brazil backtracks on plan to open up Amazon forest to mining","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Amazon conservation groups have hailed a victory as the Brazilian government announced a U-turn on plans to open up swaths of the the world’s biggest forest to mining corporations. President Michel Temer had sparked outrage in August when he announced a decree to abolish the Renca reserve, an area of 17,800 square miles – roughly the size of Switzerland – that is an important carbon sink and home to some of the world’s richest biodiversity. But he has now been forced into a humiliating reversal after his move to carve up the area was blocked by a judge, condemned in the country’s congress as the “biggest attack on the Amazon in 50 years” and opposed by environmental campaigners, climate activists, the Catholic church and anthropologists. Renca – an acronym for the National Reserve of Copper and Associates – was created by the military dictatorship in 1984 to stave off foreign interest in the area’s rich deposits of gold, copper, iron ore and other minerals. The reserve spans the states of Amapá and Pará up to the remote national border with French Guiana and Suriname. It is home to several indigenous tribes, including the Aparai, Wayana and Wajapi. The government insisted only 30% of the reserve would be opened up to mining. Indigenous territory and nature conservation parks would not be affected, it said. However, critics said any move to legitimise mining in the area would result in road-building, deforestation and increased pressure on tribes and nature. There are already 14 illegal mines and eight landing strips for bush-pilots in Renca, according to Greenpeace, which says the problem would have grown worse if Temer had approved industrial-scale mineral extraction by domestic and international companies. However, that risk is now eased by the new decree which “restores the conditions of the area, according to the document that instituted the reserve in 1984”, according to the Ministry of Mines and Energy. But the threat has not gone away. Temer and his cabinet are closely linked to mining and agribusiness industries that want to reduce protections for indigenous territory, the Amazon rainforest and other biomes. In a statement announcing the reversal, the mining ministry left open the possibility of a fresh debate on the issue. “Brazil needs to grow and create jobs, attract mining investment and even tap the economic potential of the region,” it said. Maurício Voivodic, the head of WWF Brasil, said the authorities should now think twice about pushing for development without consultation. “The Brazilian government has finally realised it’s not acceptable to make decisions that affect the Amazon and its people without a broad and transparent public debate,” he said. But the battle is far from over. Carlos Rittl, executive secretary, Brazilian Climate Observatory, notes the continued risk to the Amazon from what he called an “unscrupulous partnership” with the “ruralista” caucus in which Temer is trying to weaken environmental and indigenous protections in exchange for congress votes that protect him from corruption investigations. “This doesn’t save the forest as it might seem, nor does it improve the image of the president when it comes to his handling of society and the environment, warned Rittl."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/27/brexit-labour-tories-corbynites-right-labour","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T05:00:25Z","webTitle":"Brexit Tories opened the door to revolution.

Corbynites walked through","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"At a rally on the eve of Labour’s annual conference in Brighton, a party supporter called out from the crowd to ask the leader when he was planning to bring back socialism. “That is what we are doing, sir,” came the reply – and it was considered daring enough to be news. That was 2013; the leader was Ed Miliband. Later that week, he unveiled plans to freeze energy bills, which Conservatives took as proof that the man was an anti-capitalist maniac. (A diluted version of the policy found its way into the 2017 Tory manifesto.) Four years later, also in Brighton, Labour has moved on from bill-capping to full-scale renationalisation. And not just of energy companies. Railways, Royal Mail, the waterworks: “We’re taking them back!” John McDonnell told the conference to delirious applause on Monday. It will not be news if Jeremy Corbyn announces in his speech today that he is a socialist. Corbyn and McDonnell are proud to have redrawn the left boundary of what an opposition party in Britain can pledge and still be considered a plausible prospect for government. The Tories keep saying that such an outcome would bring catastrophe, but since the election they cannot be sure that voters will heed the warning. Theresa May’s hopes of a whopping mandate were built on the idea that Corbyn was a ridiculous, sinister candidate for prime minister, and she lost her majority. Conservative MPs fear a rerun would tip them into opposition. It didn’t help that the Tories have been crying socialist wolf for years. It wasn’t just Miliband who was cast as a fanatic. When Gordon Brown authorised the emergency nationalisation of Northern Rock, George Osborne’s instant reaction as shadow chancellor was to denounce the move as a regression to 1970s-style state meddling. Ten years on, Corbyn’s antagonists vastly overestimate Britain’s cultural abhorrence of radical leftism as a potential conveyor towards economic ruin, possibly tyranny. The cold war is ancient history to first-time voters. To remember two Germanys you have to be well into your 30s, and the memory alone is not enough to guarantee suspicion of grey-haired politicians who once equivocated over preference for the western one. It is not enough even when those politicians, guided by some doctrinaire muscle memory, still tilt towards the Kremlin on foreign policy. But the big change is that, with Brexit, the Tories have normalised all forms of radicalism. By hurling themselves at a plan in defiance of sober economic counsel, Conservatives have raised the bar for what counts as a dangerous gamble with the nation’s prosperity; they may have removed it altogether. They march to the drumbeat of revolutionary fantasy, urging sceptics to believe that anything is possible with an effort of will. The prime minister touts a panacea policy that is meant to satisfy every conceivable social and economic grievance. She will spare no expense to get it done, leave no magic money tree unshaken. When that is the ethos of government, ministers can hardly complain if the opposition takes the same approach. Having listened to the debates in Brighton, it strikes me that the unworldly utopianism inherent in Brexit attracts Corbynites, regardless of whether they voted for it. Labour is packed with remainers, but there is marked reluctance to pine for the EU, reflecting the calculated ambiguity of the leadership. This is not simply a question of respecting the referendum result (Labour delegates, after all, are in no hurry to recognise May’s authority as a fairly elected prime minister). Nor is it purely tactical. Yes, there is an electoral conundrum posed by the volume of leave voters in Labour seats. But the pre-referendum spirit of Corbynism celebrated the possibility of changing minds and reframing debates, not trimming ideological sails to any wind. That was shabby Blairism, once upon a time. Brexit has a deeper lure, conveyed by the Labour leader’s suggestion in a pre-conference interview that membership of the single market could impede the pursuit of a radical left manifesto. This belief rests on aversion to European rules regulating state subsidy for industry and enforcing fair market competition. That provokes a question of quite how radical Labour intends to be. EU membership poses no insurmountable obstacle to nationalised utilities, redistributive taxation, generous welfare states or activist industrial strategy, as a glance at France, Denmark or Germany shows. Even Labour’s new friends in Greece’s Syriza party – no cheerleaders for neoliberalism or austerity – recommend sticking with the European project. If Corbyn could not be satisfied with egalitarian social democratic policies practised for decades in Scandinavia, if he is shopping for a system beyond the leftmost frontier of EU rules, he must be looking at something altogether more drastic. Cuba, perhaps. Labour’s new radicals respond that comparison with existing forms of government is narrow-minded, pessimistic, tethered to the wreckage of 20th-century thinking. The goal, they say, cannot be grasped without a liberating bound of the imagination. Here too they sound like Tory Brexiters, who promise that the UK will carve out a unique role in the world, starting with a bespoke EU partnership bringing all the benefits of membership and none of the constraints. When that ambition is tested by mundane realities of trade and diplomacy, the utopians insist that reality yield. Corbynism sits awkwardly with anything that smacks of remain because it is intellectually allergic to incremental change, and romantically impatient with everything about the status quo. It is an extraordinary feature of British politics that two years ago there was no revolutionary party in the mainstream, and today revolution is the only item on the menu. Tory Brexiters and Corbynites face in opposite directions but are held together by mutually reinforcing dynamics. Fear of a Labour government keeps moderate Conservatives from breaking ranks and disrupting May’s plans, lest they end up triggering an election. And Labour has all the permission it needs to be radically unbound, because Brexiters have incinerated the rulebook on economic prudence and moderation. May has deployed the full capacity of government to make revolution respectable, which gives Corbyn and McDonnell their chance to make revolution permanent. • Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2017/sep/30/stephen-collins-on-the-end-of-the-world-cartoon","type":"interactive","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T05:00:24Z","webTitle":"Stephen Collins on the end of the world – cartoon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2017/sep/30/stephen-collins-on-the-end-of-the-world-cartoon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2017/sep/30/stephen-collins-on-the-end-of-the-world-cartoon","fields":{"headline":"Stephen Collins on the end of the world – cartoon","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/26/jaffa-cakes-pack-size-cut-shrinkflation-mcvities-cadbury","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T15:21:37Z","webTitle":"Jaffa Cakes packet size reduced in latest 'shrinkflation' move","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/26/jaffa-cakes-pack-size-cut-shrinkflation-mcvities-cadbury","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/26/jaffa-cakes-pack-size-cut-shrinkflation-mcvities-cadbury","fields":{"headline":"Jaffa Cakes packet size reduced in latest 'shrinkflation' move","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jaffa Cakes have become the latest casualty of shrinking pack sizes in supermarket aisles. A standard box of McVitie’s Jaffa Cakes now contains 10 rather than 12 cakes, while a twin pack has also been put on a diet, dropping from 24 to 20. In a separate assault on snack time, Cadbury has also taken a bite out of the Double Decker and Picnic bars sold in multipacks. These are the latest examples of “shrinkflation”, a phenomenon whereby manufacturers reduce the size of products ranging from chocolate bars to fruit juice and even toilet roll but consumers still pay the same price. Notable examples include Toblerone spacing out its signature triangles and Mars shrinking its sharing bags of Maltesers by 15%. In a statement McVitie’s, which is owned by Turkish group Pladis, said it had reduced the recommended retail price (RRP) of Jaffa Cakes to reflect the smaller packs, adding that “pricing ultimately remains at the sole discretion of retailers”. “There is no change in the size, shape or weight of individual cakes in the McVitie’s Jaffa Cake range,” it added. The RRP of a single pack of Jaffa Cakes has dropped from £1.15 to 99p, while a twin pack is £1.89 rather than £2.19. However, despite the lower headline price, both still equate to a small increase in price per individual cake. A recent study by the Office for National Statistics found that 2,529 of the products it tracked had decreased in size over the past five years. ONS price collectors always check the size of an item as well as the price when they are gathering information for each month’s inflation figures. Double Deckers and Picnic bars sold in multipacks are now 14% and 21.5% smaller respectively than those sold individually, while the overall pack price is unchanged. Cadbury, part of US food conglomerate Mondelēz, said the move brought the products into line with its other multipacks, which all contain smaller bars than those sold as individual products. Cadbury said rising ingredient costs and the devaluation of sterling since Brexit were making food products more expensive to make. “We carry these costs within our business for as long as possible to keep our brands as affordable as possible,” it said in a statement. “However, like all food manufacturers, we sometimes have to make changes to ensure that people can continue to buy their favourite chocolate brands, at affordable prices.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/26/ian-anthony-rook-court-stabbing-surgeon-nasser-kurdy-outside-cheshire-mosque","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T12:26:42Z","webTitle":"Man appears in court accused of stabbing surgeon outside mosque","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/26/ian-anthony-rook-court-stabbing-surgeon-nasser-kurdy-outside-cheshire-mosque","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/26/ian-anthony-rook-court-stabbing-surgeon-nasser-kurdy-outside-cheshire-mosque","fields":{"headline":"Man appears in court accused of stabbing surgeon outside mosque","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A man has appeared in court accused of stabbing a surgeon who treated victims of the Manchester Arena attack. Nasser Kurdy, who operated on those injured in the bombing in May, was stabbed from behind with a knife as he walked into a mosque in Hale, Cheshire, just before 6pm on Sunday. The 58-year-old victim suffered a 3cm wound to the back of his neck and was taken to Wythenshawe hospital for treatment, where he works as a consultant orthopaedic surgeon. Ian Anthony Rook, 28, of no fixed abode, appeared at Manchester magistrates court on Tuesday charged with unlawful and malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and possession of a lethal weapon, a knife. Wearing a grey jumper and grey tracksuit bottoms, Rook stood beside two security officers in the glass-encased dock and spoke only to confirm his name. District judge Khalid Qureshi ordered psychiatric reports to be carried out and remanded him in custody. He is next due to appear for a preliminary hearing at Manchester Minshull Street crown court on 23 October. Rook waved to members of his family in the public gallery as he was led to the court cells after the five-minute hearing. Kurdy, a father of three from a Syrian–Jordanian family, was preparing to go back to work to treat his patients on Tuesday as his alleged attacker appeared in court. Speaking after being discharged from hospital on Monday, Kurdy said: “God was merciful to me yesterday. It could be a nerve, an artery, a vein, the gullet. The neck is the contact between the body and your head, but fortunately it was just the muscle.” Police made two arrests and said they were treating the incident as a hate crime. The second man arrested has been released and police said no further action will be taken against him. Kurdy has worked as a doctor for four decades, after coming to Britain to study medicine in 1977 and working in Perth, Dundee and Northampton before settling in Manchester in 1991. He was going to the Altrincham Islamic Centre for mid-afternoon prayers and a committee meeting, as he is a lay imam, sometimes giving sermons, and vice-chairman of Altrincham and Hale Muslim Association."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"working-in-development/2017/oct/12/traffic-accident-call-a-reporter-how-journalists-are-forcing-change-in-liberia","type":"article","sectionId":"working-in-development","sectionName":"Working in development","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T13:00:41Z","webTitle":"Traffic accident?

Call a reporter! How journalists are forcing change in Liberia","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It took just one day for journalist Emmanuel Degleh to restore access for 12,000 Liberians to the only health clinic in their area. Residents of the mountainous Gibi district had been pleading with government officials to repair a collapsed culvert that was cutting off their only road to emergency health services and the rest of the country. For weeks the requests were ignored. But when Degleh picked his way up the muddy pass on a motorbike to tell the story on community radio and online at Local Voices Liberia, his report caught the public’s attention. “The news is not dominated by the voices of the ordinary people, but my persistent reporting forced the government to implement changes,” Degleh says. Within days officials had fixed the road. Degleh’s story represents a small but powerful shift in Liberia’s media landscape since the 2014 Ebola outbreak. In an industry long dominated by politics, newly trained health journalists are strengthening the country’s health infrastructure through reporting that educates communities and catalyses action. When the largest Ebola virus outbreak in history tore through Liberia three years ago, it unveiled to the world a tragically broken and underdeveloped healthcare system. Two decades of political instability and civil war had depleted the country’s health infrastructure, and 4,810 Liberians died from Ebola – more than in any other country. But just as much of a factor in the devastation – at least initially – was the spread of unverified information and a fragile press. For months, Liberians bought into rumours that the virus wasn’t real, or that it was a biological weapon of the west. Many people didn’t know how to recognise symptoms of the virus until it was too late. Unfortunately, most of Liberia’s journalists were also ill-equipped to report on the outbreak. According to Freedom House’s Freedom of the Press country report, about a dozen newspapers were published regularly in Liberia in 2014, although low literacy rates combined with the cost of a paper meant that most Liberians got their information from the radio. But the media in Liberia usually depends on government advertising, and contributions from politicians and international donors. With scarce resources most newsrooms skimped on salaries, resources and training for journalists. Reporters, who earn about 3,000 Liberian dollars (less than $30) a month, have little incentive to fork out for travel to rural communities when politicians in Monrovia will pay for stories. Meanwhile, the government has faced accusations of trying to influence editorial content by withholding advertising. A coalition of press associations and international organisations decided to assist journalists to fill the void. With the help of Internews, a non-profit international media-training organisation, the coalition launched a health programme called Information Saves Lives, which recruited 24 journalists – including Degleh – from newspapers and radio stations across the country to undergo an intensive training programme. “The very clear need for information during Ebola raised the profile and power of journalism and information infrastructures,” says Internews’ global health adviser, Ida Jooste. Internews set up an SMS service for people to text in health-related rumours, which became an invaluable source of stories. The Information Saves Lives journalists, in their newsrooms, researched the reports and distributed the facts. The journalists’ specialised training and strong relationships with health officials has enabled them to report health issues in an unsensationalised manner, and to become health experts in newsrooms, including at GNN Liberia, FrontPage Africa and community radio stations across rural Liberia. Some are going on to do paid fellowships. Degleh, for example, is on the Thomson Reuters Foundation’s programme, Reporting After the Epidemic, while his Local Voices Liberia colleague Alpha Daffae Senkpeni is doing a fellowship in China. But perhaps most important, these newly trained health journalists have earned the trust of rural Liberians. “In rural Liberia, if there’s a traffic accident along the highway, they prefer to call me as a journalist instead of the the police,” Degleh says. “If there’s an armed robbery and people need help, they prefer to call a journalist, because they see us as more reliable than the government.” It’s not that the government doesn’t know what needs to be done. But according to Degleh, officials are just content to let these issues get lost in bureaucracy until a reporter shines a spotlight on them. For example, Liberia wants to lower its maternal mortality rate, which is one of the highest in the world at 1,072 deaths per 100,000 live births. Yet the government has largely ignored the fact that bad roads are one of the biggest obstacles to rural pregnant women’s access to emergency care. Although reporters like Degleh are now carving out a space for health reporting, they are still a minority among Liberia’s more than 500 journalists, the best of whom often leave the industry for more lucrative careers in public relations. “There is a huge ‘brain drain’ in the media sector,” says Samuka Konneh, Internews’ health communications officer in Liberia. Still, rural health reporting is beginning to take root as young reporters pioneer new paths to successful journalism through international fellowships. “Homegrown” independent news outlets, like The Bush Chicken or Local Voices Liberia, are expanding across the country. Liberia’s president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, also honoured the press for its “outstanding role” in the fight against Ebola, despite her crackdown on the media during the outbreak. “As really everywhere else in the world, change is not something that one can expect to happen overnight,” Jooste says. “It happens incrementally.” But even more lasting than official accolades or immediate responses to watchdog reporting is the steady, incremental empowerment of communities as they become more informed. From learning where they can receive treatment without leaving the country, to their basic democratic rights, Liberia’s “ordinary people” are slowly finding their voice. Community health workers, the first responders in rural areas, have also risen in status. Internews suspended the Information Saves Lives programme in December due to lack of funding, but it is still running a large five-year Liberia Media Development programme funded by USAid. “I’m praying this doesn’t happen, but if there is a new outbreak [of Ebola], at least Liberia now has journalists who can effectively report on health epidemics,” says Konneh."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/26/ben-stokes-england-arrested-night-bristol","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T18:09:00Z","webTitle":"England’s Ben Stokes arrested in Bristol after win over West Indies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/26/ben-stokes-england-arrested-night-bristol","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/26/ben-stokes-england-arrested-night-bristol","fields":{"headline":"England’s Ben Stokes arrested in Bristol after win over West Indies","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ben Stokes has seen his Ashes participation and position as the England Test vice‑captain thrown into jeopardy after being arrested in Bristol in the early hours of Monday morning. A 27‑year‑old man was taken to hospital after the incident. Stokes, 26, was arrested by Avon and Somerset police on suspicion of causing actual bodily harm at 2.35am and spent the night in custody before being released under investigation without charge. He had been out after England’s 124-run win against West Indies on Sunday. England withdrew the all-rounder from Wednesday’s fourth one-day international at The Oval along with his team-mate Alex Hales, who was present at the time of the incident but is understood to be a witness. Both players missed training on Tuesday, Hales having voluntarily returned to Bristol to give a statement to police. The news broke on the day England’s selectors were picking their squad for this winter’s Ashes defence – they name the touring party at 10am on Wednesday – with Andrew Strauss, the director of cricket, instructing the panel to make their deliberations as if Stokes was fit and available. Whether this is the case remains shrouded in doubt. Strauss declined to confirm or deny suggestions that Stokes had undergone an x-ray on a hand following the incident, while there will also be a wait to see if he is charged before the squad depart for Australia on 28 October. Strauss met Stokes in Bristol on Monday evening after his release and confirmed the England and Wales Cricket Board will be launching its own investigation. Whether Stokes remains as Test vice‑captain will hinge on the outcome of this. The Guardian understands Stokes and Hales were two of at least seven England players out after their win at the County Ground on Sunday, with no curfew having been put in place by the team’s head coach, Trevor Bayliss. Stokes and Hales separated from the rest of the pack and were in the Mbargo nightclub before the incident that occurred outside it in the Queens Road and Clifton Triangle area of Bristol. Hales was witness to events but understood not to be involved directly after initially walking away. The 28-year-old went back to the team hotel after the arrest of Stokes to inform the team management of what had taken place, while the complainant was taken to Bristol Royal Infirmary. Hales returned to Bristol on Tuesday instead of attending training. Despite going out with England’s permission and having not broken any rules on a night when team-mates were also out late, he was still omitted from Wednesday’s match. The Guardian has learned that players were on Tuesday night subject to disciplinary proceedings by England. Jake Ball, the seam bowler, was among them, having been pictured earlier with Stokes, Hales and Jimmy Anderson (who had been summarising for Sky). Eoin Morgan, the England one-day captain, confirmed that Jason Roy will take Hales’s place as opener for the match and admitted that the team’s preparations had been affected. He said: “It is a big blow. It has been a distraction over the last day or so, but these things happen. Distractions arise – it’s one of the challenges of playing international sport, or professional sport. But certainly losing a guy like Ben Stokes is a big one. It’s a member of our team, a pretty crucial member – and we’re all in it together.” As well as proving to be a headache to the England management in a one-day series they lead 2-0 with two to play – Sam Billings of Kent was drafted into the squad overnight – the timing could not be worse as they look to plan for the Ashes in Australia. The incident and the fact players were out in the small hours midway through a series will also bring into question the culture of a limited-overs team who have been on an upward trajectory since theirharrowing group-stage exit from the 2015 World Cup. Stokes in particular will need to consider his off-field behaviour once more, having been sent home from an England Lions tour to Australia in 2013 along with Matt Coles of Kent following a string of late nights. It is understood he wasrecently warned by his agent, International Sports Management, after being seen out late during the Old Trafford Test match against South Africa during the summer. England had believed Stokes to have turned a corner in this regard, installing him as Test vice‑captain to Joe Root in February following Alastair Cook’s resignation after four years in charge. Bayliss, the head coach, has long talked up his leadership, both in the dressing room and as an inspirational all-rounder on the field. Such qualities will be required in Australia when the five-Test series starts in Brisbane on 23 November and with the scrutiny on touring cricketers at its highest. The selectors were already facing a tough meeting in London on Tuesday afternoon, with the batting lineup of particular concern."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/26/cover-versions-why-are-uk-and-us-book-jackets-often-so-different","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T13:30:05Z","webTitle":"Cover versions: why are UK and US book jackets often so different?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/26/cover-versions-why-are-uk-and-us-book-jackets-often-so-different","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/26/cover-versions-why-are-uk-and-us-book-jackets-often-so-different","fields":{"headline":"Cover versions: why are UK and US book jackets often so different?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Covers sell books. But in the case of Hillary Clinton’s memoir What Happened, you can’t help thinking that the book’s sales in the UK are despite the jacket treatment, not because of it. Whereas the US jacket oozes the gravitas you expect from the woman who stood up to Donald Trump, the UK jacket has all the power of a shrugged “meh”. The book is published worldwide by Simon &amp; Schuster, and the company’s US division opted for bold lettering on a white-and-blue background (incorporating the Democrats’ traditional colour). The design screams its serious credentials: this, it tells the reader, is The Book by the woman everyone expected to be a shoo-in for the Oval Office, a woman defined by her service in husband Bill’s and Barack Obama’s administrations. It is a cover worthy of the memoir that has a place in academic libraries. Weight is given to the title, What Happened. A simple statement, it hangs above Clinton’s name, reflecting the question on the lips of everyone who awoke on 9 November to find Donald Trump was soon to get access to the nuclear codes. But the UK cover … where do you begin? Any sense that Clinton is laying it on the line, or even offering answers, is washed away by a design so hackneyed it even has a generic politico-at-a-rally headshot, albeit one in which Hillary’s firm-lipped expression is reminiscent of the look your mum gave you the first time you barrelled home drunk. Not only that, but the background colour is as pallid as one of her pant suits, and the title – a question on the lips of everyone in the UK as well as the US – is squirrelled away beneath her name. When I ask, “What happened?” her publisher responds with a terse refusal to comment. But it raises the question: why did the Americans get it right and the British so wrong when UK book design is supposedly the envy of the world? One jacket designer, Stuart Bache, says the gulf between British and US design has narrowed in recent years, especially in literary fiction. Traditionally, US design tended towards literal interpretation, driven, Bache believes, by the complexity of the US market: the image that motivates readers in southern California to pick up a copy of a book is likely to be different to what appeals to readers in South Carolina. As a result, US jackets have tended to appeal to the lowest common denominator, and that does not make for good design. “It’s a complicated [market], so the design becomes simpler and focuses on broader appeal,” Bache says. “However, things have shifted in the last few years,” he adds. “There are a lot more similarities now, particularly in literary novels where the luxury of creating much more elegant, beautiful covers has been afforded to the books.” The designer and illustrator Neil Gower believes US designers have upped their game because of the explosion in digital books. “I think ebooks and the internet have definitely focused publishers’ attention on making books beautiful, covetable objects again,” he says. Publishers on both sides of the Atlantic realise that to justify the cost of a hardback, a book needs to be more than a container of words. It has to be an object of beauty in its own right, he says. Aided by advances in print technology, British and US designers are playing with things such as spot-varnishes, embossing, debossing and foils to make books physically arresting, tactile objects. Gower says: “The brief for my own book, As Kingfishers Catch Fire – in collaboration with Alex Preston – was to produce the most beautiful book of 2017, and the attention to detail extended way beyond the cover to the endpapers, the quality of the paper and colour-plates. I feel privileged to be designing books in this era.” Similar ideas are appearing on both sides of the Atlantic: hand-drawn typography, bold colours and a handcrafted feel to the illustrations. Images are de rigueur. And, says Jason Arthur, a publishing director based in the UK at Penguin Random House, US designers are leaping at the creative opportunities. “I used to think British book design was the best in the world and that the Americans were 20 years behind,” he says. “But that has changed in the last two or three years, especially with fiction from the US that put our designs to shame.” Arthur knows what he is talking about. His division of Penguin Random House has been responsible for jackets that have left US editions looking dowdy. A case in point was the UK edition of Harper Lee’s late bloomer Go Set a Watchman, which cleverly integrated the title of To Kill a Mockingbird, with a nod to 50s film posters. It veers on the right side of nostalgia. Not so the US cover by Jarrod Taylor. Drab blue with the Caterina typeface – which, despite the retro feel, is less than 20 years old – it is as appealing as a book gathering dust at the back of the school library. It falls on the wrong side of that nostalgia line. One designer, Paul Sahre, told Wired the cover was “a pastiche and a parody”. One book a US designer got right was George Saunders’ novel Lincoln in the Bardo, says Arthur. The hardback, designed by Barbara M Bachman, features a pastoral cover illustration that Saunders himself praised for its “feeling of mystery”. “It wasn’t just a picture of Lincoln,” he told New York magazine’s Vulture. “I see it as being at dusk, and I thought it picked up the feeling of America in the mid-19th century – half pastoral, half burgeoning industrial.” Saunders didn’t say what he thought of the UK cover, but one can’t help thinking he would have been disappointed. With its spindle of branches and portrait of Abe Lincoln’s son, it reveals little about the book, but plenty about the present obsession of British designers with William Morris – typified by Sarah Perry’s bestselling The Essex Serpent. That a jacket should reveal something about the content is often the beef authors have with designs, which explains why many seem more relaxed with their US covers than their UK ones. By telling the story – or at least hinting at it – there is less likelihood the jacket will be interchangeable with everything else in their section of WH Smith. Mick Herron, whose Jackson Lamb novels were first published by Soho in the US before becoming a word-of-mouth hit here, says the US design clearly positions the books for US readers whose knowledge of British spies might only extend to James Bond. “The two recent ones have a sniper-scope emblem, which doesn’t actually reflect anything in the content, but gets a basic message across,” says the Newcastle-born writer. “I don’t really get consulted at all,” he adds, and is happy to leave it to his publisher. “I don’t have much of an eye for that sort of thing.” Not everyone is so laid-back about covers, and with good reason. As the novelist Jane Harris explains, gender can make a huge difference to how a book is packaged on both sides of the Atlantic. “If you are a woman writer, they seem to always want to put a woman on the cover,” she says. So determined was she that this should not happen to her latest novel, Sugar Money – about two brothers sent to Grenada to reclaim 42 slaves for their French master – that when she finished the final chapter, she tweeted: “Put a woman on the cover of this, suckers.” Her publisher, Faber, delivered: in the UK the books has an abstract design of sugar cane in eye-popping black, red and gold. But Harris is not hopeful the design will be taken up in the US. “They seem to be wary of anything that is in any way abstract, or risks being confusing,” she says. “If you are writing about slavery, they will want to put a cliched image on the cover.” In recent years in the US and UK, the people with most influence over a book jacket have been those who choose stock for supermarkets and chains such as Waterstones and WH Smith. A few years ago, a publisher at one of the “big three” houses (Penguin Random House, Hachette and HarperCollins) told me that they had presented a new book at a meeting with the buyer from a well-known retailer. An order from the chain could propel the book into the Top 10, but there was a problem: they hated the jacket. The publisher returned to her art department and commissioned a second design. Again, the buyer rejected it – the cover was still wrong. In all, the publisher had the jacket redesigned five times, until, as a joke, she took the original cover back to the buyer, who asked: “Why didn’t you bring me this first? I love it.” The story is telling of publishers’ secret contempt for the retailers they must woo. Whatever creative inspiration designers may have, what matters more to some retailers is that the average punter will know what “type” of book they are getting, hence the number of books with Jack Reacher-style silhouetted men on the cover, or Fifty Shades wannabes with muted pictures of fishnets and ties. This tendency to avoid originality does backfire. One novelist, who asked not to be named, complains bitterly that a mutilated doll on the cover of her book in the US killed her career there. “It had no direct relevance to the content, and suggested the story is far creepier than in fact it was,” she says. “I was dropped by the publisher because the book didn’t sell. I can’t help feeling the cover did the book no favours and was actually off-putting.” Her situation is becoming less common, says Jason Arthur, and he believes that a new generation of US designers is producing world-beating work. “There is a younger generation coming through who are more outward-looking in inspiration,” he says. These designers are as inspired by gaming and film as they are books, and their work reflects this broadening of viewpoints. And, he adds, this improvement means that more US designs are making it into British bookshops. He cites The Readymade Thief by Augustus Rose as one example. “We saw the US cover and liked it, and came up with 20 different jacket designs of our own, but the American jacket was the best, so we decided to go with that.” It’s just a pity that no one thought this about Clinton’s memoir."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/26/a-feeble-no-may-mean-yes-indian-court-overturns-conviction","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T14:50:02Z","webTitle":"'A feeble no may mean yes': Indian court overturns rape conviction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/26/a-feeble-no-may-mean-yes-indian-court-overturns-conviction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/26/a-feeble-no-may-mean-yes-indian-court-overturns-conviction","fields":{"headline":"'A feeble no may mean yes': Indian court overturns rape conviction","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"An Indian court has overturned a rape conviction against a film director, ruling that a “feeble no” can signal consent, especially in cases where the alleged victim is well-educated. Women’s rights activists said the decision “muddies the water” around consent in a country struggling to curb high levels of sexual violence, rampant street harassment and deeply entrenched patriarchal attitudes towards sex. Mahmood Farooqui was sentenced to seven years in prison in 2016 for sexually assaulting an American postgraduate student while she was visiting his home in Delhi. The woman claimed Farooqui, the co-director of the 2010 Bollywood film Peepli Live, forced himself on to her while drunk, ignored her when she repeatedly said no and restrained her arms when she tried to prevent him from removing her clothes. Appealing against the decision in Delhi’s high court, lawyers for Farooqui argued that the encounter never took place and that if it had, he had not been aware the victim did not consent. Justice Ashutosh Kumar overturned the conviction on Monday, concluding he had to give “the benefit of the doubt” to Farooqui on both arguments. He found it was unclear whether Farooqui had known the alleged victim did not consent because, even though she testified that she had repeatedly said no to his advances and tried to physically resist, she accepted she had ultimately gone along with it. “Instances of woman behaviour are not unknown that a feeble no may mean a yes,” he said. Karuna Nundy, a supreme court lawyer who advised on India’s most recent reform of sexual assault laws, said she was concerned about the precedent the judgment set. “It muddies the waters and will confuse a lot of the issues around consent,” she said. “What the law says is that consent may be silent, it may be non-verbal, but it has to be unequivocal. And so when somebody says no – even when you think it’s feeble – and there is no subsequent unequivocal yes, then there is no consent.” The alleged victim told the court she stopped resisting out of fear she could be harmed in the same manner as a Delhi physiotherapy student whose rape and murder in 2012 sparked international protests. Farooqui only released her when she feigned an orgasm in order to persuade him to stop, she said. The judge said the alleged victim’s conduct would have sent Farooqui a message that she consented, “even though wrongly and mistakenly”. “What [Farooqui] has been communicated is … that the [alleged victim] is OK with it and has participated in the act,” he said. The judge argued that “in an act of passion, actuated by libido,” consent could be complex, “and it may not necessarily always mean yes in case of yes or no in case of no”. He said a firm no was not necessarily required in cases where the people involved were strangers, “in some kind of prohibited relationship” or if one of the parties was “a conservative person”. “But [the] same would not be the situation when parties are known to each other, are persons of letters and are intellectually/academically proficient, and if in the past there have been physical contacts,” he said. “In such cases, it would be really difficult to decipher whether little or no resistance and a feeble no was actually a denial of consent.” The Times of India criticised the decision in an editorial, arguing that the court may have “set a potentially dangerous precedent that a no does not always necessarily mean no”. It said: “It is easy to see defence lawyers lapping this up in cases of rape and other sexual offences even where there the alleged victim has explicitly said no to argue that the accused may not have perceived it as a firm no. It is a slippery slope the court should have avoided stepping on to.” Vrinda Grover, the lawyer for the alleged victim, said the decision was “dishonest in law and fact”. An appeal will be filed in the Indian supreme court. It is the second legal decision to draw outrage in recent days, after three law students were granted bail last week while appealing against a sexual assault conviction from March. The students were convicted of using nude photographs of a woman to blackmail her into having sex with them over an 18-month period. Releasing the students on bail, the Punjab and Haryana high court said the victim’s behaviour could be interpreted as a “misadventure stemming from a promiscuous attitude and a voyeuristic mind”. The court said her story did not “throw up gut-wrenching violence that normally precede or accompany such incidents”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/26/charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory-began-as-anti-racist-novel-claims-academic","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T12:25:06Z","webTitle":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory began as 'anti-racist novel', claims academic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/26/charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory-began-as-anti-racist-novel-claims-academic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/26/charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory-began-as-anti-racist-novel-claims-academic","fields":{"headline":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory began as 'anti-racist novel', claims academic","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"An early draft of Roald Dahl’s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory not only starred a black version of Charlie Bucket, it saw the character trapped in a life-size chocolate mould of a boy as a “metaphor for racial stereotype”, according to research by an American academic. Dahl’s widow, Liccy Dahl, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme last week of how her husband had wanted Charlie to be “a little black boy”. His biographer, Donald Sturrock, added that the idea had been rejected by Dahl’s agent, but no further details were provided about the discarded storyline. Now Catherine Keyser, a professor of English at the University of South Carolina, has told the New York Times about the original plot of Dahl’s draft, Charlie’s Chocolate Boy. According to Keyser, the setup is similar to Dahl’s bestseller, with a magical chocolate factory owned by “Willie” Wonka, and children vying for a golden ticket to visit it. But Augustus Gloop was named Augustus Pottle and there were two more children: Marvin Prune and Miranda Piker. “And of course Charlie Bucket – who in this version is a black boy, and is accompanied by his two doting parents,” Keyser said. Charlie, she added, “ends up in the Easter Room, where there are life-size candy moulds of creatures, and one of these is shaped like a chocolate boy. Charlie is fascinated by this. Wonka helps him into the mould and gets distracted. The mould closes, and the chocolate pours over his body and he is suffocating and nearly drowning in it. It hardens around him, which feels terrible. He’s trapped. He’s alive but can’t be seen or heard. No one knows where he’s gone. Then he gets taken to Wonka’s house to be the chocolate boy in Wonka’s son’s Easter basket.” The next day, burglars attempt to steal money and jewellery from the Wonkas’ house – in this version, Mr Wonka is married – but Charlie, hidden in his mould, manages to prevent the robbery. In return, he is given a shop in the city, which he names Charlie’s Chocolate Shop. Keyser said that although the story was mentioned by Sturrock and in Lucy Mangan’s Inside Charlie’s Chocolate Factory, it “had never been looked at in great textual detail” before her analysis. She said that she loved the “vulnerability and the potential” of the early draft, describing it as “a really powerful racial allegory”. “I think the mould … is a metaphor for racial stereotype. In the early 20th century, chocolate marketing in both the US and England was very tied up in imperialist fantasies and in connecting brown skin with brown chocolate. In one British ad for chocolate, for example, you had a black figure holding a cocoa bean and happily bestowing it on white children,” she said. “So I think it’s neat that in this mid-century moment Dahl has this black boy get stuck inside a mould that fits him perfectly – he emphasises that – everything about the mould fits Charlie, except [that] once the chocolate inside the mould hardens, it’s uncomfortable! So what better symbol of what it’s like to be turned into a racial stereotype than a black boy who gets stuck inside a life-size chocolate mould and can’t be seen or heard through this chocolate coating.” Dahl, however, was told by his agent not to make Charlie black. He then went on to dream up the Oompa Loompas, which were originally written as a tribe of African pygmies, prompting accusations of racism and colonialism. Dahl rewrote them to be from “Loompaland” in subsequent editions, with rosy-white skin and golden-brown hair. “I think this arc – from what I find to be a fairly anti-racist novel to one that has been rightly criticised for its racist and imperialist politics – [shows] Dahl’s ambivalence,” said Keyser. “I think that’s the power of racism; to make someone able to hold these contradictory views at once. To both identify with the underdog and seem to understand the pain of stereotype, but then be completely flummoxed that anyone finds the Oompa Loompas offensive. He was genuinely surprised and very annoyed. So I don’t mean for this to whitewash Dahl’s racial politics. I just really love the vulnerability and the potential in this first draft.” Charlie and the Chocolate Factory went on to be published in 1964. It is now estimated to have sold more than 20m copies around the world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/28/more-than-a-million-people-join-ranks-of-very-wealthy-after-stock-markets-boom","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T03:30:27Z","webTitle":"More than a million people join ranks of very wealthy after stock markets boom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/28/more-than-a-million-people-join-ranks-of-very-wealthy-after-stock-markets-boom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/28/more-than-a-million-people-join-ranks-of-very-wealthy-after-stock-markets-boom","fields":{"headline":"More than a million people join ranks of very wealthy after stock markets boom","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"More than 1 million people entered the global ranks of the wealthy last year as booming stock markets increased the number of individuals with free assets of more than $1m (£750,000) to a record 16.5 million. Research by the business consultancy Capgemini found that the world’s high net worth individuals (HNWI) collectively hold a $63.5tn fortune. In order to qualify as an HNWI, a person’s assets – excluding their primary residence and its contents – must be worth at least $1m. More than 1.1 million people saw their cash fortunes tip them into the HNWI bracket over 2016 as investments in shares in US and European markets performed well. The ranks of HNWIs grew by 8.2% in 2016, up from 6.5% annualised growth over the previous five years. Cliff Evans, one of Capgemini’s researchers, said the report showed that the already-rich were getting richer at a much faster rate than the wider population. “For people with a lot of money the service they’re getting from investment managers is proving its worth,” he said. “If you can afford the advice you get a much greater return.” The report found that HNWIs earned average returns of 24.3% on their portfolios that were overseen by a wealth manager in 2016. This compares with average interest rates of just 0.35% offered by instant-access high street bank accounts, according to the Bank of England. It comes as a growing number of politicians, economists and even the super-wealthy themselves are speaking out about the dangers of growing inequality across the world. Four International Monetary Fund (IMF) economists warned that inequality “can fray social cohesion and undermine the sustainability of growth itself”. “Inequality has risen in several advanced economies and remains stubbornly high in many that are still developing,” they said. “This worries policymakers everywhere for good reason. Research at the IMF and elsewhere makes it clear that persistent lack of inclusion – defined as broadly shared benefits and opportunities for economic growth – can fray social cohesion and undermine the sustainability of growth itself.” Ray Dalio, the multibillionaire founder of the world’s biggest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, said this week that inequality was the globe’s biggest problem. “I think the greatest issue of our time is the disparity of wealth and the problems that exist for the lower 40% of the population,” he said. “If you carve out that lower 40%, not only has there been no income growth, but death rates are rising because of opiate use, suicide, and because they’re losing jobs. “This is the biggest issue of our time – the biggest economic issue, the biggest political issue, and the biggest social issue.” The Capgemini report said there are now 14.9 million “millionaires next door” – Capgemini’s term for those with investable assets of between $1m and $5m. This group grew by 7.4% in 2016. The rate at which rich people tipped over the threshold to become ultra high net worth individuals – people with investable assets of more than $30m – grew at 8.3%. This was more than double the increase in 2015 and there are now 157,200 people in the ultra-HNWI bracket, according to the survey. These people collectively hold $22tn of assets – almost 10 times the UK’s gross domestic product. “Ultra-HNWIs, with $30m or more in investable assets, posted striking improvements in wealth and population, thanks in part to an upswing in Latin American economic performance,” the report said. “Because Latin America accounts for more ultra-HNWI wealth than any other region, it holds significant sway over the segment’s overall growth.” Vibrant growth in Latin America helped lift global ultra-HNWI wealth by 9.2%, up from an increase of 2.5% in 2015. The UK dropped out of the world’s top five countries that HNWIs call home, with France pushing Britain into sixth place.

The intimation was clear: it was her mother’s job to fix this little glitch. By “money”, she meant her entire term’s student maintenance allowance of about £1,200. Gone. In 14 days. I didn’t know what to say, so I just said, “Gosh.” I put the phone down and called her brother, who was at a less illustrious seat of learning in a more expensive part of the country. How much do you need to live on? He told me. It wasn’t the £600 a week it apparently cost his sister. I called her back and sternly told her that she had spent too much, that I was not about to bail her out and that we needed to make a plan. She forlornly agreed and, within a day or so, proffered an arrangement. And her bank statements: I needed to see where this kind of cash was going. If I would pay for two May ball tickets, she suggested, she would auction one, pay me back for both, and live on the (slim) profits for the balance of term. Her food and board were paid for; I knew she would neither go homeless nor hungry. I agreed. True to her word, she paid me back, then ditched the Patisserie Valerie cakes, designer coffee and expensive lingerie habit she was cultivating. Instead, she developed an appreciation for her mother’s proclivity to buy supermarket-own brands and cheap shampoo, hitherto mocked as mean. When I related this tale with glee to friends, they were shocked. I ought, they said, to have been more sympathetic, helped her out. Well, I could have eased the pain by nudging a couple of hundred in her direction. But why? I’d only be condoning her spending spree while ignoring her brother’s shrewd budgeting and, anyway, if I couldn’t afford to waste money on expensive pastries and chichi undies, neither could she. My daughter learned a valuable lesson. But so did I. It wasn’t an easy decision. I battled to say no, had uneasy nights, fretted she’d get hungry, cold, feel like a social outcast, and hate me for my meanness. But it was a lesson: you can say no and your children don’t hate you (not for long, anyway). The sky does not fall on your head. Richard Watts, a US-based lawyer who counsels the rich and famous and who has published Entitlemania: How Not to Spoil Your Kids, and What to Do if You Have, knows this. Saying no won’t kill you or your kids, he says. It can in fact, be a good tool. I was reminded of this during a conversation with a friend – the sort of friend who’s never reduced her university-going offspring to a term of foraging and forced sobriety, partly because she’s kinder than me, partly because she’s richer than me, mostly because she cares more of what others think of her than I do. Her similarly glossy children wear designer clothes, play tennis with designer rackets and run in designer trainers. She confided that, even when money was tight, it remained imperative that her four (four!) children still got what they wanted, what their friends had. When I generously shared my parenting philosophy with her, she sternly told me I was wrong: “Why do you make your children suffer for your failings?” My “failing” presumably being my lack of disposable income. “Children must have the things they need and want; that’s your job as a parent, to make sure they get them.” Need and want? This is another part of the problem, says Watts: “There’s a huge disparity between need and want: I need a new phone, I want the new iPhone 8.” Spot the difference? The richest person in the world, he says – and he should know – “does not have the most: they need the least”. This sounds a little sanctimonious but he’s right. I can’t have whatever I want. And I work. Why on earth should my kids? And, anyway, turning a need into a want provides an excellent exercise in incentivising, in identifying passions, in focusing the attention. “If you want to upgrade your phone to an iPhone 8, how about making some money so you can afford it?” asks Watts. I never did that, exactly, but I did encourage my younger daughter towards a job cleaning loos in the local youth hostel so she could afford a holiday in Spain. Nothing in the world feels as sweet as making your own money – don’t take that away from your kids. And they will never, ever spend your money as wisely as they spend what they earn themselves. My daughter carefully logs her expenditure on an Excel spreadsheet these days, drinks instant coffee and has an appreciation of the economy of Tesco five-pack pants. Parents don’t just spoil their kids by giving too much, says Watts, they spoil them by taking away the struggle. Unwittingly, I had got it right: I bestowed on my daughter a valuable gift by ensuring she stayed well and truly broke. In denying our kids the opportunity to battle (financially, emotionally), we’re robbing them of the chance to grow. In the end, overindulgence will catch up with them – and we may be gone, no longer around to prop them up or bail them out. In spoiling them, by giving them stuff and easing their way in the world, we might not have allowed them to grow the backbone to gain professional success on their own merit, or forge and sustain happy relationships, or even stay out of the red. Instead, warns Watts, they will be bouncing back to you, demanding to know why you never taught them how to stand on their own two feet. Nor will they know how to say no to their own kids. Give your children memories instead of stuff, advises Watts. And, while I agree this is another rather self-righteous-sounding parenting tip, I do know how memories can round a kid off in a way that accumulating a designer wardrobe and an enviable Apple collection cannot. I also know that I have granted my daughter a valuable memory. How she chooses to relate the tale of her mother turning off the money tap to her own children one day – “My brilliant mother knew that I needed a lesson in managing my finances / My mum was such a mean old cow she refused to bail me out when I overspent a little” – doesn’t matter. What does is that she will never, ever forget it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/26/media-brexit-labour-party-activists","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T11:15:16Z","webTitle":"As the media obsess over Brexit, they’re missing Labour’s revolution | Owen Jones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/26/media-brexit-labour-party-activists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/26/media-brexit-labour-party-activists","fields":{"headline":"As the media obsess over Brexit, they’re missing Labour’s revolution","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A peaceful revolution by the beach: that’s the scene at Labour’s Brighton conference. People who were marginalised, ignored and disparaged by British politics are now the masters of the official opposition. The mood last year was flat; this year, pulsing with energy. The delegates don’t know when an election will be called – but then, the prime minister can’t be sure either. This year the upbeat mood is borne out in the conviction that the party has every chance of marching into government – and with the most transformative agenda since Clement Attlee. Momentum has been disparaged and demonised by the much of the press, but it has spearheaded Labour’s dramatic transformation. The conference fringe used to be a dry, rather technocratic affair, dominated by top tables of “experts”, MPs and flat question-and-answer sessions. Momentum’s The World Transformed has discussions on everything from the nature of work, the housing crisis and rebuilding Britain’s democracy to the challenges facing a radical left government. But it’s done in a participatory way: meetings break out into groups to discuss and debate the issue at hand. Activists were once treated as embarrassments, useful only to stuff leaflets into letter boxes. The focus now is on empowerment: activists debate how to give members the confidence to organise in their local parties, stand as candidates and have conversations on the doorstep that go beyond asking people for their voter ID. And when you speak to the delegates and observers at conference, there is a genuine sense that they feel they have now displaced the old party establishment. It would be easy to miss this unfolding revolution. The media focus has been on, for example, the lack of a vote after the debate on Brexit. Cards on the table: I’d like Britain to stay in the single market and the customs union. That’s the view of most Labour members. John McDonnell’s announcement that there are negotiations about reforming the single market to prevent rules blocking Labour’s ambitious policies is promising. But there is very little dissent here about the lack of a vote at this stage. Many of the people here in Brighton have waited decades to see the Labour party adopt policies such as public ownership – including seeking to end the disaster of PFI – and taxing the rich to pay for state-led investment. They want the message from conference to be unity around a transformative socialist spirit. Like it or not, they fear that historic achievement would be eclipsed by a divisive vote on Brexit at this stage – they want a long suppressed social democracy to have its time in the sun. Labour is not yet in power, and there does need to be more wide-ranging debate about how the party, for example, wins over more older people and gets more young people out to vote There needs to be more debate, too, about what challenges would confront the most radical government since Attlee. There is always the danger of excitement being snuffed out by what could be years of opposition to come. But witnessing Labour’s peaceful revolution unfold, it’s clear that this is a historic moment in British politics. What precedents are there for one of the two main parties in a western nation to be transformed like this, from the bottom up? The peaceful revolution is sweeping all before it in the Labour party. The challenge now is whether it can take that peaceful revolution to the country. • Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"inequality/2017/sep/27/how-well-have-racial-quotas-worked-around-the-world","type":"article","sectionId":"inequality","sectionName":"Inequality","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T10:53:57Z","webTitle":"How well have racial quotas worked around the world?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/sep/27/how-well-have-racial-quotas-worked-around-the-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/inequality/2017/sep/27/how-well-have-racial-quotas-worked-around-the-world","fields":{"headline":"How well have racial quotas worked around the world?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The sacking of two American football head coaches in 2001 – Dennis Green of the Minnesota Vikings and Tony Dungy of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers – left only two black NFL head coaches out of 32, and prompted black and ethnic minority voices within the sport to demand change. This led to the establishment of the widely admired “Rooney Rule” in 2003. Named after the late Dan Rooney, former owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers and the US’s ambassador to Ireland during Barack Obama’s presidency, the regulation requires NFL teams to interview at least one minority candidate for all head coach and general manager roles. Its impact has been one of the defining features of the NFL over the last 15 years. Since 2007, 10 Super Bowl finalists have had a minority head coach or general manager. Two years after the rule was adopted, the number of BAME head coaches in the NFL had risen from two to six, and now roughly 25% of the head coaches are from minority backgrounds. Last February, the NFL announced the rule was being extended to include women for certain roles, building on the success of a policy that has been imitated in organisations around the world. However, English football’s Premier League – which currently has one BAME manager, Chris Hughton at Brighton, out of 20 teams – has repeatedly denied the need for such a rule, with its chief-executive Peter Scudamore observing: “In America, it is a different sport and a different country.” Last June, the English Football League did approve proposals to introduce a Rooney Rule for academy jobs, with 10 clubs voluntarily extending the policy to include first-team management roles. But in the eight times a manager has subsequently been recruited, the rule was only applied twice, with none leading to a BAME appointment. There are currently only two BAME managers out of 72 clubs in the EFL, despite more than a quarter of players being from minority backgrounds. In France in 2011, an illegal and unofficial quota was alleged to have been attempted to reduce minority numbers in the national football teams. A French Football Federation official secretly recorded a meeting the year before, where officials appeared to suggest limiting the proportion of black players and those of north African origin to 30% in younger age groups. The crisis sparked by the allegations was heightened by quotes from the then-French coach, Laurent Blanc describing black players in stereotypical terms. He suggested other criteria should be used to bring in players “with our culture, our history”. An investigation found that no such quota existed, but to many the comments highlighted racial prejudices in French football and society. Education flashpoint In the United States, “race quotas” are illegal – but using race as a factor in enrolment or recruitment is not. In 1996, however, the California state government introduced a ban on affirmative action policies, Proposition 209, which remains a profound flashpoint in the US. At the University of California, Berkeley, black and Hispanic enrolment fell from 24% to 13% within two years, prompting protests with hundreds of students staging walkouts and holding rallies. Across the US, legal challenges to affirmative action programs have persisted. In 2015, Abigail Fisher took a legal case against the University of Texas to the Supreme Court, arguing that as a white woman she had lost out on a place due to preferential treatment given to black and minority students. Like numerous cases before hers, the Supreme Court upheld UT’s policies, judging that affirmative action that considers race is constitutional. France’s most elite university, Institut d’Études Politiques de Paris (commonly known as Sciences Po), introduced affirmative action in admission in 2001. The policy, the first by a French university, ensures the best students from roughly 100 of the country’s worst-performing public schools are assessed without requiring the standard entrance examination. A study by the university in 2011, tracking 860 of these “priority” students and graduates who had left between 2006 and 2011, found they performed on a par with their peers academically. In August 2012, Brazil adopted sweeping quotas reserving 50% of student places in all 59 state universities for students of African or Indigenous descent. The policy sought to reverse inequalities of access to university in a country with a complex racial history and identity. While university access is virtually free, the majority of students admitted had been from private schools dominated by white students. The full impact of the policy is not yet conclusive – but it has sparked controversy. Last year the prestigious Federal University of Pelotas expelled a group of 24 white students who were accused of “defrauding the affirmative action system”. World’s oldest affirmative action policy India’s “reservation” policy is acknowledged as the world’s oldest affirmative action policy. Adopted officially in 1950, it was designed to address the prejudices of India’s caste system, setting quotas for in education, the workplace and positions of governance. The policy was initially aimed at “scheduled tribes”, castes who live in remote areas, and particularly Dalits, the lowest rung of the Hindu caste system. The quotas, which vary across India, have been partly successful. In 1965, Dalits occupied 1.6% of the most senior positions in the civil service. By 2011, that had risen to almost 12%, just 4% lower than their 16% population share in India. Despite this progress, oppression of Dalits remains a defining feature of India’s social structure. The application of the reservation policy has broadened to include low and middle castes over time, with ethnic politics playing a part in who benefits across the country. In the north east, home to so-called “backward classes”, over 80% of government jobs come under the quota system, far more than the initial target of 50%. Race quotas have also been woven into Malaysian society since 1971, when ethnic Chinese and Indians dominated the upper classes as a legacy of British rule. Sweeping changes were introduced under the New Economic Policy, designed to ensure the majority Malays would no longer be discriminated against. These quotas still persist across the public sector, in NGOs and elements of the business sector, but have become contentious. While the policy has boosted the number of Malays getting places in universities or on company boards, many suggest only the financial elite have benefited, with the poor majority and ethnic minorities missing out. Ethnic quotas in government-funded universities officially ended in 2002, but minority groups claim the policy still exists in practice.

By general consensus this was a relatively benign plain. The clue word (new to me) is something of a curiosity. The OED labels it ‘rare’, its only citations being from the eighteenth century. I certainly can’t imagine anyone using it today without appearing insufferably pretentious. Maybe as the result of a certain nervousness at the word’s classical derivation, quite a number of clues submitted failed to indicate its plurality or even that it is a noun. Many also, I thought, failed adequately to indicate the gerundive aspect of the word, meaning not just things that are there to be seen, but need or deserve to be seen. In this context, Mr Millin’s clue above was on the borderline, on the grounds that David Lean’s films, even if churned out, could usually be recommended as worth seeing, the latter part of the clue making the whole a sort of semi ‘&amp; lit.’. Polite request time. May I gently remind you that you are asked to attach your clue sheet firmly to the completed grid, and always make sure that your name and address are on the sheet with your clue on it, as well as below the grid itself.

They reduce the task of navigating hundreds or even thousands of miles of transport routes to simply glancing at an image. However, understanding a city’s transit frequency – how often the trains and buses run along those routes – is not nearly as easy, and typically requires scanning through pages of timetables. How can cities make their transit frequencies as simple and intuitive to understand as their routes? Columbia University grad student Will Geary offers a solution: TransitFlow, an experimental set of tools for building animated transport frequency maps. “Transit frequency is hard to visualise using timetables,” says Geary, who built TransitFlow while interning this summer at mapping startup Mapzen. “Timetables provide information about frequency but can be overwhelming, unintuitive and lacking geographic context.” TransitFlow collects transport routes and schedules from Transitland, Mapzen’s open source repository of travel data, and brings it to life as animated maps. The result is hypnotic. The transit flows are visualised as colourful particles flowing across the city in patterns that resemble the coordinated motion of a colony of ants. Examples from five cities are shown below. New York City New York is a city that never sleeps, and its public transit is no exception. The volume of activity ebbs and flows throughout the day, but even during the lowest point in the early morning, the city’s transportation network remains abuzz with activity. The area chart below the map summarises the transit volume by time of day and mode of transport. The measure shown is the total number of vehicles in motion, not to be confused with the number of passengers. Though there are far more buses (blue) in operation than subway trains (red), the subway remains New Yorkers’ transportation mode of choice with an average weekday ridership of over 5 million, more than double the ridership of buses. Rome In contrast to New York’s fluctuating transportation volume, Rome’s transit frequencies remain remarkably flat throughout the day before slowing down to a steady near-standstill at night. Boston Boston boasts a diverse mix of transportation systems that includes buses, light rail, subways, trains and ferries. Geographically, the motion follows a clear hub and spokes pattern, with all lines converging at a single central point.

Personality quiz","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Compassion is generally thought of as something that we show (or don’t show) to others. But recently psychologists have become increasingly interested in self-compassion. Do you go easy on yourself, or beat yourself up over the slightest slip-up? To find out, rate your agreement with the following statements on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), then add up these numbers to find your total self-compassion score. (a) I accept that I can’t be perfect in everything I do (self kindness). (b) We all make mistakes sometimes (common humanity). (c) I don’t dwell overly on my failures (mindfulness). If you scored 10 or more, then you are more self-compassionate than the average person (or, at least, the average participant in a US-based study led by Kristin Homan. If you totalled 9 or less, you are not as compassionate as average. Either way, your score could have important implications for your health. Homan and her collaborator Fuschia Sirois of the University of Sheffield found that higher levels of self-compassion were associated with better physical health. Why? First, the self-compassionate suffer from lower levels of stress. Second, other studies have shown that the self-compassionate are more likely to eat healthily, to stick to diets, to exercise, to abstain from smoking, to go to the doctor and to follow doctors’ orders. So to stay healthy, go easy on yourself.

In a separate row to the gender pay dispute at the BBC, the corporation has faced growing frustration among staff at the World Service and Monitoring about how much less they are paid than presenters, reporters and producers on the BBC’s network news, which includes flagship programmes such as News at Ten. Sources have told the Guardian that presenters on the World Service were shocked when the publication of the BBC’s pay list in July revealed that presenters of network news such as Huw Edwards were earning as much as almost £600,000 while many of them were paid less than £50,000 a year. The new pay rise will apply to around 700 staff at the World Service and BBC Monitoring, which tracks news from other providers around the world for BBC staff, the UK government and commercial subscribers. On average, staff will receive an increase of 8%. This will be funded through what the BBC described as “wider efficiencies” – effectively cost-cutting – in the news division. The increase has been announced after a review by the accountancy firm PwC found that on average there was an 8% difference in pay between World Service and Monitoring staff and network news employees in equivalent roles. The report split staff up into 12 different groups based on their roles and found there was disparities with network news in half of them. PwC blamed the disparity on “historic and economic reasons”. World Service and Monitoring used to operate separately from the BBC and were funded by the government, but in 2014 they were integrated with the rest of the news department. The report also said network news staff operated in a “different market environment” with a “wider range of career opportunities available to them, both inside and outside the BBC”. One source said the pay rise was long overdue. However, it is unlikely to fully quell the anger. There are just under 4,000 employees at the World Service and Monitoring, and less than one in five will receive the pay rise. The BBC said the increase would apply only to off-air staff in the UK, such as producers, with the remuneration of presenters and on-air journalists to be addressed as part of a wider review of how much it pays on-air talent. The disparity for some roles is also larger than 8%. A freedom of information request this year revealed that the average salary of a senior broadcast journalist at the World Service was more than 10% less than on network news – £38,037 compared with £44,023. Tony Hall, the director- general of the BBC, has described the World Service as the “jewel in the crown” of the corporation. It operates in more than 30 languages and has a weekly audience of 269 million. Some presenters, particularly those working on African services such as Salim Kikeke on BBC Swahili, are followed by millions of people on social media. The World Service is undergoing its biggest expansion since the 1940s, including the launch this week of a Korean service aimed at people in North Korea, which is opposed by the North Korean government. The BBC revealed last month that it had been told “in no uncertain terms” by the North Korean embassy in London that they did not want the Korean service to be launched. The BBC Korean radio service broadcasts at night and the BBC said it was getting through to listeners “for the most part” despite attempts by the North Korean government to jam foreign broadcasts. The US human rights group Freedom House ranks North Korea as the second worst country in the world for censorship after Turkmenistan. James Harding, the director of BBC News and current affairs, said he wanted the World Service and network news to work more closely together on investigations, reporting and breaking news. He said: “We are all keenly aware of our responsibility to the licence fee payer, seeking to provide the highest-quality services at the best possible value for money. So we have considered carefully the argument that internal and external market forces should continue to be factors setting World Service and BBC Monitoring pay. “We want a BBC where people move around and between our newsrooms. We believe a wider range of voices at work across BBC News will ensure we reach more stories and keep connected to everyone. To help make this happen, we have decided to align median pay.” The wider review regarding the pay of on-air staff was sparked by the fallout from the publication of the BBC’s list of top earners in the summer. The list revealed that just a third of the best-paid stars were women and the top seven earners were all men. The BBC is expected to make further announcements regarding the pay of presenters and the measures it will take to ensure equal pay for equal jobs in the coming months."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/01/tesla-model-x-car-review-electric-suv-the-volume-goes-up-to-11","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T05:00:08Z","webTitle":"Tesla Model X review: ‘The volume goes up to 11’ | Martin love","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/01/tesla-model-x-car-review-electric-suv-the-volume-goes-up-to-11","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/01/tesla-model-x-car-review-electric-suv-the-volume-goes-up-to-11","fields":{"headline":"Tesla Model X review: ‘The volume goes up to a Spinal Tap 11’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Price: from £70,500 for the 75D Top speed: 155mph 0-62mph: 4.9 seconds Range: 351 miles Tailpipe emissions: 0 Through his massively profitable Tesla corporation, Elon Musk is planning to transform the world not just of motoring but also of power generation (the Gigafactory), space travel (SpaceX), tunnelling (the Boring Company) and even, possibly, time travel (Hyperloop One). Musk has got an awful lot to do. So while we wait for him to sort it all out, here are 20 things – some good and some quite annoying – about his latest vehicle, the Model X, a futuristic but undeniably faddy family SUV. 1) The powerful electric engine is only about the size of a watermelon. 2) The vast touchscreen is 17in deep and is the biggest fitted in any car. It comes preloaded with Spotify. 3) The rear falcon doors are double hinged and need only 12in to open. They make it very easy to get in and out, especially if you are elderly or have to fit child seats. They are a great show-off feature, but their slow movement means they soon begin to irritate. They also mean you can’t fit a roof rack. 4) You can open or close all four doors by pressing a single button. They each sense obstacles and only open if safe to do so. A leafy bush fooled the system and left me trapped inside. 5) The lithium-ion battery pack weighs half a tonne. It looks like one giant battery, but it is made up of 18,650 regular AA-sized batteries. 6) The switchgear (indicator, windscreen control, gear stalk, etc) are from Mercedes-Benz. In the futuristic setting of a super posh Tesla they seem a bit flimsy. 7) Hidden within each car are endless digital Tesla teasers – small features designed to surprise and delight. For instance, you can set the autodrive display to look as if you are on Mario Kart’s Rainbow Road; you can switch the accelerator function from “sport” to “ludicrous”; the volume goes up to a Spinal Tap 11; and you can make the car do a sound and light show. But there’s a fine line between surprise and delight – and stale and a bit childish. 8) It takes 75 minutes to fully charge the Model X using a purpose-built supercharger, and costs about £9. 9) If you choose a destination beyond its range, the Model X plots a route to leapfrog from one charger to the next. 10) Car functionality is updated remotely – just like on a smartphone – with “constant air updates”. 11) The “Big Sky” windscreen is the largest single piece of glass on any production car on the road. 12) If you have the key fob in your pocket, the driver’s door will automatically open as you approach. 13) The central cubby is crappily finished and the lid doesn’t fit well. 14) The charge port is disguised as part of the rear light. It automatically opens when it detects the power hose. 15) You can close the driver’s door by putting your foot on the brake pedal. 16) Using an app on your phone you can check the battery charge, lock and unlock the doors, control the temperature, locate your car on Google Maps and even reverse the car in or out of a parking space while standing on the pavement. 17) The sun visors are tiny and don’t work. But they are magnetic. 18) If you indicate while cruising, the car will change lanes on its own. 19) There is a secret compartment under the front bumper to fool thieves hunting inside for precious things like wallets and purses. Though now they know… 20) A medical grade filter ensures the car is free from pollen, bacteria and pollution. There is also a bio-weapon defence mode that can totally seal the cabin. Haynes explains the world we live in Haynes has helped generations of us with our filters and big ends – those lovely cutaway diagrams making their way from the ever useful manuals on to T-shirts and teatowels. But having guided us around the working parts of our cars, Haynes has now decided to tackle some of the bigger topics in our lives. The Haynes Explains author Boris Starling has been busy and has written eight witty new parodies. Making the ideal gift thanks to Boris’s amusing spin on Haynes’ inimitable style, the eight new brilliantly observed manuals are based on a strip-down and rebuild of a particular ‘model’. They cover a whole raft of important subjects, including a jovial but affectionate look at The French, Germans, Americans and The British. Meanwhile for those looking to decipher the mechanics behind daily life, four additional titles include Christmas, Pets, Football and The Home. These eight latest titles in the range join four other Haynes Explains books which launched last year comprising Babies, Teenagers, Marriage and Pensioners. Packed full of exploded views, flow charts, ‘fault diagnosis’ and the occasional ‘wiring diagram’, each manual contains a wide-array of tongue-in-cheek information for you to digest, discuss and enjoy. They cost £6.99 each and are available from bookshops and online at haynes.co.uk.

Made up of some of the leading stars in modern football including Cesc Fàbregas and Christian Eriksen, here is a selection of his answers. The game vision of Cesc Fàbregas “I have had the chance to play with [Cesc] Fàbregas and I can say that he has the best game vision in the world. He does not run fast, technically he does not make gestures... [Hazard looks up at the sky.] But he has that thing, and he has it since he was born. If I have his vision of the game, I’d be there... [He places his hand over his head.] I’d be on a much higher level. The guy takes the ball, does not even look and puts it right where he wants to just behind the defender. And behind, the guy will score. I say to myself: ‘But how did he see that?’ Sometimes, in the team, between us, we say to ourselves: ‘But why is he doing that?’ And, in the end, the pass is magnificent.” The heading of Christian Benteke “Is that my weak point? No, no. You know what, I am good at heading! It’s just that I’m small. What I do not like, with heading, is to have to jump. I’m afraid the opponents will get ahead of me. At the level of relaxation, I am not bad, I have good timing. I jump high. It’s just the headbutt, I’m afraid, I close my eyes. I would need the head of Cristiano Ronaldo. That guy, he jumps, stays in the air and it’s good, he scores. How about Fellaini? Ah yes, Fellaini, incredible! And Benteke, a crazy thing! He jumps, pah, goal!” The free kicks of Christian Eriksen “I would take the free kicks of Juninho [Pernambucano]. In training, I can take them not badly, but as soon as I get to the game, I’m not focused, be it corners, free kicks … That’s why I do not get many. I shoot as if I were in my backyard, but still need some concentration. But I cannot! Or only for penalties. Juninho, I was watching his videos. Even a guy who does not know football, he knows his free kicks. They went around the world. Today, among those who still play, I would say Christian Eriksen of Tottenham, he shoots them too well. And Toni Kroos, too. [He whistles, once again admiring.] Besides, when Sergio Ramos scores, it’s always him who delivers the corner. Magic foot.” The leadership of John Terry “I do not like to talk. For the national team, I am captain but I say nothing. I do my talking with the ball, on the ground. Like Zidane at the time. Being captain, it’s an innate thing too. There are people who are made for ... ‘Yeah, yeah!’ [He pretends to organise his troops.] People who are made to scream. John Terry is the best captain in the world. He is there, he encourages you all the time. He screams. When you do not play well, it does not matter, he speaks to you, tells you that you must move. He has the right words. When I am a captain, I say to myself: ‘What am I going to say?’ I should be able to but I cannot. And there is no question of forcing myself. It will not be me. I do not like it. Some people like to talk, others do not.” Eden Hazard’s speed “For my speed, or rather acceleration, it is thanks to my mother, who has a shape that resembles mine. She’s a sports teacher, my dad too. I did not even do exercises when I was a kid, that’s also innate. As far as I am concerned, I have this quality of speed over a few metres, not on a long distance. After that, I am quickly tired … But for the first five metres, at the start, I am not bad.” Other players selected: Luis Suárez (finishing), Karim Benzema (off the ball movement), Cristiano Ronaldo (physicality), Andrés Iniesta (‘class’).

The apparel, a $350 denim jacket branded as “Levi’s Commuter Trucker Jacket with Jacquard by Google”, is the first product of a two-year-long collaboration between the two firms that started back in May 2015 with the intention of making a pair of “smart jeans”. The idea was to use a newly designed conductive fabric to allow the garment to send data and power without the need for wires. Since then, the plan has clearly changed, but the basis remains the same: the jacquard fabric is integrated into the jacket, and allows the smart features to work. The downside is those smart features … aren’t very smart. The jacket includes a “smart tag”, which is basically a smartwatch without the watch: it lights up in various colours, vibrates when receiving notifications, can be tapped to issue commands, and is the hub of the jacket. But the sleeve itself is also touch sensitive. Simply stroke your arm to control your smartphone – that’s the fancy Jacquard fabric in action. Oddly, all of the jacket’s features seem to require not only having your smartphone with you and paired with it, but also having headphones on. Headphones, of course, can themselves have a variety of gesture-based controls, but are easier to wear in the summer, and without risking double denim when you want to wear jeans. One downside of the jean jacket does reveal why Levi’s and Google decided to switch from trousers to coats: the fabric can only survive being washed 10 times. After that, the fancy gestures go kaput. Despite its bulky name, Levi’s with Jacquard by Google actually manages to leave out the wing of the tech firm responsible for the fabric: Google’s Atap (Advanced Technology and Projects) division, the last remaining part of Motorola after Google bought, then sold, the phone manufacturer. Atap hasn’t had the best of luck in producing things that actually make it to market: it led the development of Project Tango, an AR-focused Android device which was innovative in 2015 but only shipped in a tiny number consumer devices before being gazumped by an entirely unrelated Android AR system; and Project Ara, an attempt to build a modular smartphone which was eventually cancelled in 2016.

Every North Korean schoolchild is taught, erroneously, that the US started the Korean war; but they also learn, correctly, that their nemesis was responsible for laying waste to dozens of towns and cities from the air during the 1950-53 conflict, a fact rarely reported in the US media at the time. The carpet-bombing of North Korea has been all but forgotten in the US, but not in North Korea, where the regime exploits every opportunity to remind its people – in schools and museums, and via the state media – that the US is still the aggressor. Donald Trump reinforced that narrative this week when, having heard the North’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, make a highly provocative speech at the UN general assembly, he tweeted: “If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won’t be around much longer!” Ri said Trump’s words amounted to a “declaration of war” before piling more pressure on the US president. “Since the United States declared war on our country, we will have every right to make countermeasures, including the right to shoot down United States strategic bombers even when they are not inside the airspace border of our country,” he said. It is not the first time the North has accused the US and its allies of declaring war. In fact, given that the Korean war ended with an armistice, but not a peace treaty, the two countries have been technically at war for the past 64 years. In 2013, North Korea said it and South Korea were in a “state of war” following international condemnation of its nuclear test. Three years later, it said US sanctions targeting Kim Jong-un and other senior officials were tantamount to a declaration of war. But Ri’s explicit threat to shoot US warplanes out of the sky was telling. Not only did it open up frightening new possibilities for a miscalculation that leads to wider conflict; it also exposed a visceral fear of US air bombardment – greater, perhaps, than the fear of nuclear annihilation. In a show of force last weekend, US B1-B Lancer bombers from Andersen air force base on Guam, along with F-15C Eagle fighter escorts from the southern Japanese island of Okinawa flew off the east coast of North Korea. US bombers have carried out similar flights before – B1-B planes flew in the region as recently as last month – but the Pentagon was at pains to remind Pyongyang that this was the furthest north of the demilitarised zone separating the two Koreas that any US fighter or bomber has flown this century. It did not take North Korea long to respond. On Monday, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency reported that the regime had started moving planes and boosting defences on its east coast following the B-1B sorties. While the bombers are no longer part of the US nuclear force, they can be loaded with large numbers of conventional weapons – a capability that will not have been lost on North Koreans old enough to remember the Korean war. North Korea started the conflict when it sent almost a quarter of a million of its soldiers across the 38th parallel and into the South at dawn on 25 June 1950. But, as Bruce Cumings notes in his book The Korean War: A History: “What hardly any Americans know or remember, however, is that we carpet-bombed the North for three years with next to no concern for civilian casualties.” Blaine Harden, author of The Great Leader and the Fighter Pilot, said North Korean targets were “mostly easy pickings” for US B-29s bombers that faced little or no opposition from the ground. In an op-ed for the Washington Post, Harden cited Dean Rusk, a supporter of the war who went on to become secretary of state in the 1960s, as saying that the US had bombed “everything that moved in North Korea, every brick standing on top of another”. Curtis LeMay, head of the US air force strategic air command during the conflict, would later boast that the US bombing campaign killed about 20% of the population. “We went over there and fought the war and eventually burned down every town in North Korea,” he said. Cumings said that the public intent was to erode enemy morale and end the war sooner, “but the interior intent was to destroy Korean society down to the individual constituent”. According to US air force estimates, the bombings caused more damage to North Korea’s urban centres than that seen in Germany or Japan during the second world war, with the US dumping 635,000 tons of bombs on Korea compared with 503,000 tons during the entire Pacific war. “It is clear that for the North Korean regime and its military-first ideology, the devastation wrought by the Korean war looms large in their memory and mythology,” Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington, told the Guardian. Despite the White House’s dismissal of Ri’s war declaration claim as “absurd”, his reference to US bombers betrays North Korean fears of a pre-emptive strike – and of what demonstrations of air power may preface for Kim’s leadership. “The B1-B flights are a fairly regular feature of US ‘signaling’ to our allies that we stand ready to come to their defence,” Kimball added. “But they are also seen as a threat by North Korea’s military leaders because they would very likely be part of a first wave of retaliation in a conflict, or part of a ‘decapitation’ strike on leadership targets.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/sep/26/le-grand-mort-julian-clary-stephen-clark-drama-trafalgar-studios","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T11:28:16Z","webTitle":"Le Grand Mort – Julian Clary slices and dices through tale of death, sex and veg","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/26/le-grand-mort-julian-clary-stephen-clark-drama-trafalgar-studios","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/sep/26/le-grand-mort-julian-clary-stephen-clark-drama-trafalgar-studios","fields":{"headline":"Le Grand Mort – Julian Clary slices and dices through tale of death, sex and veg","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Sex and death are the themes of this 90-minute play by the late Stephen Clark. The problem is that they are virtually the only topics discussed in a work written as a vehicle for Julian Clary. Although Clark, who won an Olivier award for his lyrics for the reworked Martin Guerre, had an undoubted way with words, this particular piece strikes me as morbid and exploitative. We first see Clary’s Michael in his kitchen, coolly preparing pasta for an expected dinner guest. As he does so, he explores in rhyme urban myths about necrophilia involving subjects ranging from Rasputin to Marilyn Monroe. (Later, he somewhat ludicrously expands on his theme to include the archaeologist Howard Carter, who is considered a sexual predator because of his enthusiasm for the tomb of Tutankhamun.) But the drama gets under way with the arrival of the cockily assertive Tim, whom Michael had encountered that day in a pub. As a kitchen knife is freely brandished and the two men engage in mutual confessions, you are never quite sure whether Michael’s plan is to seduce or kill his guest. Behind the play lurks the idea that Michael, abused in childhood, is terrified of close personal encounters. That leads, however, to nonsensical statements such as Tim’s claim that “killing someone is the most intimate thing you can do with them.” The play also teases us with the idea that we are about to witness acts of sex or violence. When a naked Tim poses in front of a relief of Leonardo’s image of Vitruvian Man, it looks very much like the former; when a knife hovers ominously around one of the two men’s genitalia, it implies the latter. Either way, the impression is that we are being pointlessly titillated. Clary is at his best in the opening monologue where, slicing and dicing vegetables, he exhibits an economy of movement that constitutes physical grace. Although he handles the character’s later Oedipal narrative with some skill, not even he can disguise the fact that it feels like the author’s desperate attempt to shock and amaze. James Nelson-Joyce lends the dinner guest a frantic ebullience and Christopher Renshaw directs capably. But the play itself, which feels like the spawn of Jean Genet and Stephen King, is purgatorial without ever being truly cathartic. • At Trafalgar Studios, London, until 28 October.

But beyond that narrow radius, it was hard to make an impact. But as UK garage waned and the next generation developed the colder, darker sound that would become grime, a low-budget, DIY infrastructure began to sprout up, and artists slowly started making connections beyond their postcode. There were big, scene-uniting raves such as Sidewinder; homemade, magazine-style DVDs such as Risky Roadz; the punk-like magazine RWD, cobbled together in the back room of a record shop in Crystal Palace; and the cable TV station Channel U, which broadcast the first music videos by these usually-unsigned MCs and crews. While beefs and diss tracks – between crews, between areas of London – were common, the symbol of a tentatively emerging scene unity came in the form of the “all-star” or “link-up” tunes, where five or more MCs from different crews would come together to each do a verse on a hot new instrumental. These were crucial in starting the process of binding together grime’s first wave, but in 2003-2006, grime was a long way from the united front we see today, when the likes of Wiley, Giggs, Lethal Bizzle, BBK, Stormzy and Krept &amp; Konan all routinely put in guest appearances at each other’s concerts. The all-star track is also perhaps the closest that grime manages to get, in song form, to capturing the frantic, pass-the-mic hype of a live pirate radio or rave set. Perhaps the greatest all-star track – and for south Londoners, one of the greatest grime tunes of all time – is Southside Allstars, created and curated by UK garage-into-grime duo Nikki S and Nyke, aka Milkymans. These days the duo are both cabbies – a career move foreshadowed by Southside when Nyke, the fulcrum of the track, reels off an A-Z of some of the less glamorous parts on the less glamorous side of the river Thames, interspersed with verses from no fewer than 15 south London MCs. Nikki S and Nyke parked up their cabs in a quiet side street in Shoreditch so we could sit in the back and talk through the history of the all-star tune. “The thing that made it look mad aggy was the scenes with all the kids,” Nyke recalls of Southside’s video. “Especially Fugi’s ‘G to the I’ lines in the tunnel, which would become famous in folklore. He was local, so he could literally whistle and all the boys from his estate came down from nowhere. While they were setting up the shoot, we had a hundred little yutes in the drive-thru McDonalds in Wandsworth, and every little boy was robbing all the stuff out of there. It was chaos.” “It weren’t really a club tune,” laughs Nikki. “It was so grimey. It was a statement really.” Of all the guest verses, it is the one by So Solid Crew’s Asher D that best sums up the need for a bit of chest-beating neighbourhood pride – “I just want to stand correct for my block” – because, although the tune was bringing MCs from different parts of south London together, Southside was a response to, and intensified, the south-versus-east London tensions of the early 2000s. So Solid Crew had dominated the MC-driven side of UK garage so completely, drawing envious glances from their east London rivals, that, according to Nyke, all the east London top dogs, including Geeneus from Rinse FM and Diesel from Deja Vu FM, had a “secret meeting” in which they plotted to build up an alternative power base. “They basically said: ‘We’re going to build a fence up around east London now, start burrowing in, and make our own sound.’” Alias, the respected early grime producer who made the Southside instrumental, deliberately neglected to stamp his Alias audio-logo on the track as he usually would. “He was worried that his tunes would get shut down by Slimzee and Geeneus,” Nyke says. “I remember the east London artists were ringing up our manager, Sponge, because he would be orchestrating raves still in south, and they were like: ‘Is it cool to come south? Is it beef?’” The guest MCs on Southside had to chip in a couple of hundred pounds each for the right to be on the tune, in order to help pay for the video. “They were about to go on a historic tune,” recounts Nyke. “It’s about to go on Channel U!” This model for all-star MC tunes became a staple of Channel U and the cottage industry in grime DVDs, and a showcase and a symbol of the scene’s growing confidence and ambition. The videos put faces and more recognisable personalities to voices previously heard only on pirate radio or vinyl. In many respects, these were the seeds of grime’s move from an underground sound to the increasingly big-money pop genre it has become today. A slew of other all-star tracks dominated the airwaves in those formative years. South London crew Essentials produced a track called Headquarters, later renamed State Your Name, which required each MC to present themselves as if in a military line-up: “What’s your name soldier, state your location, who are you repping?” At which point they’re ordered to “drop and give me 16 [bars]”. Jammer’s sensational Destruction VIP did a similar thing with rival east London crews that Southside had done for south. The explosive Pow! (Forward), marshalled by Lethal Bizzle, was so big it got banned from clubs and made a rare foray (for the time) into the Top 10. In a genre overwhelmingly dominated by male MCs and DJs, the Female Allstars’ 2006 track Grab That Mic was a celebration of some great overlooked female MCs such as No Lay and Lioness, a feat repeated with Rock the Mic in 2012. In 2005, Nikki S and Nyke followed up Southside’s success with another classic, geezer-ish Channel U-era all-star tune, Ska Riddim, with its jaunty ska sample, artillery-fire drums and appearances from Channel U favourites such as Flirta D, Doctor, Bashy and Big Narstie. “On Ska Riddim, you’ll notice that again, it’s all south and west London MCs on there,” says Nyke. “I asked east MCs! We reached out. Like, I put a call into D Double E, but because – there’s no other way to say this – because of who our management were, and the relationship with the So Solid dynasty ... they were all shook [scared] of So Solid.” More than 10 years on, following grime’s many ups and downs and ascent to pop ubiquity, the all-star tune has sadly fallen into disuse – chiefly, you have to assume, because the likes of Stormzy and Skepta consider themselves too big to consider sharing space on a track with more than one or two other artists. Features and collaborations are carefully chosen, and approaching a track mob-handed has less appeal. It’s a shame, because all-star tracks are grime at its best, as some recent exceptions to the rule show: P Money’s 10 out of 10 and Skepta’s That’s Not Me (All-Star Remix) bang much harder than a lot of their competitors. And this week, another all-star revival heralds the comeback of the two MCs most associated with the format: at the instigation of SBTV’s Jamal Edwards, Nikki S and Nyke have just come out with Ska 2, 12 years after the original. The tune brings together three generations of MCs – the hosts and Asher D from the late UK garage days; Little Dee, Bossman Birdie, Scrufizzer and Flirta D from grime’s Channel U heyday; and the next generation, in Jammz, Novelist, PK, Kwamz and Yizzy, “the youngers who grew up watching Southside and the first Ska Riddim on TV”. It’s a welcome return to collective lyrical energy, its different styles and flows rubbing up against each other, in an era of solo MC superstars. Maybe it will lead to more – although Nyke has another theory about why these all-star tracks don’t happen so much anymore. “I’d forgotten about this, but they’re a fucking logistical nightmare, man,” he laughs. “They will put years on you. They take so much time, money and effort to organise – and back then we had a manager who was also putting people under pressure. And Sponge was a big guy: you didn’t fuck around with Sponge.” Inner City Pressure: The Story of Grime by Dan Hancox will be published by William Collins in 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/27/no-postal-survey-18-year-old-enrolled-voter-told-abs-cant-verify-him","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T18:00:12Z","webTitle":"No postal survey: 18-year-old enrolled voter told ABS can't 'verify' him","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/27/no-postal-survey-18-year-old-enrolled-voter-told-abs-cant-verify-him","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/27/no-postal-survey-18-year-old-enrolled-voter-told-abs-cant-verify-him","fields":{"headline":"No postal survey: 18-year-old enrolled voter told ABS can't 'verify' him","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"An 18-year old Sydney man with two lesbian mothers says he has been denied a vote on marriage equality by the Australian Bureau of Statistics despite the fact he is properly enrolled to take part in the postal survey. The ABS has said it will investigate the case but Patrick Cairnduff told Guardian Australia he is “incredibly frustrated” at the prospect peers who bullied him at school will get the right to vote on whether his mothers can marry while he may be excluded. The case is the first known instance of the ABS refusing to provide a vote to a person enrolled on the cut-off date of 24 August, and suggests the Australian Electoral Commission roll provided to the ABS may have excluded some eligible electors. Cairnduff enrolled with the AEC in the federal electorate of Grayndler in Sydney in February, just before his 18th birthday. The AEC allows 16 and 17 year olds to provisionally enrol then automatically adds them to the full roll when they turn 18. After the postal survey was called and before the 24 August cut-off for eligibility, Cairnduff said he “triple-checked” his enrolment using the AEC website, confirming that he was enrolled to vote. Guardian Australia has seen the confirmation of enrolment sent to Cairnduff by the AEC on 22 February and independently checked using the AEC website that he is currently enrolled. When Cairnduff did not receive a postal survey form by the 25 September deadline, he applied for a replacement form and made inquiries to the ABS postal survey hotline. The ABS replied acknowledging his request for a replacement form. “Unfortunately we have not been able to verify your details against the commonwealth electoral roll so cannot process your request at this time,” the customer assistance team said in an email. The ABS suggested to Cairnduff he could check his enrolment online and “resubmit his request” but did not explain why it was not able to verify his details. The ABS made no promise it would be able to supply him with a vote, telling him on the hotline it would investigate and call him back in two to three days. “They can find me on the AEC website but can’t find me on their database … they said they’ll investigate but I won’t be able to have a survey,” he said. Cairnduff’s mother Annette Cairnduff, who is one of the founders of LGBTI rights lobby group Just Equal, married her wife Kylie Gwynne while same-sex marriage was briefly legal in the Australian Capital Territory. Those weddings were struck down by a federal law in 2004 redefining marriage as exclusively between a man and woman. The pair plan to marry again if Australia legalises marriage equality after the postal survey. Cairnduff said he was “incredibly frustrated” at the prospect of not being allowed to vote, adding “I just don’t understand why”. “As a kid they used to chastise me for having gay parents, sometimes at school people are a bit rude … and it shocks me to think that those kind of people can vote on whether my mums can get married and I can’t.” Cairnduff said he is worried that even if the ABS resolves the issue and gives him a vote that others may be in the same boat and excluded from the roll. “I’m worried – I was on the phone [to the ABS] for an hour and a half and the only reason I’ve stuck with it is because it directly affects my mums. “For others I can imagine it would be too much, and others would give up.” Just Equal spokesman, Ivan Hinton-Teoh, said it was “extremely concerning that there is an unknown number of Australians who, by no fault of their own, may be disenfranchised from the survey”. “The ABS must urgently audit their records to determine the number of people affected and resolve a way in which they can be notified and provided with a mechanism to participate,” he said. An AEC spokesman said it was unable to discuss the enrolment status of any individual for privacy reasons. “Persons needing to inquire further with the AEC regarding their enrolment status should contact the AEC,” he said. Guardian Australia has contacted the ABS for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/27/malcolm-robertss-one-nation-replacement-may-be-ineligible-to-stand","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T23:18:12Z","webTitle":"Malcolm Roberts's One Nation replacement may be ineligible to stand","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/27/malcolm-robertss-one-nation-replacement-may-be-ineligible-to-stand","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/27/malcolm-robertss-one-nation-replacement-may-be-ineligible-to-stand","fields":{"headline":"Malcolm Roberts's One Nation replacement may be ineligible to stand","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The One Nation Queensland candidate who stands to replace Malcolm Roberts in the Senate if the high court rules Roberts ineligible on citizenship grounds, could himself be ruled ineligible to sit in parliament. This could potentially open the way for Pauline Hanson to replace Malcolm Roberts with Malcolm Roberts. Bankruptcy proceedings were filed against the One Nation candidate William Fraser Anning and Fiona Ruth Anning by ABL Nominees in the federal circuit court, with court documents obtained by Guardian Australia claiming that the subsidiary of Bendigo and Adelaide Bank is saying it is owed $239,393.49. It follows a default judgment in the South Australian district court on 26 April, which was made after the defendants did not respond to the claim. The matter is due back in court on 3 October, where it is understood it will be decided. The following week, the high court will consider Roberts’s eligibility to sit in the Senate after last week ruling he was a dual citizen at the time of nomination. Anning’s bankruptcy proceedings have the potential to add another wrinkle to the section 44 crisis which has dogged the 45th parliament, if the high court ultimately finds Roberts was ineligible. If the court finds Anning to to be bankrupt, he becomes ineligible for parliament under section 44, which restricts anyone who is an undischarged bankrupt or insolvent from sitting. If Roberts’ election is found to have been invalid, Anning, as the next candidate on the 2016 ticket, who received 19 above-the-line votes in 2016, stands to take his place. If he has been found to be bankrupt, the court would need to look at when he became insolvent. If it was before the election, then he would also be deemed ineligible, and the count would move to the number four candidate, Judy Smith, Pauline Hanson’s sister, who won 47 first preference votes. But if any insolvency was found to have occurred after Anning nominated, then a casual vacancy would be created, which would allow One Nation to put anyone it likes forward – including Roberts – to become the party’s second Queensland senator. When asked, Hanson has previously only said she stands by Roberts, and believes he belongs in the Senate, but would see what the high court decided. In a submission to the court on Tuesday the attorney general, George Brandis, argued that parliamentarians who did not voluntarily obtain or retain their dual citizenship and did not know it existed should not be considered to have contradicted section 44. In his argument, published by the court on Tuesday afternoon, Brandis said that was the case for the three government members who have been referred to the court, Barnaby Joyce, Fiona Nash and Matt Canavan, as well as Larissa Waters, who resigned from the Senate after discovering her breach in July, and the Senate crossbencher Nick Xenophon. But Brandis’s submission made a point of naming the Greens senator Scott Ludlam, who also resigned when he discovered he held dual citizenship, and Roberts as being “incapable of being chosen as senators”. “The resultant vacancies should be filled by a special count,” Brandis submitted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/26/eus-tax-plans-for-tech-companies-will-damage-growth-us-body-warns","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T21:25:51Z","webTitle":"EU tax crackdown on tech giants will damage growth, US body warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/26/eus-tax-plans-for-tech-companies-will-damage-growth-us-body-warns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/26/eus-tax-plans-for-tech-companies-will-damage-growth-us-body-warns","fields":{"headline":"EU tax crackdown on tech giants will damage growth, US body warns","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The American Chamber of Commerce in Europe has warned that the EU’s plans to take more tax from technology giants such as Google, Facebook and Amazon will damage the continent’s economic growth and could lead to a breakdown in cooperation with the US on global tax reform. The European commission, on the prompting of France and Germany, is seeking ways to capture a greater amount of tax from companies that exploit their lack of physical offices in a country to book their profits in low-tax states. Taxing tech companies is on the agenda of an EU leaders’ summit devoted to the digital economy in Tallinn, Estonia, on Friday. A recent study found that Amazon’s corporation tax bill in the UK is 11 times smaller than that of British bookstores. In Ireland, the European commission concluded that Apple paid 0.005% to Irish tax authorities in 2014. France is pushing a proposal to tax technology companies on turnover, rather than a conventional corporation tax on profits. It has won support from 10 EU member states, including Germany, Italy and Spain. The commission’s first choice, meanwhile, is a common corporate tax base for companies aimed at introducing a common set of tax rules, but not rates, in order to prevent the hiding of profits from the appropriate tax authorities. The development is just the latest move by Brussels to try and keep pace with the activities of tech companies. On Tuesday it was reported that Google is to create a standalone unit for its shopping service and require it to bid against rivals for ads shown on the top of its search page, in an effort to oblige with an EU ruling that it was abusing its monopolistic position in the internet search market by artificially promoting its service. The company had been given a deadline of this Thursday to provide a remedy when it was fined a record €2.4bn in June. Neither the company nor the European commission commented. Some have accused Brussels of having a vendetta against Silicon Valley. The American Chamber of Commerce to the European Union (AmCham EU) said on Tuesday that they were concerned “by the recent proposals from the European commission and some member states to introduce new measures to tax digital activities”, adding that it would make Europe less attractive to investors. The US business organisation added that the initiatives had been floated by Brussels last week without any assessment of the impact and that they “could both harm the competitiveness of the EU and jeopardise international efforts to tackle tax issues if they are not subject to very broad multilateral agreement”. A statement said: “Turnover taxes, as proposed by some member states, can substantially reduce the amount of company profits available for investment and reinvestment, with a negative effect on jobs and growth. “They penalise startups, low-margin companies and loss-making companies because they do not seek to tax the value created. “The European commission’s proposal to consider including digital taxation under the scope of the common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB) may also adversely affect EU competitiveness and growth if it is not in line with internationally agreed rules on value creation.” During a meeting of finance ministers in Estonia two weeks ago, the UK chancellor, Philip Hammond spoke of his concern that unilateral efforts to clamp down on the tax affairs of US technology companies would be met with retaliation from Donald Trump’s White House. The EU is working with the US on a rewriting of global tax laws to avoid aggressive tax avoidance. Susan Danger, chief executive of AmCham EU, said: ‘Unilateral action by the EU would seriously undermine international efforts to address tax issues. “The EU should continue to support tax reforms and the harmonisation of tax regimes within the OECD [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development] framework.” Danger went on to say: “Current EU plans risk putting Europe at a competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis other global players. Internationally agreed-upon tax standards ensure the EU remains an attractive destination for foreign investment”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"social-care-network/2017/oct/02/child-first-approach-irelands-programme-for-young-migrants-international-model","type":"article","sectionId":"social-care-network","sectionName":"Social Care Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T07:25:36Z","webTitle":"'Young migrants in Ireland are treated as children, not asylum seekers'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2017/oct/02/child-first-approach-irelands-programme-for-young-migrants-international-model","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/social-care-network/2017/oct/02/child-first-approach-irelands-programme-for-young-migrants-international-model","fields":{"headline":"'Young migrants in Ireland are treated as children, not asylum seekers'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When the first group of unaccompanied child migrants arrived in Ireland from the Calais refugee camp earlier this year, their progress through Dublin airport was impeded by well-wishers who wanted the youngsters to know they were welcome. “I vividly remember not one but two elderly Irish gentlemen, 10 minutes apart, who each insisted we tell the kids they were really glad they were here,” says Thomas Dunning, principal social worker with the team for separated children seeking asylum at Tusla, Ireland’s child and family agency. “That reflects the marked change in feeling we’ve seen in the past 12 months.” Last November, the Irish parliament responded to public clamour by making an all-party commitment to accept up to 200 children who’d been living in the (by-then dismantled) Calais camp. Extra resources were promised for Tusla, which oversees a well-established programme for child migrants that is regarded as a model of good practice around the world. In late October, the Irish programme will be one of the approaches discussed at a conference in Stockholm, organised by the European Social Network, on meeting the needs of migrant children and young people. Sweden has been dealing with some of the largest numbers of child refugees, receiving more than 35,000 in 2015 alone. “Our numbers are small by comparison – we had 126 last year,” says Dunning. “But we are proud of what we do and we have a ‘child first’ ethos – they are treated as a child, not an asylum seeker – and an equity of care principle that’s almost unique in Europe.” This principle guarantees that child migrants are given the same level of care and support as Irish children in the care system. It was introduced in 2009 after providers had been overwhelmed by the numbers of unaccompanied young people arriving in the early years of the decade – a peak of 1,085 in 2001 – and resorted to accommodating them in dormitory-style hostels. The last hostel was shut in 2010 and migrant children are now placed in foster care or small children’s homes, each accommodating no more than six. The child will enter the asylum process “if and when appropriate”, sponsored by the social worker assigned to them on arrival in loco parentis. The social worker accompanies them through the process even if they turn 18 and legally become an adult. The number of child migrants arriving in Ireland is growing again, including those being admitted from shelters in Greece via the European resettlement scheme. The UK has reportedly taken none from Greece this year, citing procedural difficulties. Dunning, himself a migrant from the US, is confident that Ireland can deal with the rising numbers. “I feel we are ready for it,” he says. “I can go and say, ‘I need this Irish child to get that, and this child from Ghana needs to have it too’. I am listened to and the resources are put in place.” Dunning’s team of 17 at Tusla is complemented by a separate, 11-strong children’s service at the City of Dublin Education and Training Board (ETB), which is led by manager Jessica Farnan, who will be speaking at the Stockholm conference. On arrival, children go straight into a programme designed to prepare them for mainstream schooling. The programme was first envisaged to last six weeks, but low education levels among the current wave of young migrants – and typically limited English – means they usually need longer preparation, sometimes a year or more. “In some cases they have little by way of reading or writing skills in their own language and we are really starting from scratch,” says Farnan. “It can be a case of ‘learning to learn’. Those who have been in Calais may have to learn how to go to school and how to get up in the morning.” Most arrivals from France are boys, originally from Afghanistan or Somalia. Their needs may be quite different to those coming from Syria via Greece, says Farnan. “The ETB first researched the needs of unaccompanied minors 15 or so years ago, but we have changed what we do as the system has changed. We carry on doing that.” Join the Social Care Network for comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox. Follow us on Twitter (@GdnSocialCare) and like us on Facebook.

Osman Shahenshah, 55, the ex-chief executive, and Shahid Ullah, 58, formerly chief operating officer, appeared in Westminster magistrates court on Tuesday charged with two counts of money laundering and two counts of fraud. They will face the charges formally on Wednesday. The Serious Fraud Office said the men stood accused over payments they received via secret companies they controlled relating to over $400m of Nigeria business deals. “The alleged fraud is claimed to have led to the collapse of the $2.6bn oil giant by their administrators, who in related civil claims are seeking damages in excess of $500m from the defendants and a Nigerian associate,” the SFO, which launched an investigation two years ago, said in a statement.

The museum was getting too big for its boots, claimed curtain-twitching critics, and losing touch with the character of the small Cornish town. Twelve years and £20m later, the gallery has doubled in size, but, from the outside at least, you would be hard-pressed to notice. In a deft feat of engineering, an almost 600-sq-metre space has been excavated into the hillside, chiselled 15 metres down into the granite bedrock, providing a vast light-flooded chamber for temporary exhibitions that the gallery has sorely needed for years. Originally conceived in the 1990s as a place to exhibit a permanent collection of the work of St Ives artists and designed for 70,000 annual visitors, Tate St Ives grew quickly in popularity and ambition. By 2004, it was receiving 250,000 people a year, but it was still forced to close for weeks on end every time a new exhibition was being installed and shuffle works between floors in a tiny lift. The question was how to expand invisibly. “It has been a very fine balancing act between the gallery and the community,” says Mark Osterfield, the diplomatic executive director of Tate St Ives since 2007. “There’s a real danger in situations like this that the big institution is perceived to be taking over a place, so we didn’t want to slap an ‘iconic’ new building up on the hill.” Osterfield inherited a messy situation, after the Tate had indeed proposed to slap quite a big building up on the hill, igniting local rage by threatening to obliterate a few residents’ parking spaces in the process. “There was an audible gasp in the room when we first showed our plans,” says the project’s architect, Jamie Fobert. “It seemed as if the whole town had turned up to heckle.” After a two-year scoping study to consider other sites – including the threat of leaving St Ives altogether – it was agreed that the best way forward was to hide the extension underground, at considerable extra expense beyond the planned £12m budget. This became possible in 2010, when the neighbouring landowner, Penwith Housing Association, sold the back half of its site to Cornwall Council (the Tate’s landlord), using the proceeds to erect a new block of sheltered housing in front of where the submerged gallery would be built. It was a win-win situation – or so it seemed. From the inside, the new gallery is a stunning space, terminating the existing building’s enfilade of domestic-scaled rooms with a gaping hangar. A row of massive concrete beams march for 30 metres across the ceiling, gently filtering the magical St Ives light into the room, capturing the very substance that first drew artists such as Ben Nicholson and Barbara Hepworth to settle here. The new extension allows the Tate to stay open year-round, providing one big flexible space for seasonal exhibitions, along with staff offices, a workshop and a proper loading bay and art lift for the first time. “Our main material for the project was daylight,” says Fobert, which might sound like an architect’s cliche, but here it rings true. Environmental engineers Max Fordham modelled the precise lux levels allowed by international standards for the display of art, from which the architects generated their form, designing six light-wells, four metres deep, topped with honeycomb-filled glass. At least 50 doll’s house-sized models were made to fine tune the proportions. The result feels accordingly hand-crafted – a sense emphasised by Fobert’s woven rope benches that encourage you to linger and take in the pulsating skies. The power of entering the new gallery is perhaps amplified by what comes before. The original Tate St Ives is an awkward building, its interiors exuding the institutional air of a 1930s sanatorium. It is a dingy place of grey lino floors, fussy art deco-ish details and suspended ceilings that groan with heavy cornicing. It feels like a conversion job, but it was actually purpose-built in the 90s by Evans &amp; Shalev architects, who were furious at the prospect of their masterpiece being altered or added to, and attempted to have it listed when the Tate’s plans were first mooted. To quench the architects’ ire, they were commissioned to design a new educational space, adding a conical rooftop pavilion in the same clumsy manner as their original building. Sadly, the problems of their grey pebble-dashed hulk remain. Visitors must traipse up a series of steps, or along a circuitous ramp, to a huge entrance rotunda, designed like the porch of an oligarch’s villa. Once inside, you must still process through a series of lobbies and ante-lobbies before you even come to the first gallery. Rather than fixing this mess, the new extension only makes matters more confusing from the outside. If you approach from the south, coming from the Barbara Hepworth Museum, as many visitors will, you encounter what looks like a new entrance. A cluster of greenish-grey ceramic clad volumes face on to a new public space, where the light-wells poke up among areas planted with wild grasses. Yet this entrance is for staff only: all of the visible bits of the new building are back-of-house. To get into the gallery you must go down the hill and navigate Evans &amp; Shalev’s obstacle course of steps and ramps, as before. Another staircase winds down the other side of the new building, originally intended to be an entrance, but it is now a dead-end, only used as a fire escape. Looking up at the Tate from the beach, it’s clear that the whole thing is the wrong way round. You don’t see a proud new extension to the gallery, but the unlovely five-storey block of white-rendered flats with glass balconies, crashing into the museum like a slab from the Costa del Sol. It’s a good thing that a new space for art should help to subsidise seafront homes for the elderly, but both could have been so much better if they had been thought of as a single cohesive project. Instead, the blank granite cliff face of Fobert’s gallery stands mere metres from the back of the housing block, like a diagram of warring neighbours. It is a missed opportunity for the town, and one that you can’t help but think might have been avoided had St Ives welcomed the new gallery for the boon that it is, rather than bullied it into hiding."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/sep/29/family-tree-the-exquisite-brilliance-of-william-morriss-daughter","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T11:00:23Z","webTitle":"Family tree: the exquisite brilliance of William Morris's daughter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/29/family-tree-the-exquisite-brilliance-of-william-morriss-daughter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/29/family-tree-the-exquisite-brilliance-of-william-morriss-daughter","fields":{"headline":"Family tree: the exquisite brilliance of William Morris's daughter","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"At first glance Honeysuckle looks like a classic bit of William Morris. Based on a pattern of intertwining woody stems, curling leaves and fluted flowers, the design hovers somewhere between botanical literalism and stylised motif. The colours are likewise lush but persuasive. Originally made as a wallpaper in 1883, Honeysuckle remains a bestseller to this day. Look closer, though, and you’ll notice that all is not quite as it seems. Instead of those exotic pomegranates and acanthuses that Morris so often went in for, Honeysuckle features the kind of plants you might find in an English cottage garden. The design, too, is airier and less oppressive than the kind of thing he usually did. Unusually for a Morris wallpaper, there is no sense that you are in danger of being mugged by a triffid. Although Honeysuckle sailed under the “William Morris” flag for many years, subsequent archival research has revealed that it was actually the work of his daughter. May Morris was one of the leading artists of the Arts and Crafts movement whose designs for everything from wallpaper to baby’s Christening mittens became the defining feature of many a wealthy, progressive household at the beginning of the 20th century. In particular, May’s brilliance at needlework helped raise what had previously been a trivial female hobby or, worse still, domestic drudgery, into fine art. This autumn an exhibition entitled May Morris: Art &amp; Life will showcase more than 80 of her works, including original artwork, designs, embroidery, jewellery and fashion, many of them borrowed from leading institutions including the V&amp;A, the Ashmolean and the National Trust. There is, of course, a rueful irony in the fact that an exhibition designed to extract May from her father’s long shadow will be held at the William Morris Gallery, the handsome brick house in Walthamstow, east London, devoted to the Victorian titan’s life and work. In many ways, though, the venue makes sense. For the first part of her professional life, May was subsumed in working for “the Firm”, the affectionate nickname by which Morris &amp; Co was known. From its headquarters in the family’s various London homes, the Firm issued a selection of carefully crafted household items, painted furniture and bedsteads, carpets and cushions. All were guaranteed to have been created by an expert hand using artisanal – the word still meant something – methods. The resulting object, made with thought and care, was intended as a soulful reproach to the gimcrackery of industrialised batch production. The younger of William Morris’s two daughters by his beautiful pre-Raphaelite model wife Jane, May was no one’s idea of a shrinking violet. A recently discovered diary from 1870, written when she was eight, suggests a child entirely unawed by having been born into artistic royalty: I shall be nine next twenty fifth of March. I am very untidy and always very dirty and sometimes I am ashamed to say very naughty. I have got light curly hair cut on my forehead. My eyes are blue. I am neither fat nor very thin. Now I have described myself I will have my readers judge whether I am pretty or ugly. In fact she was neither. From her mother, May had inherited a lofty slenderness, while her pugnacious chin and long nose came straight from her father. An early photograph shows a tomboyish May, perched in a tree branch alongside her sister and the Burne-Jones children, gloriously unbound by the starchy protocols of Victorian girlhood. Once back on firm ground, however, May proved to be a model of deftness when it came to learning the exquisite stitchcraft in which her mother and aunt Bessie excelled. There was nothing unusual about young girls learning needlework from their female elders. But the hobby over which middle-class mid-Victorian women laboured so intensely was usually “Berlin Work”, a pedestrian affair involving coarse wool and crude tent or cross stitching. The Morris women, by contrast, dedicated themselves to reviving the precise and precious craft known as “opus anglicanum” that flourished in the medieval English church. Stitched with silk and gold thread, and teeming with elaborate imagery, these exquisite 13th-century altar cloths, psalteries and vestments provided hopeful inspiration for what might still be possible in an age of cheap textiles and bright synthetic dyes. There was never any doubt about the direction in which May’s education and career would take her. While sister Jenny, who had epilepsy, retreated into the twilight of chronic ill health, May stepped into the role of eldest son, embarking on an unofficial apprenticeship that would prepare her to join her father in the Firm. She studied embroidery at the National Art Training School (later the Royal College of Art), before taking over the embroidery department of Morris &amp; Co at the age of just 23. Now she was responsible for producing a stream of new patterns and designs for wallpapers and fabrics, in addition to supervising a team of outworkers and in-house embroiderers. The immaculately kept Morris &amp; Co embroidery daybook shows the young woman dealing confidently with orders for bespoke household items from aristocratic clients including the Countess of Rosslyn and Lady Trevelyan. Then there were Robert and Joanna Barr Smith, a wealthy Scottish couple transplanted to Australia who insisted that their ersatz feudal manors should be decorated top to bottom in the Morris style, carefully shipped from Hammersmith. Other less affluent clients were served by the stock that May and her workers supplied to the Firm’s shop in Oxford Street. Here you could find goods to suit all pockets including popular embroidery kits, containing everything needed to reproduce some of that Morris magic. It was a highly successful business model, in which May did double duty as designer and production manager. May took her inspiration directly from nature, unlike her father, whose designs drew on ancient texts and archival motifs. Key objects in the exhibition include a series of careful botanical drawings and watercolours made from her close observation of the countryside around Kelmscott Manor, the Oxfordshire Elizabethan pile where the Morris family spent part of each year. Indeed, May’s whole practice lay in the articulation of simple forms, whether drawn from nature or vernacular art, made up into practical well-made items for everyday use. What she particularly loathed were overdecorated goods designed mainly for display. Her scorn was reserved for the well-to-do consumer who enjoyed wearing dainty embroidered nightdresses and underclothes without valuing the labour involved “wrought by what underpaid work-girl she does not know or care”. In 1907 May founded the Women’s Guild of Arts in an attempt to raise the professional status and bargaining power of women and girls working on an independent basis in arts and crafts of all kinds. This acute engagement with the politics and economics of making carried May naturally into the socialist movement that her father had done so much to found. She met and campaigned with Eleanor Marx, Annie Besant, Ramsay MacDonald and George Bernard Shaw. Shaw’s diaries record evenings of musical duets with May at Socialist League parties. There were also visits to the theatre to consume the thrilling new drama of Ibsen, with its exploration of what relationships between men and women might look like in this dawning age of sexual equality. It was in this heady atmosphere that May fell in love with Shaw and in 1886 daringly sent him a hand-painted Valentine’s card showing a procession of pre-Raphaelite maidens worshipping at his shrine. The flattered Irishman declared himself unable to marry Miss Morris on the grounds of poverty (at this point he was still a newspaper critic living with his mother) but liked to suggest that there was nonetheless a “mystic betrothal” between himself and May. This romantic notion was slightly spoiled by the news that Shaw was already involved in an affair with a much older woman. On the rebound, May promptly and disastrously married another socialist comrade, Henry Halliday Sparling. One of the most poignant objects in the exhibition is the Homestead and the Forest quilt, which was a collaboration between May and her mother in the months leading up to her wedding. A stitched bestiary, it shows all the creatures on the planet from frogs to crocodiles, and was designed both to cover a child’s cot and to act as a gentle introduction to the wonders of the natural world. May separated from Sparling after just four years, having rekindled her passionate feelings for Shaw (the situation was hardly helped by the fact that the apprentice playwright insisted on coming to live with the newly married couple). May never remarried or had children. Nonetheless, the quilt remained one of her favourite pieces of work and it was singled out for praise in the press following its appearance in 1890 at the third Arts and Crafts exhibition. At the time of William Morris’s death in 1896 May ceased to work directly for the Firm. Now she was free to be recognised as an artist in her own right, exhibiting her work in the increasing number of galleries around the world that recognised fine needlework as an art. It was now, too, that May cemented her authority by publishing Decorative Needlework in which she stressed that excellence was not about mastering many exotic and difficult stitches, but making expressive use of a few ordinary ones such as simple running and darning stitches. Above all, she warned against the art of needle painting, the attempt to imitate in stitch the thousands of shades found in nature “till a libellous caricature of natural growth is achieved”. May spent her later years editing her father’s 24-volume collected works and building a memorial hall to his honour in the village of Kelmscott. She was also responsible for the care of her sister Jenny, a clever girl once destined for Cambridge whose intellectual and affective life had been destroyed by the medication she took for her epilepsy. Living alongside May in Kelmscott Manor – still resolutely uncarpeted, with no running water or heating – was Mary Lobb, a hearty woman who wore plus fours and who Evelyn Waugh cattily insisted on absolutely no grounds was a hermaphrodite. Accompanied by Mary, an elderly May was able to travel to Iceland to retrace the epoch-making journeys her father had made 60 years earlier in search of the Norse myths that inspired so much of his own creative written work. “I’m a remarkable woman – always was, though none of you seemed to think so,” May wrote to Shaw in 1936, 30 years after their romance ended not in the marriage she had hoped for, nor the mystical betrothal he had promised, but in a rueful “comradeship”. Taken out of context, May’s words might sound like something spat out in umbrage after decades of being overlooked by the world in general, and by men in particular. But in fact what this self-possessed woman was offering was nothing less than a clear assessment of just how much she had achieved in her professional and personal life at a time when even privileged women had little control over either. And if no one else had noticed her quiet triumph, well, time would surely tell.

Although fasting is a part of many religious traditions, the evidence for its effect on the brain is mixed. What does seem clear is that calorific restriction (through fasting, the 5:2 diet or just eating less) is one of a familiar set of interventions that can help to keep your brain healthy. Along with physical exercise and intensive mental activity, fasting seems to increase the production of a helpful chemical called BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) which supports the formation of new connections and even new brain cells. It is one of a range of responses to mild stress that ends up making you stronger. In terms of religious fasting, little official data is available, but anecdotally people often eat so much in the meal immediately before the fast begins, and in the one just after it ends, that the total calorific intake for the overall period is about normal. So even while the spiritual significance is clear, it may not bring the medical benefits you hoped for.

Raymond Matimba is believed to have left Britain in 2014 to link up with terrorists in the region. According to the Daily Telegraph, he went on to join a group of high-profile British jihadists that included Emwazi, the executioner also known as Jihadi John. The newspaper also reports that Matimba had links to the Manchester suicide bomber Salman Abedi. Zimbabwean-born Matimba, who adopted the nom de guerre Abu Qaqa al-Britani al-Afro, is said to have become a leading sniper for Isis. The 28-year-old spent time in Raqqa, Isis’s de facto capital, and reportedly may still be alive. The newspaper published a video apparently showing Matimba, Emwazi and Britons Reyaad Khan and Junaid Hussain in a coffee shop in the city in 2014. The men are lounging on sofas, their weapons leaning against the wall, while they charge their phones. The clip, filmed in secret by an infiltrator, is said to be the first to show all four together. The video’s source, whom the newspaper did not identify, told the publication Matimba had urged the terror cell to organise an attack on his home city of Manchester, and had spoken to Salman Abedi in the months before his attack in May. The source said: “He said [to the group] that he hated his city, that he wanted it to be bombed.” Matimba was reported to have been killed this year, however his mother, Moncia, 60, told the newspaper that she had not received any official confirmation. “I am still going through hell and I never expected such a thing like this to happen in my life,” she said. The support worker last heard from her son in 2015 via WhatsApp. “I contacted the counter-terrorism authorities,” she said. “I said I don’t want to talk to him any more. Eventually I changed my number.” Emwazi was killed in a 2015 drone strike after becoming one of the top targets for the US-led coalition fighting Isis. The Kuwaiti-born Londoner appeared in a number the group’s videos, including those in which he is shown murdering American reporter Steven Sotloff and British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning. Emwazi was suspected of having been part of a four-member Islamist terror cell known as The Beatles because of their British accents. Hussain, a computer hacker, was described as a key Isis operative before he was killed by a US drone strike on 24 August 2015. The 21-year-old, from Birmingham, was said to have been number three on the Pentagon’s “kill list” of Isis targets. Khan, from Cardiff, is thought to have travelled to fight in Syria late in 2013 and appeared in the group’s propaganda videos. He died when a car he was travelling in through Raqqa was targeted by an RAF remotely piloted aircraft. This year a Guardian investigation found that 16 convicted or dead terrorists had lived within a 2.5-mile radius of a Moss Side address that was the childhood home of Ronald Fiddler, also known as Jamal al-Harith, who died in a suicide attack near the Iraqi city of Mosul in late February. One of those people was Matimba. After the Manchester arena attack, police confirmed they were investigating bomber Abedi’s links with Raphael Hostey, who was killed in an airstrike in Mosul last April aged 24. Hostey, also known as Abu Qaqa al-Britani, is believed to have sponsored hundreds of terror recruits, including Matimba, Fiddler and Muslim convert and former RAF gunner Stephen Gray."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/27/euthanasia-a-choice-for-people-with-disability-its-a-threat-to-our-lives","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T00:33:32Z","webTitle":"Euthanasia a choice for people with disability?

It's a threat to our lives","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Legislation has been introduced into the Victorian and New South Wales parliament seeking to become the first jurisdictions to legalise euthanasia since the Northern Territories brief window in the 1990s. Like the rest of the community, people with disability debate euthanasia with many views, but a number of us are genuinely concerned that legalised suicide will encroach on our rights and see the vulnerable among us subjected to financial, social, emotional and other pressures to take our own lives. We have cause to be concerned about perverse outcomes if euthanasia is adopted in Australia. In some countries where it has been introduced euthanasia has been offered to people with mental illness, people with dementia, twin brothers who were deaf, and even a woman with severe tinnitus. My challenge to advocates of voluntary euthanasia who insist that here in Australia it would “never be about someone like you”, would be to ask them to specifically rule us out. While the ink has barely dried on the Victorian government’s voluntary assisted dying bill, the legislation introduced by premier Daniel Andrews appears to have embraced the totality of the recommendations of the report of the Victorian ministerial advisory panel. This is troubling given those recommendations bring people with disability clearly into scope. The panel recommends that disability “does not satisfy the eligibility criteria for access to voluntary assisted dying, nor does disability exclude a person from eligibility to access voluntary assisted dying”, while the bill says that a person is not eligible “only because the person has a disability”. Confused? Well, you’re not the only one. This troubling recommendation, that euthanasia should be a choice for us without meeting the eligibility criteria, misunderstands the factors which make too many of us eligible in the first place. As I write this I can easily picture the comments underneath – “it’s a choice” and “if you don’t want it, don’t ask for it”. They’re understandable, but they gloss over justified and reasonably held concerns. The reality is that people like me don’t get choices in too many areas of our lives. That includes a preventative and tertiary health system that is staggeringly unfriendly to us, even if people with disability and/or chronic conditions should be their best customers. When the panel was trying to grapple with the issue of where to draw the line for people with disability, they used an example which perfectly crystallises this lack of meaningful choices in the health system and makes euthanasia such a worrying threat to our lives. Recommending against excluding people with disability from euthanasia, the panel gave the example of Tina, a 43-year-old woman with cerebral palsy. “Fully employed as a disability advocate and educator, Tina lives independently and communicates using a communication tool. Six months ago Tina was diagnosed with an aggressive cancer for which she has now exhausted all treatment options.” The panel felt that Tina should be offered euthanasia because her request was “voluntary and enduring”. What’s also enduring but decidedly involuntary is the chronic lack of access to our health system for many people with a disability like Tina’s. Back in 2003 a community advocacy group, Access for All Alliance, undertook a survey of all general practices around Australia to identify which provided access to adjustable-height examination beds. The survey showed that of the 3,553 response there were just over 14,000 fixed-height examination beds and only 719 adjustable-height examination beds. An open letter from the Human Rights Commission found that in many situations patients, particularly women with disability, do not get a service at all because of the inaccessibility of fixed-height examination beds. One woman had not had a pap smear for 10 years because her doctor could not transfer her on to the fixed-height examination bed. The National People with Disability and Carers Council’s Shut Out report in 2009 also gave a sobering account of the exclusion of disabled people from primary and tertiary healthcare including comorbidity arising from a lack of access to yearly checkups and health screenings. Eight years later the national disability strategy reports very little sustained and meaningful improvement in our access to healthcare including for people with physical disability or communication issues. While the national disability insurance scheme (NDIS) is starting to make a difference in specialist supports, it won’t fix the health system. On the ground, I hear from people who can’t be examined by their GP because they don’t have a height-adjustable exam table. Clinics, primary care, dentists, holistic health and the tertiary health system still have significant barriers to access, especially in regional Australia. If Tina has aggressive cancer there is a very good chance that she couldn’t even get a proper medical exam or the kinds of screening recommended for women her age. She probably couldn’t even find a clinician with the time and capacity to communicate with her. In the real world someone like Tina is also very unlikely to have a job and to be able to afford private health insurance or even find the informal supports that other people could call on following a life-changing health diagnosis. As a woman with disability she’s also far more likely to be facing various forms of violence or abuse that make life seem intolerable. Choice? What a joke. Sitting in Tina’s wheels people with disability are entitled to ask members of parliament: why are you hurrying to grant us the “choice” to die when you never lifted a finger to fix the barriers that made our lives miserable or gave us equal access to preventative health? Until every person with disability has equal access to screening, prevention and treatment in our health system, suicide prevention resources, and meaningful alternatives to ending it all, offering us euthanasia isn’t an act of generous equality. It’s our Hobson’s choice – a fake, cruel one-way exit for vulnerable people locked out of basic healthcare and other social and community infrastructure that others take for granted.

If I could summarise your views thus, they would be to give a broad thumbs up to more visual designs, but perhaps not every week, and to ensure that the text remains legible. Wise advice! Back to this week’s edition of the paper, which features a feast of election coverage from around the world. In Germany, chancellor Angela Merkel won a fourth term in office but saw the far-right populist AfD party make significant gains. On the other side of the world there was electoral stalemate in New Zealand, where Bill English’s National party looked likeliest to form a coalition government after Labour’s great hope Jacinda Ardern fell short. Our cover story this week focuses on Spain, ahead of this weekend’s deeply controversial referendum on Catalan separatism. With allegations of political posturing over national interest and fears for the wider impact on the country, Emma Graham-Harrison reports on the sadness and frustration felt by many Spaniards. We report from Kirkuk in Iraq, where Kurdish citizens held an independence vote despite considerable international urgings to the contrary. And from Australia, where a postal ballot on gay marriage rights is being seen as a barometer for liberal attitudes generally across the nation. On the Finance page we examine the wider prospects for taxi app firm Uber, which has lost its trading licence in London due to a poor corporate responsibility record. Elsewhere in the UK we look at the ramifications of Theresa May’s request for a two-year extension to the Brexit process. And as the Labour party holds its annual conference, we hear from its galvanised leader Jeremy Corbyn on why he believes his party represents the mainstream of British politics. The Weekly Review leads with a powerful long read from Richard Lloyd Parry about the Japanese school that failed to escape the clutches of the 2011 tsunami. I have to admit, this account of the brief passing of minutes from the earthquake siren to the moment the wave struck left me feeling helpless, heartbroken and angry. Our Book reviews catch up with Hillary Clinton’s memoirs of the 2016 US election campaign and struggle to sympathise with the Democratic nominee’s recollection of events. The Culture pages report from Cape Town, where a lavish new waterfront art gallery has divided opinion and shone a light on the country’s stark divisions. And there’s a fascinating catch-up with the veteran US documentary maker Ken Burns, whose epic new televisual history of the Vietnam war has drawn praise from across the political spectrum. From an editor’s point of view, it was one of those weeks in which so much seemed to be going on that I woke up in the night worrying I’d forgotten something important.

Do you believe that intervention should be minimised or that state ownership and regulation should be expanded? This is our central political debate. But it is based on a mistaken premise. Both sides seem to agree that state and market are the only sectors worth discussing: politics should move one way or the other along this linear scale. In fact, there are four major economic sectors: the market, the state, the household and the commons. The neglect of the last two by both neoliberals and social democrats has created many of the monstrosities of our times. Both market and state receive a massive subsidy from the household: the unpaid labour of parents and other carers, still provided mostly by women. If children were not looked after – fed, taught basic skills at home and taken to school – there would be no economy. And if people who are ill, elderly or have disabilities were not helped and supported by others, the public care bill would break the state. There’s another great subsidy, which all of us have granted. I’m talking about the vast wealth the economic elite has accumulated at our expense, through its seizure of the fourth sector of the economy: the commons. That it is necessary to explain the commons testifies to their neglect (despite the best efforts of political scientists such as the late Elinor Ostrom). A commons is neither state nor market. It has three main elements. First a resource, such as land, water, minerals, scientific research, hardware or software. Second a community of people who have shared and equal rights to this resource, and organise themselves to manage it. Third the rules, systems and negotiations they develop to sustain it and allocate the benefits. A true commons is managed not for the accumulation of capital or profit, but for the steady production of prosperity or wellbeing. It belongs to a particular group, who might live in or beside it, or who created and sustain it. It is inalienable, which means that it should not be sold or given away. Where it is based on a living resource, such as a forest or a coral reef, the commoners have an interest in its long-term protection, rather than the short-term gain that could be made from its destruction. The commons have been attacked by both state power and capitalism for centuries. Resources that no one invented or created, or that a large number of people created together, are stolen by those who sniff an opportunity for profit. The saying, attributed to Balzac, that “behind every great fortune lies a great crime” is generally true. “Business acumen” often amounts to discovering novel ways of grabbing other people’s work and assets. The theft of value by people or companies who did not create it is called enclosure. Originally, it meant the seizure – supported by violence – of common land. The current model was pioneered in England, spread to Scotland, then to Ireland and the other colonies, and from there to the rest of the world. It is still happening, through the great global land grab. Enclosure creates inequality. It produces a rentier economy: those who capture essential resources force everyone else to pay for access. It shatters communities and alienates people from their labour and their surroundings. The ecosystems commoners sustained are liquidated for cash. Inequality, rent, atomisation, alienation, environmental destruction: the loss of the commons has caused or exacerbated many of the afflictions of our age. You can see enclosure at work in the Trump administration’s attempt to destroy net neutrality. Internet service providers want to turn salience on the internet – now provided freely by a system created through the work of millions – into something you have to pay for. To ensure there is no choice, they have also sought to shut down a genuine internet commons, by lobbying states to prohibit community broadband. In the crazy plutocracy the US has become, four states have made this form of self-reliance a criminal offence, while others have introduced partial bans. Another example is the extension of intellectual property through trade agreements, allowing biotech companies to grab exclusive rights to genetic material, plant varieties and natural compounds. Another is the way in which academic publishers capture the research freely provided by communities of scientists, then charge vast fees for access to it. I’m not proposing we abandon either market or state, but that we balance them by defending and expanding the two neglected sectors. I believe there should be wages for carers, through which the state and private enterprise repay part of the subsidy they receive. And communities should be allowed to take back control of resources on which their prosperity depends. For example, anyone who owns valuable land should pay a local community land contribution (a form of land value tax): compensation for the wealth created by others. Part of this can be harvested by local and national government, to pay for services and to distribute money from richer communities to poorer ones. But the residue should belong to a commons trust formed by the local community. One use to which this money might be put it is to buy back land, creating a genuine commons and regaining and sharing the revenue. I expand on this idea and others in my recently published book Out of the Wreckage. A commons, unlike state spending, obliges people to work together, to sustain their resources and decide how the income should be used. It gives community life a clear focus. It depends on democracy in its truest form. It destroys inequality. It provides an incentive to protect the living world. It creates, in sum, a politics of belonging. To judge by the speeches at this week’s Labour conference, the party could be receptive to this vision. The emphasis on community and cooperatives (which in some cases qualify as commons), the interest in broadening ownership and fighting oppressive trade agreements, point towards this destination. I hope such parties can take the obvious step, and recognise that the economy has four sectors, not two. That’s the point at which it can begin: the social and environmental transformation for which so many of us have been waiting. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/26/equifax-boss-richard-smith-retires-data-breach","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T13:32:20Z","webTitle":"Equifax chief Richard Smith steps down in wake of massive data breach","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/26/equifax-boss-richard-smith-retires-data-breach","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/26/equifax-boss-richard-smith-retires-data-breach","fields":{"headline":"Equifax chief Richard Smith steps down in wake of massive data breach","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The chief executive of embattled credit agency Equifax announced his retirement on Tuesday, in the wake of a massive data breach that exposed the personal information of 143 million people. Richard Smith, 57, retired with immediate effect, becoming the third senior executive to leave since the breach was reported earlier this month. Equifax’s chief information officer and chief security officer have also left the company. In a statement issued by the company, Smith said: “The cybersecurity incident has affected millions of consumers, and I have been completely dedicated to making this right. At this critical juncture, I believe it is in the best interests of the company to have new leadership to move the company forward.” Smith has been chairman and chief executive officer of the company since 2005. His total compensation was $14.9m in 2016, according to Bloomberg. Equifax is now the subject of multiple state and federal inquiries after the Atlanta-based company said “criminals” had exploited a US website application to access files between mid-May and July of this year. Consumers’ names, social security numbers, birth dates, addresses and, in some cases, driver’s license numbers were exposed. The breach also involved the credit card numbers of about 209,000 US consumers – the largest credit card hack in US history. The company has also come in for criticism for its confusing response to the hack. A class action lawsuit has been filed against the company accusing it of negligence. The Senate committee on banking, housing and urban affairs will hold a hearing on the scandal on 4 October and Smith is still expected to testify. The company has been widely criticized for waiting a month before informing clients that its systems had been compromised. Several top executives sold stock totaling $1.7m days before the hack was made public, and the company has lost about a quarter of its value since making the announcement. In a statement, Mark Feidler, a board member who has been appointed chairman, said: “The board remains deeply concerned about and totally focused on the cybersecurity incident. “We are working intensely to support consumers and make the necessary changes to minimize the risk that something like this happens again. Speaking for everyone on the board, I sincerely apologize. “We have formed a special committee of the board to focus on the issues arising from the incident and to ensure that all appropriate actions are taken.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/26/what-do-you-think-nfl-players-protest","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T14:04:18Z","webTitle":"What do you think about NFL players protesting during the national anthem?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/26/what-do-you-think-nfl-players-protest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/26/what-do-you-think-nfl-players-protest","fields":{"headline":"What do you think about NFL players protesting during the national anthem?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Former 49ers quarterback, Colin Kaepernick, who is now a free agent, first kneeled during The Star-Spangled Banner last August, in protest against police brutality and racial injustice.

Following a year-long investigation into the whole price comparison industry, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Tuesday it was investigating one price comparison site further. The CMA declined to name the company, but Comparethemarket.com – made famous by its highly successful meerkat advertising campaign – said it expected to discuss the issue with the regulator. It also defended its relationships with insurers. The site faces allegations that it has done deals with insurers that prevent them from making cheaper offers on other websites – known in the trade as most favoured nation clauses. Comparethemarket.com said in a statement that it “has some simple contractual arrangements with home insurers to ensure that our customers always get the lowest available price” and that it welcomed “the opportunity to discuss this further with the CMA”. Over the last decade price comparison websites have become a major seller of insurance products as they can be used by consumers to simultaneously check prices with hundreds of insurers. The market is dominated by four big comparison websites: Comparethemarket.com, Moneysupermarket.com, Confused.com and Gocompare.com. The CMA had been investigating whether the sector was operating as transparently as it should. It is thought that an insurance policy sold to a consumer following a comparison site search can net that website as much as £60 commission, although payments are rarely disclosed. The CMA’s chief executive, Andrea Coscelli, speaking as the final report was published, said: “Our study has found that most people in the UK have used a comparison site at least once so it is vital that everyone gets the benefits they deserve. The good news is that more than 90% of the people we surveyed were very or fairly satisfied with the sites they used. “But we have also found that improvements are needed to help people get even better deals. We have set out ground rules for how sites should behave, as well as being clear on how regulators can ensure people have a better experience online. We are also taking enforcement action where we suspect the law may have been broken.” News of the further investigation at Comparethemarket.com will be a blow to the brand’s owner BGL, which last month delayed plans for a float that had been expected to value the business at more than £1bn. The CMA has the power to fine companies up to 10% of turnover if it unearths serious wrongdoing. It said it would announce an update on the investigation in March next year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/06/country-diary-signs-of-life-on-a-shingle-shore","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T04:30:43Z","webTitle":"Country diary: signs of life on a shingle shore","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/06/country-diary-signs-of-life-on-a-shingle-shore","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/06/country-diary-signs-of-life-on-a-shingle-shore","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: signs of life on a shingle shore","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The vast shark’s tooth of shingle that is Dungeness protrudes into the strait of Dover. Though the sky is overcast, as I drive on to the promontory the light intensifies, reflecting from the sea on to the flint pebbles. It’s like walking into a room with glass walls. This is an ancient, undulating, beach dotted with old abandoned boats and sheds. Millennia ago the sea deposited 40 square kilometres of shingle here, sifting it into ridges of smaller pebbles and troughs of bulkier ones. Above the shoreline, Dungeness is a static shingle platform, a huge, flat cairn. This is an exposed environment, buffeted by maritime winds, the closest the UK gets to a desert. In the shingle furrows the conditions are botanically brutal. Water drains away in seconds and any seeds that germinate face a parched demise. Only lichens, community organisms within which fungi and algae and sometimes bacteria co-exist to form a miniature, self-supporting ecosystem, can take hold. I squat down to take a closer look at the delicate but hardy patchwork of this lichen heath and see minute forests of branching and scalloped forms. Their colours are beautiful: subtle aqua greys of Cladonia pentosa and Hypogymnia physodes, mustard yellow of Xanthoria parietina, and pale chartreuse of Flavoparmelia caperata. Fronds of decaying seaweed blow up from the strandline, catch and accumulate between the smaller pebbles on the ridges. Sea kale (Crambe maritima) is a pioneer species, able to germinate in these small traces of humus. A little more soil accumulates around its roots every year as its leaves are shed and with each growing season more drought-tolerant plant species take hold. As I walk between the islands of vegetation I spot the desiccated seedheads of sea campion (Silene uniflora), wild fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), toadflax (Linaria vulgaris), heath bedstraw (Galium saxatile), wild carrot (Daucus carota), yellow horned poppy (Glaucium flavum) and viper’s bugloss (Echium vulgare), all growing near mounds of sea kale. With the help of the wind, these specialised plants are slowly knitting the shingle together with their roots and self-made soil. They are making new land.

All mucking in together to wash the car on a weekend, deeply engaged in conversation while we work. No, neither have I, but this is all part of the job of being the child of an MP. I’m the child second from right with a sponge, doing my bit of election propaganda when my father, George Gardiner, was standing as Conservative candidate in the February 1974 general election. It’s a role thrust upon you, with no say in the decision and, from experience, I can affirm it is no picnic being the child of an MP. This particular photograph never made it, but he won the election and became Conservative MP for Reigate, a job he held until 1997. A rightwing trouble maker, or “a viper slithering around in the parliamentary pit” as John Major described him, he was never low-profile, something not helped by a trenchant column in the Sunday Express. Family is important to the profile of an MP, particularly a Conservative one, so as young children we were expected to play our part, turning up to functions and being on our best behaviour (a frequent fail), though I do remember winning a bottle of wine in the raffle, which I promptly sold to my parents. Or traipsing around old people’s homes wishing the residents happy Christmas and facing the indignity of being told I was a “very pretty girl” (Conservative boys clearly were not expected to have long hair). It was a bit tiresome, but probably good for us. But, as you get older, the role becomes harder. Especially if you go to a liberal north London comprehensive where everyone seemed to come from Labour-supporting families. The fact that leftwing firebrand MP Michael Meacher’s son was in my year only helped make me even more of an alien species. Every Monday morning, I would come in to be told by the son of a prominent solicitor, no doubt prompted by the latest Sunday Express article: “My dad says your dad is a wanker.” A viewpoint probably taken as read by most classmates. I didn’t suffer the torment of the children of the Beckenham Tory MP Bob Stewart who, in a recent parliamentary debate, claimed a teacher had told classmates to shun his son. No teacher victimised me, but there is no doubt some treated me slightly differently. You have a public persona that is not of your choosing, probably much like the children of celebrities, but without the wealth to cushion yourself from it. You would be amazed how many felt the need to challenge, test and probe it. How did I respond? Partly by fitting in, becoming vociferous in my hatred of Margaret Thatcher, but also sometimes by sticking by my father, arguing the case for monetarism with a politics teacher, even though I didn’t believe it. It was often a complicated tightrope. To escape this, when I went to university I kept his job a secret, leading to the hilarious moment when, on a visit to the House of Commons, one of the Leeds University politics society saw me give him a peck on the cheek. When challenged, I just winked and said “the London gay scene” and moved on. No follow-up question came. Overall, it would be honest to say he was often an embarrassment to me, but then to be fair, I probably was to him, with my rejection of much of what he believed in – the invitations to his party functions certainly dried up. But I think I learned a lot from the experience, not least the power of ignorant stereotyping and the petty tribalism of politics, which can be pretty tough on a young child. The idea that you should see your opponents as the enemy, not people; made worse when that enemy is your dad. Or the view that, because he was a Conservative, I must be leading some sort of secret life, as we couldn’t really be as I appeared, that we must be posh and loaded. Er, no. My father grew up living in shabby rented accommodation, the only child of a single mother who worked in a butcher’s shop. What money he had, he earned himself through journalism and his parliamentary salary. So when I see photographs of people such as the mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham showing off in a “Never kissed a Tory” T-shirt, I don’t think “what a class act”. Instead, I see a closed narrow-mindedness. I kissed a Tory throughout my whole life until his death in 2002, and it never did me any harm. Which isn’t to gloss over the difficulties. When your dad is arguing against sanctions for South Africa, for capital punishment, smashing the trade unions and being a Eurosceptic “bastard” in his own party, it could be difficult. But I hang on to the fact that while I profoundly disagreed with him, he was genuinely motivated by making the world a better place. The intentions were good, the actions often awful. Which brings me back to my first election when I was five, “supporting” my father as a candidate in 1970. My memories are largely of cutting up election literature to make collages and having a temper tantrum during the photoshoot, which meant his election address featured a snarling five-year-old. Little did I understand the turmoil going on around me. It was taken in the parliamentary constituency of Coventry South, a seat near Birmingham, where, two years earlier, Enoch Powell made his infamous “rivers of blood” speech and, in 1964, Peter Griffiths had won a shock victory in Smethwick off the back of a pamphlet that stated: “If you want a nigger for a neighbour, vote Labour.” It was a toxic environment and the popular pressure to go along with Powell was immense, including from local party activists. Instead, my father made efforts to build bridges with the immigrant community, especially the Sikhs, whom he saw as natural Tories. It may not have won him the seat, but it was the right thing to do, and he formed a connection with many in Britain’s Sikh community that lasted until his death. I can be proud of that. Now I’m 52, with children of my own, and I still keep quiet about who he was. I’m no longer embarrassed by him, but would rather people judge me on who I am, not where I come from. I suspect things are so much worse for the children of MPs today. With the abuse of trust highlighted by the expenses scandal and the wave of simplistic populism sweeping the world, our politicians have never been held in such low esteem. Rather than settling for a playground jibe, social media allows critics a megaphone with which to berate MPs and their kin. I know I can look my kids in the eye and say: “Don’t worry, I’ll never be an MP,” in the knowledge that it’s in their best interests. But that says something rather sad about our world, doesn’t it?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"stage/2017/oct/01/charlotte-spencer-dance-is-this-a-wasteland","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T07:00:11Z","webTitle":"Charlotte Spencer: ‘We’ll be harnessing a more feral part of ourselves’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/01/charlotte-spencer-dance-is-this-a-wasteland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/oct/01/charlotte-spencer-dance-is-this-a-wasteland","fields":{"headline":"Charlotte Spencer: ‘We’ll be harnessing a more feral part of ourselves’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Charlotte Spencer, 35, is a choreographer whose work explores our relationship with landscape and the environment.

Where will Is This a Waste Land? take us? The piece is set on disused land between London City Airport and a former flour mill. I like to search out places awaiting redevelopment. Demolished places – where you might find holes in the ground and mounds of rubble. The performances are timed to coincide with dusk. There will be six live performers and up to 80 participants, wearing headphones. They’ll be hearing a series of instructions and a soundtrack of various field recordings. The choreography occurs in the space between instruction and interpretation. So the participants are both performers and spectators? Spectators of each other, yes. Ultimately, it’s out of our control. Unlike in a stage performance, the audience has agency. So there’s a precariousness and a delicacy about the event and we can’t know what it looks like until it happens. The piece is an invitation to the participants to have a physical experience. Hopefully, we’ll be harnessing a wilder, more feral part of ourselves. I have a rule: no phones. Otherwise, there’s nothing to say about how you should behave in these spaces. Is it difficult gaining access? There are always complex political issues. For developers, there are all sorts of reasons to keep these empty packets of land out of bounds. There’s health and safety, obviously. They don’t want any kind of liability for anyone injuring themselves. But there are also issues of control. There are times, just prior to sale, when developers like to have artists around to give properties an edge. But most of the time they very much don’t want them there. Why do you think you have this affinity for landscape? I grew up in near Canterbury and loved spending time outdoors, climbing trees and scrambling about. My mum used to tease me about holidays. I used to say: “I’m only going if there are pointy mountains.” We went to the Swiss-Italian Alps, the Picos de Europa in Spain and the Pyrenees and I got a lot of energy from those landscapes. In 2010, I made a piece called Mountain Dialogues. I was interested in the way we hold time in our bodies and the way this relates to the imperceptible movement of mountains. In any place I work I can’t help but be informed by the particularities, the history and how and whether it’s been peopled. What can those taking part expect to experience? Connecting to these landscapes leads to a wildness, and a chaotic experience, that I think is beautiful. You say to yourself: “What the fuck is going on?” In that sense, it’s like life.

Various legends have proliferated in that gap, but it was while exploring the idea that early Christianity is inflected with Buddhism that Theroux happened upon one of history’s fascinating obscurities: the Russian journalist and spy Nicolas Notovitch, who claimed to have discovered the answer. In 1894 he published a bestselling book called The Unknown Life of Jesus, his “translation” of a record of Jesus’s travels through India studying with Hindus and Buddhists. Notovitch had found this ancient Tibetan text, he explained, at a monastery in Ladakh, where he was recovering from a broken leg. “I thought, what on earth is a Russian doing in that corner of the British empire in the 1880s?” says Theroux. “It’s totally mysterious, he can’t be up to any good.” This was also the time when the Russian secret service was setting up a branch in Paris to conduct “a kind of war on terror” against revolutionary elements – and the mysterious Notovitch seemed to be caught up in that too. A decade of obsession followed, and the result is The Secret Books, a rich stew of fiction with a tantalising basis in fact and some pertinent things to say about our present era’s relationship to propaganda and narrative manipulation, as well as the way “storytelling shapes the world we find ourselves in”. Theroux’s wife, a former editor at his publisher Faber who now works in TV, came back from a books festival with a tote bag bearing the cheery quote “Stories are bridges to other worlds”. “I thought yes, but they are only as benign as the people who wield them. They are actually poisonous and vindictive and false as much as they are bridges. That was the controlling idea of the book.” Because Notovitch’s new gospel wasn’t the only secret book to come out of Russia’s fin de siècle: its dark twin in the novel, which has had a far more powerful afterlife, is the antisemitic forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, first published in Russia in 1903. “I’m not Jewish, so I’d never envisage myself writing a book where Jewish identity was a factor, but it hadn’t dawned on me the extent to which antisemitism is a creation of the Russian empire. To me The Protocols is the great fake news story of the last 200 years,” Theroux says. “Think about this: ex-KKK leader David Duke, who is one or two removes from Trump, says The Protocols is a real guide to the machinations of world Jewry in 2017. It’s like an undead curse, and the template for all other conspiracy theories.” Of course, the curse goes back further still: antisemitism, as Theroux points out, is “encoded into the storytelling of the gospel writers”. The moment in Matthew when the crowd respond to Pilate washing his hands of responsibility for Jesus’s death with the cry “His blood be on us, and on our children”, reveals “the fake news writer, the Breitbart guy, the manipulation of story happening in the 2nd century AD. You make him the goodie, you make him the baddie, then set wheels in motion that have consequences 2,000 years later”. Aptly for a book buzzing with conspiracies and conspiracy theories, it’s become unexpectedly timely over the course of its composition, as the rise of fake news eats away at the lines between fiction and reality and reports of antisemitic attacks increase. “It is quite spooky,” Theroux admits. “I think of it in a Taoist way: if you follow your obsessions, you’ll match up with the flow of the universe.” The novel also wrestles with fears about the purpose of fiction in a post-truth era: the novelist’s queasy feeling that “I’m surrounded by people who are lying about stuff, why add more fabulation, what on earth can that do?” There are several false starts as Theroux interjects himself into the narrative, changing the sex of characters, digressing into the joys and terrors of open-air swimming in his local south London lido and diverting into family history before the rollicking adventure story of the narrative proper kicks in. “Usually when I write I have a separate book where I put my gloom and despondencies – the process of how the story emerges, the mess it comes out of. So I thought I’d incorporate some of that, like a Pompidou Centre of a novel, where some of the workings are on the outside.” The most striking element in these meta-fictional hijinks is that rather than avoiding anachronism, like most historical novels, The Secret Books rejoices in it. In what he admits is a “Marmite” gambit, he repeatedly breaks the fictional spell: modern slang and technology pepper the page, the tsar is compared to Darth Vader, and characters direct each other to “check out my blog”. “I did think about writing it as a conventional historical novel – ‘One morning, in 1887, Nicholas Notovitch woke up and yawned’ – and I just felt so despondent. I don’t want you to have that comfortable feeling that ‘this is an authentic reproduction of 19th-century France that bears no relation to the present day’. It’s happening now. History doesn’t stop. That’s a realisation of middle age – you develop an awareness that we’re in history in a really terrible way.” Theroux is now nearly 50; he published his first novel, A Stranger in the Earth, when he was 30, but it was the follow-up, 2001’s The Paperchase, that he counts as his “first real book”. It was inspired by another fertile absence in literature, Sherlock Holmes’s cleverer brother Mycroft, but is more notable for drawing on the sibling rivalries of his own family. These included father Paul and uncle Alexander, writers whose fractious relationship has played out over decades through fictionalised memoirs and caustic book reviews, as well as his own relationship with his younger brother Louis, whose TV documentaries exploring the stranger corners of US society had already made him a star. He wasn’t nervous at the time about fictionalising his family because “A, it’s not that much like them – I felt I changed it a lot – and B, Jesus, you lot have all been writing about each other for the last 20 years!” Nearly two decades on, rivalry remains “a scab you can pick at. You always have that in you. But if you go down the road of making comparisons … One interviewer said: ‘You sound like your brother and you look like your brother, why aren’t you as successful as your brother?’ And I thought, wow, that’s amazing, why aren’t you as successful as my brother?!” Theroux was born in Uganda, where his parents were both teaching, his father with the US Peace Corps, then in universities; his British mother, Anne Castle, with VSO. “They were idealistic, maybe with an element of the white saviour thing.” The family moved to south London, then boarding at Westminster from 13 offered “‘early adulthood, some sense of independence”. He was friends there with Nick Clegg, “an amazing reader – him and Barack Obama must be the only two modern politicians who read novels”. After studying English at Cambridge and international relations at Yale – “a bit of a dry biscuit”; he’d chosen it because it seemed more useful than literature – he spent some time “trying to sidestep being a writer. I wanted to write a novel but I didn’t want to say I did.” A “little bit of gloom and confusion, of the common or garden variety” – anxiety at the blank page of life opening up after the structures of formal education – sent him into psychoanalysis, which “opened up an internal space to think about writing”. An awareness grew that if he didn’t do it now, he’d regret never trying: “No one’s going to give you permission. There’s no point at which someone says it’s time to write a novel.” Weighing up the anxiety of influence against the example of family role models, he agrees it’s probably easier to get started when books are the family profession. You have “a notion of what it involves, some practical sense. Also I can ring my dad up and say ‘I’m stuck’ or ‘I’ve got a terrible review’ and he’s a good corner man. But I don’t read too much of my dad’s stuff because I feel like I’ve already got quite a lot of it in my brain. There’s a slight anxiety: ‘Who wrote that sentence?’” He is “steering clear” of his father’s forthcoming Mother Land, a novel about a controlling matriarch and her seven children, which bears inescapable similarities to the older Theroux generation and was described by Stephen King in the New York Times as “an exercise in mean-spirited score-settling”. “Diplomatically it’s a bit of a no win,” Theroux says. “If I read it and like it I’m going to piss off my family, and if I read it and don’t like it I’m going to upset my dad. I’d much rather be friends with everyone. “My dad has a devilish streak,” he admits, in reference to his childhood experience of having his diaries mined for material (Theroux senior’s line at the time: “I’ve got a chit from matron”). His own children are now nine and 11: would you do that to them? “No, no!” Does that mean you have less of a splinter of ice in your heart? “Yeah, I guess I have.” One unambiguous benefit of having Paul Theroux as a father was his recommendation of Marcel’s 2009 novel Far North to Haruki Murakami, who was so impressed that he translated it into Japanese. “I don’t know if he’s taken liberties with the translation,” Theroux says. “Better not to know. If you translated it back into English, it would have sold more in the UK than the original.” A survival story set in Siberia after the world has been overturned by climate change, the novel brings warmth, humanity and otherworldliness to an often grim genre and was shortlisted for the Arthur C Clarke award. It was followed by 2013’s Strange Bodies, an ingenious metaphysical investigation into consciousness and reincarnation as well as a fiendishly high-concept slice of SF. “I love genre – high genre, that takes good writing seriously,” Theroux says. “It’s got to be entertaining. I take a certain amount of pride in set-ups and payoffs and reversals. That’s why I read, I love that stuff. Enchantment is a really powerful tool, and maybe in literary fiction we don’t talk enough about that.” Throughout his writing career Theroux has travelled extensively as a documentary maker and journalist. “When you first write a book your fantasy is that you’ll be able to stay in a cottage and write deathless prose; actually you have to make deals with the world to earn a living. It’s good to be in the world and reflect about history. Being so solitary isn’t good for your mental health. Writers do get crazy and weird.” But he’s now grounded by marriage and children, comfortably settled in a corner of south London that feels reminiscent of his own childhood. “I like that it feels normal. Normality is good, isn’t it, in life. Keep the life normal, and keep the work weird. You don’t want to do it the other way round.” • The Secret Books is published by Faber.

Clive Lewis, the former shadow secretary of state for energy, singled out GMB for being too close to the nuclear lobby and said it was not speaking up for renewable energy because it did not have members there. He also questioned why unions “fight to the bitter end” for the arms industry. His comments reflect tensions within the Labour movement over union support for nuclear power and a nuclear deterrent. GMB, Unite and Prospect have tens of thousands of members in the nuclear and arms industries. Corbyn has called for a “nuclear-free world”. Lewis told a fringe event on energy at Labour’s conference in Brighton: “One of the problems with where trade unions are at the moment is that they have been so weakened that I think they have become, and have been used by big business as, a voice for big business. “Because big business understands that if you have a unionised workforce they also become spokespeople for you. They create a situation where you have a wide and broad spectrum politically of people supporting your particular position. “On nuclear, yes, GMB and other unions are staunchly supporting it because the jobs there generate union members. Contrast that to the highly self-employed solar sector: the unions have no trade unions there. They are not speaking up at all for them.” He said unions had thrown their weight behind plans for Hinkley Point C, the first new nuclear power plant to be built in the UK for 20 years. “That is one of the reasons that a big song and dance and hoo-ha about solar wasn’t made by the unions and yet they are getting staunchly behind Hinkley,” Lewis said. “It is also the reason why trade unions fight to the bitter end on the arms industry – because they have high-quality jobs and strong membership there and this is their lifeblood. Without the members they don’t exist.” He told a 60-strong audience at an event organised by Labour Energy Forum that the Labour movement needed to do more to get involved in the renewable energy sector. “There are obviously other things we could do – we could encourage unions and activism in the renewal industries as something that is good for business,” he said. A GMB spokesperson reacted furiously to Lewis’s comments. He said: “We’ll put copies of the Uber and Addison Lee judgments in the post for Clive. He can have a read about what taking on big business and organising ‘self-employed workers’ really looks like. “Our energy workers keep the lights on. Of course we want more renewables, and we want good renewable jobs here in the UK, but right now they don’t exist because the government isn’t investing. “GMB will always stand up for our members and their jobs – that’s who we speak for, that’s what a trade union does.” GMB has confirmed that its 3,000 members working at Sellafield in Cumbria will go on strike on Wednesday over a pay row."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2017/sep/26/manchester-city-v-shakhtar-donetsk-champions-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T21:14:45Z","webTitle":"Manchester City 2-0 Shakhtar Donetsk: Champions League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/sep/26/manchester-city-v-shakhtar-donetsk-champions-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/sep/26/manchester-city-v-shakhtar-donetsk-champions-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Manchester City 2-0 Shakhtar Donetsk: Champions League – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"That’s an impressive win for City against a fine team who gave them a stiff test. After an even first half City shifted into a higher gear in the second period and cruised to victory. The margin should have been bigger but they’re looking good in the group. Splendid by Sterling! Wide on the right wing he released Bernardo Silva and then sprinted into the box. Silva had the coolness to wait before playing a low pass from the right to Sterling, who, near the penalty spot, slams the ball into the net via the underside of the bar. Shakhtar substitution: Petriak on, Bernard off. 87 min: A superb pass by Gundogan into the path of Sane. The winger dashes into the box and could centre for Bernardo Silva, who’s pleading for a pass eight yards from goal. But Sane gets greedy, beats one defender and then tries to sidestep another. He’s run into traffic at the edge of the six-yard box and his shot is smothered. Silva turns away in disgust. City should really be out of sight by now. 86 min: Sane, at the left-hand corner of the City box, tries to slalom his way past Butko. the does enough to create space for a shot, but lashes wide. City substitution: Bernardo Silva on, Aguero off. So that’s Aguero and Jesus resting up before Chelsea. 82 min: Gundogan cuts out a pass on the edge of his own area and then lopes 60 yards forward. He puts in Aguero, who tries to dupe the last defender by feinting one way and then the other. But, like Pyatov for the penalty, the defender isn’t buying Aguero’s tricks. Shot blocked. It’s like Aguero’s power have evaporated ever since he got within a goal of Eric Brook’s record. City substitution: Having thoroughly checked the stadium to make sure Claudio Yacob isn’t on the premises, Guardiola throws on Gundogan. Off trots Silva to a deserved ovation. 79 min:De Bruyne bursts from midfield and tries to release Aguero, but the Argentinian had stopped his run, thinking De Bruyne was going to put through Sterling instead. 76 min: Five Shakhtar players converge on the ref to demand a penalty after Stones inadvertently cuts out a cross with his arm! The official evidently decides that Stones was too close to get out of the way - about three yards - but Shakhtar complain that his arm at no business being outstretched, which it was because he was pointing to where he wanted Walker to cover. 73 min: City have missed some glaring chances in this half - especially that Sterling one and Aguero’s spotkick -, will they be punished with a sucker punch? That was almost Zaza-esque! Aguero approached the ball with baby steps, hoping the keeper would dive one way so he could go the other. But the keeper faced him down, and Aguero’s shot wasn’t close to the corner so Pyatov was able to push it away. Eric Brook would have scored that. Sane goes down under a flimsy challenge by Ordets. That didn’t look like a foul on second inspection, but you can see why the ref thought it was on the first. 69 min: Walker tucks a lovely 20-yard pass down the right wing. De Bruyne, on the run, produces another perfect delivery, obliging Sterling to score from six yards. But Sterling loses his composure, or something, and shanks wide from six yards! How can such a super player finish so badly so often? 68 min: Shakhtar launch a counter-attack down the left. The rapid Ismaily charges past Walker and curls over a dangerous cross, just beyond Ferrerya, who couldn’t quite keep up with his speedy team-mate. 67 min: De Bruyne curls a low freekick into the box from the left. Otamendi tries to flick it towards goal from eight yards but fails to get a true touch. 66 min: Ordets booked for taking down Silva after City forced Shakhtar to cough up possession again. 64 min: City are bossing this now; Shakhtar seem to have punched themselves out in the first half and are now struggling to match the hosts’ pace. But they’ll not give up hope so long as City only have a one-goal lead. 62 min: The camera picks out Benjamin Mendy making his way to a seat in the crowd, on crutches. We’ll get news of his injury status in the coming days: all we can say for sure at this stage is that he is the third player this season to be struck down moments after I brought him into my fantasy team. 61 min: Aguero skedaddles into the box at the left-hand corner. But his control abandons him, so a grateful defender whacks the ball out of play. 58 min: City are starting to thrum. They’re lording it in possession terms now. Are Shakhtar waiting for a second wind or have they folded? 56 min: A sublime chipped pass by Silva! On the run, he lifted the ball over the defence from 25 yards out and dropped it into the path of Aguero, who volleyed it at goal from seven yards. But straight at Pyatov, who beats it away! 54 min: Jesus gets a consoling word for Guardiola on the sideline: it’s nice to see a player so depressed at being taken off. It’s also nice to see Sterling on the pitch: he’s been brilliant so far this season. City substitution: Sterling on, Jesus off. The Brazilian looks downcast, seemingly due to disappointment rather than injury. 52 min: Another good tackle by Delph, this time on Talson, who was excellent in the first half but hasn’t been able to pull so many strings in this one. Delph has defended very well and only been exposed when team-mates have left him outnumbered. 50 min: Butko hares past Delph down the right and collects a pass, then blasts the ball into the danger zone. Otamendi stretches out a leg to clear it at the near post. Marlos plays a slack pass in midfield, straight to De Bruyne, who nudges it forward to Silva. The Spaniard scurries forward, probes a little and then feeds De Bruyne, who’s about 25 yards out, a little to the right. He takes one touch to set himself up and then sweeps a curler into the top corner! 47 min: Talson gobbles up a weak clearance by Stones. Players stream forward to provide the Brazilian with options for the pass. He slips it wide to an overlapper, but Delph slides in with a fine tackle to snuf out the trouble. 46 min: Here we go again, with the same personnel as in the first half. Guadiola was not wrong: this is a proper test for City. So far they’re just about holding their own against a very tenacious and slick side, who’ve had slightly better possession and created some clear opportunities. City have posed threats, too, of course, but nowhere near as many as they’ve been used to this season. How will City react to this unfamiliar challenge? 44 min: Talson flies down the left and then slips the ball through to the overlapping Ismaily, who’s fast enough to stay ahead of Walker before cracking a low cross into the danger area. Stones clears awkwardly. 43 min: As we approach half-time, City are massed in their own half, trying to figure out how to get the ball back. Or, at least, how to prevent Shakhtar from infiltrating. 41 min: Delph feeds Sane, who glides past two defenders and into the box. He bears gracefully down on goal from the left-hand side and slots a pass beyond the advancing keeper ... and inches past the far post! 40 min: A freekick from the right for Shakhtar. It’s dinked over the defence towards the near post, where Ferreyra arrives and gets his head to it from six yards. Just wide! 38 min: City are a tad flummoxed. Shakhtar are defending in such numbers and so well that the home side don’t quite know how to open them up. And the troubling thing for them is that when Shahtar attack, they also do that very well and in good number. 36 min: More danger from Shakhtar! They stream forward down the right, overwhelming Delph before Butko fires over a low cross. Ederson dives low to bat it away with one hand. It doesn’t go very far but, fortunately for him, Otamendi tidies up. 34 min: Sane, mostly on the left so far, wanders across to the right and receives the ball. He jinks in-field and offloads a low curler from 20 yards. Good save by Pyatov! 32 min: Ismaily robs Walker at the edge of the Shakhtar area ... and the skedaddles 60 yards forward! The ball is eventually poked of his foot but Shakhtar reclaim it. Marlos tries a sneaky curler from 20 yards out on the right-hand side, aiming for the bottom left-hand corner. Ederson dives to push the ball away. 30 min: Jesus pounces on a loose pass by Fred on half-way. He turns provider for De Bruyne, closing in on goal from the left-hand side of the box. But De Bruyne pulls his low shot wide of the near post! He’s sparkled for most of the night but that was poor. 27 min: “He’s like a quarterback,” coos Owen Hargreaves on BT on the subject, of course, of De Bruyne, who’s just deposited another long bomb on the foot of Aguero. But the Argentinian’s control is not of the same standard, so Shakhtar get a reprieve. 25 min: Stepanenko has an opportunistic pop from 25 yards. It floats way over the bar. Don’t think that counts as goalmouth action. 23 min: We have ourselves a chess match here and it’s quite gripping. But if simple folks like myself will start demanding more goal-mouth action pretty soon. 20 min: De Bruyne is a marvel! He has to be one of the world’s most efficient players: his every touch advances an attack. Just now the ball game to him at knee-height just inside the Shakhtar half and he immediately guided a curling first-time pass around the last defender and towards Aguero, who might have got on the end of it before the keeper if he had been expecting such ingenuity. 19 min: There’s little goal-mouth action but this is a very interesting game. In particular it’s going to be fascinating to see how City, so dominant so far this season, cope with having to chase the ball for sustained periods. Will their concentration lapse? 16 min: City try to regain the upperhand. After zipping the ball around for a bit, Silva threads a lovely low pass from the half-way line into the path of Aguero, who’s got the run on the last defender. But the goalkeeper is wise to that ploy and he sprints out of his box to boot clear. 15 min: The impressive Bernard curls in a corner from the left. It’s flicked on at the near post but flies past the far one without anyone else getting a touch. 14 min: Shakhtar have turned the tables on their hosts. They’re hogging possession now and looking very dangerous with it. This is indeed shaping up to a be a proper test for City. 12 min: Another lovely, high-tech move by Shakhtar! They’re very nimble technicians and their threat is growing. And this time they open City up, only for an uncharacteristically heavy touch by Fred to allow Delph to make a crucial last-ditch tackle at the edge of the box. 10 min: Snappy passing by Shakhtar takes them to within shooting range for the first time. City shut down any opening, but even Guardiola must admire the passing the interplay that took the Ukrainians so far forward. 8 min: Aguero darts on to a lovely through-ball from De Bruyne, who spoonfed him from the right wing. Aguero’s first touch was good but he didn’t catch his shot quite right so Pyatov makes a more comfortable save than expected. 6 min: A defensive mistake opens the door for City! Rakitskiy bungled his attempted interception, and suddenly Jesus can skitter into the box, down the right-hand side. He pulls the ball back towards Sané in the middle, but Fred had spotted the danger and was well placed to make a timely intervention. 5 min: Shakhtar have looked accomplished so far. City are having most of the ball but the visitors are well organised and not allowing themselves to be opened up. 3 min: Aguero picks up the ball near the left-hand corner of the Shakhtar box. He weaves his way past two players and then tries to curl a shot into the far corner of the net. Almost incredibly, it goes out for a throw. That’s so unusual that even he can’t help smiling. 2 min: No signs of nervousness from the visitors, unsurprisingly. They’re calmly passing the ball around from the back. But as soon as City win it back, it’s clear that the home side’s intentions are more aggressive: they don’t just stroke the ball about, the ping it. 1 min: Off we go. Now that the boos have subsided, the atmosphere is remarkably quiet. Fashion followers may like to know that City are in their sky blue shirts with white shorts. Shakhtar are in their away outfit, a white number with orange shoulders and sleeves. Their shorts are black. Boooooooooooooooooo! Yes, it’s the Manchester City Champions League anthem and it’s getting another rousing rendition as the teams stand to attention! The manager has used his pre-match powwow with BT to (a) scoff at suggestions that his team is perfect (b) say he will know the extent of Mendy’s injury in the next day or two and (c) big up Shakhar, saying they will help tell where City are at right now. “They are well organised in zonal marking ... and when they have the ball, they play from the back. They have the ability with one pass to find their team-mates behind our midfield lines and then they are so quick and dangerous. I’ve played against them eight times and I’ve always had the feeling ‘wow, how good they are’! It will be a good test for us to see how is our level now in the Champions League.” If Braga left today, that would be a good result. But hopefully that doesn’t mean they’ll be negative. City are vulnerable at the back, especially with Mendy missing, and we can expect Shakhtar to try to exploit that. They failed to make the group stages last season but they were confident travellers in the Europa League, scoring five at Gent and four in Braga before winning at Celta Vigo. Evidently being forced to play their ‘home’ matches 500km from their actual home (because of conflict in Ukraine) they’ve got used to play away. Here you go. Most notable for City - given Guardiola could just pluck names from a golden hat when it comes to choosing his attack - is that Fabian Delph will continue filling in as a left-back/roving midfielder. He’s no Benjamin Mendy but he’s done a decent job in that role in recent weeks. Further forward, the answer to the weekly ‘which brilliant young winger will start this time’ is Sané rather than Sterling. Meanwhile, Shakhar, as ever, have a slew of talented Brazilians, with the midfielder Fred, in particular, reputed to be hot stuff. It’s all very exciting. City: Ederson; Walker, Stones, Otamendi, Delph; De Bruyne, Fernandinho, D Silva; Jesus, Aguero, Sané Subs: Bravo, Danilo, Sterling, Gundogan, Mangala, B Silva, Touré Shakhtar: Pyatov; BUtko, Ordets, Rakitskiy, Ismaily; Fred, Stepanenko; Marlos, Taison, Bernard; Ferreyra Subs: Shevchenko, Khocholava, Dentinho, Alan Patrick. Petriak. Azevedo, Kovalenko Referee: M De Sousa (Portugal) Hello. The theory that Manchester City are an unstoppable force is about to be jabbed and probed like never before. Or unlike any other time so far this season, at any rate. Because on Sunday they face Chelsea and today they host Shakhtar Donetsk, who, on a scale of 1 to 10 - with 10 being European Champions Real Madrid and 1 being Total Crystal Palace - are a 7.5, or thereabouts. When the draw was made the Ukrainian side were expected to be competing with Feyenoord for the right to meet Arsenal in the latter rounds of the Europa League, but they ridiculed those presumptions by beating Napoli in their first group game. So they’re proper contenders in this group and City surely won’t take them lightly. Which is not to say that City will do anything other than seek to annihilate the visitors. It’s a beautiful attitude that Guardiola is developing at City, the drive to batter the opposition senseless and then just keep on battering. This is just sport, so there must be no relenting, no pity. City enjoying dancing on their prone victims and you can’t help liking them for that. If you’re going to spend gazillions buying up most of the best players in the world, then you’d better win with imperial swagger and contempt. Entertain us at least, you pompous tyrants, otherwise you’re really just blinged-up bureaucrats."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/01/musical-cookery-at-the-sportsman-restaurant-in-kent","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T05:00:08Z","webTitle":"Musical cookery at the Sportsman restaurant in Kent","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/01/musical-cookery-at-the-sportsman-restaurant-in-kent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/01/musical-cookery-at-the-sportsman-restaurant-in-kent","fields":{"headline":"Musical cookery at the Sportsman restaurant in Kent","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"I have heard people say they see colours when they cook, and that this is how they make sense of food. I don’t know how that works, but I can understand, as I see food and music as analogous. When I am finishing a sauce or soup, I can’t help thinking as I would if I had a graphic equaliser and was balancing something in a song. The treble is like acidity, so if I need a bit more, I add a few drops of lemon or lime juice, or cider vinegar. The idea is not to be able to taste the lemon, but to stimulate the sides of the mouth and create an illusion that the whole of the mouth is filled. It is a bit like those old buttons on stereos marked “wide” – press the button and the sound appeared to spread out and seem bigger. I see salt as bass, which is easy to adjust, although I always check how new chefs season their dishes. If they are using Maldon or our homemade salt, both of which come in flakes, I make sure they rub it between their fingers to break it down a bit. I get strange looks when I ask young chefs to show me how they season, but it is so fundamental it should be discussed. The mid-range is umami, and it is true that if you don’t have a strong middle, in music or food, then you will struggle to “finish” with adjustments to seasoning. The mid-range gives a dish depth and should be there when the cooking is done. It can be solved by adjusting the recipe to add an umami element, such as parmesan or even ketchup, which increases the savouriness. In winemaking the French have a word, matière, which translates as “material” or “stuff”, and this seems to be in the mid-range. If you are tasting a dish to finish the seasoning and it lacks “middle”, then you probably haven’t followed the stages properly, from reduction, deglazing and other methods that help to develop flavour. To use another musical term, these processes create a kind of compression, because they focus and concentrate flavour. Without wishing to torture this extended analogy, I also see the rise of the gastropub in musical terms. When I was looking for a site for my restaurant, before finding the Sportsman, I read an article in the trade press that said that it costs £1m to open a Michelin-starred restaurant. What they meant was a “posh” restaurant, as the two were seen as the same – no relaxed restaurant had stars back then, not even the River Café or St John. This reminded me of the mid-70s, when to form a band would cost a fortune, because you needed a 20-piece drum kit – complete with a gong – as well as banks of keyboards, synthesisers and emulators. And not forgetting those huge four-by-four cabinets, to make sure the lead guitar made your ears bleed. Then the music required a degree from the Royal College to play, as you offered up your interpretation of a Mussorgsky piece. The whole music industry had become bloated and needed to be taken down a peg or two. That is why punk was so refreshing in 1976. It gave people the confidence to form bands with limited equipment but lots of talent. It should be said, of course, that there was also a load of rubbish – which is where the image of punk came from – but the important thing was that it was a revolution from the bottom up. I thought of this as I plotted a way of opening my own place. All I needed was a building with four walls, a roof and a kitchen; the rest of the trappings felt unnecessary. I didn’t like the idea of a restaurant floor packed with staff who had just the one job, like handing out the cutlery; a waiter who was only there to sneer at your choice of wine and then hide it from you on the other side of the room. In such places, I could sometimes feel the eyes of all the floor staff burning into the back of my head as they waited for me to finish what I was eating. Of course, in most restaurants, the floor staff are professional, but in others, there was neither the skill nor numbers of trained staff to execute this style of service. This meant that you often had a young, poorly trained waiter carrying out a function that he clearly didn’t understand. Being well brought up, I would often spend the meal trying to help make his evening run smoother. I realised we would have to find a different way to serve the food, and it was a visit to the Walnut Tree in Abergavenny that gave me the answer. The front-of-house staff were just bright, intelligent people from the town who carried out their function as if it were a busy café: fast, friendly and efficient with no pretence, formality or uniforms. I was beginning to like this idea of a jumble sale Michelin-starred restaurant. It divided people – some really didn’t like it. They liked the tablecloths, crockery and sommeliers because these things told them they were in a good restaurant. This was just plain snobbery and needed to be challenged. Would these people recognise the food was as good or better than many top restaurants without these signifiers? Either way, I wanted to find out.

Despite attempts by Theresa May to circumvent deadlock in Brussels by holding private talks with EU leaders about her latest negotiating stance, Tusk emerged from 90 minutes of discussion in Downing Street with only a slightly warmer response. “I feel cautiously optimistic about the constructive and more realistic tone of the prime minister’s speech in Florence and our discussion today,” Tusk told reporters. “This shows that the philosophy of having cake and eating it is finally coming to an end. At least I hope so.” But he insisted that the UK needed to show more willingness to settle its financial obligations and on the rights of EU citizens before the EU would be willing to enter the next phase of talks on a future trade deal. “We will discuss future relations with the UK once there is sufficient progress,” said the council president, who represents national governments in Brussels. “The sides are working hard at it but if you ask me, and if today member states ask me, I would say there is not sufficient progress yet.” Downing Street said the prime minister had used the meeting to call on the EU to be more “imaginative and creative” and also stressed the “importance of agreeing a period of implementation once Britain leaves the EU in March 2019”. “At the end of the meeting, the PM said her Florence speech had been intended to create momentum in the ongoing talks,” said a No 10 spokesperson. “She said it was important for EU negotiators to now respond in the same spirit.” Earlier, the prime minister urged Tusk to consider her speech last week calling for a transition period and continued payments as a moment to step up their talks. “Obviously things have moved on in terms of the discussions we’ve been having,” May told the former Polish prime minister as they sat down in No 10. “By being creative in the ways we approach these issues, we can find solutions that work both for the remaining [EU] 27 but also for the UK and maintain that cooperation and partnership between the UK and the EU,” she added. She said they would “be able to discuss what I set out last week in Florence – that hope for a deep and special partnership that we want to create with the European Union when we leave” and pointed out that she was also now “unconditionally committed to maintaining Europe’s security and want[ed] to have a good security partnership as well”. But the EU has shown a united front in its response to the impasse in Brussels, where the chief negotiator Michel Barnier and Brexit secretary David Davis appear no closer to a breakthrough this week. Responding to Davis’s claim that May’s €20bn offer in her speech in Florence now left no excuse for a lack of progress, Poland’s EU affairs minister Konrad Szymański said separately on Tuesday that he feared the two sides’ starkly contrary perspectives on the talks could lead them to fail. The UK had legal obligations to meet, Szymański said, but the British government had given the impression to the public that the divorce bill was a punishment to be endured. “I think we have a fundamental difference of perspective of how we see the negotiations,” he said. “We would prefer to talk about principles, and rules and legal obligations which account from the fact of membership and the presence of the UK in the EU. “It would be much more transparent, and probably healthy, and maybe easier to understand for the British public opinion and the British parliament. “We need a good explanation of why this number is fair and this one is not fair. This is a crucial point. Otherwise we will fail.” In a sign of the British government’s frustration with the European commission, Davis has embarked on a whistlestop tour of political leaders, in order to convince them of the need to talk about a future trading relationship. On Tuesday Davis visited The Hague to see the Dutch foreign minister Bert Koendes, and on Monday in Brussels he spoke to the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, and the Belgian foreign minister Didier Reynders, along with senior MEPs, including the German David McAllister, who is close to the chancellor, Angela Merkel. He is seeing the European parliament president, Antonio Tajani, on Wednesday. Davis is seeking to persuade key politicians that further delays make a lack of a deal more likely, and that the impact could be huge for countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/26/the-fiver-liverpool-spartak-moscow-big-cup-baby","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T15:47:04Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | Electric buzzers that went off every time they tried to cross the halfway line","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/26/the-fiver-liverpool-spartak-moscow-big-cup-baby","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/26/the-fiver-liverpool-spartak-moscow-big-cup-baby","fields":{"headline":"Electric buzzers that went off every time they tried to cross the halfway line","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"THE RED ARMY IN MOSCOW It has long been source of frustration for Liverpool that their managers have struggled to strike the right balance between defence and attack. The Roy Evans vintage, for example, were hot stuff going forward in the mid-to-late-90s, admired by many neutrals as the finest attacking side in England when in full flow. The song “Pass &amp; Move”, released before Roy’s boys took on Manchester United in the 1996 FA Cup final, was a glowing homage to their attacking brilliance, with much of it dedicated to urging Robbie Fowler to “go, Robbie, go” and praising shampoo salesman Jason McAteer for being “like a bat outta hell”, which is precisely what you want from a right wing-back. However, brief mentions of defensive stalwarts “Babbsy”, “Razor” and “Scalesy” smacked of how yearly appraisals at Big Paper end with The Fiver being praised for the time it went three whole days without getting its hand stuck in the vending machine. Liverpool lost the game when David James, exhibiting the judgment that last week saw him clumsily weigh in on the Mark Sampson business by tweeting that “some wasted talent can’t deal with the fact they aren’t good enough”, flapped a corner straight to Eric Cantona, who happened to be in pretty handy goalscoring form that year. Oh Jamo! Poor old Roy ended up leaving Liverpool with only one Milk Cup to show for his efforts, making way for Géd Houllier in November 1998. Géd soon set about sorting out tightening up his creaking defence, fitting his full-backs with electric buzzers that went off every time they thought about crossing the halfway line, and his early caution looked to be bearing fruit when Liverpool nabbed three trophies plus a Super Cup in 2001. He promised that his team was destined for greatness. But then he also reckoned Bruno Cheyrou was the new Zidane, so there’s that. In the end an attack built around Mr Em barging people over made George Graham’s Arsenal look like Hungary 1954 multiplied by Brazil 1970, so eventually Géd had to make way for comparative party animal Rafa Benítez, who somehow won Big Cup with some rope-a-dope cunning against Milan. So Liverpool have had joy in Europe by adopting a defensive outlook. Géd won Euro Vase, Rafa was a Big Cup specialist and who can forget Brendan Rodgers putting on that famous display of catenaccio at the Bernabéu in 2014? Plenty of Liverpool fans, that’s who! In fact Kopites seem much happier now Jürgen Klopp has decided the best way to win is by creating a team of hyperactive toddlers who spend matches giddily zooming up and down the pitch until their opponents are bent over double, wheezing, begging for mercy. Which is all terrific fun, only there are a few people who are starting to wonder if the German might want to take a leaf out of Géd and Rafa’s very dull book on tactics now and then. Much of the focus before Liverpool’s Big Cup encounter at Spartak Moscow on Tuesday centred on how Klopp can fit Sadio Mané, Roberto Firmino, Philippe Coutinho and Mohamed Salah into his team. But having dropped two points against Sevilla a fortnight ago, Klopp is aware this might not be the occasion to play all his “artists”. Not when Liverpool have started the season by conceding 11 goals in six league matches and Simon Mignolet’s performances in goal have left supporters looking back fondly on the days when a sleep-deprived Jamo would turn up at Anfield having spent the entire night playing Tomb Raider. The good news is that Mignolet won’t be starting against Spartak. The bad news is the Belgian’s spot is going to Loris Karius, who makes Joe Hart look like Andrés Iniesta with the ball at his feet. All very funny, of course, but if this goes on much longer they’ll be calling for the return of Géd. And that’s when the laughter dies.

If deforestation carries on at the same rate, they may be gone in 100 years. Food companies are a big part of the problem; agriculture is the largest single cause of forest loss. And they are also part of the solution, with hundreds making commitments to stop deforestation. But as deforestation continues, what more can companies do? This was the question put to experts from the private, NGO, government and finance sectors at a recent roundtable on the topic, held in New York. Partnership emerged as a major theme. Although progress has been made on governments, food companies and NGOs working together to end deforestation, several roundtable panellists emphasised the need to act more quickly to stop destruction of forests around the world. “There isn’t enough action happening now to end deforestation. Companies must rectify their business practices before they expand into new territories, because that old model of industrial plantation isn’t delivering for the forest, for people or for the planet,” said Gemma Tillack, agribusiness campaign director at NGO Rainforest Action Network. Brazil’s soy moratorium – a 2006 agreement between environmental groups and corporations where purchasers agreed to not buy soy produced on deforested land – was heralded by several panelists as an example of what can happen when collaboration is successfully implemented. “We need to replicate the extraordinary success of the soy moratorium in other parts of Latin America,” said Glenn Hurowitz, chief executive of Mighty Earth. “We need to do it in south-east Asia on palm oil and spread it to other commodities like rubber.” The key to the success of the soy moratorium – which is not without its critics – was effective collaboration, said Francisco J B Oliveira Filho, former director of policies to tackle deforestation in the Brazilian government. “It was a very hard discussion at the beginning,” he said. “But as soon as we got to know each other, we managed to reduce the illegal soy production related to deforestation in the Amazon region to the level that it’s almost 2–3%.” The conversation took place alongside the UN general assembly, and the body’s sustainable development goals were mentioned as a way forward for governments and other parties on their commitments to end deforestation. “This week’s theme around sustainable development goal 17, and the critical nature of partnership to accomplish these very complex issues, feels very fitting,” said Diane Holdorf, chief sustainability officer at Kellogg. “Without the partnership of collective action, we’re not going to achieve our best.” As well as working across sectors and along supply chains, Tillack added that companies had a role to play in encouraging each other to adhere to standards. “There is a very crucial peer-to-peer role. Don’t just rely on the NGOs to find the cases and pressure one company. We are the least resourced of all. That responsibility needs to go back to all of you guys that have big budgets.” Many panellists highlighted the importance of working along the whole of the supply chain, from the smallholder farmers to the multinational companies to the banks who finance different parts of the chain. Pavan Sukhdev, goodwill ambassador to the UN Environment Programme and chief executive of Gist Advisory, said that banks should consider risk to the environment in their processes. “As a banker for 25 years, one of my observations as a member of the risk committee was that, how come we do not have ecological value as a risk?” he said. It is important to integrate rather than pressurise different parts of the chain, said Gabriela Burian, sustainable agriculture global lead for Monsanto and strategic adviser for food and agriculture in the Americas for the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. “Work as a team and then they can understand the value,” she said. Burian added that new initiatives are not necessarily the answer. “Every six months we launch a new coalition and this is really hard to track, for companies to understand. Let’s deliver on what we have and scale up.” Working with local governments is also vital, said Andrew Aulisi, senior director for public policy and government affairs at PepsiCo. “A lot of decisions are made at the local level,” he said. “There’s going to be a local desire to dedicate some of that land to agribusiness. We can’t allow our supply chain work to exist in a silo, where we think that we’ve created a clean supply chain but it’s existing in a parallel universe where the landscape is actually being degraded.” The High Carbon Stock approach (HCS), which identifies forest areas that need to be protected as distinct from land which has been degraded so does not have a high biodiversity value, was presented as a way all those who contribute to deforestation can make more progress. Tillack asked why the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) hadn’t adopted HCS as part of their standard for members. Dan Strechay, RSPO’s US representative for outreach and engagement, said the organisation is currently conducting a consultation with members and the public on revising their standard and the question of incorporating HCS is part of it. Oliveira Filho laid out the challenge for coming decades: “How are we going to balance production to feed the world and protection for climate change, for biodiversity?” Productivity is at the centre of the solutions, said Aulisi. “If you take a step back and look at sustainable agriculture globally the key is yield and productivity getting the most production on the smallest footprint.” There are solutions out there, he said, but there is a lack of action to adopt them: “We have technologies and practices. We don’t need to invent anything, we could just take what we have now and put it to use on farms. And yet it seems at times there’s a lack of will to do it.” The panellists agreed that working together was how action would get started. “Because at the end of the day everyone around the table is working on the same goal,” said Strechay.

But sometimes, what a devoted crime reader wants isn’t anything too fancy. Sometimes, what we want is a good, solid police procedural, preferably set somewhere interesting, preferably with a troubled, renegade investigator who refuses to listen when their boss tells them to leave an avenue of investigation alone. And in Sarah Ward’s A Patient Fury, that’s exactly what we get. This is Ward’s third mystery featuring Detective Constable Connie Childs, a CID officer in Bampton, a small town surrounded by the dark peaks of Derbyshire. Connie is back at work after the events of A Deadly Thaw, but isn’t really on top of things – she’s distracted and suffering from insomnia. Regardless, her boss, DI Sadler, calls her in the early hours after a report of suspicious deaths following a house fire. When they arrive, Connie vomits when she sees the superbly grotesque scene displayed in a broken window: “Dangling behind the ruined glass was the outline of a body slowly revolving in a sickening dance. As they watched, the face turned towards them.” But there’s more: the body is that of a woman – a mother. The burning house also contains the bodies of her husband and her small son, whom the reader already knows have been killed with a claw hammer. Connie jumps to the conclusion that “we’re going to be looking at another case where a man thought it was okay to obliterate a family because of his skewed thinking”, but forensics point to the mother, Francesca, as the murderer. It looks cut-and-dried, but Connie, small and combative, just can’t accept it. It doesn’t make sense, she keeps saying. And “don’t you think acts have got to have a logic to them?”” When Sadler won’t listen – hurrah for that wayward copper I was after – Connie sets out to prove why, digging into the history of the surviving family, Francesca’s stepson and stepdaughter George and Julia, uncovering more about their tragic past. Because this isn’t the first member of their family to be declared dead under mysterious circumstances: almost 40 years before, George and Julia’s mother went missing, leaving a note on the door saying she’d be back in two minutes, and never returned. Ward, a Derbyshire resident, crime-fiction blogger and judge for the Petrona award for Scandinavian translated crime novels, layers her story together carefully. We jump back and forth in time, and between perspectives, as the details of the past mystery and present murders become clearer. Julia, an intriguing figure, is a tour guide to the local caves by day, and by night takes tourists on ghost walks around the town. She also posts pleading messages on missing persons websites, begging the mother she still believes is alive to come home. “I will survive this, she thought. The darkness won’t overcome me. This is not the first bad thing to have happened to me.” Ward scatters her clues carefully. It’s not hard to work out who everything’s pointing to, but it’s enjoyable putting it all together, and both Connie, “a girl who things happen to”, and Julia (“I feel frozen. It’s like a sheet of glass is separating me from the rest of the world. I’m trying to feel emotion but there’s nothing there”), are intelligent, perceptive companions along the way. • A Patient Fury by Sarah Ward is published by Faber (£12.99).

If the British-born and based musician seems emphatic on this point, shared over coffee in a park in north London,it’s because she has never really fitted in anywhere. Born to Tamil parents, Raman has spent a career shrugging off labels: world music (“a racist marketing category; I hate it”); ethnic (“I’ve often been told I should sound ‘more Indian’”); feminist. “I’m always striving for expression that could go beyond gender, beyond ethnicity,” she says. Her latest project is equally liberationist in spirit. On 30 September, Raman will host Sacred Imaginations at the Barbican Centre, a concert of “sacred music for secular people”. The lineup, curated by Raman and her husband/music partner, Sam Mills of Real World Records, boasts esoteric virtuosos from around the globe who are united in their working knowledge of eastern and early Christian music. Parts of it will, says Raman, be like “plugging into something from the fourth century”. Raman has been mining this intersection between ancient and modern since her 2001 Mercury-nominated debut, Salt Rain. That record was a bricolage of genre-defying originals and reworked ancient devotionals, sung in English, Tamil, Sanskrit and Hindi. Six albums on, she remains an independent artist with a well-stamped passport, having studied with Bauls in Bengal, Sufis in south Asia and having benefited from the tutelage of Tamil Nadu devotional matriarch Kovai Kamala. For Ghost Gamelan, Raman’s forthcoming seventh album, she went to Surakarta, Indonesia in search of Gamelan musicians. Of her collaborations generally, she says: “Many of the traditions I work with happen to be quite patriarchal. The qawwalis [Sufi singers from south Asia], for example: their daughters aren’t allowed to sing. But I wanted to penetrate that [scene], to earn their respect.”Working with qawwalis on her 2013 album, Queen Between, was rewarding, says Raman, although initially difficult. Indonesia was also tough. “The self-determining woman artist is something they don’t recognise – though we managed to transcend that in the end; it was a great experience.” Sexism, of course, isn’t just the preserve of the east. She empathises with the frustrations expressed by Björk in a famous 2015 interview with Pitchfork.com, concerning the microaggressions female artists face. “She’s one of my big heroes. I always think: what would Björk do?” Increasingly, Raman finds herself aching for female collaborators. Abida Parveen, doyenne of the qawwali world, was just out of reach for Queen Between (“I couldn’t afford her fees”), but Raman is buzzing with enthusiasm over Lucie Antunes, the Parisian marimba and vibraphone percussionist who guests on Ghost Gamelan. “I was gobsmacked the first time I saw [footage of] her performing. Its like she’s talking in tongues. She’s from that Stockhausen/John Cage sort of world.” Raman’s longest-standing collaborator, Mills, is still very much her linchpin. But it is only after the Brexit referendum that the mixed-race couple has experienced xenophobia on London’s streets. “It was a group of people, outside a pub in Islington, chanting things … but honestly, [Brexit] hasn’t affected us. If anything, it’s made us stronger. We just really believe in what we do.” She’s buoyed by women such as Saffiyah Khan, the smiling, EDL-defying protester who went viral after a Birmingham rally. “That image just said it all, didn’t it? I feel optimistic. I cope with [the strife] by doing this work.” If she’s uninterested in overtly political lyricism that is perhaps because her values are self-evident in her work. “Its clear where I stand. I’m trying to create a space where I can bridge worlds, not keep them apart.” It’s a practice that speaks to the cultural appropriation debates raging in mainstream pop culture – debates Raman doesn’t keep up with. “I’m committed to the idea of unity, especially now, when there are so many forces trying to [divide us]. It doesn’t mean you pretend everyone is the same – there will be contradictions and complexities, but I think celebrating our commonalities [is vital].”Extremism of all kinds should be resisted, says Raman, from the US’s cross-burning fascists to the institutional Islamophobia she has witnessed under India’s Modi government. Sacred Imaginations is, subconsciously, part of that resistance With Sacred Imaginations, she continues to show them. Sacred Imaginations is at the Barbican Centre in London on 30 September"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/sep/25/talking-horses-hoping-for-ulysses-weather-in-france-plus-monday-tips","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T11:59:48Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Hoping for Ulysses weather in France plus Monday tips","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/25/talking-horses-hoping-for-ulysses-weather-in-france-plus-monday-tips","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/25/talking-horses-hoping-for-ulysses-weather-in-france-plus-monday-tips","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Hoping for Ulysses weather in France plus Monday tips","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Today’s best bet, by Chris Cook I see that the ground at Chantilly, which will stage the Arc on Sunday, is being reported as ‘soft’ this morning by the International Racing Bureau and that’s hardly a surprise for the time of year. But I’m interested that the forecast for that area is dry and quite warm, with no more than 2mm of rain even on those days when rain is expected. If, by any chance, it were to dry out to ‘good’ going, I’d be interested in the 7-1 about Ulysses to turn around King George form with Enable. But, classy as he is, he’d really need it to dry out. He couldn’t get home like she did on rain-softened ground at Ascot and we all expect that form will stand up if there’s cut in the ground on Sunday. Traditionally, this is the week when the words “heavy dew” get used a lot in racing circles, as a reason why the going may not dry out much in the Arc build-up. I’ll definitely be sitting on my hands until Sunday afternoon, as regards betting on the big race, because the state of the ground will make all the difference. It has certainly made the difference at Hamilton, where racing has been abandoned today because of all the recent rain. Leicester’s card will go ahead on deep going. So thank the Lord for an all-weather surface, since Kempton stages what should be an exciting and informative card on its Polytrack. Mudallel (5.05) is the nap, although the early 4-1 has become an ungenerous 5-2. Since being gelded and switched into handicaps, Ed Dunlop’s three-year-old has done well at this track, racking up form figures of 411. He passed most of the field in the last furlong and a half last time after a confident ride and has plenty more to offer. Earlier, Asaas (2.55) might be over-priced at 15-2, from the Roger Varian yard that continues among the winners. He looked ready for a step up in trip when a bit disappointing at Beverley last month and that was only his first outing since he was gelded. I’ll give him another chance with Silvestre de Sousa back aboard. Waves (5.15) might be pick of the card at Leicester at 9-2. The going there will not be to every taste but she has shown a distinct liking for the mud, winning on soft at Bath in May and being a plodding-on third on heavy at Ffos Las last time. The winner of that race, Fastnet Spin, has a fine chance in the previous race at Leicester.

Kabeiroi, the latest creation by experimental theatre company Punchdrunk, is a shapeshifter of a show. Based on fragments of a lost play by Aeschylus, it takes you on a journey across London (you’re advised to top up your Oyster card before arrival) and is by turns tourist experience, treasure hunt and descent into an unsettling world. These shifts keep you on edge, leading you to constantly question what the show is. My partner and I set off in the middle of the afternoon, from a surprisingly ordinary central London location, after being issued with some prosaic housekeeping instructions and a pair of audio guides. The narrative unfolds across a substantial stretch of town, with the start and finish several miles apart. It makes use of a quiet garden square, a major tourist attraction, a pub, a small room in a boutique hotel, the dark car park of a fast food restaurant and several stations. At times, the modern-day locations stand in stark contrast to the mythological elements of the narrative, which focuses on the experience of an initiate preparing for and ultimately experiencing the ceremonies of a mystery cult, while evading malign forces. As the experience unfolds, you have no idea which passersby might turn out to be involved. The cast is compact – somewhere between five and nine and entirely female, by my reckoning, which fits with the Aeschylus story of an island ruled by women who have murdered their husbands and fathers. The encounters with the cast are mostly fleeting. In Punchdrunk’s 2013 immersive show The Drowned Man, which took place across several floors in a large disused Paddington sorting office, you were clearly intended to invest heavily in the characters. In Kabeiroi, the focus is very much on you. At times you are closely instructed about how to proceed; at others you are granted enough autonomy for doubt to creep in. At one point I gave (sedate and self-conscious) chase to a woman I was sure was shouting my name. She turned out to be extremely drunk and absolutely nothing to do with the show. The encounters with actors tend to come out of nowhere, which adds to a feeling of paranoia. I was particularly suspicious of an elderly gentleman in full highland dress, a woman in a Spiderman skirt and a Spearmint Rhino doorman. There are several changes of pace, although it’s not clear whether this is a result of the need to keep the various pairs of audience members separate, or a deliberate mechanism to keep you off-balance. The show leaves you feeling as if you’re observing – or being observed by – the real world, but not quite part of it. There is certainly potential for going off-script. At one point my partner got lost and, I suspect, almost brought the show to a grinding halt. One interesting aspect of experiencing the show with another person is that you immediately notice the contrast between your responses. I am fairly rule-abiding while my partner was rather taken with the idea that you could subvert the narrative, or turn it back on the performers. As a Punchdrunk supporter, I was able to enter a “keyholders’ ballot” for preview tickets to Kabeiroi. This wasn’t my first Punchdrunk experience. After The Drowned Man I saw Sleep No More, based on Macbeth, during which I was given an errand to run by a scarlet-clad witch. At their children’s show Against Captain’s Orders at the National Maritime Museum, my seven-year-old ran through the set wailing that he was, contrary to all assertions, neither loyal nor brave. I was fairly confident that I was ready for whatever the company felt like throwing at me in Kabeiroi. But I was wrong. While there are moments that participants will recognise as vintage Punchdrunk theatre, the majority of the experience feels very removed from what has gone before. Felix Barrett, the company’s artistic director, once said: “If audiences get used to the rules, change them.” With Kabeiroi, a boundary has been removed – the barrier between the real world and the world of the show – leaving you exposed. You notice the expressions and mannerisms of passersby. You listen in to fragments of conversation. There’s a sense of a great body of untold stories around you. And all of that is very Punchdrunk. There is a small piece of the Kabeiroi narrative which feels like an invitation to return to the “set” at a later date, not as an audience member but as an observer, watching another participant feel their way through the experience. If I found myself in the area, I can imagine giving in to the temptation to slip into one of the more public locations, sit on a bench and watch as the real world gives way to Kabeiroi’s mysteries."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/25/us-rate-rose-in-2016-but-this-years-numbers-suggest-decline-ahead","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T14:50:51Z","webTitle":"US murder rate rose in 2016 – but experts question claims of long-term trend","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/25/us-rate-rose-in-2016-but-this-years-numbers-suggest-decline-ahead","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/25/us-rate-rose-in-2016-but-this-years-numbers-suggest-decline-ahead","fields":{"headline":"US murder rate rose in 2016 – but experts question claims of long-term trend","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Murders in the US rose by 8.6% in 2016 following a more than 10% increase the year before, according to new FBI statistics. The homicide rate increased 7.9%. The violent crime rate increased by 3.4% while property crimes dropped. The murder and violent crime rates remain dramatically below the levels of the early 1990s, when nearly 25,000 Americans were murdered each year. But the two years of increases resulted in a more than 20% increase in the national homicide rate since 2014, the justice department said in a press release accompanying the FBI figures. “For the sake of all Americans we must confront and turn back the rising tide of violent crime,” attorney general Jeff Sessions said. “And we must do it together.” Sessions said the country needed to “dismantle criminal organizations and gangs, stop the scourge of drug trafficking, and send a strong message to criminals that we will not surrender our communities to lawlessness and violence”. In a reference to repeated claims by Sessions, the justice department press release said the FBI data “reaffirms that the worrying violent crime increase that began in 2015 after many years of decline was not an isolated incident”. Experts, however, called into question whether the increases for 2015 and 2016 would be part of any longer-term trend. Mid-year data from 2017 suggests that national murder numbers may decline this year, or at worst increase only slightly. With a president and an attorney general who have warned of “American carnage” and called the increase in murders in 2015 a “dangerous permanent trend”, the new crime numbers are likely to be heavily politicized. “Sadly, Trump will probably seize on these numbers to do more fearmongering,” said Thomas Abt, a Harvard Kennedy School researcher who worked on violence prevention in the Obama justice department. The murder increase should be greeted with “concern but not panic”, Abt said, adding that it was frustrating that “many more [politicians] will be concerned about how more homicides will impact their own agendas” than will focus on how to fix the violence itself. While the Trump administration has often linked violence and crime to immigration, Abt said, “every serious examination of immigrants and crime show that immigrants – ‘illegal’ or not – commit less crime than citizens.” The two years of increases in murders come after the national numbers hit “a level that’s as low as we’ve had in decades”, said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University. Fox said it was not surprising that violence might increase after many years of success in reducing murders. “Two years is not a relevant trend,” he said. Since the early 1990s, as the US population has grown, murders have dropped to about 14,000 a year. The estimated number of murders in 2016 is 17,250, with about 3,000 more Americans killed than in 2014. The 2016 national murder rate remains lower than it was in 2008, the last year of the presidency of George W Bush. There was no national pattern in violence in 2016: New York City saw historic or close to historic lows in shootings and murders, as murders in Chicago spiked. Property crimes decreased as murder, aggravated assault and violent crime overall increased. Large cities saw the biggest rise in violent crimes – those with more than one million inhabitants witnessed a 7.2% rise. Places with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants saw violent crimes rise by just 0.2%. The FBI cautioned against city-to-city comparisons, stating that such rankings “often create misleading perceptions adversely affecting communities and their residents”. State-to-state comparisons are fairer and the differences are stark. For example, violent crime rose 32.4% in Vermont and fell 5.3% in Florida. Here again, though, the comparisons are imperfect. In smaller state populations like Vermont, percentage changes can look more dramatic. The report also included race and ethnicity data about those arrested in 2016. Of 8.4 million arrests, 69.6% were of white individuals and 27% were black or African American. Of the US population, 77% is white and 13% black."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/29/why-onlookers-hold-the-key-to-standing-up-to-bullies","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T12:30:03Z","webTitle":"Why onlookers hold the key to standing up to bullies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/29/why-onlookers-hold-the-key-to-standing-up-to-bullies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/29/why-onlookers-hold-the-key-to-standing-up-to-bullies","fields":{"headline":"Why onlookers hold the key to standing up to bullies","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Apoll shows that more than half of secondary school teachers say bullying is a problem. This, depressingly, is in line with other data – for instance, from the Rumi Foundation, which holds a yearly survey into bullying and whose latest figures show a growth in online bullying. It is also worthwhile to think about the lived experience of bullying. This is resonant for me, because I was physically bullied at my school, not only by a pupil but by several teachers, as well as at home, where my elder brother used to habitually indulge in some form of psychological torment or another. As a former victim (bullying survivor?) I would say one of the most painful things about being bullied is not so much the humiliation and fear – though obviously that’s a large part – but the confusion. Why is this person doing this to me? What did I do to deserve it? I can see now – finally – that there are a number of motivations behind bullying that I would have been unable to understand as a child and had nothing at all do with me. First, and most confusingly of all, is the fact that some people simply enjoy bullying for its own sake. To exert power and cruelty over someone weaker than you, or different, is a big kick for a certain kind of person, and such people are not particularly rare. A related point is that bullying is often an activity that is collectively enjoyed. The group – or mob, if you want to think of it that way – loves to find a scapegoat. It doesn’t matter that the victim is innocent – the point is, the person being bullied provides an “outsider” who can help give the group identity. Such bullying happens not only in schools, but also in workplaces, and pretty much any place where you put more than a dozen people together. What should one do if one is being bullied? There is no easy answer. Grassing up your assailant violates the unwritten pupil code, but it’s a possible way out – or, like the other option of fighting back, it can simply make things worse. Others become jokers or fools. Or you can just tough it out and hope the bully will get bored and move on to someone else. There is a school of thought that suggests we should have some sympathy for the bully – that being bullied makes you into a bully in the first place. But the idea that bullies have been bullied themselves is largely a myth. According to evolutionary psychologists, bullying appears to be hardwired, and on the whole bullies are socially, that is to say, evolutionarily, successful. Many species bully, and not only primates. It’s a way of riding up the dominance hierarchy or, if you’re a chicken, the pecking order. So what can I say to console or advise any child who is being bullied? If there’s any positive side to it all, it may be true that it can help build resilience, as many of my parents’ generation believed. But that’s only if, sooner or later, you make a stand against it. And that’s a hazardous option. Perhaps the solution isn’t really in the hands of the bullied – it’s in the hands of other, often stronger, onlookers, the non-bullying children, who may pretend not to notice, either because they enjoy the spectacle or they are afraid of being bullied themselves. The most effective solution would be for those children to withhold approval and condemn the perpetrator – and to be encouraged to do so by schools. If children were taught to collectively “name and shame” bullies, bullying would fall. Nothing in the end is stronger than peer pressure – and in that fashion, the same force that often brings about bullying, can also make it cease. timlottwriter.wordpress.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/26/moomins-tove-jannson-feminist-oxfam","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T08:35:59Z","webTitle":"The Moomins: Tove Jansson’s feminist legacy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/26/moomins-tove-jannson-feminist-oxfam","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/26/moomins-tove-jannson-feminist-oxfam","fields":{"headline":"The Moomins: Tove Jansson’s feminist legacy","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Post-war stories about Finnish trolls might not be the first place you would look for feminist icons, but the more you discover about the women in Moomins creator Tove Jansson’s life, the more it makes sense. “I’m not sure Tove ever used the word ‘feminist’, but she was one in every sense of the word,” says her niece and creative director of the Moomins Characters brand, Sophia Jansson. “She challenged a lot of the assumptions that were still held by society about how women should live at the time – for example, that they should stay at home and dedicate themselves to bringing up children. She was all about daring to make choices that are not necessarily easy. She defied convention and that made her quite exceptional.” The books are full of strong female characters, from straight-talking Little My, to calmly confident Moominmamma, and it is significant that those based on real people were all women. The stories are being used as part of a collaboration with Oxfam, which will see Jansson’s Moomin artwork used to help empower women all over the world and raise them out of poverty through donations from sales of a range of new products based on Jansson’s short story, The Invisible Child. On the one hand, Moominmamma – always clutching her handbag and providing picnics – might not seem an obvious feminist role model. But the character was based, Sophia confirms, on Jansson’s own mother, Signe Hammarsten-Jansson (known as Ham), an artist who instilled a fierce work ethic into her daughter. Like Moominmamma – who is the only one to recognise Moomintroll after he is transformed by a magic spell in Finn Family Moomintroll – she had a deep understanding of her child. Jansson wrote in a letter to her friend Eva Wichman: “Ham can see through every disguise, because she loves me.” The Moomin stories were also a way for Jansson to pay homage to the women she loved romantically, in a time when it was illegal to be a lesbian. First, her former partner Vivica Bandler appears alongside Jansson as the characters Thingumy and Bob, two inseparable creatures who keep a red ruby hidden in a suitcase (a metaphor for forbidden love). She wrote to Bandler: “No one understands their language, but that doesn’t matter so long as they themselves know what it’s about.” Later, you find her long-term partner, Tuulikki (Tooti) Pietilä, in Moominland Midwinter as the optimistic Too-Ticky, a character who is able to quell Moomintroll’s fears and help him embrace independence away from his family. Meanwhile, in Moominpappa at Sea, Moominpappa is determined that everyone should rely on him, yet the three female characters who follow him (Moominmamma, Little My and the Groke) all manage to define their own narratives. Even the Groke, the chilling spirit of winter and death, manages to find power in her own isolation: “She started softly, but gradually her song of loneliness had got louder and louder. It was no longer just sad, it was defiant, too. ‘There’s no other Groke, I’m the only one.’’’ In part thanks to the support of these women and the characters they inspired, Tove’s entire life was filled with bold decisions: selling satirical cartoons mocking Hitler; opposing war; choosing not to marry or have children; and turning down Walt Disney’s offer to buy the Moomin brand. She was the writer, illustrator, designer and controlled the business side of her creation, not trusting anyone else to do it justice. “She wasn’t willing to compromise on her beliefs,” says Sophia. “Her work says: ‘This is me. This is who I am. Take it or leave it.’” · For more information on the Oxfam and the Moomins feminist fundraising collaboration, visit oxfam.org.uk/shop/moomins"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"science/shortcuts/2017/sep/25/to-boldly-go-split-infinitive-grammatical-error-research","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T11:18:33Z","webTitle":"To boldly go for it: why the split infinitive is no longer a mistake","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/shortcuts/2017/sep/25/to-boldly-go-split-infinitive-grammatical-error-research","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/shortcuts/2017/sep/25/to-boldly-go-split-infinitive-grammatical-error-research","fields":{"headline":"To boldly go for it: why the split infinitive is no longer a mistake","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Name: The split infinitive. Age: 800 years. Ish. Appearance: Hideous or invisible, depending on your point of view. I’d have to say invisible, since I don’t know what it is. An infinitive is one of the many forms that a verb can take. If I say, “It is nice to know more than you” then “to know” is the infinitive of the verb know. What’s a split infinitive then? A split infinitive is when other words creep into the middle of an English infinitive. The most famous example is Star Trek’s “to boldly go where no one has gone before”. The Victorians decided that splitting an infinitive was a grammatical mistake, and some people still agree with them. Why? That’s a question I can’t answer. Basically, they just think it’s clumsy to wantonly put in extra words after the “to”. I see what they mean. But now they have been proven wrong! Really? How? Researchers at Lancaster University and Cambridge University Press have concluded that split infinitives are now nearly three times as common in British speech as they were in the early 1990s. How on earth can they tell? They’ve gathered the Spoken British National Corpus, which they say is the largest ever public collection of transcribed British conversations. How have they done that? They persuaded 672 people to record 1,000 hours of conversations using their smartphones. This produced 11.5m words, with a rate of 117 split infinitives per million, compared with a rate of 44 per million recorded in the early 1990s. OK. But surely split infinitives don’t stop being mistakes just because more people use them? Au contraire. In language, that’s exactly what happens, because the meaning of words keeps changing. Eh? Maybe 100 years ago splitting an infinitive meant, “I don’t know my grammar rules”, because they were usually avoided by people who did. However, now that most people, including language experts, are relaxed about split infinitives, that changes. Indeed, taking trouble carefully to avoid them means: “I’m a bit fussy and old-fashioned.” And correcting other people’s means: “I prefer being right to being kind.” Exactly.

The record comes as the first subsidy-free large solar power project opens in the UK, in what the government described as a significant moment for the energy sector. Analysis by National Grid of power generation showed that a combination of solar, wind and nuclear – and an absence of coal – pushed carbon emissions to their lowest level yet over the season. Between 21 June and 22 September, the carbon intensity of the grid – as measured in grammes of C02 emitted per KWh of power generated – was more than halved from its level over the same period four years ago. This summer, nearly 52% of power came from low-carbon sources, compared with 35% in 2013. A growing number of solar and windfarms, coupled with nuclear and gas power stations, have transformed summer power supply and broken new records. On one Friday in May, solar panels even briefly provided more power than the UK’s nuclear fleet. Duncan Burt, director of the system operator at National Grid, said: “It’s been a summer of records. The big fundamental shift has been the continuing growth in offshore wind and solar coming on. “We’ve gone from renewables being a part of the mix to often being a significant, majority part of the mix.” He added that while the group would have liked to have seen some windier, sunnier days in August, it had coped with the challenge of managing intermittent power sources such as wind and expected the trend to continue. While National Grid said that handling the amount of variable, renewable power on the system is not adding to consumer costs at the moment, studies have shown a much higher penetration of green energy could result in higher bills. A report by the UK Energy Research Centre earlier this year warned that balancing intermittent wind and solar would increase costs if the grid is not made more flexible with new measures, such as battery storage. National Grid has launched a new forecast of the grid’s carbon intensity, to help householders see the most environmentally friendly time to use appliances such as washing machines, or to charge an electric car. The best times to keep emissions down while making a cup of tea on Tuesday, for instance, are forecast to be at 1am, 2.30pm and 11.30pm. In a further boost for green energy the climate minister, Claire Perry, on Tuesday will officially open a solar farm in Bedfordshire that has been billed as the first subsidy-free one of its kind in the UK. Perry hailed it as “a significant moment for clean energy in the UK”. Installations of large-scale solar farms crashed after the government ended subsidies in the spring of 2016, but the developer of the new facility near Flitwick believes that energy storage has made them financially viable, even without state support. “Solar obviously by itself is still very difficult. What we’re doing is making it into a hybrid site,” said Steve Shine, chairman of Anesco, in reference to the 6MW of batteries that will store electricity generated from the 10MW solar farm during the day, to be sold when the power is most valuable. The farm’s capacity is enough to power the equivalent of about 3,000 homes. Shine said the project would break even due to the batteries and the way the company had cut costs by nearly a third through measures such as not burying cables. “I really do believe this is the future,” said Shine, arguing the combination of solar and batteries could help address the UK’s energy challenges. “We’re not building new CCGT [gas], coal’s got to come off, nuclear needs a lot of subsidy, offshore wind is obviously good, but solar is lowest life cost.” Separately, a report from Imperial College predicted that the combination of solar power and batteries could be so financially attractive to householders by 2030 that the technologies would “bleed revenues from the utilities sector”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/25/strictly-dances-off-with-saturday-night-viewing-figures","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T19:09:45Z","webTitle":"Strictly dances off with Saturday night viewing figures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/25/strictly-dances-off-with-saturday-night-viewing-figures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/25/strictly-dances-off-with-saturday-night-viewing-figures","fields":{"headline":"Strictly dances off with Saturday night viewing figures","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Strictly Come Dancing and the X Factor have been battling it out for Saturday night audiences for 13 years, but the BBC show struck an unprecedented blow against its ITV rival last weekend by attracting almost 5 million more viewers in a record victory. The contrasting performances of Strictly and the X Factor have raised questions about whether the ITV show has fallen into terminal decline despite creator Simon Cowell attempting to shake it up this year. The X Factor attracted 4.8 million average overnight viewers on Saturday night, an all-time low for an episode of Cowell’s singing contest, which like Strictly launched in 2004. In contrast, the first live episode of Strictly’s 2017 series attracted an average of 9.4 million viewers, a record for the opening show and up from 8.7 million last year. The X Factor’s performance improved slightly on Sunday to 6.2 million average overnight viewers, but this is still well down on the programme’s peak in 2010, when 17.2 million viewers tuned in to see painter Matt Cardle win the final. Tom Harrington, a TV analyst at Enders, said singing contests had become “stale” and questioned whether ITV would continue to put the X Factor up against Strictly. “Shows are often moved around, including by the BBC, which sits on top of the channel listing but doesn’t have everything its own way – it moved The Big Family Cooking Showdown, so as not to clash with Bake Off on Channel 4, and it brought forward Poldark so as not to share a Sunday night again with ITV’s Victoria,” he said. “Strictly and X Factor have been going head to head in some capacity for years and, up to this time, that consistency indicates that for both the BBC and ITV that arrangement works. That may change, however, with X Factor’s decline.” Despite the X Factor’s falling audience, Harrington said it remained valuable to ITV. The programme reaches more 16- to 34-year-olds than Strictly – a valuable market for advertisers – and its viewing figures are expected to rise significantly when people watching the X Factor on catch-up services or recordings are taken into account. “X Factor has been slipping since the heights of the late 2000s when the discovery of acts like Matt Cardle and Little Mix resonated with viewers,” Harrington said. “Singing contests have inevitably grown somewhat stale, a trend hurried along by the sheer number of them – in the past year, BBC has announced that neither Pitch Battle nor Garry Barlow’s Let It Shine will return for a second season. “That being said, even as it stands X Factor remains a guaranteed pull for a sizeable audience, and one that is relatively young. It is important to note that on Saturday, X Factor was markedly more popular amongst the 16 to 34s than Strictly.” Cowell has made changes to the X Factor this year in an attempt to improve viewing figures after a disappointing 2016, when the final was the least watched since the first in 2004. There are expected to be fewer live X Factor shows in this series, and contestants will leave the programme on Saturdays and Sundays, rather than just in the Sunday episode. A jukebox feature used to seemingly randomly select the theme of each week’s show has also been scrapped, while former judge Cheryl Cole is expected to return for the judge’s house stage. Despite the changes, the judges remain Cowell, Sharon Osbourne, Nicole Scherzinger and Louis Walsh, with Dermot O’Leary presenting the show. While X Factor’s audience has been declining since 2010, Strictly’s has risen. The BBC dancing competition achieved its record viewing figures of 11.8 million in last year’s final, in which Ore Oduba beat actor Danny Mac and former singer Louise Redknapp. BBC sources say the broadcaster is delighted with Strictly’s performance, particularly after the new series was criticised for featuring a supposedly underwhelming collection of celebrities. They also denied that the publicly owned organisation was being overly aggressive by scheduling the programme against X Factor, which generates millions of pounds of advertising for ITV. Saturday’s episode of Strictly lasted for two and a half hours and the last 45 minutes overlapped with the X Factor. This contributed to X Factor’s audience dropping 1.5 million compared with the previous weekend when it did not clash with Strictly. A BBC spokesperson said: “It’s up to other broadcasters how they schedule their programmes, but we have always broadcast Strictly at the heart of the Saturday night schedule – precisely where the public want the biggest show on TV.” ITV declined to comment. The Strictly episode included the introduction of new head judge Shirley Ballas and a tribute to former host Sir Bruce Forsyth, who died last month. Aston Merrygold, the former JLS singer, topped the leaderboard. Other celebrities performing in Strictly this year include comedian Brian Conley, Paralympic champion Jonnie Peacock, and broadcaster and former stage performer Debbie McGee. Despite Strictly performing stronger than the X Factor, ITV has enjoyed success elsewhere in the ratings battle. The first episode of Liar, a drama starring Joanne Froggatt and Ioan Gruffudd, attracted 8 million viewers, making it ITV’s highest rated new drama this year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/01/kamasi-washington-harmony-of-difference-review-glorious-diversity","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T07:00:11Z","webTitle":"Kamasi Washington: Harmony of Difference review – a glorious exploration of diversity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/01/kamasi-washington-harmony-of-difference-review-glorious-diversity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/01/kamasi-washington-harmony-of-difference-review-glorious-diversity","fields":{"headline":"Kamasi Washington: Harmony of Difference review – a glorious exploration of diversity","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Credited with making jazz cool again, Kamasi Washington’s cosmic clout is undeniable.

They impress, they entertain, they qualify for Europe and achieve to a certain level without actually getting it over the line. The old ‘Neverkusen’ epithet from the Klaus Toppmöller days has endured well. Last season, and the summer that followed, changed all that. The Roger Schmidt era, which had given Die Werkself a firm on-pitch identity, fell to pieces and the club dropped the ball badly in appointing Tayfun Korkut as his successor – at exactly the point where a strong personality was needed to galvanise the players. In between wan performances, poor results and players meeting angry fans to appease them, Leverkusen came worryingly close to the drop. With no European competition for the first time in eight years, this season has looked like a rebuilding job ever since the end of the last one, an impression accentuated by the exits of Hakan Calhanoglu, Omer Toprak and Chicharito, with Kevin Kampl and the disappointing Aleksandar Dragovic following. Heiko Herrlich, known for his hustle and bravery as a player at the club in the 90s, returned as coach to oversee the new era. Despite Herrlich’s good work with Jahn Regensburg, it looked like a crowd-pleasing punt. The 45-year-old had underwhelmed in his previous spell as a top-flight head coach with Bochum, a position from which he was relieved in spring 2010. The suspicion that he might be out of his depth was reinforced by an underwhelming start, and the shabby loss at Mainz that followed the international break didn’t bode well. The last two performances at the Bay Arena, however, have been cut from a different cloth. Sunday’s 3-0 win over Hamburg was not quite as irresistible as the thumping of Freiburg last weekend, but Leverkusen’s ability to periodically pull away from mediocre opponents underlined the potency of their attacking weapons, and fired dreams of what more might follow. It was a new beginning, with Leon Bailey and Lucas Alario given their first starts in a line-up which – along with the most of the others in the Bundesliga after a long week – was heavily rotated. With habitual firestarter Karim Bellarabi on the bench, Benny Heinrichs and Wendell got involved, but Bailey’s long-awaited first impression after arriving from Genk in the winter window will linger longest in the memory. “It’s so good to be out there as a Leverkusen player,” Bailey said afterwards, and he wasn’t the only one feeling that. His talent is not in question, but his application has been in some quarters. He was ticked off by the club after a bizarre incident on a trip back to Genk in April, when he filmed a man working out in a gym, and posted the video on Snapchat, mocking him as a clown – only for the individual to turn out to be a professional boxer and hunt him down and confront a pretty terrified-looking Bailey at a local café. Here, he was as smart as he’d been daft in that incident, attacking with purpose and intelligence from the left and laying on two goals – firstly with a deft header down for Kevin Volland to rattle in the opener, before pretty much laying Alario’s debut goal on a plate with a demonic delivery across the six-yard box. Herrlich also praised Bailey for his defensive work. Volland, who has taken a while to settle after his move from Hoffenheim last year, is starting to look as influential as had initially been hoped and now has four goals in the last two home games. There was relief at the €19m Alario’s lively debut too, after his buyout clause was paid on deadline day but River Plate refused to hand over his registration, prompting Fifa’s intervention. “We are happy the matter can be filed away at last,” said Leverkusen’s sporting director Rudi Völler, with some understatement. Credit is due to Herrlich, too, whose side recovered here from a midweek loss to Hertha in which they’d played with personality. The seeds of this current upswing go further back – despite losing on the opening day at Bayern, they played with real daring in the second half especially and made life tough for the champions. There have been more goals in Leverkusen games than in any other team’s so far this season (22 in all); maybe Leverkusen’s new personality will be that of entertainers. They might be a work-in-progress but Hamburg, who lost a fourth straight game without scoring despite a promising start, can only dream of being this far along the line. Both coach Markus Gisdol and chairman Heribert Bruchhagen frankly pointed to a lack of quality. “With this squad,” lamented Gisdol, “we’re reaching our limits.” The absences of Nicolai Müller, Filip Kostic and Aaron Hunt have left them without much of a cutting edge either – with Leverkusen, as they calibrate their new attacking talents, perhaps looking on with a sigh of relief. Talking points • Finally, Borussia Dortmund conceded their first Bundesliga goal of the season on Saturday, 416 minutes into the campaign. That was the only mild dampener on their evening, however – they were 5-0 up against Borussia Mönchengladbach at the time, and added a sixth before the end via the unlikely source of Julian Weigl, whose delightful volley was only his second goal for the club, on the occasion of his first start of the season after injury. The improving Toprak had given the pre-match talk in Dortmund’s huddle, underlining how Peter Bosz has already coaxed a number of players to stand up as leaders, and the table-toppers were rampant from the get-go. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang hit a hat-trick and Maximilian Philipp scored twice, though Real Madrid scouts will note before Tuesday that Gladbach had chances, with Thorgan Hazard notably shooting straight at Roman Bürki twice when clean through. • Bayern spent Saturday pressing the flesh at Oktoberfest, and they probably needed a drink after the barely-explicable way in which they let two points slip away against Wolfsburg on Friday night having led 2-0. “We handed them over,” lamented Thomas Müller and though it will be put down to Sven Ulreich, whose glaring error in letting Max Arnold’s long-range free-kick past him allowed Die Wölfe back into the game, he wasn’t alone in his culpability. The defensive pairing of Mats Hummels and Jérôme Boateng had looked solid, but it was on their watch that Daniel Didavi wandered in unattended to head the equaliser. The recalled Arjen Robben was quiet, despite his goal, and missed a sitter at 2-1 which surely would have definitively put the game to bed. After Carlo Ancelotti made five changes, he has a few decisions to make before Wednesday’s Champions League trip to Paris Saint-Germain. • Former coaching badge classmates Julian Nagelsmann and Domenico Tedesco met at the Rhein-Neckar Arena, with Schalke’s visit to Hoffenheim also a return for former Die Kraichgauer youth coach Tedesco. Nagelsmann later admitted to Tedesco that his team’s 2-0 win was on the flattering side, and he was right. Yet while Tedesco must make do with admiration, Nagelsmann and Hoffenheim have tangible reward, with teenager Dennis Geiger’s first Bundesliga goal setting them on the road to a win that briefly took them top. • Unsung heroes of the week have to be Augsburg, who finished the Englische Woche seven points better off and in fifth after Saturday’s goalless draw at Stuttgart. That could have been an even better haul had Rani Khedira not fired a very presentable chance straight at Ron-Robert Zieler. Coach Manuel Baum, always an endearingly energetic presence on the touchline, is still a mystery to many. When he came on Saturday night’s Aktuelle Sportstudio on ZDF, presenter Jochen Breyer gave him a pen and A4 sheet of paper, asking him to jot down the secrets of the team’s success. “It’s not witchcraft,” smiled Baum. • More second-season syndrome for Leipzig, despite a fine first-half performance and an ultimately deserved victory over Eintracht Frankfurt. The irresistible new front-pair of Jean-Kévin Augustin and Timo Werner clicked again, with both on the scoresheet, but Ralph Hasenhüttl’s side ended up clinging on with only the woodwork preventing a Simon Falette equaliser. • Werder Bremen were booed – heavily – for first time this season by a Weserstadion which is starting to get twitchy after three points, and no wins, from the opening six after Saturday’s 0-0 with fellow strugglers Freiburg. “We were thinking too much about not losing,” said Thomas Delaney, betraying a degree of tension though not, sporting director Frank Baumann claimed, a lack of confidence in the coach’s methods. “We are absolutely convinced by Alex Nouri,” Baumann said. The Nordderby at Hamburg next Saturday evening is huge for both teams. • Mainz got a much-needed win, beating Hertha via a Pablo De Blasis penalty awarded by referee Tobias Stieler after VAR consultation. De Blasis’ goal was Mainz’s 500th in the Bundesliga – “a nice bit of colour,” according to the scorer, with the present far more important. Coach Sandro Schwarz has a challenge on his hands in trying to integrate a spate of new talent and one of those newbies, Alexandru Maxim, shone intermittently. Rather less content was Hertha’s Vedad Ibisevic, given a late red card by Stieler for swearing at him, with the Bosnian striker claiming the official misheard. “I hope they [the DfB] have lip-readers,” he said. It’s a tricky trip to Östersunds in the Europa League on Thursday for Hertha. • A point, at last, for Cologne, and one that deserves credit in a goalless draw at Hannover on Sunday. OK, one goal in six and bottom of the table doesn’t look pretty, but at least Peter Stöger and company seemed to have stemmed the flow at the back – this was a good, solid, away performance away to a side that went into the game with a 100% home record. “It’s a positive feeling,” said Stöger. That is exactly what Effzeh want to take into Thursday’s match with Crvena Zvezda, their first at home in Europe in 25 years. Results: Bayern Munich 2-2 Wolfsburg, Hoffenheim 2-0 Schalke, Mainz 1-0 Hertha Berlin, RB Leipzig 2-1 Eintracht Frankfurt, Stuttgart 0-0 Augsburg, Werder Bremen 0-0 Freiburg, Borussia Dortmund 6-1 Borussia Mönchengladbach, Hannover 0-0 Cologne, Bayer Leverkusen 3-0 Hamburg."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"community/2017/sep/24/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-sleep","type":"article","sectionId":"community","sectionName":"Community","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T08:00:39Z","webTitle":"Your pictures: share your photos on the theme of 'sleep'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/community/2017/sep/24/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-sleep","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/community/2017/sep/24/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-sleep","fields":{"headline":"Your pictures: share your photos on the theme of 'sleep'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The next theme for our weekly photography assignment in the Observer New Review is ‘sleep.’ Share your photos of what sleep means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.

Ford announced his latest fragrance during New York fashion week, and the name alone has caused a stir, with descriptions ranging from “racy” to “obscene”. Certainly, it’s a gear change for the designer, who has previously favoured more literal fragrance names – Tobacco Vanille, Tuscan Leather, Venetian Bergamot – but, in the increasingly risque world of cosmetics monikers, it is unlikely to raise eyebrows for long. Cosmetics’ names were once chosen for sentimental, rather than shock, value. Chanel’s numbered fragrance line marked dates including her birthday (No 19) for example, and Dolce &amp; Gabbana’s Sophia Loren No 1 lipstick was released to commemorate the actor’s 81st birthday. Meanwhile, Nars’s Jungle Red lip and nail colour reference the nail polish from 1939’s The Women (a film that memorably featured not a single man). Yet Nars is far better known for Orgasm – a blush colour that managed to overshadow the likes of Threesome, Sex Appeal and, sadly, Mata Hari, in what is a relatively risque range – rivalled perhaps only by (the pigmentally similar) Deep Throat. This year, the brand launched an entire Orgasm collection off the back of its popularity. (Tagline: “Have more than one.”) “François [Nars, Nars’s founder and creative director] has always wanted to give the products an identity and character,” says Magalie Parksuwan, senior vice-president of marketing at the company. “He wants people to remember the names and to provoke.” The high street has embraced provocative and “rude” cosmetics, with brands such as Soap &amp; Glory marketing innuendo-laden products, from Sexy Mother Pucker lip shine to Glow Job tinted foundation. Too Faced’s Boudoir Eyes palette skipped the puns entirely, with shadows titled Fuzzy Handcuffs and French Tickler, while the brand’s Better Than Sex mascara proved so popular that it inspired a line of shoes. Unsurprisingly, the ever-“edgy” Urban Decay has its own selection of suggestive cosmetics, including a blusher in Fetish (a name shared with a lipstick by Mac) and a lip gloss in Rule 34 (Google it). Illamasqua takes a more straightforward approach, with a rubber-finish nail varnish in Kink and an eye shadow simply called Sex. But can raunch-based retail really seduce potential customers? “It definitely has an impact,” says Parksuwan, “[but] there’s more to the success of a product than just that.” When Kylie Jenner, something of a bellwether for millennial makeup trends, released her blush collection in March, she ditched the sentimental nomenclature of her Lip Kits (Mary Jo K was a tribute to her grandmother and Dolce K was named after, er, the family dog) for vastly more provocative names including X-Rated, Virginity and Hot and Bothered. But it was her rosy pink Barely Legal which proved most controversial – sparking a similar backlash to that prompted by Kat Von D’s Underage Red lipstick in 2015. Even so, an Instagram search for #kyliecosmetics conjures more than two million posts – many of them photos of the products themselves; fully packaged, lascivious labels neatly aligned – which perhaps goes some way to explaining why suggestive stickers, no longer sheepishly consigned to the base of nail varnish pots, proliferate. “Names help to create a story and elicit a reaction [online],” says Parksuwan. And, given the epicurean competition, who would want to be #beige? That said, the chance to be immortalised in makeup may not yet be dead. Last week, Ford also expanded his Lips &amp; Boys collection, which now features 100 lipsticks – each named after one of the designer’s closest friends."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/22/khovanshchina-oedipe-best-uk-classical-concerts","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T10:30:45Z","webTitle":"Khovanshchina and Oedipe: this week’s best UK classical concerts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/22/khovanshchina-oedipe-best-uk-classical-concerts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/22/khovanshchina-oedipe-best-uk-classical-concerts","fields":{"headline":"Khovanshchina and Oedipe: this week’s best UK classical concerts","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"1 Khovanshchina The return of David Pountney’s 2007 production of Mussorgsky’s historical epic not only opens Welsh National Opera’s new season but also inaugurates R17, the Cardiff-based multi-disciplinary event marking the 100th anniversary of the Russian revolution.

Firefighters who put out a fire at the address on Wimbledon Park Road in Wandsworth called police at about 6.30pm on Wednesday to report the body. The victim was too badly burned to immediately establish a gender or age. Police said it seemed as though attempts had been made to dispose of the body. The suspects, a 40-year-old man and a 34-year-old woman, were arrested at the scene and taken to separate police stations for questioning. The Metropolitan police’s homicide and major crime command (HMCC) is leading the investigation, and working closely with police in Wandsworth. “Early indications are that attempts were made to dispose of the body,” DI Richard Leonard from the HMCC said. “I would like to appeal to those in and around the area to come forward with information. You may well have seen or heard something suspicious in the last few days which could assist our investigators.” Supt Peter Gardner from Wandsworth police said: “I fully appreciate the concern that this investigation will cause in the local community.

Under this ambitious brand positioning – or “communion of intent”, in its CEO Pietro Beccari’s more elegant phrasing – Fendi has become a generous patron of the city of Rome, where it is based. The house paid the £2m bill for the recent restoration of the Trevi fountain, and staged a fashion show upon its reopening. Plans for the Caravaggio Research Institute, to be founded by Fendi in partnership with Rome’s Galleria Borghese, were announced this month. “This is a very interesting project for Italy and Rome and for Fendi to bring the beauty of the Italian capital and of Caravaggio around the world,” said Beccari. He described the painter as “very modern and an innovator”, adding that “these are values shared with Fendi”. In November, Caravaggio masterpieces will travel from Rome to LA for an exhibition at the Getty Museum. On the Milan catwalk, Fendi’s arthouse persona showed up in the asymmetric kingfisher blue fringes and bold stripes of eye makeup sported New Romantic-style by the models. Sheer, striped midi dresses in moss green and petrol blue were worn with decorative flat sandals with stretch surf straps – a luxe take on the utility walking sandal, which is emerging as a trend for next summer. The Max Mara catwalk is notable on the Milan fashion week schedule for focusing on the down-to-earth business of clothes real women want to wear. The brand’s British creative director, Ian Griffiths, has an eye for the subtle updates that make a wardrobe modern, while the formidable infrastructure of Max Mara ensures top-notch Italian tailoring and fabric. The first six outfits on to the catwalk were all head-to-toe caramel, a capsule wardrobe of chic monotoning designed to appeal to Max Mara’s clients, busy women who do not have time to assemble maximalist montages each morning. A trench coat came in organza, which perhaps makes more sense in the Italian climate than the British, but which was seductive in its showcasing not just of the ribbed bodycon dress underneath but also in its own immaculate seams and tailoring. The trends emerging for next season were ticked off as models emerged: the trouser suit; a fitted “body” tucked into a long-line skirt, and a ribbed vest with a ”carwash” skirt. (Think of a long skirt cut into the vertical ribbons of a drive-in carwash, and you get the idea.) Collection notes described these clothes as being for when “business and pleasure blur”, which is fashion week speak for outfits that you can wear to the office, and then to dinner. A ribbed racer-back top with flat-front trousers and a blazer looked, crucially, like an outfit that would transition effortlessly from the catwalk to the real world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/21/canadian-mining-firm-eldorado-gold-greece-protests","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T14:33:10Z","webTitle":"Canadian mining firm withdraws threat to quit Greece amid protests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/21/canadian-mining-firm-eldorado-gold-greece-protests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/21/canadian-mining-firm-eldorado-gold-greece-protests","fields":{"headline":"Canadian mining firm withdraws threat to quit Greece amid protests","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Greece’s biggest foreign investor has withdrawn its threat to pull out of the country in an apparent breakthrough over work permits as miners railing against the prospect of unemployment took en masse to the streets of Athens. George Burns, chief executive of the Canadian mining company Eldorado Gold, said enough accommodation had been reached over the issue of outstanding licences to allow “constructive talks” with the government over its future in the country. His announcement came as more than 1,000 miners, protesting against the prospect of possible job losses, descended on the capital, blockading the environment ministry before angrily marching on the Greek parliament. Miners from mountain villages whose families have been working the gold and copper reserves for generations feared they would lose jobs if the row over long-delayed licences was not resolved. Most in the capital on Thursday had travelled overnight on coaches from northern Greece, where Eldorado operates two goldmines. “We have come to Athens again to claim a right to our livelihood, a right to a wage,” Giorgos Hatzis, representing workers at one of the mines, told reporters. “We are not going to stop claiming the sacred right to work.” In echoes of a controversy in Romania, where the Canadian mining company Gabriel Resources has faced fierce opposition from local activists, Eldorado has confronted entrenched resistance over its operations from opponents citing environmental concerns. The loudest criticism has come from leftists in the governing Syriza party. More than 2,000 jobs are on the line in an investment exceeding $3bn – by far the largest in a country where one in five are out of work. Earlier this month the Vancouver-based firm gave the government until 22 September to issue the permits, saying it would suspend operations if the deadline wasn’t met. After violent protests outside the environment ministry last week, licences were provided for a pre-existing underground mine at Olympias, on the Chalkidiki peninsula, but not for an open-pit mine at Skouries. Eldorado expects each mine to have a life of at least 25 years, and more than 500 miners work in Skouries alone. With foreign investment key to cutting unemployment, the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras has exhorted his cabinet to facilitate endorsement of major state sell-offs, but sensitivities remain, with leading Syriza figures complaining that Eldorado is trying to cut corners. Stergios Pitsiorlas, the deputy development and economy minister handling investments, told the Guardian that while Athens wanted the mining firm to stay “there are rules and everyone has to respect them”. Contractual obligations had to be kept, he said. Much of the controversy has centred on metal production techniques. The Canadian company has agreed to enter an arbitration process to settle differences with Greek authorities including compliance with environmental regulations. In a statement it insisted that the Skouries licence was not part of the process. “Upon receipt of the required Skouries permit and the Greek government being willing to engage with us in constructive discussions, the company will then be in a position to re-assess investment options in Greece,” it said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/sep/21/jake-lamotta-not-great-champion-but-one-of-toughest-boxing-beast","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T13:06:28Z","webTitle":"Jake LaMotta was not a great champion but one of the toughest, a boxing beast | Kevin Mitchell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/21/jake-lamotta-not-great-champion-but-one-of-toughest-boxing-beast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/21/jake-lamotta-not-great-champion-but-one-of-toughest-boxing-beast","fields":{"headline":"Jake LaMotta was not a great champion but one of the toughest, a boxing beast","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jake LaMotta should have been in Las Vegas to watch Gennady Golovkin and Saul “Canelo” Álvarez, two distinguished middleweights pitched together to echo the deeds of the division’s glorious past, a fight reckoned to restore boxing’s faltering image. LaMotta, who knew a lot about the game’s sullied reputation, would have given it a wry smile. The fight did not quite do its job. It was a terrific rather than a truly great contest and dreadful misjudgment by one of the officials overwhelmingly in favour of Álvarez returned a split draw, drowning out all other post-fight sentiments. So, unfairly but inevitably, Golovkin-Álvarez will be remembered only slightly more fondly than the theatrical crossover fight in the same ring three weeks earlier between Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor. To rinse away the taste of that farce, LaMotta’s was a name the promoters raised in the week before GGG-Canelo. He was lauded alongside Sugar Ray Robinson, his nemesis. They spoke, too, about the later Sugar Ray – Leonard – and Marvin Hagler and Tommy Hearns and Roberto Durán. They hoped the past might gild the present. Maybe their memories were selective. LaMotta, the world middleweight champion from 1949 to 1951, was not ringside on either night but seeing out his final days in a nursing home in Florida. If asked, he could probably recount the night he threw his fight against Billy Fox in 1947 to get his title shot against the charismatic Frenchman Marcel Cerdan two years later – and how he lied about the fix for 13 years. He had bowed to the arm-twisting of Fox’s influential gangster manager, Blinky Palermo, but never properly cashed in on being world champion. He defended the title twice before running into Robinson for a sixth and final time. Then he got fat, fought on for three years, losing four and drawing one of 10, knocked down for the only time in his career, but quitting on his stool twice. His best years were in the 1940s, as a foil for Robinson and terroriser of lesser opponents. He was not a great champion but he surely was one of the toughest, a boxing beast. The fine details of his brief reign and the denouement are not always absorbed in recollections of his career, mainly because one of the greatest movies of all time painted him in classically Shakespearean mode, a doomed victim to fear then pity. Martin Scorsese’s Raging Bull simultaneously rehabbed LaMotta’s standing as a middleweight champion and exposed the essential ugliness of his personality. But his boxing was not the real story. As Scorsese told the New York Times when the film finally started making noise after its release in 1980: “Those who think it’s a boxing picture would be out of their minds. It’s brutal, sure, but it’s a brutality that could take place not only in the boxing ring but in the bedroom or in an office. Jake is an elemental man.” Scorsese did not say that as something to be proud of but a fact foolish to ignore. Chuck Palahniuk said something similar when I asked him about his exploration of elemental maleness in his book Fight Club. What the filmmaker and the author shared was a fascination with the glamour of violence. Not a lot about LaMotta’s life appeared glamorous, apart from his seven wives, perhaps, the second of whom, Vikki, appeared in Playboy. The last to indulge him was Denise Baker, who was 30 years his junior and by his side when he died of pneumonia on Tuesday, aged 95. They met in the famous Manhattan bar PJ Clarke’s in 1993, married two decades later and they shared a stage in a short theatrical rerun of his life that she co-wrote and directed, called The Lady and the Champ. It contains LaMotta’s glib take on his many marriages: “My first wife died from eating mushrooms. My second wife died from eating mushrooms. My third wife died of a skull fracture. She refused to eat the mushrooms.” The production got worse reviews than LaMotta’s fight against Fox. Mrs LaMotta VII told the celebrity gossip site TMZ this week: “I just want people to know, he was a great, sweet, sensitive, strong, compelling man with a great sense of humour, with eyes that danced.” He was all of that – and he was less as well. He went to reformatory school for attempted burglary (never a good look on the CV: attempted); he beat a bookmaker nearly to death and left him for dead; he was serially cruel to his wives, at least some of the early ones; he got six months on a chain gang for introducing men to underage girls in his Miami nightclub; he got bit parts in movies; and he recycled his life in a standup act, the centrepiece of which was the On the Waterfront “I could have been a contender” monologue that formed such a poignant closing to Raging Bull. I was not alone in discovering that, to get an interview, the going rate was whatever he felt like asking for on the day. For all his admirable fighting deeds, LaMotta knew well enough that, if it were not for the book and the movie, the life he led would have been as tough to sell as those of his less famous contemporaries. As Don King says, you don’t get what you deserve, you get what you negotiate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/21/get-up-stand-up-including-exercise-in-everyday-life-healthier-than-gym-says-study","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T22:30:30Z","webTitle":"Get up, stand up: including exercise in everyday life healthier than gym, says study","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/21/get-up-stand-up-including-exercise-in-everyday-life-healthier-than-gym-says-study","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/21/get-up-stand-up-including-exercise-in-everyday-life-healthier-than-gym-says-study","fields":{"headline":"Get up, stand up: including exercise in everyday life healthier than gym, says study","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Incorporating physical activity into our everyday lives, from taking the stairs to holding “walkaround” meetings in the office, is more likely to protect us from heart disease and an early death than buying a gym membership, according to the author of a major new global study. The study, published in the Lancet medical journal, found that one in 20 cases of heart disease and one in 12 premature deaths around the globe could be prevented if people were more physically active. It compared 130,000 people in 17 countries, from affluent countries like Canada and Sweden to some of the least affluent, including Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. While 30 minutes of exercise per day for five days a week, which most guidelines recommend, reduces heart disease and deaths, one to two hours a day is the optimal amount of physical activity, said lead author Professor Scott Lear, of Simon Fraser University’s faculty of health sciences in Vancouver, Canada. Most people will think they cannot incorporate that much physical activity into their life, he said. “They will think ‘I’m stressed out and have to make dinner – and then do exercise for two hours!’” he said. But the study showed that those people who have the highest activity levels are those for whom it is part of their everyday working lives. In developing countries, more people still have physically taxing jobs but as they become more economically prosperous, their activity levels fall. “They are going from sweeping the floor to buying a vacuum,” said Lear. He does not advocate selling the vacuum cleaner, but we could all incorporate more activity into our lives rather than relying on occasional forays to the gym or swimming pool. “It becomes routine as opposed to an endeavour,” he said. “Sitting for hours is not good for hearts or the physical body. Getting up every 20 to 30 minutes for a walk around is beneficial. I have a cooking timer. “We spend a lot of time in meetings. If it is just two or three people, why not have a walkaround meeting?” He also suggests playing with children in the park rather than sitting watching them, increasing the walk to work by getting off the tube or bus early and taking the stairs rather than the lift. The authors found that the more physically active people were, the lower their risk of heart disease or an early death. “Participating at even low physical activity confers benefit and the benefit continues to increase up to high total physical activity,” says the study. People who did more than 750 minutes of brisk walking or equivalent activity per week reduced their risk of death by 36%. But the study notes that “the affordability of other CVD [cardiovascular disease] interventions such as consuming fruits and vegetables and generic CVD drugs is beyond the reach of many people in low-income and middle-income countries; however, physical activity represents a low-cost approach to CVD prevention.” While the amount of physical work people do in low income countries reduces heart disease, their chances of surviving if they do have a heart attack or stroke are lower because their health services are not as advanced. The World Health Organisation recommends that adults aged 18-64 years old do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week, as well as muscle strengthening exercises at least two days a week. But it is thought that almost a quarter (23%) of the world’s population are not meeting physical activity guidelines. The study is the first to compare physical activity and heart disease levels in countries of varying affluence. “The clear-cut results reinforce the message that exercise truly is the best medicine at our disposal for reducing the odds of an early death,” said Dr James Rudd, a senior lecturer in cardiovascular medicine at the University of Cambridge. “If a drug company came up with a medicine as effective as exercise, they would have a billion-dollar blockbuster on their hands and a Nobel prize in the post.” “There is a trend for more heart disease in lower income groups both within and between populations,” said John Martin, professor of cardiovascular medicine at University College London. “In the UK it has been shown that lower social class is associated with more heart disease. Walking is easy and cheap. This study should encourage governments to rebalance health budgets away from high tech treatment of heart disease to promoting simple strategies of prevention like walking.” Professor Metin Avkiran, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation said: “In an age where we’re living increasingly busy but often sedentary lives in the west, weaving physical activity into our daily routines has never been more important, not only to improve our physical health but also overall well-being. Increased physical activity could have an even greater beneficial impact in lower income countries, due to its low its cost and the high incidence of heart disease in those countries.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2017/sep/22/why-boris-johnsons-singing-birds-are-just-what-the-doctor-ordered","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T05:00:38Z","webTitle":"Why Boris Johnson's 'singing birds' are just what the doctor ordered","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/sep/22/why-boris-johnsons-singing-birds-are-just-what-the-doctor-ordered","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2017/sep/22/why-boris-johnsons-singing-birds-are-just-what-the-doctor-ordered","fields":{"headline":"Why Boris Johnson's 'singing birds' are just what the doctor ordered","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“No, we are a government working together,” Boris Johnson insisted post-jog to journalists in New York. “We are a nest of singing birds.” You could be forgiven for assuming that the classicist foreign secretary had reached for another Latin-lit allusion (Horace? Ovid?) to pooh-pooh the idea of continual Brexit bust-ups. In fact, the quote comes from Dr Johnson and has nothing to do with interpersonal harmony. Quizzed by Boswell about his student days, the 18th-century Johnson noted how many poets had attended Pembroke College, Oxford, besides himself, adding “with a smile of sportive triumph, ‘Sir, we are a nest of singing birds’”. The original quote and its use are so bizarrely askew as to require imaginative inference about the workings of the bookish Borisonian subconscious: could he have referenced his namesake (despite the allusion making no sense) as a way of repressing the words he really wanted to use about the cabinet? John Webster after all came up with a much better known avian quotation (in The White Devil) in conjuring “a summer bird-cage in a garden” where “the birds that are without despair to get in, and the birds within ... fear they shall never get out”. Or perhaps Boris was thinking of another literary allusion by another namesake: Catherine Johnson’s 2008 novel A Nest of Vipers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/21/uk-banks-to-check-70m-bank-accounts-in-search-for-illegal-immigrants","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T19:00:26Z","webTitle":"UK banks to check 70m bank accounts in search for illegal immigrants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/21/uk-banks-to-check-70m-bank-accounts-in-search-for-illegal-immigrants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/21/uk-banks-to-check-70m-bank-accounts-in-search-for-illegal-immigrants","fields":{"headline":"UK banks to check 70m bank accounts in search for illegal immigrants","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Banks and building societies are to carry out immigration checks on 70m current accounts from January in the biggest extension of Theresa May’s plans to create a “hostile environment” for illegal immigrants in Britain, the Guardian has learned. The Home Office expects to identify 6,000 visa overstayers, failed asylum seekers and foreign national offenders facing deportation in the first year of the checks, which are to be carried out quarterly. The accounts of those identified will be closed down or frozen “to make it harder for them to establish or maintain a settled life in the UK”. Officials say freezing accounts that hold significant sums “will create a powerful incentive [for those involved] to agree to voluntary departure” so they can secure their money once they have left the country. Immigration welfare campaigners warned that the Home Office’s recent record meant it could not be trusted to implement this new system without errors and that migrants with every right to be in Britain were likely to be hit by mistakes in the imposition of the checks. Satbir Singh, the chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, criticised the move: “The government’s own record shows it cannot be trusted even to implement this system properly. Immigration status is very complex, and the Home Office consistently gives out incorrect information and guidance. “Migrants and ethnic minorities with every right to be here will be affected by the imposition of these new checks.”. Banks have been told to adopt a default position of telling customers to take up the matter with the Home Office if a mistake has been made, even if they provide a passport or biometric residence permit showing they are lawfully present in Britain. The Guardian confirmed with the Home Office the January implementation date for the bank checks after being alerted by a reader who is a European national resident in Britain. Her husband spotted a reference to “changes to how we check your eligibility to bank with us based on your immigration status” in an email from Barclays detailing their latest changes in their banking terms of conditions. Dominique Welbank said: “As a French national having lived here since 1991, and having been denied permanent residence because I do not have comprehensive sickness insurance, I have no confidence the Home Office will not extend this scheme to EU citizens like myself because of Brexit.” Status checks are required by anyone opening a new bank or building society account under the Immigration Act 2014, but no measure has previously required checks on the scale of every current account in Britain. The new legislation requires the banks to check the identity of every current account holder against a Home Office supplied database held by an anti-fraud organisation, Cifas. It includes details of those whom the Home Office regard as liable for removal or deportation because they are overstayers, failed asylum seekers or those who have absconded from immigration detention. Safeguards are included to prevent the closure of a bank account which would leave the account holder without the subsistence means to live. Account closure can also be delayed to recover debts or deal with complex joint accounts. An official Home Office impact assessment acknowledged “the proposed measures may have the potential to impact on the appetite of firms to offer banking services to legal migrants who do not have permanent leave to remain in the UK” and promises to monitor the situation. Officials add that the banking laws ban discrimination against legally resident customers. The January implementation of the quarterly checks on the current accounts operated by every bank and building society in Britain are part of Immigration Act 2016 measures to create a hostile environment for illegal migrants. Other measures include “right to rent” checks with heavy fines for landlords who let homes to illegal migrants, checks on driving licences and tougher measures against illegal working. An official Home Office impact assessment acknowledges that rather than encouraging illegal migrants to go home it could simply drive them even further into the “hidden economy”, but says this will not be a significant issue because they are already breaking the law. “This policy is not expected to exacerbate the situation but to contribute to the hostile environment, encouraging illegal immigrants to leave the UK on a voluntary basis,” it says. Banks have also been told there is no requirement on them to contact account holders or require additional documentary evidence as part of the check. A Home Office spokesperson defended the introduction of the checks saying: “We are developing an immigration system which is fair to people who are here legally, but firm with those who break the rules. Everyone in society can play their part in tackling illegal migration. “As approved by parliament in December 2016, from January banks and building societies will be required to carry out regular checks on the immigration status of all current account holders against the details of known illegal migrants to establish whether their customers are known to be in the UK unlawfully. This is part of our ongoing work to tackle illegal migration. People who are here legally will be unaffected.” A Barclays spokesperson said the bank was simply complying with the Immigration Act 2016 and the checks impacted on all customers regardless of nationality."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/23/secrets-of-the-tv-writers-rooms-tv-narcos-silicon-valley-transparent","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T17:00:21Z","webTitle":"Secrets of the TV writers’ room: inside Narcos, Transparent and Silicon Valley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/23/secrets-of-the-tv-writers-rooms-tv-narcos-silicon-valley-transparent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/23/secrets-of-the-tv-writers-rooms-tv-narcos-silicon-valley-transparent","fields":{"headline":"Secrets of the TV writers’ room: inside Narcos, Transparent and Silicon Valley","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Every age creates its signature way of telling and consuming stories. The Jacobeans had the blood and lust of popular tragedy. The Victorians had the great social novel. The 1960s had new journalism. The chosen form of our own age is the downloaded serial drama. While the energy and ambition of screenwriters was for nearly a century invested in two-hour feature films, for the past 10 years, ever since The Wire and The Sopranos and The West Wing showed what might be possible, it has been in the 10-hour arcs, and annual seasons of streamed drama. Those shows – Scandi-noir, Game of Thrones (and its progeny), Breaking Bad and the rest – have created a new kind of relation between creators and viewers. The stories are made not only for total immersion, but also presuppose the potential for binge-watching. Since Netflix started uploading whole series, days and nights are lost to the “just one more episode” of unfolding dramas, in the way that we might once have been invited to lose ourselves in books. The idea of bingeing on drama has some negative connotations, but the facts suggest that far from seeing this habit as time wasted, we tend to think of it as fulfilling in the way that time devoted to great fiction always was. In 2013, Netflix did a study into why 73% of viewers felt overwhelming feelings of comfort when immersed in these dramas. The company sent an anthropologist, Grant McCracken, into viewers’ homes to discover the reasons for this: “TV viewers are no longer zoning out as a way to forget about their day, they are tuning in, on their own schedule, to a different world. Getting immersed in multiple episodes or even multiple seasons of a show over a few weeks is a new kind of escapism that is especially welcome.” The usual attention deficit of the internet was replaced by something more complex and satisfying. The huge demand for such shows and the intense rivalry between Netflix and Amazon, in particular, to create has led to a new kind of mythologised creative space: the writers’ room. The creative pressures of producing multiple series of 10-hour dramas in short order have changed the dynamic of traditional scriptwriting practice. Rather than pairs of writers, or single auteurs, the collective and the collaborative is not only prized but essential. As favourite shows build their own addictive fanbases – more fragmented than the audience for broadcast TV ever was, but often more cultishly engaged – the writers’ room, the place where the drama begins and ends, has become the subject of intense curiosity and scrutiny. The room is largely an American creation, a development of the comedy bunkhouses that produce The Simpsons or Saturday Night Live. Inevitably there are websites and blogs and memes devoted to gossip about these sacred and profane spaces, places to get a fix of favourite dramas before the next series is uploaded. Some shows – Orange Is the New Black and The Good Wife pioneered the practice – provide the backstory to the genesis and creation scenes in live Twitter feeds, with whiteboards and interview links and photos. What they mostly reveal is that having ideas – even in groups – and writing them up into scripts is no less painful and laborious than it ever was, but that it now has a kind of endless forward motion. In his book Difficult Men, Brett Martin describes the rise of the21st-century phenomenon of the streamed drama series, noting that though all writers’ rooms have their own character, they share a few common features. Chief among them, the one “near-absolute” is that in the centre of the room “there will be a quantity and flow of food reminiscent of a cruise ship, as though writing were an athletic feat demanding a constant infusion of calories”. Other than that energy supply, there are two essential elements: along one wall a whiteboard (“the signature tool of this golden age”) with a grid divided into 10 or 12 columns, one for each episode; and a harassed-looking writers’ assistant feverishly trying to capture every passing comment made by the writers in relation to those episodes and to type it into a laptop before it is lost. At the centre of all of the chat and ideas is the showrunner, the person charged with getting the writers writing and the series made. This person is rarely relaxed. As David Chase, creator of The Sopranos observed: “Other people have good ideas. And they’re hard to come by. But in another sense, they’re a dime-a-dozen. Turning an idea into an episode – that’s the grunt work. Eventually, the showrunner’s the one who has to look at his watch and say: ‘How do we fill up 42 minutes?’ We can all sit around and decide we want to make a Louis XIV table, but eventually somebody has to do the carving.” Different writers’ rooms have evolved different processes to try to keep that grunt work going into the fourth and fifth and sixth series. Here, three showrunners explain how they do it. ‘Eric Newman, Narcos: People come and go, but you burn out pretty quickly’ Eric Newman, producer of genre films such as Dawn of the Dead and Children of Men, spent years researching the rise and fall of Pablo Escobar and the Colombian cocaine trade, with a view to making a feature film of the story. Netflix approached him with the idea of a series, and he offered them the first 10 hours of Escobar’s story. The third series of Narcos, which shows the rise of the Cali Cartel after Escobar’s death, began on Netflix this month. “This is something I have been living with for 20 years. From the beginning, I wanted this not to be about one trafficker, Escobar. I wanted it to be about a whole evolution of this business. We have been talking about this series, the macro of it, for what seems like forever. In terms of the process we have what we call tent poles of events, things that happen, turning points that support the rest of the story. Some of them are spectacular, others more subtle – from the end of the cold war to the death of a cop. As writers, we have these events to hit. We take licence occasionally, but there is an obligation to the truth. The writers’ room is where the research comes together. The nature of the job means above all we all have to know the story inside out. All the characters, where they wanted to go, and how close they got, and where they ended up. All drama arises in the gap between what a person wants and what they get. We always try to talk about the characters as the real people they were: ‘Where is this guy going? What does he want?’ All we will do for the first six to eight weeks in the writing room is just talk about the story. Nothing makes me happier than when one of the writers comes in and says: ‘Look, I found out this amazing thing about this guy last night – how can we use it?’ We are always learning new stuff as we go. One of my favourite things in series two was this guy named Limón. All we had was that there was this guy and he was shot and killed with Escobar. We thought: well, if that is where his story ends, where does it begin? And we came up with this really compelling story in the second episode of season two. We do that a lot. We have a car crash and then trace it backwards. It is a very difficult and complicated and exhausting process. In any writers’ room – and this is the first show I have written and run – there are two invaluable things: one is inspiration, and the other is those collaborators who have done research. We talk to everybody who was involved, though not to the traffickers that much because they give the same story: they were misunderstood, innocent, not as they were depicted. Our guiding thematic principle is that this world is extremely complicated. It is never bad guys and good guys. It is bad guys and very bad guys. And there is almost never any justice, only a doomed mission that is underneath it all. By episode seven, we know Escobar will have blown up an airplane. But how he gets there is the fun part. He is a character like Icarus, or Macbeth. An archetype and also the truth. Our job is to find the most dramatic version of that. The veracity of it gets more imperative. I think we are somewhere around 60% to 70% true. But what you find is that this world is full of unreliable narrators, wishful thinkers, self‑deceivers. I come from movies, and we look at things in terms of a three-act structure. What everyone wants and why they can’t get it has to be established very clearly in the first act. The middle act tends to be an escalation of things, leading in the third act to a massive confrontation. Doing that over 10 hours kind of explodes the drama. Some of the younger writers in the room have grown up with this TV format. Right now we have 10 writers, and the younger ones have had experience primarily in television. For a screenwriter, that always used to be seen as a failure. Now it is the opposite. It has changed over the last 10 years, but particularly since The Wire and The Sopranos, that first golden age of cable television. I would say in terms of all three seasons I may be the only consistent presence in the writers’ room. People come and go, but you burn out pretty quickly. Every morning I wake up and I attempt to convince my wife that I have no idea what I am doing and that this is the season that will expose me. And then I drive to the office, and almost invariably, after about an hour staring at this massive whiteboard with all the characters and diagrams of who killed whom, we find inspiration. It is like being in a police operations room. The key thing is that this is not a job, and if you try to approach it like a regular job you can’t do it. It requires a level of commitment that only comes if you love it and are interested enough in it to talk about it until exhaustion.” Jill Soloway, Transparent: ‘We want the characters to tell us what they want’ Jill Soloway is the creator of Amazon’s Transparent, the comedy drama that returned for a fourth season on Amazon last week. Soloway previously worked as a writer on several other series including Six Feet Under and was best director at the Sundance film festival in 2013 for the feature Afternoon Delight. Transparent stars Jeffrey Tambor as Maura Pfefferman, a retired college professor who opens up to his family about having always identified as a woman. Soloway’s father came out in a similar way in 2011. Tambor and Soloway, who now identifies as nonbinary, both won Golden Globes for Transparent in 2015, the first time an internet-streaming show had won the award for best series. “I think of our writers’ room like the perfect dinner party or the perfect gathering. You want a whole bunch of different opinions in there and yet you don’t want to get bogged down in conflict. I look for people who understand how to play well with others but who are also strong personalities. In terms of writers, you want people who are shit-starters creatively, but not in real life. We have been quite a tight team, but for season five of Transparent, which we are writing now, we are having a little transition – losing a few writers and gaining some. We are having more trans women in the writers’ room; we actually have three trans women and five trans people in total if you count people who are gender-nonconforming. It’s exciting to slowly make the room reflect the possibility of the story. It is always like a group commitment, Monday to Friday. Sitting in that room on the beanbags and dreaming up the characters is the most fun thing ever. I will spend slightly less time there now because I am directing, and I might be editing or whatever, but it is still where I want to be most. I couldn’t have possibly imagined in a million years that this would happen. The fact that this quite personal thing has turned into a publicly consumed phenomenon is quite special. My sister was the very first person I hired. I really used the show as an excuse to get her to move to LA. We have been writing together since we were kids. She is my first writing partner. When I first pitched the idea, Amazon Studios were the only ones who really wanted it and because they were just starting we didn’t even know if that was viable. Now it feels like a very safe place. HBO was interested, but they wanted us to do some developing and it maybe would have taken a few years. Amazon went after it really vigorously, and are involved, but with a very light touch. I think the fact that the audience can take it all in one go if they want to and really go into their own experience with it shapes what we do a little. It is a much more involved experience, when it comes to watching and bingeing. We try to think about when people might stop and when they might keep going, in a natural way. In the writers’ room we plan, but it always changes. Things grow and change and take unexpected turns just like people do. We feel like the souls of the Pfefferman family are real – and they become more real to us with each series. They are really growing. When I see those early series I can’t believe how young Josh and Ali look, like babies. Six Feet Under was a very similar vibe. I tried to learn from Alan Ball, who led that room. He used to tell us: ‘Just believe the family exists in the centre of the room, and then you all sit around and conjure them up.’ We are like that with the Pfeffermans. We want them to tell us what they want, we want that open feeling when the show starts to write itself, letting the characters come to us in dreams or while we are in the shower. The writing itself can be tough. I never write when I am trying to write. I have to read the previous draft, take a walk, have a bath, live, think, dream, love, laugh and wait for the inspiration that says, ‘Here is the new scene!’ and only then do I sit down at a computer. It is a different kind of all-consuming than it was at the beginning. It is a little less painful in a way. I think the show still has dark elements, but we are able to hold on to them a little bit more loosely and let things happen. I don’t feel quite as urgent about trying to collect the pain as I did at the beginning. I had wanted to have my own show for such a long time that in the first couple of years we almost felt like in a race against time. Now we can let the Pfeffermans do their thing and not feel we have to convey an agenda. I am hoping it can continue for many years.” Alec Berg, Silicon Valley: ‘One thing we know is that failure is generally funnier than success’ Alec Berg is the showrunner and an executive producer and director on HBO comedy Silicon Valley, which follows five young techies trying to make their fortune in a startup called Pied Piper. Berg previously worked as a writer on Seinfeld and on Larry David’s Curb Your Enthusiasm and has four Emmy nominations for his writing. Silicon Valley is in its fourth season, and Berg is currently leading the team writing series five, which will air next year. “Every year we start the writing process by saying: ‘What are the big-picture issues in the real Silicon Valley?’ And: ‘How do we get at them?’ We have dealt with gender issues recently. The big one now is privacy. On the one hand, it is easier to steal from reality than make things up. On the other we have to be very photo-real, which takes a lot of research. Silicon Valley is a very different thing from Seinfeld or Curb Your Enthusiasm – and harder to write in that those shows were not serialised. It is pretty unique, I think, to try to create a narrative arc of this length in a comedy show. It is not just a day in the life. This is about people who are trying to accomplish something and the big question is, can they accomplish this thing without selling their soul? Every episode has to be a step along that journey. On Seinfeld there was no writers’ room. Every writer would sit in their own office and work on their own episode. And then you would run it by Larry [David] and Jerry [Seinfeld] and they would say, ‘more of this’, or ‘steer clear of that, someone else is writing the same thing’. On Silicon Valley we have 10 or so writers in the room. We generally all outline together. Then one writer will pick an outline and write a draft. Then the rewriting of that draft is done in smaller groups. You can’t rewrite with 10 people. It’s usually me and the writer and one or two others. It is a fact of life that whatever you are writing expands to fill the time you have. If we had six months to do one episode, it wouldn’t be enough time. It’s never enough time. The maddening thing is that until you have a deadline, psychologically, it is impossible to make good decisions. You’re never done, but it gets to the point where this is as good as we can make it in the time that we have. In that sense with Silicon Valley, it is always: anything we have that works goes in. I have never heard anyone say, ‘That’s great! Let’s keep it on the shelf for next year.’ In season one there was that great thing where you could say, ‘Maybe this is the show, maybe that is the show.’ ‘Put this in, this can be the show!’ But the more you do it, the less freedom you have. It becomes more: ‘That’s not the show, that’s not how we do it.’ One thing we know is that failure is generally funnier than success. Every once in a while, we get to the point in the story where the guys in the show have a big win, and then we sit down and say: ‘Let’s write three episodes where things are going great for them.’ And we just can’t do it. It is too boring for the audience. The audience is invested in the characters and wants them to succeed, but if they do succeed, it is not interesting. My own curse is I now have 25 years of ideas I can’t use. I don’t think I am any better at coming up with good ideas, but I am better at knowing what bad ideas are. I used to think a third of what I wrote was pretty good, now it is about a 10th. Quite often the only way we know something works is that we have written every other possible version of it and it works better than the other things. Even then you are not sure. We are writing things now that won’t air for nine months. Some things are funny now, but won’t be so funny in nine months. Just occasionally the exact right thing comes along at the right time. One of the strange things about this format is writing without an ending. The first four seasons on Silicon Valley, we pointed the boat out into the middle of the ocean and set sail. We are now starting to have conversations about where we are headed. Season five doesn’t feel like the end, but season six or season seven might. Season five is about half done. We start shooting at the end of October. And then there is constant rewriting of the stuff we are shooting. We never have any idea of what the last two or three episodes will be. In that sense, you can never escape this thing. The shooting crew comes in for three months, and they are kind of nomads, going from one thing to the next. They will often ask me what I am working on next. I will say: ‘I’m working on this. Just on this. I do this all the time.’”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/21/catalan-leader-accuses-spain-of-violating-rights-in-referendum-row","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T16:51:17Z","webTitle":"Catalan leader accuses Spain of violating rights in referendum row","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/21/catalan-leader-accuses-spain-of-violating-rights-in-referendum-row","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/21/catalan-leader-accuses-spain-of-violating-rights-in-referendum-row","fields":{"headline":"Catalan leader accuses Spain of violating rights in referendum row","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The regional president of Catalonia has accused the Spanish government of acting “beyond the limits of a respectable democracy” and violating fundamental rights as it strives to prevent an independence referendum from being held in 10 days’ time. Writing in the Guardian a day after Spanish Guardia Civil officers raided regional government buildings and arrested 14 senior officials, Carles Puigdemont insisted the vote would go ahead as “ballot boxes and a peaceful attitude” are the only weapons left to those who want independence. “Catalan home rule has effectively been suspended due to this anti-democratic attitude from the Spanish government,” he wrote. “It’s a situation that harks back to the dark past of this country, when democracy was not a part of the Spanish dictionary. What is happening here in Catalonia would not happen anywhere else in the European Union.” Puigdemont said requests for negotiations with the Madrid government had been ignored dozens of times, and the Spanish executive was refusing to entertain any dialogue on the issue. “Instead of engaging in discourse, the Spanish government has opted for police and judges, taking us beyond the limits of a respectable democracy,” he wrote. “With the arrests of high-ranking officials and threats to detain democratically elected politicians, I believe the Spanish government has violated the European charter of fundamental rights.” However, despite his assertion that the Spanish government was deliberately targeting officials, Wednesday’s arrests were ordered by a judge in Barcelona and not by anyone in Madrid. Puigdemont’s accusations came as Catalonia’s regional vice-president, Oriol Junqueras, admitted the arrests – and the seizure of almost 10m ballot papers – had changed “the state of play”. “The circumstances today are different because a significant part of our team, half of the economics team, has been arrested,” he said. “That [the referendum] cannot be held in the circumstances that we wanted is obvious.” The arrests led to about 40,000 people taking to the streets of Barcelona on Wednesday night. On Thursday, thousands of people gathered outside the Catalan high court to demand the release of the arrested officials. Some waved Catalan independence flags and chanted: “We will vote!” Jordi Sànchez, president of the leading independence organisation the Catalan National Assembly (ANC), told the crowds: “We will be here, peacefully but present, until all of the arrested walk out free.” Malena Palau, a 21-year-old student, said she and her fellow protesters were not afraid and wanted to exercise their democratic freedoms in the referendum. “We want to vote because we have the right to decide, regardless of what we vote,” she told the Associated Press. In a TV address on Wednesday night, the Spanish prime minister warned Puigdemont and others to stop chasing the “chimera” of a referendum. “Don’t go ahead,” Mariano Rajoy said. “Go back to the law and democracy.” The Spanish finance minister, Luis de Guindos, said fresh negotiations on securing Catalonia a better deal could be held if the independence movement agreed to cancel the referendum. “Once independence plans are dropped, we can talk,” he told the Financial Times. Rajoy’s government has repeatedly vowed to prevent the vote from taking place, arguing that any referendum on Catalan independence would be illegal because Spain’s 1978 constitution makes no provision for a vote on self-determination. The constitutional court has suspended a referendum law that was pushed through the Catalan parliament a fortnight ago and is investigating whether the law breaches the constitution. It has also warned Catalan officials that they could be fined up to €12,000 (£10,500) a day if they carry on organising the vote. Puigdemont and his fellow independence campaigners maintain that Catalonia has a right to self-determination and argue their unilateral referendum is justified and will be legally binding. But the Venice Commission – a panel of experts who advise the Council of Europe on constitutional law – has told Puigdemont that the referendum would have to be carried out “in agreement with the Spanish authorities … and in full compliance with the constitution and the applicable legislation”. The Spanish government has recently stepped up its efforts to head off the vote by launching a crackdown on the regional government’s finances, limiting new credit and requiring central supervision for payment of non-essential services. On Tuesday the Guardia Civil confiscated referendum documents from the offices of a private delivery firm in the Catalan city of Terrassa. More than 1.5m referendum leaflets and posters have also been seized. The interior ministry has cancelled leave for all the Guardia Civil and national police officers tasked with stopping the vote. Thursday also saw an intervention from the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, whose Scottish National party lost a 2014 independence referendum agreed with the British government. Sturgeon called for dialogue between the two sides, saying it was preferable to the sight of police officers confiscating ballot papers. “It is of course entirely legitimate for Spain to oppose independence for Catalonia, but what I think is of concern anywhere is for a state to seek to deny the right of a people to democratically express their will,” she said. “The right of self-determination is an important international principle, and I hope very much that it will be respected in Catalonia and everywhere else.” Although more than 70% of Catalonia’s 7.5 million people are in favour of holding a referendum, surveys suggest they are fairly evenly split on the issue of independence. A survey two months ago showed 49.4% of Catalans were against independence while 41.1% were in favour. More than 80% of participants opted for independence in a symbolic vote three years ago, although only 2.3 million of Catalonia’s 5.4 million eligible voters took part."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/sep/27/autoeurope-car-hire-customers-turned-away","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T06:00:26Z","webTitle":"Motorists left high and dry by AutoEurope if they are delayed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/sep/27/autoeurope-car-hire-customers-turned-away","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/sep/27/autoeurope-car-hire-customers-turned-away","fields":{"headline":"Motorists left high and dry by AutoEurope if they are delayed","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Three readers who booked holiday car hire through the online broker AutoEurope turned up at the rental desk to find that not only had their vehicle been given to someone else, but they also were not entitled to their money back. EC of Mitcham, Surrey, paid AutoEurope £401 to hire a car from a rental firm called Fox in Turkey. Her flight to Dalaman was two hours late and when she arrived at the airport rental desk she was told her contract had been cancelled and was non-refundable. “I rang AutoEurope and was told that the terms and conditions stated that the car could not be held if a customer was more than an hour late and there was nothing they could do about it. I had no choice but to find a last-minute alternative. And because the cost was high and my budget low, I could hire a car only for three days instead of three weeks. I am a single mother and had been saving up for this holiday for three years, but it was spoiled because of AutoEurope’s unreasonable T&amp;Cs.” Londoner FH also used AutoEurope to hire a car on the Greek island of Kefalonia. The vehicle, provided by hire firm Green Motion, cost £318. “When I filled out the booking form I had to give the flight number and estimated time of arrival. I put down British summer time by mistake, which was two hours behind Greek time. When we arrived at the airport hire desk we were told the car had been held for an hour and that no other car was available. We had to get a taxi to our destination, which cost us £50. All AutoEurope offered to do was organise another car that, if I wanted it immediately, would cost £2,700, or £700 if I could wait a week. Two days later I found an alternative provider myself and paid £300.” FoS from London booked an Alamo car via AutoEurope for a holiday in France and pre-paid £159. He and his wife were delayed on their journey and arrived at the rental desk at Avignon TGV train station two hours later than planned. He was told the booking was invalid and that he would have to fork out for a new booking if he wanted a car. “The terms and conditions on the hire voucher state that ‘Auto Europe does not refund any unused days if the customer does not show up, shows up late or returns the vehicle early’. Nowhere was it specified what ‘late’ meant. Although the voucher stated that the T&amp;Cs would ‘vary by country’ there was no link to Alamo’s T&amp;Cs. Its website does not provide T&amp;Cs, nor does it mention that customers will lose their money if they arrive later than the specified booking time.” This essential caveat is not mentioned in the pick-up information on the rental voucher, nor under “Important notice to make your car rental a smooth experience”. Only in the small print on the third page does it state that unused days are not refunded if a customer shows up late and you are not referred to the supplier’s T&amp;Cs to find out what “late” means. Legally, the vagueness and the lack of prominence of such key information could make it unenforceable. AutoEurope tells me it’s difficult to find T&amp;Cs that fit with the hundreds of suppliers it deals with worldwide, and that even the same brand names operate differently across countries. “The term ‘late’ is hard to define without going into great detail,” says a spokesperson. “The general industry standard is to hold on to the car for two hours. If the client’s flight number is provided on the booking it is also standard for the rental company to check flight delays before selling the car to another client.” Some companies, such as Green Motion and Alamo, only receive the booking money from AutoEurope once the customer collects the car, which means they are more likely to hire it out to someone else to avoid being left out of pocket if the original customer is late. After being contacted by The Observer, AutoEurope has decided that it could be more sensitive to circumstances when a customer is only a couple of hours late, so it has refunded all three rental fees in full, plus FH’s taxi fare. The company also says that it is taking legal advice on how to make its T&amp;Cs clearer. When collecting a car from an airport always include your flight number in the booking so the hire company will know if you are delayed. If you are held up for any other reason, phone to tell it your new arrival time so your car is held for you.

She has blown her majority, achieved nothing beyond clinging to power, and remains in post only because of a paucity of alternatives in her divided party. So a disunited country has a terrifyingly weak leader as it confronts its biggest challenge since the second world war. On Friday she must try to restore her credibility, so shattered both at home and abroad, with a speech that finally proves she has a precise plan for Brexit. When she stands up in Florence – a city that was once a leading financial centre – she has to find words to unite her feuding party, silence fanatics on the right, soothe the concerns of business and soften the view across Europe that her government still has little idea how to seal Brexit. She needs to shift from shallow slogans that shroud this debate and detail a clear vision for departure that embraces transitional arrangements and future trading relationships. Her task has been made many times tougher by the attention-seeking antics of her foreign secretary. Boris Johnson should have been sacked by now. He has become like a Donald Trump armed with a thesaurus and some knowledge of the classics – a flashy showman with flexible political opinions who, for all his bombastic rhetoric, focuses only on making Boris great. But, despite collateral damage to colleagues, nation and party, this selfish man will conclude that his mission has been accomplished. He’s prepared the ground to resign if needed, amid angry talk of Brexit “betrayal”. As May prepared for her latest speech of a lifetime, equally significant was a blizzard of tweets from Johnson’s ally, Dominic Cummings, campaign director of Vote Leave and widely seen as the strategic brain behind Brexit. These were scathing about “the shambles now unfolding”, which he blamed on the “historic unforgivable blunder” of triggering article 50 too fast and, before adequate preparation. He is right: Britain is in a sorry mess and part of the problem was entering negotiations too soon. Article 50 was designed with a two-year timeframe to deter departures. But, just as with Johnson’s efforts to take back control of his career, Cummings’s intervention implies that everyone else is at fault rather than the architects of this chaos. Such is their arrogant certainty, they brook no compromise. Cummings savaged the more pragmatic Brexit secretary David Davis, cabinet secretary Jeremy Heywood and Philip Hammond, the chancellor striving to protect the economy from the most devastating Brexit impact. Even Whitehall’s human resources machine came under fire. We are seeing arsonists flee a burning building, having set it ablaze. Nigel Farage also talks about “the great Brexit betrayal”. These charlatans will claim it was all ruined by fainthearts. Meanwhile, the likes of Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons who nearly ended up as Tory leader, and Labour’s Kate Hoey lash out at journalists who dare ask questions on withdrawal, making sinister accusations of unpatriotic behaviour to shut down debate. Prepare for more of this self-serving guff as the heat intensifies. Cummings approvingly referenced Otto von Bismarck on revolutions. I have reported on several revolutions and seen a repeated trajectory in which ideals end up engulfed by dark forces. Certainly Britain today feels a far less comfortable and confident nation after last year’s divisive ballot, for all that bravura talk of a glorious new age unleashed by Brexit. Even Johnson has, reportedly, bemoaned losing friends over the referendum. The more apposite Bismarck quote would have been the Iron Chancellor’s remark that people never lie as much as during a war or before a vote. We have just seen the shameless foreign secretary revive the risible claim that Brexit will give the NHS a £350m-a-week boost, ignoring official rebuke. “Why does he need to resurrect this?”, I was asked by one leave minister. “It was not true at the time and it’s not true now.” The answer is simple: it resonated more than any other issue, even immigration, in last year’s depressing debate. These people are playing games with other people’s prosperity. They won the referendum by exploiting mistrust for politicians, and their legacy will be a weakened economy that makes it harder to address inequalities or build houses. They are also corroding their tortured party’s base in business and among younger voters, and probably handing the next election on a plate to Jeremy Corbyn, unfettered by Brussels. The challenge facing an impotent prime minister is immense. May must choose whether to side with people such as Johnson, who preach nationalism yet show conceited contempt for fellow citizens and colleagues, or find a path through the morass they created that lessens the damage by retaining fluid and open relationships with our allies. Cummings has come clean and admitted Brexit is leading to an “unnecessary shambles”. Yet as the rats desert their sinking ship, they absolve themselves of any blame for the debacle. • Ian Birrell is a former speechwriter for David Cameron"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/21/catalonia-bloack-catalonia-referendum-rights-mariano-rajoy-carles-puigdemont","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T13:11:38Z","webTitle":"Spain’s attempt to block Catalonia’s referendum is a violation of our basic rights | Carles Puigdemont","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/21/catalonia-bloack-catalonia-referendum-rights-mariano-rajoy-carles-puigdemont","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/21/catalonia-bloack-catalonia-referendum-rights-mariano-rajoy-carles-puigdemont","fields":{"headline":"Spain’s attempt to block Catalonia’s referendum is a violation of our basic rights","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Democracy has been under a lot of pressure in Catalonia for the past few weeks. European values, civil rights, freedom of speech, freedom of information and freedom of assembly are being violated by Spain’s central government, which has sent the police to search newspapers, printing companies and private mail services; ban political meetings; seize referendum material; and threaten to imprison democratically elected politicians. On Wednesday, this moved up a gear, when threats became reality and Spanish paramilitary police took Catalonia to a de facto state of emergency. Fourteen high-ranking government officials were arrested as part of the anti-referendum operation, as police raided government buildings, offices and private homes. Catalan home rule has effectively been suspended due to this anti-democratic attitude from the Spanish government. It’s a situation that harks back to the dark past of this country, when democracy was not a part of the Spanish dictionary. What is happening here in Catalonia would not happen anywhere else in the European Union. We have arrived at this unacceptable situation after asking Madrid for political dialogue dozens of times, and each time being rejected by the Spanish executive, which has consistently refused to discuss Catalonia’s future. But a healthy democracy needs dialogue in order to evolve. Instead of engaging in discourse, the Spanish government has opted for police and judges, taking us beyond the limits of a respectable democracy. With the arrests of high-ranking officials and threats to detain democratically elected politicians, I believe the Spanish government has violated the European charter of fundamental rights. The EU itself is built on these values and is committed to guaranteeing the rights proclaimed in the charter and in the EU treaties. As an EU member state, Spain should respect that. If not, it is the European commission’s duty to intervene. The rule of law is accepted across Europe as the guarantee of our rights, but the Spanish president, Mariano Rajoy, is twisting our law to suit his own political ends in blocking the referendum. Spain’s constitution was introduced to cement democracy after Franco’s dictatorship, but this government is exploiting its wording as a means to deny us our right to vote. Catalan citizens are peaceful, European and open-minded, we want to contribute to better international and European governance. The crackdown on our attempts to achieve a democratic process is alien to the way that we both think and act. Our response has been peaceful, despite the heavy-handed tactics from central government, putting democracy and good humour at the forefront. All we want is to carry out the greatest expression of a free democracy, and vote on Catalonia’s future. This is not about independence, it is about fundamental civil rights, and the universal right of self-determination. We have only arrived at this crisis due to aggressive tactics employed by Rajoy over the past seven years. In 2010, the Spanish constitutional court annulled a large part of the Catalan statute of autonomy negotiated between Catalonia and the previous prime minister, José Luis Zapatero. This demolished one of the main agreements achieved during the Spanish transition to democracy – Catalonia’s recovery of self-governance. The ruling by the court – whose current president is a former activist for Rajoy’s conservative Popular party – showed contempt for the legitimacy of the statute of autonomy, which had been approved by both the Catalan and Spanish parliaments, and also by the Catalan citizens through a referendum. More than a million people marched against this annulment in Barcelona in July 2010. Since then, millions more Catalan citizens have taken peacefully to the streets in defence of self-rule and the right to decide on their political future. No longer will we compromise on our desire for a referendum. We won’t give up on it. Catalans will exercise their right to decide in the 1 October referendum – whatever the actions of central government. We call on the international community to stand with Catalonia in its defence of democracy and true European values.

On the basis of my observations, can I share with you my impressions of what’s happening in secondary education? The story starts with Pisa-envy: the misplaced view that the international Pisa tables represent a useful and valid way to compare education systems, and that politicians should command a country to fit the Pisa worldview. We’ve seen ministers slaver over Chinese Pisa results as if these were a true representation of the full range of Chinese schools, rather than a highly selective one. Then, ignoring the fact that an education system will always reflect and help construct society as a whole, ministers talk as if they want to bolt the Chinese way on to our system. Have they suddenly become fans of Chinese Communism? Are they just using Pisa as a way of peddling their own highly hierarchical views of what education here should be, or do they really believe that the failings of British capitalism depend on the school curriculum rather than decades of chronic underinvestment? It was this atmosphere that led us to the “knowledge-rich curriculum”, the move to stuff syllabuses with more facts. The principle here is that knowing more facts makes you cleverer. This is a debate about whether children can think conceptually with a few rather than many facts, and indeed whether a fact-rich education will enable children to think conceptually later on. What this debate doesn’t handle is what happens to the children for whom the new curriculum is too much and too difficult. The obsessive-compulsive behaviour around the new grading system for GCSEs (using numbers rather than letters) does little more than distinguish the highest fliers from the high flyers. Is there a social need for this? Do the great problems of today’s society – poverty, inequality and personal debt – cry out for a reform that distinguishes tiny percentage differences between top-performing pupils, while hundreds of thousands of students below the line are treated as collateral damage? All this is directly affecting teachers, children and parents. Statistics can’t express the boredom and stress produced by a curriculum that is pushing the GCSE syllabus down from years 10 and 11 into years 7 and 8. Older siblings look at what younger children are struggling with and say: “We didn’t do that till year 10.” The notion of attainment has become entangled with time, as if doing well at school must mean doing well early and quickly. What’s the hurry? Which bit of education theory tells us that every child benefits from the educational equivalent of panic-buying? A minority do, of course, but for the others, what are the side-effects of the humiliation of years of feeling “I can’t learn all this”? This question is hard to answer because of both the told and untold statistics on exclusion. We know exclusions are going up, but anyone working in schools hears over and over again stories of covert selection or “dumping”: schools quietly losing pupils from individual exams or altogether, so their league table position is not threatened by too many “fails”. Let’s say it clearly: thousands of secondary pupils are being junked and a good deal of it is invisible. More collateral damage. Occasionally, people in your position have made political hay by saying that they were interested in the “attainment gap”. Scenarios have been painted of hordes of illiterate children turning into drug addicts and criminals unless a new government came in and kicked teachers and pupils up the backside. This is not the message of the moment, though, is it? Exclusion means selection and when you knit that in with the steady creep towards selective admission into secondary schools, you have a built-in disregard for the attainment gap. Rather, it cements it and honours it. Should you or anyone in your team resurrect concern for this gap I, for one, would point the finger at the raft of overt and covert methods at work that create the gap through the school system itself. I’m worried. Are you?

Her craven quest for trade deals suggests not","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Theresa May has used the 2017 UN general assembly to renew her campaign against slavery, and marked this with the publication of a call to action that has so far been endorsed by 37 nations. While focusing principally on the criminal justice response, May’s plan to end forced labour, modern slavery and human trafficking contains some important new departures for the UK government. It recognises the need for governments to act proactively, in partnership with business, to exclude slavery and forced labour from national economies and promote decent work. It acknowledges the importance of better protection for groups that suffer discrimination and migrants. And it underlines the value of proper engagement in the struggle by humanitarian and development workers. These elements echo the charter published by Anti-Slavery International in July and endorsed by leading civil society and trade union campaigners, including the UN special rapporteur on slavery, Urmila Bhoola. It is a considerable achievement for the UK to have obtained so many endorsements. For many governments the issues raised are contentious. For example, one signatory, Qatar, persists with kafala, a system of tied visas that effectively empowers unscrupulous employers to enslave tens of thousands of migrant south Asian construction and domestic workers, most notoriously perhaps those involved in the needlessly bloody preparations for the 2022 World Cup. The UK’s own overseas domestic worker visa similarly endangers migrants to Britain, yet May has remained obdurate in the face of proposals for reform, not least the recommendations of an independent review established by her department when she was home secretary. It seems a lacuna in May’s thinking that her own policies could create the risks of enslavement to which many fall victim. It is doubly unfortunate because the risks are not limited to domestic workers. In spite of May’s exhortation to identify and protect trafficking victims, introducing the offence of illegal working in the 2016 Immigration Act renders them more vulnerable to prosecution and deportation. The pending lunacy of Brexit, and May’s bizarre insistence on not being subject to the jurisdiction of the European court of justice, poses a threat to security and law enforcement cooperation across Europe, including anti-trafficking policing. And May’s antipathy to the European court of human rights, one of the towering British achievements of the post-second world war period, sends a deeply unhelpful message to countries that have subjected themselves to the scrutiny of international courts and have had to strengthen their anti-slavery efforts as a result. May’s favoured approach to modern slavery is rescue by means of law enforcement. This is important component, but we cannot prosecute our way out of an issue so deeply embedded in so much of the international political economy. There is an urgent need to empower those vulnerable to slavery and focus on protecting the most basic human rights. Overseas workers in the UK, Qatar and Saudi Arabia must be protected from physical or sexual assault, and be able to leave their jobs, without risk of homelessness and destitution. Construction workers in Qatar and the rest of the Middle East must have the right to form democratic unions to obtain and keep decent work. Children, particularly girls, must have access to appropriate, high-quality education that empowers them and diminishes the risk of enslavement. Dalits in Asia must have the full protections of rule of law. From brick kilns to garment factories, no industry should turn a blind eye to the slavery and exploitation that have become endemic. Forced marriage must be repudiated as a fundamental assault on the most basic rights of women and girls and the bedrock of the misogynistic depredations of the likes of Saudi Arabia, Islamic State and Boko Haram. Leadership in this struggle demands that the fundamental causes of slavery are confronted. Many touch profoundly upon the way nations choose to organise their societies. Some countries seem to have built their competitive economic advantage on the enslavement of migrant workers or despised groups within their own citizenry. The UK’s call to action could be an important beginning in the struggle against slavery. But it could also be a false dawn, because it is difficult to see how the UK can continue to provide leadership in the struggle against slavery when, rather than challenge other nations on fundamental anti-slavery reform, Brexit renders Britain an abject supplicant in a craven search for trade deals with some of the worst offenders."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2017/sep/23/top-10-autumn-weekend-breaks-in-british-uk-countryside-hotels","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T06:00:08Z","webTitle":"Top 10 autumn breaks in the UK countryside","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/sep/23/top-10-autumn-weekend-breaks-in-british-uk-countryside-hotels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/sep/23/top-10-autumn-weekend-breaks-in-british-uk-countryside-hotels","fields":{"headline":"Top 10 autumn breaks in the UK countryside","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Romney Marsh, Kent There’s not a great deal to look at. But that’s why you come to the marsh, to marvel at the absence not only of city clutter but features of any kind. Save for hawthorn bushes. And sheep. And the ghosts of old smugglers. For all that, it invites autumn exploration – of villages, such as St Mary’s in the Marsh, where children’s author E Nesbit lies in the churchyard beneath a wooden grave marker carved by her husband, or the Royal Military Canal (which isn’t an ounce as pompous as it sounds), sliding past pretty Appledore. There’s an antiques “barn” at the old station if the weather’s bad. If you’ve a bike, so much the better. The roads are quiet, flat and shielded (sometimes) from the wind by tall hedges. Frogs plop in reed-lined ditches, and ancient churches, spared the clunk of the Victorian age, are cool and spare like beach-bleached wood. St Thomas à Becket at Fairfield could vie for prettiest small church in England were it not so modest. St Dunstan at Snargate once reeked of smugglers’ tobacco. When you tire of the inland sea of bare fields and ewe-y pastures, crunch along the gravel at Dungeness, or run up and down the dunes at Camber. Or head to Dymchurch, celebrated as the home of the fictional smuggling vicar, Dr Syn. Maudlin and down at heel? Or evocatively out-of-the-way. You’ll be spoiled for pubs. Visiting the tiny Red Lion at Snargate (opposite the church) is like stepping back in time. Rye’s Globe in the Marsh is state-of-the-art “gastro”. Where to Stay The Marsh isn’t replete with fancy hotels, but Romney Bay House (doubles from £95 B&amp;B) at Littlestone has always intrigued me. Tom Blass, author of The Naked Shore: Of the North Sea (Bloomsbury, £20) St Mary’s Vale, near Abergavenny, Monmouthshire St Mary’s Vale is an exquisite National Trust woodland above Abergavenny, on the edge of the Black Mountains. The sessile oaks that carpet the steep sides of this valley have grown into a host of extraordinary shapes. While a few trees have attempted to grow straight, the vast majority abandoned that long ago and have taken on strange, twisted forms, with branches at irregular heights in unpredictable directions. There are trunks with giant, bulbous growths and branches which have grown out horizontally before collapsing back to the ground. The carpet of leaves and liverworts, the uprooted mangled trees and the electric green moss that coats many of the branches combine to mesmeric, magical effect. This type of woodland, known as Atlantic or western oak wood, is characteristic of western Britain. Conservationists prize the rare species of lichen and moss often found in these damp woods. St Mary’s Vale is stunning in autumn, when chinks appear in the leaf canopy and light falls in ethereal shafts. Sometimes, particularly if I am walking downhill fast, the dappled light plays tricks and I sense that these gnarled, misshapen trees are moving, and closing in on me: when I stop, they stop, like some supernatural version of grandmother’s footsteps. A walk from the small car park just beneath the wood around St Mary’s Vale only takes an hour or so. To make an afternoon of it, continue up beyond the oak trees on to the moorland and climb Sugar Loaf, the iconic, southernmost peak of the Black Mountains, originally known by the more enigmatic Welsh name, Mynydd Pen-y-fâl. From the summit, the views over the Usk valley and the sculpted heights of the Brecon Beacons are superb. On the way back through St Mary’s Vale, follow the stream called Nant Iago, which is lined with alders. Where to Stay The Angel Hotel (doubles from £95 room only) is at the heart of Abergavenny life. There is an excellent bakery next door, owned by the hotel, for picnic supplies. Robert Penn, author of Woods: A Celebration, published by the National Trust Powerstock Common, Dorset Autumn leans across the limestone prow of Eggardon Hill. Shadows lengthen, hawthorn rusts, fieldfares search the cooling land. From the dazzle of the sea (250 metres below) come the updrafts that buzzards ride. Up here, bronze age barrows lie within an iron age hill fort, as do the humped remains of trees that 18th-century gangster Isaac Gulliver planted on the seaward rump as a navigation aid for ships smuggling booty. To the north, Eggardon drops suddenly towards a valley of oaks. These trees are the remnants of Poorstock Royal Forest, which King John acquired in 1208, along with a castle (north-west along King’s Lane) rumoured to be the grounds of Athelstan’s palace. Occasionally, if the wind is right, you might catch the long, yearning call of deer rutting below in Powerstock Common. In 1217, the Forest Charter gradually improved rights of access to all royal forests and the Common of Poorwood was established to allow locals to graze animals and gather firewood. These rights were lost in 1867, when the land was enclosed, but Powerstock Common is open to the public again today, managed as a nature reserve by the Dorset Wildlife Trust, who have nurtured a wonderful mosaic of scrub, grassland, wood and coppice. is a very special place, whatever time of year you explore. An old railway line that once ran to the sea at West Bay makes for easy walking or cycling to the villages of Powerstock, Nettlecombe and Kingcombe. But there is so much life see, hear and enjoy in the different habitats of the Common itself, there’s no need to amble far. Though for food try the excellent Brassica in nearby Beaminster, and for drink the Spyway Inn near Eggardon is a free house with lots of local ales and ciders. Where to Stay The Store (sleeps 2, from £400 a week, shorter breaks also available) is a self-catering barn in Toller Fratrum, a hamlet that was once the farmstead of the Knights Hospitallers and whose history stretches beyond Domesday. The Marquis of Lorne (doubles from £80 B&amp;B) is a 16th-century inn with rooms in Nettlecombe. Adrian Cooper, director of the arts and environmental charity Common Ground and co-producer of Arcadia, which premieres at the London Film Festival in October Dartmoor and the Tamar Valley Going to this part of the country is all about being outdoors in all weather. Autumn is often the best time to be here – the weather can be great and the summer crowds have gone. Whatever outdoor pursuits you’re into, you can do them on Dartmoor – riding, walking or biking. Tamar Trails organises geocaching and tree-surfing (tree-top trails) as well as walking and biking – in the Tamar Valley on the Devon-Cornwall border. My family has always been into fishing. I came here as a child, and have kept on coming. I’ve never caught anything, but it’s about spending time with my dad, and in nature. To be in thigh-deep water – trying not to fall in – watching the river and the landscape, is heaven. The old fishing club we used to go to when we were kids is now the terribly swish Hotel Endsleigh. The teas and gardens are superb. Visiting gardens is also a passion of mine and the area is heaving with amazing ones – the National Trust gardens of Cotehele are beautiful. Obviously, all this outdoor activity makes you hungry. Eating a picnic outdoors works for me – egg mayo sandwiches, and a glass of wine for my dad. Food just tastes so much better outdoors. Head to Tavistock for supplies – there are a few good delis, including Crebers, which has been going for over a century, and a fantastic market. Where to Stay Tavistock House Hotel (doubles from £89 B&amp;B) is a restored townhouse built by the Duke of Bedford around 1820. Out in the wilds, bang slap on Dartmoor, Wydemeet B&amp;B has quiet rooms and a bit of luxury for £125 B&amp;B. Cressida Cowell, author of The Wizards of Once (Hachette, £12.99) Rural Suffolk In Suffolk’s interior it feels as though the tides of modernity, so thorough and erasing elsewhere, came in slowly and only partially, leaving much forgotten and untouched. Amid its cornfields sit sway-backed, timber-framed farmhouses, many painted traditional ochre or Suffolk pink; ruined barns crumble away, roofless and lost in nettles and ivy; and horse ponds dot the fields, dreaming of the days when Suffolk Punches still worked the land. As an agricultural county, Suffolk really is dominated by the cycle of arable crops and, in autumn, after the harvest, you get a glimpse of the landscape laid bare. The country here feels haunted by the past, from the mysterious witch-marks scratched onto East Anglian churches – for instance, at All Saints in Barnadiston – to the flint hag stones gleaned from the fields and now cemented into garden walls. Pull on walking boots and go for a bracing walk in the Waveney Valley; there’s a range at discoversuffolk.org.uk. For lunch, head to the tiny 14th-century Peacock Inn in the pretty village of Chelsworth, which serves superior pub grub and isn’t far from medieval Lavenham, with its higgledy-piggledy half-timbered houses. Where to Stay Imposing Dedham Hall (doubles from £120 B&amp;B) is deep in Constable country, and offers art classes as well as good food and beds. Melissa Harrison, author of Clay and At Hawthorn Time (Bloomsbury). Her new novel, All Among the Barley, will be out next year Kimmeridge, Dorset Come over the ridge and there it is, the gleaming, heart-lifting sea. Then a thin swoop of road descends from the chalk downs to the terrace of rough grass, and the rocky beach curving in a smile. Everything about Kimmeridge is quiet and great. The sea meets the land as it must have done for centuries. Most people potter on the beach, or climb the cliffs and follow the coastal path to the Clavell Tower, a 19th-century wedding cake of a folly. I walk east around the bend, and pick over rocks to some lovely flat pavements that run into the shallow sea. Cut by crisscrossing straight lines, the rocks are mysterious and beautiful, and behind them dark cliffs rise in layers of shale and mudstone, containing untold creatures trapped millions of years ago. Walk along for a while. A raven croaks, a kestrel keens. Every so often the cliffs release a shower of shale, which lands on the rocks with a light pattering that mixes with the shush of the waves. A mile away in Kimmeridge village, Clavell’s sells light lunches and cream teas, and across the road the new Museum of Jurassic Marine Life displays the finds of a local plumber, Steve Etches, who has devoted much of his life to fossil-collecting in Kimmeridge Bay. The specimens on show are astonishing, not least for their ferocious dentistry; pair after pair of serrated jaws frozen in a last gape. Back by the sea, on a quiet autumn afternoon, nothing much is happening. The ancient rocks are warm in the sunlight. Little anemones shine like half-sucked boiled sweets, and bouquets of bladderwrack sway with the waves. I sink into a daze. Two paddleboarders glide past, while far at sea is the mirage of a huge ferry. A thin dog splashes by and puts up several oystercatchers, which fly off with loud peeps over the bright water. Where to Stay Kimmeridge Farm House (doubles from £90 B&amp;B) is a three-room B&amp;B built in the 14th-century, with bay views. Christopher Nicholson, author of Among the Summer Snows (September Publishing, £14.99) Crathes Castle Gardens, Deeside There are a thousand places in Deeside that could contend for “favourite” status, places to visit and to walk, glens and waterfalls, nature reserves, forests, rivers – and whisky distilleries if you’re so inclined. The main road from the south winds westwards through the small towns and villages – Banchory, Aboyne, Ballater, Braemar – and on towards the Cairngorms. The district is beautiful in autumn, with the harvest just over, morning mist hovering over the rivers, a few late swifts still darting over the stubble fields as they prepare to leave for the winter. In autumn, I’ll head to Crathes Castle, a 16th-century tower house, particularly to its walled gardens. There I can indulge that delicious autumn melancholy which is also a celebration of the evanescence of the beauty of trees, plants and flowers. On a morning in autumn the visitors, like the swifts, have all but gone and I can wander the flagstone paths alone , my only companions the calling wood pigeons and contentious jackdaws, wind like a stirring finger in the high trees. The bright and strident brilliance of summer is muted; white and purple late crocuses collapse softly into the ground, hydrangeas fade to the colours of old silk, and Virginia creeper blazes against high stone walls. I look out over the fields to the place where, a few years ago, a Mesolithic lunar calendar was excavated and discovered to be possibly the oldest in the world: 12 hollows in perfect alignment with the phases of the moon and midwinter solstice. The perfect warm-up after such a morning walk is a hearty beef and haggis pie at the Boat Inn in Aboyne. Where to Stay Banchory Lodge Hotel (doubles from £85 B&amp;B) has the Dee on its doorstep. Esther Woolfson, author of Field Notes From a Hidden City (Granta, £16.99) Exmoor coast The Exmoor coast was my home for 13 years and I have a deep love for its moors and craggy coast, unspoiled by campsites and once the haunt of Romantic poets. Autumn is especially lovely: the woods explode with oranges and yellows, the old hedgerows burst with blackberries, and there are deer everywhere, as well as buzzards and badgers. A particular treat is strange and tiny Culbone chapel, a pre-Norman church reached through an oak-filled valley off the A39. A visit to the goat-filled Valley of Rocks is a must: Coleridge and Wordsworth admired its boulders and caverns, and, according to Hazlitt, they almost wrote a poem about it. Another gem is Woody Bay station, from where you can catch a steam train to the next village, Parracombe, home of the Fox &amp; Goose, purveyor of fine food and Exmoor ales. There’s an easy walk from Hunters Inn, a vast pub with rooms, down the valley to the sea at Heddon’s Mouth, where German soldiers landed in the second world war. Then amble along the steep coast to Woody Bay, where you can see the remains of a pier and a brick bathing house, testament to a Victorian attempt to turn the bay into a resort. Where to Stay The Moorlands Hotel has reasonably priced rooms (doubles from £90 B&amp;B). Tom Hodgkinson, founder and editor of The Idler West Penwith, Cornwall Beyond Penzance is west Penwith, the last granite lump of Cornwall and its strangest and most evocative region. From Mousehole, walk west along the cliffs to Land’s End and you feel as if you’re treading a narrow path to the edge of the world. Another day or two’s walking will take you round the coast to St Ives and the newly reopened Tate St Ives. En route, in St Just, visit the Jackson Foundation Gallery for the wonderfully powerful landscapes of Kurt Jackson. Autumn in Cornwall divides between still, high-pressure days of golden light or low-pressure gales. It’s pot luck which you get. Either way, there is no more dramatic place to witness the approach of winter than on this remote stretch of coast. Where to Stay The Old Coastguard Hotel in Mousehole (doubles from £140 B&amp;B). Philip Marsden, author of Rising Ground: A Search for the Spirit of Place (Granta £9.99) County Antrim coastline There is no warmer welcome than a roaring log fire and pint of Guinness in one of the many snug alcoves of the Bushmills Hotel on the north Antrim coast – especially if you’ve just cycled all the way up from Belfast. The Coastal Causeway Route is one of Europe’s most dramatic drives, a rollercoaster road running alongside dizzying cliffs and spectacular beaches – but I think it’s best seen from the saddle of a bike, if the weather is kind. Along the way are a string of villages that make for good stop-offs and refuelling points. From Bushmills, roll down the hill and watch the wild North Atlantic waves batter the basalt stacks at the Giant’s Causeway. This is nature at its most magnificent and raw. If the sun is shining and the wind is behind you, head east to Ballycastle. The views along the way stretch over hedgerows to pastures running down to sandy coves, low-scudding clouds shifting the light and focus all the time. At Ballycastle, stop for a scoop at Morelli’s, the Italian-Irish ice-cream parlour overlooking the harbour. Long before Game of Thrones tourism hit this part of the world, Cushendun was famous for being designed by Clough William-Ellis in 1912. If it looks like a Cornish village, that’s because it was designed to please Lord Cushendun’s wife, Maud, who was from Penzance. It would be rude not to drop in for a pint at Mary McBride’s, a cosy, traditional pub that you may find it difficult to extract yourself from. Then push on to Carnlough, where the Londonderry Arms – once owned by Winston Churchill – serves a warming bowl of chowder with wheaten bread, as well as afternoon teas. It’s also a good place to spend the night, before heading back on yourself the following morning for the glorious strands and gaudy seaside charms of Portrush. Where to stay Magherintemple Lodge in Ballycastle sleeps four from £625 a week (shorter stays available). Doubles from £150 B&amp;B at the Bushmills Hotel and £65 B&amp;B at the Londonderry Arms.

Part of its magic lay in Mother Shipton’s Cave and Petrifying Well: “Mother” herself, a 17th-century crone with (dubious) powers of prophecy, had long vacated. But the cave, on the mossy flanks of the river Nidd, still oozed witchiness. (The well, too, was strangely intoxicating. When I was seven, I gave it a sock. When I was 11, it gave me a concrete boomerang.)Today, greater pleasures are to be had mooching in the avuncular shadow of the arched railway bridge, “taking tea” (or a coronation chicken sandwich) at the Lavender Rooms on Market Place. Best of all is coffee and a slice of cake at the waterside cafe on the Nidd beneath the castle, the ruins of which you have strolled among, arm in arm with your “other”. The view from the castle promises greater pleasures: the improbably formed Brimham Rocks, and the gothic splendour of Fountains Abbey are a short bus ride away. Or, better still, set out into the Yorkshire Dales with an Ordnance Survey map and a sausage roll from Thomas the Baker, and return in time for beer and mussels at Six Poor Folk on Castlegate. (If it’s full, head down a few doors to the Spice Merchant for a curry. It’s autumn after all.) Where to stay Right on the waterfront with great views of the castle and still close to the town centre, Teadrop Cottage (doubles from £95 B&amp;B)has four comfortable rooms and generous breakfasts. Tom Blass, author of The Naked Shore: Of the North Sea (Bloomsbury, £20) Tregaron, Ceredigion You don’t arrive in Tregaron by chance. This tiny market town beneath the Cambrian mountains has to have been your primary destination. Just getting there is part of the pleasure, though: Tregaron is surrounded by some of the remotest and most beautiful countryside in the southern half of Britain. If you drive under blue skies, either via Abergwesyn pass or through the Elan valley and over the russet-coloured hills from Rhayader – a road once called “one of the 10 most scenic drives in the world” by the AA – you won’t forget it. Arriving by bicycle along the Ystwyth Trail, a lovely mix of dismantled railway lines and quiet country lanes winding east from the Irish Sea, is equally memorable. Tregaron may be sleepy today but it was once a bustling agricultural hub, and its charter dates from 1292. For three centuries from the late 1500s, the town was a major centre for drovers who herded sheep, geese and cattle on long-distance routes to London. On the square today, a craft shop sells jewellery handmade from Welsh gold and paintings by local artists. If you’re thinking about winter, visit Jane Beck in Llwyn y Groes to buy a Welsh woollen blanket. Cors Carron, a large “raised bog” just outside Tregaron, is a nationally important habitat full of rare flora and fauna. There is a bird hide, and raised walkways from which you could catch sight of otters, adders, hen harriers and polecats. For yet more fresh air, visit the Hafod Estate, once home to Thomas Johnes, a farmer, writer and social benefactor. From 1780, he ran an experimental farm here, building houses and schools and planting some four million larch, Scots pine, oak and beech trees over 30 years. The stately home fell down in the early 20th century but his picturesque landscape is still evident. Where to stay Where there was a drover, there was usually a pub and Y Talbot, on Tregaron’s main square, is a cracker, with recently refurbished rooms (doubles from £120 B&amp;B). Legend has it there’s an elephant buried in the back garden. Robert Penn, author of Woods: A Celebration (Pavilion Books, £20) Bridport, Dorset Bridport’s nonconformist history lingers in the spirit of independence and sense of community in this small market town. The distinctive architecture has, since the 13th century, been shaped by the making of ropes for naval and fishing fleets. Wide, welcoming South Street, where the rope was dried, lends the town an openness and is the setting for busy markets on Wednesday and Saturday, accompanied by live bands in Bucky Doo Square. The narrow “walks”– where the rope was spun – lead today into nooks and alleys where independent shops, artists’ studios and a vintage quarter thrive. There’s more to Bridport’s cultural life than TV drama Broadchurch. Plug into the local music scene at The Ropemaker’s and Beach &amp; Barnicott. The Community Orchard hosts an October Apple Day and wassailing events. The Electric Palace, where local musicians Billy Bragg and PJ Harvey have played, is a Bridport institution. It used to generate its own electricity when it opened as an opera house in 1926, and has original art deco murals. The Arts Centre goes from strength to strength, while the Lyric, at the other end of town, hosts occasional experimental theatre and brilliant shows for children. Books are also part of the town’s fabric, from the treasures of Bridport Old Books and Wild and Homeless to the Bridport Literary Festival, which hosts talks in venues across town from 4-12 November. For food, Dorshi offers east Asian cuisine using local products, such as pork, leek and ginger dumplings (£5.75) to noodles and pork belly (£13); the Red Brick Cafe serves anything from a fried egg sandwich to falafel and salad; and Soul Shine also has a wide range, from vegan breakfast (£9.50) to warm Moroccan chicken salad (£10). Where to stay The boutiquey Bull Hotel (doubles from £85 B&amp;B) or arty B&amp;B Number 27 (doubles from £120). Adrian Cooper, director of arts and environmental charity Common Ground, and coproducer of Arcadia, premiering at the London Film Festival in October Oban, Argyll and Bute Oban, on Scotland’s west coast, is a jewel of a town. There are no big hotels, just lots and lots of B&amp;Bs and tiny guesthouses. It’s also full of quirky little shops, including my favourite outdoorsy shop, Nancy Blacks. There’s a great cheese and wine place, a chocolate shop, and no end of cut-price cashmere places. Up on the hill is a remarkable Victorian folly, McCaig’s Tower, which looks just like the colosseum, and was built by a philanthropist to keep the area’s stonemasons in work. There is an amazing view of the bay from up there. If it’s wet, and you have small people to entertain, there’s always the Sea Life Sanctuary – it has saved my bacon on several occasions. But for me the town is all about the islands. Oban can be used as a base to explore Mull, Iona and Ulva, and smaller, lesser-known islands like Muck, Eigg and Rum, Coll and Tiree. There are fishing and whale watching excursions, and boats to Fingal’s Cave on Staffa. I’m usually on the hunt for food, and Oban is great for the freshest fish: try the Waterfront Fishouse Restaurant. For a quick bite, crab sandwiches from Oban Seafood Hut on the CalMac pier are to die for. Where to stay The Manor House Hotel (manorhouseoban.com) has cosy rooms and is a stone’s throw from the ferry terminal to the islands of the Inner Hebrides. Cressida Cowell, author of The Wizards of Once (Hachette, £12.99) Hexham, Northumberland I fell in love with Northumberland when I was writer-in-residence at its literary festival in autumn 2015. It’s a criminally under-visited county: those who pass through on the way to Scotland miss out on breathtaking upland landscapes, dark skies and warm hospitality. The market town of Hexham is the jewel in the county’s rugged crown. Its abbey has an excellent, child-friendly interactive display about its history, and an Anglo-Saxon crypt. The twice-monthly farmer’s market is a foodie’s dream, with produce from a 50-mile radius. Culturally Hexham is vibrant, with its literary festival and events at Queen’s Hall arts centre. This autumn there’s classical dance drama from Kerala, music from Quebec, A Midsummer Night’s Dream danced by Ballet Cymru, a bold production of Antigone, philosophy lectures and kids’ events. And it’s a short drive or bus ride from Hexham to Hadrian’s Wall, making it easy to walk a section and be back the same day. Make time also for a spot of book shopping at Cogito Books on the narrow, cobbled lane of St Mary’s Chare, and a French country-style dinner at Bouchon Bistrot . Where to stay Antique-filled Hexham Town Bed and Breakfast (doubles from £80 B&amp;B) a few minutes from the centre. Melissa Harrison, author of Clay and At Hawthorn Time (Bloomsbury, £16.99). Her new novel, All Among the Barley, will be out next year Salisbury, Wiltshire In a black mood, I visit Salisbury on a shopping trip. I hate shopping, so on my way turn into the church of Saint Thomas. Dim light, quiet air. Peace. The largest of all England’s Doom paintings covers the space above the chancel arch. It dates from the late 15th century, was whitewashed after the Reformation and only recovered in the 19th, but its dramatic message is clear even if the colours are somewhat faded. On the left, angels usher the blessed into heaven; on the right, various devils – one with a punk quiff – cheerily direct the damned into a dragon’s gaping mouth. The damned are naked but look like shoppers. Ha! I recover my equanimity. Salisbury is a small city with a host of minor irritations, among them a hideous, elevated ring road – may those responsible go straight to hell – but many things to like. The cathedral, with its immense spire, is a stupendous feat of the medieval imagination – especially at night, floodlit against a dark sky. The nearby Salisbury Museum has an impressive collection of prehistoric artefacts from the hill forts that once stood on the Wiltshire downs. It’s worth a look if only for the stuffed bustards in the entrance. There are atmospheric old pubs – try the 14th-century Haunch of Venison – and some excellent restaurants. My current favourite, Cafe Diwali, serves Indian food several classes above the average Wiltshire curry. On Tuesdays and Saturdays in the main square market stalls sell fish, fabrics, cheeses, ironmongery, cheap shoes, fat olives and local breads. It could almost win over a shopping-phobe like me. Perhaps the best thing about Salisbury is its homeliness. Not far from the Doom painting, by the library, a footbridge crosses the Avon, and here passers-by often feed bread to swans with hungry black eyes and the most heavenly white plumage. Where to stay The Pembroke Arms (doubles from £75 B&amp;B) in nearby Wilton is an 18th-century ex-coaching inn with nine rooms. Christopher Nicholson, author of Among the Summer Snows (September Publishing, £14.99) Aberdeen Autumn is particularly lovely in Aberdeen: the sight and sense of a northern season, a blaze of brilliance before the dark of winter. Autumn here happens swiftly, overnight. There’s no dramatic fall in temperature after our invariably cool summers but just like that, one morning it’s autumn. It’s there in the first faint scents of wood smoke, the fallen, gilded leaves underfoot, even when the trees still look green. The frantic gull cries of August are replaced by the sounds of the first geese overhead as they arrive from their summer breeding grounds in Iceland and head towards their wintering sites at the Lochs of Strathbeg Skene. The fieldfares and redwings will soon be back. In the centre of this grey city of slate skies and steely sea, the wide streets of granite are lit by glowing sun or swept with gusts of fine, cold rain. Against the greys, autumn dazzles. Leaves of beech and maple turn copper, madder, bronze. Outside the Triple Kirks and the Old Schoolhouse, the intrepid sit with their drinks, shivering only lightly, resisting the dark and cosy warmth of Ma Cameron’s or the Prince of Wales, at least for now. The whale watching season at Torry Battery and Girdleness will soon be over; the bottlenose dolphins, harbour porpoises and minke whales will be gone for another year. In Old Aberdeen, bonfire smoke rises from behind a high wall in the Chanonry near the Botanical Gardens and Arboretum. Another, different kind of migration has brought the students back and the narrow streets and medieval lanes of the university area are busy again with a feeling of earnest expectation. Kilau Coffee in the High Street and the St Machar Bar pub will be crowded again. Autumn, when another year begins. Where to stay The Bauhaus Hotel, (doubles from £65) is as stylish as the name suggests. Esther Woolfson, author of Field Notes From a Hidden City (Granta, £16.99) Richmond, Surrey An easy escape from central London is Richmond – 16 minutes by train from Waterloo. Take a walk to Pen Ponds in Richmond Park to see red deer rutting and get a bacon buttie in the car park cafe. Lounge around on fallen trees, pick up conkers and spot weird ducks. Look out for the mad cyclists: men in Lycra on bicycles have turned the park into a race track, which is a shame. Richmond also has the sweet, sweet Thames, of course. Walk up to the Roebuck pub on Richmond Hill and see the view of the bend in the river that Turner painted. It is the only view in England protected by an act of parliament. Get a boat down the river towards Teddington Lock or hire one by Richmond bridge and be Jerome K Jerome for an hour. Then stroll down through the Terrace Gardens, stopping for tea in the Hollyhock Café. Take the underpass and emerge at the river, then walk towards Petersham Nurseries, a chichi restaurant, cafe and plant shop. You pass gently lowing cows on Petersham Meadows, probably the closest real farm to Piccadilly Circus. A little further along the river is 17th-century Ham House, a National Trust property with a magnificent vegetable garden. From there, catch the foot ferry to Twickenham for £1 (children 50p). Where to stay The Victoria (doubles from £120) is a groovy modern pub 10 minutes’ walk from Richmond Park and 10 minutes’ bus ride from Richmond town centre. Tom Hodgkinson, founder and editor of The Idler Penzance, Cornwall Geologists talk about isostatic change, when land rises following the melting of a glacier. I like to think that something similar happens to Cornwall after the summer. About half a million people are resident in Cornwall, but 10 times that number visit each year, the greater part in the summer and the greater part of those during the school holidays. At the end of August, a great weight is lifted from the county. Lanes and villages are no longer clogged with campervans. The beaches empty. You find yourself having drawn-out conversations with local friends. A certain lightness pervades everything. September and October are the best months in Cornwall. The light has lost its mid-summer haze and the colours are sharper, with the melancholic tinge of the turning leaves. The sea keeps its summer temperatures, and swimming is at its most pleasurable. In Penzance, Jubilee Pool – the largest lido in the country – is staying open until the end of October. Twice a day the tide fills it with sea water and it is a swimming experience like no other. With your hair still wet, you can walk up Chapel Street, with its antique shops, and pop in for a warming drink in the Admiral Benbow pub, then browse the shelves of End of the World Books in nearby Market Jew Street. Walk through the surreally tropical Morrab Gardens to Penlee Gallery for the finest public display of Cornish art. Where to stay Chapel House (doubles from £150 B&amp;B) is a listed Georgian house and former arts club that has been transformed into a boutique hotel with exhibits from Newlyn School of Art. Philip Marsden, author of Rising Ground: A Search for the Spirit of Place (Granta £9.99) Bakewell, Derbyshire I know people from Derbyshire who are a bit sniffy about Bakewell, a tourist honeypot in the Peak District. The cloying sweetness of the Old Original Bakewell Pudding Shop, the naffness of the love locks on the Wye Bridge, the ostentation of Chatsworth House, all those daytrippers … It leaves them cold. But not me. I’ve been coming to the market town ever since I was a youngster and the sight of those unpretentious limestone houses and shops on the run in from Chesterfield still warms my heart. My journey’s end is always the Farmers Feast, a workaday cafe serving the cattle marketeers with tea and full fry-ups on the edge of the showground. From there, I walk over the Wye Bridge – stopping to admire the thumping great rainbow trout in the gin-clear waters below – and into Market Street to pick up supplies at the Bakewell Cheese Shop and Smylies Fruit and Veg. Then it’s off to an industrial estate on the edge of town to fetch beer from the Thornbridge Brewery, which knocks out decent pale ales and cask beers. I first started coming to Bakewell every spring to fish for trout on the Wye – just a couple of miles away at Monsal Head, but isolated in a deep, narrow gorge – only resurfacing in the dusk for a pint and a sandwich at the Monsal Head Hotel at the top of the lane. Years later, I came back in the summers for the Eroica Britannia vintage cycling event, pedalling the repurposed railway lines, tunnels and viaducts of the Monsal Trail that offer glorious views from on high. But autumn is golden time for walking, when blankets of mist drape the valley floors of the Wye and the Derwent. Nestled between the rolling hills of the White Peak and the moors of Dark Peak, there’s good walking in any direction. But an easy circular route follows the meandering Wye down to Haddon (if you’re there before the end of September, stop in at Haddon Hall, a fine medieval manor house) and then on to Over Haddon, which offers spectacular views over Lathkill Dale, and the prospect of a pint at the Lathkill Hotel, which used to serve the local lead miners. There’s nowt twee about any of that, me ducks! Where to stay I usually self-cater a couple of miles out of town at one of the many farms now offering accommodation, such as at Burton Manor Cottages near Over Haddon. But there are plenty of options in town, like the well-appointed Peacock Inn, a 200-year-old coaching inn with rooms (doubles from £119 B&amp;B).

Juventus couldn’t do it either. Nor could Borussia Dortmund, Napoli or Sporting Lisbon. The other Sporting, from Gijón, couldn’t do it. They came from Mexico, Japan, Poland and Cyprus and failed too. Barcelona tried four times but they couldn’t do it. Sevilla and Atlético had five goes each. Nope, no good. Along came Valencia, Deportivo and Celta, Osasuna, Espanyol and Villarreal, but they couldn’t do it and nor could Las Palmas, Eibar, Athletic, Cultural, Granada, Málaga, Alavés or Leganés. Real Betis, on the other hand, could. In fact, on Wednesday night they only went and did something even better. Thirty-five different teams from eight different countries had tried over 73 games and six competitions stretching back almost 18 months and none of them had stopped Real Madrid scoring, but Betis were almost there. There was still time for it to slip away, especially against the team with a thing for agonising late goals and they were nervous but they were near. It was 11.47pm and the scoreboard at the Santiago Bernabéu, like scoreboards everywhere, had stopped on 90 minutes – information denied when it’s most needed. Alongside, it read: Madrid 0-0 Betis. The board went up: five minutes, one last bugle call, a record awaiting, fans screaming at them to pour forward. Victory over Real Sociedad on Sunday extended Madrid’s run of scoring in consecutive games, equalling the record set by Santos in the sixties. Three days later, with Cristiano Ronaldo returning from a five-match ban, they were set to break it. On Tuesday Marca’s front cover ran a picture of Pelé with the headline “O’Rei Madrid”: Madrid the King. Thing is, if you’re going to come for the King you’d better not miss, and Madrid had: Ronaldo had thumped over, Bale had hit the post with a wonderful flicked volley, and Betis goalkeeper Antonio Adán had flown. Twenty-seven shots Madrid had taken. But, Zidane said afterwards, “the ball didn’t want to go in”. Actually, it did. “We had 26, 27 chances,” Zidane said, while Betis’s manager Quique Setién admitted: “They put the ball into our box 20, 25 times.” There were superb saves too and Setién added: “To win here you know you’ll suffer and you know your goalkeeper has to be spectacular: winning here without suffering is a utopia.” But while goalkeeper Adán needed to be spectacular – and on a couple of occasions he really was – while chances were wasted, the siege rarely looked as incisive as expected and, like Madrid’s draw against Levante, it wasn’t as if there were countless chances. Nor were Betis barricaded in – and proof of that came with what happened next. Adán had just made another save, a comfortable one from Borja Mayoral, and the clock was ticking. But he didn’t boot the ball as far as possible and nor did anyone take it to the corner and keep it there. Instead, they played. Before the game, as they gathered in a circle, Betis captain Joaquín Sánchez had appealed for “personality”. “We’re going to defend with the ball,” he said, “and then we’re going to enjoy having it, eh.” As for the manager Setién, he urged them: “Don’t stress; be calm, especially with the ball. Have faith in what you do. Let’s have it, choose well.” His assistant, Eder Sarabia, paced. “We have to reach the end alive; that’s the key. We’ll have chances for sure.” And so it proved. With 92.11 on the clock, something to cling on to, Adán rolled the ball out and it began. Javi García carried it forward. It went left, towards the touchline, inside again, across the middle and over to the other side, back to the middle, and round it went. When it came to Cristian Tello, he dashed toward and spread it to Antonio Barragán. There, on the right edge of the area, Betis outnumbered Madrid. Barragán clipped a lovely ball over to Antonio Sanabria, moving into space near the far post and he headed down into the net, before racing towards the corner flag and skidding to his knees. High, high above him, fans in green and white went wild. All around the rest of the stadium, Madrid’s supporters turned for the exit; 93.20, the clock said, and Betis were in the lead. In a weird sort of way, for all that Madrid sought the goal and a 0-0 draw would have been huge enough for Betis, it had been coming too. They’d had opportunities early, Dani Carvajal clearing one off the line, and even as the game tilted Madrid’s way they protected themselves with possession where they could, and three or four times they had come away cleanly, only to take the wrong decision, misplace a pass, or crash into one-man wall Casemiro. Sometimes, those mistakes put them in trouble and, hearts racing, you could sense fans pleading with them to just put their bloody foot through it. On the touchline, though, the message was different. “You have to be intelligent to have the ball, keep it, make them run, have some calm in moments of tension. In the last 20 minutes you watch them and you can think: ‘How did you miss?’ You see passes that are relatively easy they don’t make. But after all the effort, the running, you can’t ask them to have the same precision as in the fifth minute,” said Setién. What he could ask them to do was keep trying. Betis made changes and saw Víctor Camarasa, their best player until then, forced off just before half-time. Reading the line-up on the Metro, seeing no Sergio Leon, Joaquín or Andrés Guardado, frankly the temptation was to turn back. But they had only gone and done it. Real Betis had become the first team in 74 games to stop Madrid scoring, the record shared, not taken, from Pelé’s Santos, and then they’d scored themselves. They had won at the Bernabéu – the first time anyone other than Barcelona or Atlético had beaten Madrid there in six-and-a-half years and the first time Betis had left with a victory for 19. For Setién, it was a third consecutive game against Madrid without defeat. “Is it going to be a long night?” he was asked. “As long as I like,” he smiled. “It’s only three points but it’s three prestigious points,” said Setién. Three points that will reinforce their identity, too, one that is still being forged. And few coaches have an identity quite so clear cut as his. “In these days when everyone thinks you have to run, fight, work, compete, I ask my players to think,” he added. For Zidane, there was a lot to think about. This was Madrid’s third home game in the league and they have not won any. With a little more luck they could, and probably should, have won all three; the shot count for the three is up near 80; that scoring run surely shows they have no goalscoring crisis. But Madrid do lack a little fluidity and the chances are not always as clear as the stats suggest. The truth is, they don’t look quite right. “At home we’re finding it harder to generate football,” Isco admitted. This night was occasionally chaotic and clarity was rare: at one point they had briefly had 12 men on the pitch because Luka Modric didn’t realise he was the one coming off – and not everyone was happy he was – while Lucas Vázquez twice had to ask Zidane where he was supposed to be. As the ball went forward, it was too often just put into the box. Casemiro said it was “hard to understand” but also suggested they had needed to have a bit more “head”. They also need more points – and fast. It may only be momentary but the damage done is significant. Two draws, against Valencia and Levante, and a defeat against Betis, is their worst start at home in 20 years. Only twice before – in 1969-70 and 1995-96 – have they not won in the opening three games. Worse, it leaves them, in the words of one front cover, “SEVEN POINTS!” behind Barcelona already. It wasn’t supposed to be like that, but it’s like that and that’s the way it is. “That’s football: you have to accept it,” Zidane said. “Maybe last year we won some games we didn’t deserve to: now it’s the other way around.” He also reminded everyone there’s a word he likes even if everyone else doesn’t, one that sums him up: tranquillity. “Should you be worried?” he was asked. “No, I don’t think so,” he replied. Talking points • Vitolo returned to the Sánchez Pizjuán for the first time since he left Sevilla for Atlético, via Las Palmas. Back in the summer, his buy-out clause was paid, releasing him from Sevilla the day after they had announced he was renewing his contract. When Diego Simeone learned he was missing out on his player, he was furious. So was the president of Las Palmas, Miguel Ángel Ramírez. They had both been counting on him and they weren’t about to admit defeat easily, especially not when they learned Vitolo hadn’t actually signed the extension yet. So one night and dozens of phone calls later, Vitolo was on a private plane, his clause paid, and he was off home to Gran Canaria, where he will stay for six months before joining Atlético, while Sevilla stewed, a crisis opening up in their boardroom. Sevilla are a rare club that have normalised departures, but not this one. The president José Castro announced legal action against Vitolo, Las Palmas and Atlético. And the fans were waiting for him on Wednesday, in a game Sevilla won with a late and fortunate goal from Jesús Navas. Someone wrote “traitor” on the side of the bus and there were chants calling Vitolo a “rat” and wishing him death. Every touch was met with whistles and boos. “Every time he had the ball, they fouled him,” said the Las Palmas manager Manuel Márquez. “It’s hard for a human being not to be affected by an entire stadium having a go at him, but some people grow in the face of adversity. I think he’s sad because of the chances missed and because we lost, not for any other reason.” It was, said AS, a “sad day”. And he’ll have to do it all over again later in the season when he comes back with Atlético. • Barcelona beat Eibar 6-1, but here’s the weird thing: Eibar had more shots than the home team did, José Luis Mendilibar’s resigned smile saying it all. Barcelona deserved to win, sure, but not by five goals. Eibar were often impressive, creating chances that suggest there’s still a vulnerability about Barça despite their perfect start. Denis Suárez scored one and Paulinho – useless, worthless, rubbish Paulinho whose signing was a disgrace – got another, the same two men who had scored in Getafe at the weekend. Oh, and Leo Messi got four. That’s 12 so far this season, nine in the league. We’re only five weeks in. • Simone Zaza scored three times in eight minutes for Valencia, happily heading home with the match ball three days after he had been left out against Levante. That day he sat out of the substitutes’ pre-game kickabout and at the end of the match, coach Marcelino had forced him back out to thank the fans. Amidst reports they had fallen out, Zaza returned and got an impressive hat-trick as Valencia beat Málaga – who really weren’t that bad in the first half – 5-0 at Mestalla. “A lot of what’s been said is a lie,” he insisted afterwards. • “New manager, guaranteed victory,” they say, but then they say a lot of things. Alavés went into the post-Zubeldía era with another defeat. This time against Deportivo, who desperately needed the win. • All quiet on the Twitter front. And that’s a good thing for Málaga. But for how long will it last? Twitter parody account holder and Málaga owner Sheik Al-Thani has already called his manager out publicly this season and, frankly, poor old Míchel always looked like a sacking in waiting. But so far, despite another defeat, there has been silence. Which is a welcome miracle in itself. Whether it is lasting is another matter. “I’m not scared of anything,” Míchel said. “Would I understand it if I was sacked? That’s not a question for me. The issue for me is to keep working and raise the morale of the players: they’re human beings and they suffer.” • “This was [Antoine] Griezmann’s best game since the season started,” Simeone said after Atlético won at San Mamés. The Frenchman provided two superb assists (and had two goals ruled out) in a 2-1 win over Athletic, while Jan Oblak saved a penalty from Aritz Aduriz. That’s his sixth from 10 faced with Atlético. In games, that is – even if everyone only remembers Milan and that penalty shoot-out where he hardly moved. “People talk about one game; penalties are a lottery,” the goalkeeper said, not entirely accurately. As for Griezmann, Simeone was raving: “He’s different, he makes us fly.” • It’s on! A Stadium Called Wanda will host the Champions League final in 2019. • And, look out, here come Fuenlabrada: into the Copa del Rey with the big boys for the first time in their history. Results: Valencia 5–0 Málaga, Barcelona 6–1 Eibar, Leganés 0–0 Girona, Athletic 1–2 Atlético, Deportivo 1–0 Alavés, Real Madrid 0–1 Betis, Sevilla 1–0 Las Palmas.

However, they found it difficult in the Spring Series, picking up one win in eight matches, and have already steeled themselves for a battle against relegation.

However, they got back to winning ways in the Spring Series, finishing top on goal difference, and a squad containing Katie Chapman, Gilly Flaherty, Fran Kirby, Eni Aluko and Ji So-yun boasts enviable talent. Finish above them and you will probably win the league. Coach Emma Hayes. Key player Ji, nicknamed the Korean Messi, provides goals and creativity in her role as a deep-lying forward. Last season Second. Target this season Win back the title. Everton Although Everton missed out on promotion to WSL1 last season, they ended up returning to the top tier for the first time since 2014 when the Football Association accepted their bid to fill the spot left vacant by Notts County. Doncaster Belles were unhappy with the FA’s decision but Everton believe that winning the WSL2 Spring Series proves they have been elevated on merit. Coach Andy Spence. Key player Courtney Sweetman-Kirk was prolific for Doncaster and the striker is expected to flourish after joining Everton. Last season Third in WSL2. Target this season Survival. Liverpool The 2013 and 2014 champions have struggled to compete with Chelsea, City and Arsenal in the past two seasons, finishing 17 points off the pace in 2016. For Liverpool, who begin their campaign with a Merseyside derby against Everton on Friday night, it is about finding a way to respond to the rising demands of women’s football in England. That may not be easy after the sale of Shanice van de Sanden to Lyon. Coach Scott Rogers. Key player Caroline Weir demonstrated her goalscoring threat by grabbing Scotland’s winner against Spain at Euro 2017. Last season Fifth. Target this season Get closer to the top sides. Manchester City There is no doubt that the champions, Continental Cup holders and FA Cup winners are the team to beat. They are a fearsome proposition and are setting new standards. Their wealth has allowed them to accelerate away from the majority of the competition. However, City know they will face a determined fight from Chelsea, who increased the intensity of their rivalry by winning the Spring Series. Coach Nick Cushing. Key player Jill Scott is a marauding presence in midfield for City. Last season Champions. Target this season Retain the title and the FA Cup. Reading Reading’s target last season was simple: survival was their goal after winning promotion and in the end they did enough to stay up at the expense of Doncaster. However, they were not particularly convincing, winning only one of their 16 games, and they need to be prepared for a possible relegation battle before aiming any higher. That said, they can take encouragement from finishing sixth in the Spring Series. Coach Kelly Chambers. Key player Fara Williams’s experience could be vital after the midfielder’s arrival from Arsenal. Last season Eighth. Target this season Mid-table. Sunderland While Sunderland were disappointing in the WSL1 last season, finishing a point above Reading, they improved in the Spring Series, finishing fifth after winning two and drawing three of their eight matches. It is unlikely that they possess the depth or the resources to rise higher than mid‑table but there is a belief within the club that this can be a comfortable campaign. However, will Melanie Reay’s inexperience be a problem in her first full season as manager? Coach Melanie Reay. Key player Stephanie Roche, runner-up in the 2014 Puskás Award, is known for her habit of scoring stunning goals. Last season Seventh. Target this season Mid-table. Yeovil Town They are young and energetic, and no team scored more than them in WSL2 last season. They will be fearless and enterprising, and will hope to bloody a few noses along the way. Ultimately, though, Yeovil know they will be up against it after finishing bottom with one point in the Spring Series. However, they have spent pre-season concentrating on eradicating their weaknesses. That work ethic could prove invaluable. Coach Jamie Sherwood. Key player How will Kayleigh Green slot back into the side after returning from a loan spell in Italy? Last season First in WSL2. Target this season Survival."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/21/sadiq-khan-to-speak-at-labour-conference-after-party-rethink","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T12:33:40Z","webTitle":"Sadiq Khan to speak at Labour conference after party rethink","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/21/sadiq-khan-to-speak-at-labour-conference-after-party-rethink","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/21/sadiq-khan-to-speak-at-labour-conference-after-party-rethink","fields":{"headline":"Sadiq Khan to speak at Labour conference after party rethink","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Sadiq Khan has finally secured a speaking slot at Labour conference next week after a party committee overruled a previous decision that he would be blocked from the programme. The London mayor will now have to start writing a last-minute speech after the conference arrangements committee (CAC) managed to secure him a slot. Khan had been initially denied an opportunity to address the floor after the party leadership decided time should be preserved for ordinary members to speak. That schedule was endorsed this week by Labour’s ruling national executive committee, which also blocked Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, from the programme. On Thursday, the CAC approved a programme ensuring Khan a speaking slot, along with a representative of local government. A source with knowledge of the meeting said some committee members had successfully argued that that Labour conference should hear from politicians who are running administrations. The source said the trade union Unite had argued that speaking time should be reserved for members but that had been overruled. The CAC’s decisions will be put to a vote on Sunday morning at party conference but this is usually waved through as a formality. A source close to the London mayor’s office said: “Sadiq is happy either way. It’s great if he can give a speech to Labour members. He’d better start writing one. But we don’t want this to be a distraction from the big issues being addressed at conference. We haven’t heard officially from the party.” Khan, who has previously criticised Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership of the party, gave a speech last year under the theme of “Labour in power” that was seen by many as a warning to Corbyn not to forget the importance of winning elections. The party’s membership has long called for an increased role at conference in place of long speeches from politicians. It is understood Corbyn is keen for speeches to be shorter and the number of speakers trimmed to give members more time for debates. Keynote speeches are expected from Corbyn, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, and Tom Watson, the deputy leader. Party sources said that with Labour membership having tripled the leadership was keen to give those members more opportunities to contribute, especially given the effort put in by activists during the election. The conference, from 24-27 September, is expected to have the biggest turnout of members in 30 years, with about 1,200 likely to attend. Many local constituency parties will send their full contingent of delegates, when normally only a small number would have been sent on cost grounds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/21/fa-mark-sampson-2013-women-in-football","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T11:34:28Z","webTitle":"FA aware of Mark Sampson allegations in 2013, claims Women in Football","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/21/fa-mark-sampson-2013-women-in-football","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/21/fa-mark-sampson-2013-women-in-football","fields":{"headline":"FA aware of Mark Sampson allegations in 2013, claims Women in Football","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Women in Football has said it is concerned by the latest revelations surrounding Mark Sampson and has claimed questions about the former England manager’s suitability for the job were raised to the Football Association four years ago. Sampson, who was appointed the England Women manager in December 2013, was sacked on Wednesday after the FA said it had been alerted to “clear evidence of inappropriate and unacceptable behaviour by a coach” while he was at Bristol Academy. It was previously thought the FA was first made aware of allegations that Sampson had engaged in inappropriate relationships with female players at Bristol in March 2014. After a 12-month investigation he was cleared by the FA’s safeguarding team to continue in his role. Martin Glenn, who was appointed as the FA chief executive in March 2015, became aware of the investigation seven months later but apparently asked to see the full detail of the report only last week. “WiF understands that questions over Sampson’s suitability for the role were flagged to the FA as early as 2013 during the recruitment process,” Women in Football said in a statement. “The safeguarding investigation of 2014, Sampson being sent on an education course in 2015, Eniola Aluko’s complaint in 2016 and Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson’s Duty of Care report published this April were all missed opportunities for the governing body to more closely examine the issues. “It is unfathomable that an England manager could be sent on a course to emphasise the appropriate boundaries between coach and player, as a direct result of a safeguarding investigation, and not be subject to any sort of due diligence. “WiF routinely receive complaints of discrimination and abuse from women working in football. We rely on the governing body’s ability to properly investigate these issues in a transparent and competent manner.” The Women’s Sport Trust said in a statement that it agreed with the sports minister, Tracey Crouch, about the FA’s handling of the Sampson affair and called for a wider cultural change. “The sacking of Mark Sampson highlights how football needs to dramatically improve its approach to the safety and welfare of its players. The FA’s handling of the situation has been described by the sports minister as ‘a mess’ – it’s hard to disagree,” it said. “Our primary concern is the welfare of athletes in sport. Through our work with elite athletes and our contributions to Baroness Tanni Grey Thompson’s recent Duty of Care Review, we are very aware of how difficult it can be for athletes to raise issues and challenge the authority in their sport. “As Eni Aluko has experienced, whistleblowers can pay an unacceptably high price. Athletes have talked to us about the risk of losing funding or not being selected if they call out problems. This is unacceptable and terrible for all sports.” Glenn will be questioned by MPs why he did not ask sooner to see the full details of the allegations made against Sampson while at Bristol Academy. Damian Collins, the chair of the culture, media and sport select committee, believes Glenn should lose his job if it is found advice and warnings that might have meant Sampson’s contract being terminated earlier were ignored. Collins has summoned Glenn and other FA executives to appear before the CMS inquiry on 18 October. It was originally intended to delve deeper into the issues raised by Aluko about the FA’s investigation into claims of bullying, harassment and racism during Sampson’s reign, first reported by the Guardian. “Our concern is looking into the scope of investigation into the concerns raised about Mark Sampson recently by Aluko and in the past,” Collins said. “Be it Martin Glenn or whoever, if it’s found that they ignored advice and warnings that were clear then their position does become untenable.” Aluko first made allegations of discriminatory behaviour by Sampson in a “culture review” by the FA that she was promised would remain anonymous. A week later, the Chelsea striker was dropped from the national setup by Sampson, who accused her of “unlioness behaviour”. The FA says the timing was a coincidence. In March 2016, an FA investigation cleared Sampson of any wrongdoing but Collins believes executives at the FA should have demanded sight of the report into Sampson’s time at Bristol. “When Aluko’s allegations emerged earlier this year at that point they should have said we should look back at the previous report because that was similarly an investigation into his conduct,” Collins said,. “That wasn’t done. We’re going to hold an evidence session of the committee next month with Eni Aluko discussing her allegations and concerns. I hope Martin Glenn and other senior people from the FA will be here not just to answer questions on that but also these important questions of who knew what and when, when considering Mark Sampson’s position. “Clearly, by the FA’s own admission, after seeing the full report based on the previous investigation he wasn’t fit to do the job, he wasn’t someone who should ever have been appointed.” It is the second time in less than a year that an England manager has lost their job over off-field issues. Sam Allardyce was sacked after being caught up in a newspaper sting. Collins suggested there may be a rotten culture at the FA. “Many people will see this alongside other issues, child abuse in football, appointment of Sam Allardyce and say they don’t seem to learn,” he said. “They don’t seem to have proper systems in place that allows good governance. “Certainly there is a systems failure which means things aren’t routinely flagged up. If they are and people are ignoring those flags it’s even more concerning. Whatever it is at the heart of it, it’s not working. Time and time again the FA fall short of the standards we would expect.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/21/when-media-sceptics-misrepresent-our-climate-research-we-must-speak-out","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T13:09:32Z","webTitle":"When media sceptics misrepresent our climate research we must speak out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/21/when-media-sceptics-misrepresent-our-climate-research-we-must-speak-out","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/21/when-media-sceptics-misrepresent-our-climate-research-we-must-speak-out","fields":{"headline":"When media sceptics misrepresent our climate research we must speak out","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"On Monday, we published a paper in the scientific journal Nature Geoscience that re-evaluated how much carbon dioxide we can still afford, collectively, to emit into the atmosphere and still retain some hope of achieving the ambitious goals of the Paris climate agreement to “pursue efforts” to keep global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The carbon budget we found, to yield a two-in-three chance of meeting this goal, was equivalent to starting CO2 emission reductions immediately and continuing in a straight line to zero in less than 40 years: a formidable challenge. Formidable, but not inconceivable. The distinction matters, because if it were already completely impossible to achieve the Paris ambition, many might argue there was no point in pursuing those efforts in the first place – or that the only option left is immediately starting to cool the planet with artificial volcanoes. We knew this finding would be controversial, since previous estimates had indicated that to meet the same goal, emissions might have to reach zero in well under a decade, which really is inconceivable. Crucially, the reason for the correction was not that we had a new estimate of the climate response, or warming per tonne of CO2 emitted – we used exactly the current consensus range – but that we took better account of past emissions and where human-induced warming has got to already. It was a relatively technical paper, so we prepared as best we could, wrote a non-technical blogpost and organised a press briefing with the Science Media Centre. Almost all of the initial coverage on Monday and Tuesday was accurate: both the Times and Telegraph had headlines about ‘wrong’ or ‘faulty’ models, but in the articles beneath them, Ben Webster and Henry Bodkin were careful not to say there was any evidence the models were systematically over-responding to CO2. We took pains at the briefing to stress the discrepancy was likely due to other, more transient, factors. Those who were there evidently understood. Then the opinion writers piled in. Writing in Breitbart, James Delingpole announced that our paper “concedes that it is now almost impossible that the doomsday predictions made in the last IPCC assessment report of 1.5C warming above pre-industrial levels by 2022 will come true.” Which would be exciting, except that the 2013 IPCC report made no such prediction. In fact, the IPCC specifically assessed that temperatures in the 2020s would be 0.9-1.3C warmer than pre-industrial, the lower end of which is already looking conservative. Anyone who had troubled to read our paper would have found this “IPCC AR5 Ch11 projection” helpfully labelled on two of our figures, and clearly consistent with our new results. In the Daily Mail, Graham Stringer, a Labour MP, weighed in: “According to these models, temperatures across the world should now be at least 1.3C above the mid-19th century average.” Except, they don’t show that, and nor did our paper. Because CO2 concentrations are much better known than emissions, models calculate both the emissions needed to reach observed concentrations and the temperature response. In many models, total accumulated CO2 emissions do not reach today’s level until well after 2020, by which time the level of human-induced warming in the models can indeed be about 0.3C warmer than it is in the real world today, depending on how you measure it. Which means you need to be careful about using these models to work out the remaining carbon budget for an ambitious goal like 1.5C – precisely the point of our paper. In a rapidly warming world, a few years makes a big difference: the discrepancy between modelled temperatures today and observed temperatures today is much smaller. Moving on to the Sun, James Delingpole (again) announced that our paper would “scotch the […] myth […] that man-made carbon dioxide (CO2) is causing the planet to warm at such dangerous and unprecedented speeds that only massive government intervention can save us.” Note the careful wording. Delingpole presumably knew that our paper said nothing at all about revising the impact of CO2 on climate. But by adding a swipe at government intervention, perhaps he hoped to pack just enough into that sentence to squeak it past the UK Independent Press Standards Organisation (which presumably has no sway over Breitbart). So after reasonably accurate initial reporting, suddenly our paper was about a downgrading of the threat of climate change, when it was actually nothing of the kind: our predictions for warming rates over the coming decades are identical to those of the IPCC, and we do not assess the impacts of climate change for any warming level. And then, of course, these ideas were picked up by sympathetic editors all over the world. Who really loses from all this? While Delingpole and Stringer were making out that our paper was about something it wasn’t, it seems to have prompted much more interesting conversations among scientists around the world about what the true level of human-induced warming really is, and what the Paris goal actually means. These are important questions. For such a tight target, the actual remaining carbon budget is sensitive to a number of assumptions, including even how we define global average temperature. Significant uncertainties remain, and while we believe our paper improves on previous estimates, it is by no means the last word. But debating the current level of human-induced warming and how it relates to the 1.5C goal feels a bit like discussing how best to steer a spacecraft into orbit around Saturn while Delingpole and Stringer are urging their readers to question whether the Earth goes round the Sun. Critics of mainstream climate policy frequently complain that they feel excluded. The real problem is that they exclude themselves, and their readers, from the discussion as soon as it starts to get interesting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/21/eu-brexit-negotiator-attacks-boris-johnson-old-fashioned-views-on-identity-european","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T11:26:24Z","webTitle":"EU Brexit negotiator attacks Boris Johnson's 'old-fashioned' views on identity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/21/eu-brexit-negotiator-attacks-boris-johnson-old-fashioned-views-on-identity-european","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/21/eu-brexit-negotiator-attacks-boris-johnson-old-fashioned-views-on-identity-european","fields":{"headline":"EU Brexit negotiator attacks Boris Johnson's 'old-fashioned' views on identity","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The European parliament’s Brexit negotiator has launched a scathing attack on Boris Johnson, saying his recent criticism of young voters who feel allegiance to Europe was “old-fashioned” and “nonsense”. Guy Verhofstadt told a special meeting of three committees in the Irish parliament that it was perfectly possible to feel European while at the same time feeling allegiance to your country of birth. “Some British politicians – not to name Boris Johnson – criticise their countrymen and women for wanting to keep their European identity. He accuses them of ‘split allegiance’. I think this is a binary, old-fashioned and reductionist understanding of identity. I think we need to be smarter, more open and more inventive then that,” he said. “It’s nonsense to talk about split allegiance. It’s perfectly possible to feel English, British and European at the same time. As it is perfectly normal to be a Dubliner, Irish and European at the same time,” he said. “It is this position that needs to be defended by our European Union just as the European Union needs to [make sure] there is no return to the past, to hard borders on our continent, and certainly not to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.” Verhofstadt’s attack comes after the foreign secretary’s Daily Telegraph article in which he said lack of allegiance to the country by some voters drove the leave result in the EU referendum last year. “I look at so many young people with the 12 stars lipsticked to their faces, and I am troubled with the thought that people are beginning to have genuinely split allegiances. “And when people say that they feel they have more in common with others in Europe than with people who voted leave I want to say, but that is part of the reason why people voted leave,” he said. Verhofstadt, who spent Wednesday in Belfast meeting political leaders, and the evening on the Irish border, said Ireland showed it was possible for multiple self-identification to co-exist and flourish. He said the worst kind of borders were those “that run through people’s hearts and minds”. These, he said, “breed division, discrimination and hostility”. The former Belgian prime minister also repeated his insistence that there could be no return to a hard border of checkpoints in Ireland after Brexit. On Wednesday evening he visited a border farm in Co Monaghan, remarking that it was impossible to see where one jurisdiction started and the other ended. Verhofstadt described the Irish border as an “illogical divide” and called for it to remain invisible. “Certainly the cows couldn’t see it. Cows from the north eating grass from the south, milked in the north by a farmer from the south with their milk bottled in the south,” he said. “I’m a Belgian so surrealism comes naturally to me, but to reinstate the border would be more than surreal, it would be totally absurd, even for me.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/sep/21/napoli-have-never-looked-more-ready-under-sarri-to-challenge-for-serie-a-title","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T11:14:16Z","webTitle":"Napoli have never looked more ready under Sarri to challenge for Serie A title | Paolo Bandini","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/sep/21/napoli-have-never-looked-more-ready-under-sarri-to-challenge-for-serie-a-title","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/sep/21/napoli-have-never-looked-more-ready-under-sarri-to-challenge-for-serie-a-title","fields":{"headline":"Napoli have never looked more ready under Sarri to challenge for Serie A title","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Maurizio Sarri did not feel anxious as he headed for the tunnel. His team was a goal down to an in-form Lazio, who had already beaten Juventus and thrashed Milan in the past six weeks. And yet, the Napoli manager told his players to change nothing. Just keep doing what you’re doing, lads, and things will turn out right in the end. Or, at least, that’s the way he told it afterwards. Only those individuals present in the Stadio Olimpico’s away changing room can know whether Sarri’s team-talk truly was as zen as he claimed. What we can say is this: he was entitled to have faith in his team. Slow starts have been a theme of this season for Napoli, you see, but so have ferocious fast finishes. They were 1-0 down after 45 minutes against Atalanta at the end of last month, and came away 3-1 winners. Either side of that fixture, they played away to Nice and Bologna. Both games were goalless at the interval; both finished up as comfortable victories. So perhaps it was this recent experience which gave Sarri such confidence on Wednesday night. Or maybe he had spotted Stefan de Vrij limping. Lazio’s best centre-back, as well as the scorer of the opening goal, had suffered a muscle strain and would not return for the second half. The hosts had already lost another defender, Angola’s Bastos, to injury after 25 minutes. Such injuries left them with a makeshift back three, featuring Dusan Basta – more naturally a wing-back – and Lucas Leiva. Not the ideal combination for facing Serie A’s most prolific attack. And here we get to the heart of the matter, because if Sarri truly did feel confident of turning things around, it was probably because he could glance around that changing room and see Dries Mertens, José Callejón and Lorenzo Insigne looking back at him. Perhaps it is even more than that. The brilliance of Napoli’s front three should not blind us to the quality running through the rest of the side: the force and fury of Allan, the calm control of Jorginho or even the under-appreciated ball distribution of Kalidou Koulibaly. It was centre-back Koulibably who pulled Napoli level on Wednesday, forcing the ball home after goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha had blocked an initial effort by Raúl Albiol. Within two minutes, the visitors had taken the lead. This time it was Callejón, finishing coolly from the edge of the box after Marek Hamsik squared the ball into his path. Napoli’s third goal, though, is the one that will be remembered. Strakosha had shown impressive alertness to race off his line and knock away a long pass from Jorginho before Mertens could bring it under control. As the ball ran away towards Napoli’s left flank, the Belgian forward continued to pursue it. With the keeper suddenly caught in no-man’s land, he twisted his body back to arc a shot from outside the box into the far top corner. No sooner had the ball hit the net, than the comparisons began. “Hey, wasn’t that just like the one by Diego Maradona?” Well, kind of. The Argentinian did score a famous chip of his own in February 1985, against the same opponents and from the same side of the pitch – but he scored from a less acute angle. Mertens would prefer not to have his every achievement juxtaposed with those of Napoli’s greatest player, but it is a testament to how good he has been over the past 12 months that it continues to happen regardless. “Like Diego,” ran the front-page headline on Thursday’s Corriere dello Sport. “Was that Dries or Maradona?” asked Gazzetta. Mertens had celebrated by raising an imaginary toast, miming a cup and lifting it to his lips. We might all do well to stop worrying about the past for a moment and just enjoy drinking down this present-day Napoli. They are hardly a flawless team, and Sarri had already vented his frustration about the slow starts in recent press conferences. We are also yet to see the best of Hamsik this season, although this was possibly his best performance of the campaign. But they can be irresistible when everything is clicking. Right now, it really is. Napoli would eventually make it 4-1 on Wednesday, Jorginho converting from the penalty spot in injury time. The Serie A season is just five games old, yet this was already their 19th goal and their 10th different goalscorer. Dating back to last season, they have now won 10 consecutive league games: a club record. Perhaps they caught a few breaks on Wednesday. Those injuries certainly disrupted Lazio, who finished the game with 10 men – Basta leaving on a stretcher after they had made their final substitution. Napoli had already scored their third goal before then, however. And Lazio failed to muster a single second-half shot on goal. Early days it may be, but Napoli have never looked more ready, under Sarri, to challenge for the title. When an interviewer from Mediaset Premium asked about that prospect after the game, though, he gave a typically deadpan response: “I need to go to bed. We’ve got training tomorrow.” Just keep doing what we’ve been doing, lads. Things might just turn out right, in the end. Talking points • The only other team left with maximum points is, of course, Juventus, after they beat Fiorentina in Turin. Theirs was not such a compelling performance, Mario Mandzukic’s second-half goal the difference between the two teams. It arrived in the 52nd minute, and was the first shot on target of the entire game (Fiorentina still had not managed one by full-time). Beyond the three points, there were further positives to be found for Juve in an impressive first league start for the 20-year-old Rodrigo Bentancur. Max Allegri has been warning us since the summer that the Uruguayan midfielder could be an extra ace up the Old Lady’s sleeve, and his confidence in possession is certainly striking. • Inter, who played on Tuesday, got to enjoy one night alone atop the table, but their draw with Bologna served as a reality check for a team that has not always been playing as well as results might suggest. Luciano Spalletti accused his team of lacking speed and aggression, though in some cases they seemed to be suffering more from a lack of precision. Antonio Candreva attempted an astonishing 22 crosses over the course of the game, and found his target with just two. • Another round of games, a fresh humiliation for Benevento and Crotone – who suffered four-goal defeats to Roma and Atalanta, respectively. The bottom part of the table, in general, makes for ugly reading. Those two teams have scored a single goal each, as have 18th-placed Verona. They have conceded 36 between them. That is not to take anything away from the victorious sides in those two contests, of course. Edin Dzeko grabbed two of Roma’s goals, and has now scored against 22 of the 23 teams he has faced in Serie A. Josip Ilicic’s slalom past three defenders for Atalanta’s third against Crotone, meanwhile, bears a repeat viewing. Results: Bologna 1-1 Internazionale, Atalanta 5-1 Crotone, Benevento 0-4 Roma, Cagliari 0-1 Sassuolo, Genoa 1-1 Chievo, Juventus 1-0 Fiorentina, Milan 2-0 SPAL, Lazio 1-4 Napoli, Udinese 2-3 Torino, Verona 0-0 Sampdoria."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/21/brian-cookson-uci-presidency-david-lappartient-cycling","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T14:57:00Z","webTitle":"Brian Cookson suffers landslide defeat for UCI presidency by David Lappartient","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/21/brian-cookson-uci-presidency-david-lappartient-cycling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/21/brian-cookson-uci-presidency-david-lappartient-cycling","fields":{"headline":"Brian Cookson suffers landslide defeat for UCI presidency by David Lappartient","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Brian Cookson’s reign as the UCI president came to a humiliating end on Thursday as he garnered only eight of 45 possible votes in losing world cycling’s top job to the Frenchman David Lappartient. The contest in Bergen had been forecast to be on a knife edge. Instead, Cookson haemorrhaged support and suffered one of the widest election defeats by a head of any international sports federation. The result also means Cookson, who took over in 2013 after 16 years in charge of British Cycling, becomes the first UCI president to serve only one term. Lappartient, the European Cycling Union president, vowed to rid the sport of the “corruption” he said had left the UCI with a “disastrous reputation”. The 44-year-old, who has boldly promised to ban the use of out-of-competition corticosteroids, which can allow riders to lose weight without the corresponding decline in power, as well as doing more to tackle technological fraud by the use of hidden engines in bikes, added: “It is a great responsibility and I will endeavour in the next four years to be worthy of such trust.” Cookson was left licking his wounds. In a speech to delegates before the vote, he promised to double the UCI’s investment in women’s cycling and appealed to be allowed to continue the work he had started. Yet he failed to win them over. Tellingly, reports suggest he did not get a single vote from the 15 European delegates. Afterwards he fiercely defended his presidency, insisting he had lifted cycling out of the gutter during his reign and had changed the UCI for the better since replacing the Irishman Pat McQuaid. “The UCI I leave behind is unrecognisable from the organisation I took over and I depart with my head held high,” he said. “Someone needed to stand up and take on the previous regime, who had dragged cycling into the gutter, and I leave the UCI knowing I have delivered all the promises I made four years ago.” Cookson said he was most proud of his work in promoting gender equality and supporting developing nations, which he claimed had “inspired and excited millions more around the world”. He added: “I am tremendously disappointed not to have been given a mandate to complete the work we began four years ago and I hope David Lappartient will continue to move cycling in the right direction.” Yet the flaws in the 66-year-old Briton’s candidacy were obvious, too. In 2013 he had run as the change candidate against McQuaid but this time round there was a lack of fresh ideas. Some at the UCI also felt his introverted style and lack of drive was not best suited to run a leading global sport, and he was not helped by the negative headlines surrounding bullying and discrimination that have dogged British Cycling, where he played such a central role. Cookson also faced criticism, especially on social media, for posting numerous selfies with riders. When Lappartient had announced his intention to run in June, he called Cookson a weak president who lacked “ambition” and “vision”. After his victory he was more magnanimous, telling his rival he would always be welcome in the sport. “I imagine his disappointment because I know his interest in our sport that he practises regularly,” he said. Lappartient promised to get to work immediately and change cycling for the better. “Change generates fear,” he said. “It’s normal. However, I would like to reconfirm to UCI employees that I know their value and professionalism, and we need your expertise and commitment to work with me in delivering this four-year plan. As of Tuesday, I will be at the UCI headquarters in Aigle to meet each and every one of you, and begin working on what I have been elected to do.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"travel/2017/sep/21/cape-town-zeitz-mocaa-art-museum-africa-open-september-2017","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T12:04:58Z","webTitle":"'Africa's Tate Modern' – Cape Town’s Zeitz-Mocaa gallery opens","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/sep/21/cape-town-zeitz-mocaa-art-museum-africa-open-september-2017","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/sep/21/cape-town-zeitz-mocaa-art-museum-africa-open-september-2017","fields":{"headline":"'Africa's Tate Modern' – Cape Town’s Zeitz-Mocaa gallery opens","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A week before its public opening, the social spectacle surrounding the preview of Cape Town’s Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa (Zeitz-Mocaa) threatened to eclipse the art on display. There was a soiree hosted by Gucci. Hanging above the makeshift dancefloor was a giant rubber flying dragon by South African artist Nicholas Hlobo. In one of the museum’s white cubes, an installation of half-mannequins made from cowhide – Emabutfo by Swazi-born Nandipha Mntambo – became a backdrop for selfies. But the buzz was good and the free tickets for all four days of this weekend’s public opening (22-25 September) were accounted for online (the museum promises more will be available on the door). The Zeitz-Mocaa building is in a converted grain silo overlooking the Atlantic on the Victoria and Alfred waterfront, an area regenerated 30 years ago for retail, real estate and tourism on the remnants of two dilapidated 19th-century harbour basins (Victoria and Alfred). The silos themselves were built over coal sheds that once supplied steamships, which, in turn, were part-funded by capital from slave compensation after abolition (the owners were compensated, not the slaves). The £28m museum’s architect is English (Thomas Heatherwick), its patron is German (Jochen Zeitz, former CEO of Puma) and the executive director is South African (all three are white men), and it has been hailed as Africa’s answer to the Tate Modern. Zeitz-Mocaa is not the first of its kind, but it is the largest such institution on the continent, with 100 galleries spread over nine floors – and a boutique hotel at the top. It will focus exclusively on 21st-century work from Africa and the diaspora, centred around the private collection of Zeitz. His collection is “very pop, very graphic,” says art critic and author Sean O’Toole, with most works post-2010 and dominated by young South African artists. “But that’s not the same as telling the complicated, multi-vocal African story,” says O’Toole. However, Mark Coetzee, Zeitz-Mocaa’s executive director and chief curator, insists that the vision is to provide a “platform for Africans to tell their own story and participate in the telling of that story”. He says the museum is “geographically situated in Cape Town but has a dialogue with all 54 African states”. Besides the permanent collection, there are centres for photography, performing arts and the moving image, a dedicated arts education centre (a full schools programme is promised in 2018), a costume institute and a curatorial training programme. Access has been designed to encourage local visitors, too. There are public transport stops for local as well as tourist buses, a nearly completed pedestrian walkway into town and free entry for African citizens on Wednesdays and under 18s every day. As a public not-for-profit institution, however, questions remain: when the project was first announced, Zeitz committed his collection “in perpetuity”. Now many of the works are listed as being on long-term loan instead. Although many young artists have been persuaded to donate works, O’Toole says he is also concerned there is no information provided about the museum’s annual budget, or its acquisitions budget. “I think what is going to define all of this in the end is what is represented in the museum,” says Coetzee, explaining that in the past the majority of South Africans were “excluded not only from visiting [museums] but also from being represented, or the way they were represented was problematic. It is going to win if the audience see themselves represented by their own artists.” • zeitzmocaa.museum"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/18/soviet-officer-who-averted-cold-war-nuclear-disaster-dies-aged-77","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T15:24:04Z","webTitle":"Soviet officer who averted cold war nuclear disaster dies aged 77","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/18/soviet-officer-who-averted-cold-war-nuclear-disaster-dies-aged-77","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/18/soviet-officer-who-averted-cold-war-nuclear-disaster-dies-aged-77","fields":{"headline":"Soviet officer who averted cold war nuclear disaster dies aged 77","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A Soviet officer whose cool head and quick thinking saved the world from nuclear war has died aged 77. Stanislav Petrov was on duty in a secret command centre outside Moscow on 26 September 1983 when a radar screen showed that five Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles had been launched by the US towards the Soviet Union. Red Army protocol would have been to order a retaliatory strike, but Petrov – then a 44-year-old lieutenant colonel – ignored the warning, relying on a “gut instinct” that told him it was a false alert. “The siren howled, but I just sat there for a few seconds, staring at the big, back-lit, red screen with the word ‘launch’ on it,” he told the BBC’s Russian Service in 2013. “All I had to do was to reach for the phone; to raise the direct line to our top commanders.” Instead of triggering a third world war, Petrov called in a malfunction in the early warning system. But even as he did so, he later admitted, he was not entirely sure he was doing the right thing. “Twenty-three minutes later I realised that nothing had happened. If there had been a real strike, then I would already know about it. It was such a relief,” he said. It later emerged that the false alarm was the result of a satellite mistaking the reflection of the sun’s rays off the tops of clouds for a missile launch. “We are wiser than the computers,” Petrov said in a 2010 interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel. “We created them.” The incident occurred at the height of the cold war, just three weeks after the Soviet army had shot down a Korean passenger jet, killing all 269 people on board. Ronald Reagan had recently called the Soviet Union the “evil empire,” and Yuri Andropov, the ailing Soviet leader, was convinced the Americans were plotting a surprise nuclear attack. Petrov was never honoured by the Soviet authorities for his role in saving the world from thermonuclear conflict. He was, however, reprimanded by his authorities for failing to describe the incident correctly in the logbook that night. His story did not become widely known until 1998, when Gen Yury Votintsev, the retired commander of Soviet missile defence, published his memoirs. In the following years, Petrov achieved worldwide recognition for his actions. He was honoured by the Association of World Citizens at the UN headquarters in 2006 as “the man who averted a nuclear war”. In 2013, he was awarded the prestigious Dresden peace prize. He was also the subject of a 2013 documentary film entitled The Man who Saved the World. The son of a second world war fighter pilot, Petrov was born in Vladivostok on 9 September 1939. He later studied at a Soviet air force college in Kiev. He died on 19 May in Fryazino, a Moscow suburb, where he lived alone on a state pension, but his death was only reported on Monday. No cause of death has been announced. He is survived by a son and a daughter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/18/vince-cable-calls-for-political-adults-to-work-together-against-hard-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T21:00:15Z","webTitle":"Vince Cable calls for 'political adults' to work together against hard Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/18/vince-cable-calls-for-political-adults-to-work-together-against-hard-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/18/vince-cable-calls-for-political-adults-to-work-together-against-hard-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Vince Cable calls for 'political adults' to work together against hard Brexit","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Britain needs “political adults” to work together to halt a damaging Brexit, Vince Cable will tell the Liberal Democrat conference on Tuesday, urging moderate Conservatives and Labour MPs to work with his party. Cable will also call on the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, to listen to the many pro-EU voters who backed him in June. “He would do better to get off the fence and refurbish his revolutionary credentials. Jeremy, join us in the Anti-Brexit People’s Liberation Front,” he will say in his first keynote speech as Lib Dem leader. In a speech in which the 74-year-old former business secretary will argue that his age and political experience are a tactical advantage, Cable will say it is possible to preserve the UK’s place in the single market and customs by working cross-party. “What the people want, what the country desperately needs is some political adults,” he will say. “Fortunately we are not alone. There are some sensible grownups in the Conservative party and the Labour party and the Greens. “And beyond them are millions of people deeply worried about what is happening. We have to put aside tribal differences and work alongside like-minded people to keep the single market and customs union, essential for trade and jobs.” He will attack senior politician including Boris Johnson and David Cameron, calling the EU referendum battle “a fraudulent and frivolous campaign led by two groups of silly public school boys reliving their dormitory pillow fights” and the Brexit negotiators “people who would struggle to get their heads around a toddler’s Lego set”. Cable’s speech will come after Nick Clegg described being in a coalition with the Conservatives as extremely tough by the end of the parliament, likening working with Cameron to “being in a cage with a demented gorilla”. He said the former prime minister was constantly being pulled to the right by the time of the election in 2015, “trying to find ways of satisfying loopy people like Jacob Rees-Mogg”. Clegg said he was still in touch with some Conservative coalition ministers, including Cameron, George Osborne and current chancellor Philip Hammond. But he said relations had significantly deteriorated with others, recalling how Michael Gove had once “locked himself in the loo” to avoid seeing Lib Dem minister David Laws. Though Cable will urge cross-party cooperation to limit a hard Brexit, he will also reassert the Lib Dems’ commitment to keeping the UK in the EU, calling them “the party of remain”. Party sources said the speech was unlikely to depart significantly from the former leader Tim Farron’s flagship policy of offering a referendum on the final Brexit deal, which delivered only limited gains for the Lib Dems at the June election and which put them at odds with many voters in their former heartlands in south-west England. Cable is understood to be keen to place the emphasis on the economic costs of leaving the EU – the policy area he can speak on with authority. Cable will say any new referendum must not be seen as a second running of the June 2016 vote. “Let me be clear: this is not a call for a re-run – a second referendum – on Brexit,” he will say. “It is a call for a first referendum on the facts, when we know what Brexit means.” Cable will say his party is likely to be “denounced as traitors and saboteurs” along with supreme court judges. “But if the definition of sabotage is fighting to protect British jobs, public services, the environment and civil liberties then I am a proud saboteur,” he will say. “Brexiteers will say ‘we have already voted to leave. How dare you flout democracy.’ It is actually quite difficult to follow the argument. It seems to go that consulting the public – having a vote – is undemocratic.” Over the course of the four-day conference in Bournemouth, Cable has sought to re-establish the Lib Dems as a credible party of government, telling the Observer and the BBC he believed it was possible for the Lib Dems to win a Commons majority and for him to become the next prime minister. But the Lib Dem education spokeswoman, Layla Moran, the newly elected MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, told a party fringe meeting she did not think that ambition was realistic in the short term. Moran said talk of Cable as prime minister was “good fun” but the focus should be on “distinctive positions” and new policies. “It’s not just the leadership, there is a portion of the wider party that still kind of believes this too, that somehow we are going to go back into government at any moment,” she said. “And I think we need to kind of accept we’re not.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/19/parliamentary-committee-pacac-examine-boris-johnson-david-norgrove-row","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T05:30:09Z","webTitle":"Commons committee asked to examine Boris Johnson's £350m claim","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/19/parliamentary-committee-pacac-examine-boris-johnson-david-norgrove-row","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/19/parliamentary-committee-pacac-examine-boris-johnson-david-norgrove-row","fields":{"headline":"Commons committee asked to examine Boris Johnson's £350m claim","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Boris Johnson’s row with the statistics watchdog over his repeated claim that up to £350m a week extra might be made available after Brexit could be examined by a parliamentary committee. The public administration and constitutional affairs committee (Pacac) has received a request from a Labour member to summon the foreign secretary and David Norgrove, the head of the UK Statistics Authority (UKSA), to give evidence over their dispute. Johnson was rebuked by Norgrove after repeating the £350m figure, which was emblazoned on the side of Vote Leave’s battlebus during the EU referendum campaign. Pacac is the committee in charge of examining the role of the UKSA and the Office for National Statistics. The Labour MP Paul Flynn, an experienced member of the committee, has asked that the chair, Bernard Jenkin, launch an inquiry into the row as a matter of urgency. “I have asked that Pacac should examine Sir David’s role in the current row, as well as invite the foreign secretary to give evidence, so we can ensure that UKSA remains independent and accurate,” he said. Norgrove, 69, is a former private secretary to Margaret Thatcher. He began his career as a Treasury economist in 1972 having grown up in Peckham, south London, and read history at Oxford. Joining Thatcher in 1985, he was given access to the formulation of some of her most controversial policies as prime minister, including the privatisation of utilities and discussions over the poll tax. Norgrove has recently called for statisticians to stop others from cherry-picking data to suit their arguments. In an interview with Civil Service World in June, he said: “There’s always been a tendency to look for the evidence that supports the policy rather than the other way round. “That’s not going to end any time soon, but statisticians have an important role in trying to head that off.” Whitehall insiders said Norgrove was very popular at UKSA and the Office for National Statistics and was unlikely to face any internal pressure to back down in the dispute. Norgrove left No 10 in 1988 to join Marks &amp; Spencer. In January 2004 he stepped down from his role as director of clothing after poor Christmas sales. He was lured back to Whitehall in 2005 as the first chair of the pensions regulator and took a tough stance against some companies. Norgrove was appointed as the chair of the UKSA in April after the tenure of Sir Andrew Dilnot. He was the preferred candidate identified by the then cabinet minister Ben Gummer and received cross-party support before taking up the role."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/sep/18/lewis-hamilton-vettel-singapore-grand-prix-f1","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T14:25:43Z","webTitle":"Lewis Hamilton is now the favourite and Vettel has only himself to blame | Giles Richards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/18/lewis-hamilton-vettel-singapore-grand-prix-f1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/18/lewis-hamilton-vettel-singapore-grand-prix-f1","fields":{"headline":"Lewis Hamilton is now the favourite and Vettel has only himself to blame","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Hamilton holds sway The win in Singapore may prove to be the miracle at Marina Bay Lewis Hamilton had been hoping for but, putting aside divine intervention, the British driver comprehensively earned his victory. The crash off the grid took out his rivals but he still had to execute a perfect race to take the flag. He was on it immediately. Just moments later, aware that Sebastian Vettel’s car was leaking fluid, he went offline out of turn three to avoid it – wisely as it was there the stricken Vettel spun and crashed. Always strong in the wet, Hamilton was grateful for the rain and proved again that he is the master of difficult weather. He overcame conditions, including three safety car restarts, that went across the gamut – from an almost full-wet tyre scenario through a greasy, drying phase on to a dry, slick rubber finale. Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo did have a gearbox problem but Hamilton’s pace would have likely been enough to deny the Australian anyway. He was three-tenths of a lap quicker in the early phase and a whopping five-tenths through the crucial middle period. A virtuoso performance. Vettel makes costly blunder The 28-point advantage Hamilton now enjoys over Vettel is more than the British driver could have hoped for going into Singapore where damage limitation was his aim. But for neutral fans the huge swing is a disappointing blow to a title fight that had looked like it was going to the wire. With the majority of the remaining six races likely to favour Mercedes, Hamilton is on course for his fourth title. If Singapore proves to be the moment he lost the championship, Vettel can only blame himself. He had a poor start and saw Max Verstappen shooting up the inside. As a title contender the percentage game would have been to give him space and avoid contact. Instead he invoked the Michael Schumacher chop, went left to squeeze the Dutch driver, almost certainly unaware Kimi Raikkonen had gone up the inside of Verstappen, who had nowhere to go. Contact and disaster for Ferrari ensued – Verstappen was an innocent party. Vettel made a poor decision in the heat of the moment, as he did in barging Hamilton in Baku. This time it may have cost him the title. Alonso eyes the future With McLaren’s divorce from Honda finalised in Singapore the team are looking to start afresh with Renault and re-signing Fernando Alonso to complete their plans appears to be a formality. They need Alonso and he proved it again at Marina Bay. He once again excelled in qualifying, pushing the McLaren to eighth on the grid and followed it with an electrifying start. He was up to third by the first corner and a podium was on the cards when he was collected by Raikkonen and Verstappen. He then continued to wrestle a heavily damaged car round for a further seven laps. Instructive perhaps that his mindset has already improved, in that before ditching Honda he was only too happy to retire. He remains eager to achieve the triple crown and McLaren have said they would allow him to race at Le Mans next year. Toyota, should they commit to it, will be the only manufacturer in the top LMP1 class and strong favourites. With the Honda connection dispensed with, that barrier to his participation with Toyota has gone. It is an exciting prospect, reflected in the Spaniard’s upbeat demeanour. Sainz deserves his seat As part of the complex negotiations on McLaren’s deal for Renault engines, the manufacturer took on Carlos Sainz Jr from Red Bull. It was at the expense of Britain’s Jolyon Palmer, who is without a drive for next season, but Renault are serious about their desire to be fighting for the title within three years and Sainz deserves to step up. After three seasons with Toro Rosso he has gone as far as he can and while Red Bull have no room for him they rate him highly enough to have ensured they have an option to have him back in 2019. The 23-year-old Spaniard showed his class in Singapore. That he has pace has never been in doubt but his run to fourth, his highest finish and the team’s best result since Verstappen managed the same at the USA GP in 2015, showed a maturity that augurs well. He managed the conditions superbly, stayed calm and most importantly out of trouble, even when strongly pressured by Sergio Pérez. Midfield fight hots up Palmer dealt with his disappointment at finding he no longer had a seat at Renault with his best performance of the season and his first points. His sixth place was as good a riposte to the news as he could have hoped for. Renault reaped the benefit, moving above Haas to seventh in the constructors’ championship. The race saw some tight battles between the midfield contenders, with overtaking enabled by the conditions on a track that ordinarily does not favour passing, that reflects the tight competition among the teams. With end of season payments at stake the main contenders know every point is vital. Williams lead Toro Rosso by just seven points. They in turn lead Renault by 10, who are now five in front of Haas. Just 22 separate all four teams and the final six races will be increasingly intense for all of them. Sainz proved he could be a key player in that competition and although Palmer is contracted for the remaining meetings, Renault may yet opt to try to buy him out of his contract in order to import the Spaniard for the next round at Malaysia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/18/ambitious-15c-paris-climate-target-is-still-possible-new-analysis-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T15:00:28Z","webTitle":"Ambitious 1.5C Paris climate target is still possible, new analysis shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/18/ambitious-15c-paris-climate-target-is-still-possible-new-analysis-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/18/ambitious-15c-paris-climate-target-is-still-possible-new-analysis-shows","fields":{"headline":"Ambitious 1.5C Paris climate target is still possible, new analysis shows","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The highly ambitious aim of limiting global warming to less than 1.5C remains in reach, a new scientific analysis shows. The 1.5C target was set as an aspiration by the global Paris climate change deal in 2015 to limit the damage wreaked by extreme weather and sea level rise. It was widely seen as impossible because analysis at the time indicated it required carbon emissions to fall to zero within seven years, a speed deemed “incompatible with democracy” by one climate economist. However, an updated analysis using the latest data shows the global carbon emissions budget that meets the 1.5C goal is significantly bigger than thought, equivalent to 20 years of current annual emissions. The scale of the challenge remains huge but it means that, if the world’s nations ratchet up their emissions cuts in future as intended under the Paris deal, the expected “severe, widespread, and irreversible impacts” on people and the natural world could be avoided. “It is looking more hopeful that we can really achieve the Paris goals,” said Prof Michael Grubb, a climate economist at University College London and one of the team that produced the new analysis published in the journal Nature Geoscience. In 2015, Grubb said the massive scale and speed of carbon cuts needed to meet the 1.5C target were “incompatible with democracy”. But the new work has changed his mind, showing there is more room for emissions than thought. He also said carbon emissions have stopped growing sooner than expected, especially in China, and that renewable energy costs are plummeting unexpectedly quickly. “We are in the midst of an energy revolution,” he said. Prof Myles Allen at Oxford University, who was part of the team that produced the new analysis of the 1.5C goal, said they used several methods to make a fresh estimate of the necessary carbon budget, including updating measurements of the emissions and warming that have already occurred. Previous computer models had also projected more rapid warming in the expectation that, for example, sun-blocking pollution particles would be cleaned up more quickly than it has in reality. “A lot of people said 1.5C is simply not possible,” said Allen. But the new work revealed that for a 66% chance of meeting the 1.5C target in 2100, the budget is 240bn tonnes of carbon, assuming that other greenhouse gases such as methane are also controlled. This means the target could be met if strong action is taken. The scientists also warned that carbon cuts need to happen sooner rather than later, starting with countries strengthening their Paris pledges in 2018. A commonly used scenario for ambitious carbon cuts, called RCP2.6 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, projects ever bigger carbon cuts as time passes. But Grubb pointed out that this would eventually require annual drops in carbon emissions only previously seen when economies collapsed in the 1930s depression, the second world war and at the end of the Soviet Union. Instead, he said, cutting carbon by smaller amounts but starting much sooner could deliver the 1.5C goal. Grubb said the “politics is still not easy”. But he downplayed the impact of President Donald Trump’s decision to take the US out of the Paris deal, saying other nations, as well as states and cities in the US, were pressing ahead regardless, not least because of the economic attraction of ever cheaper green energy. On Sunday, both secretary of state Rex Tillerson and national security adviser HR McMaster indicated the US is open to negotiations on staying in the Paris deal. As the new work was published, the UK’s Met Office said that the “slowdown” in the rate of global temperature rises seen in the first decade or so of this century was over, with 2014, 2015 and 2016 all setting new heat records. In the latter two years, the world’s surface air temperature was more than 1C above pre-industrial levels for the first time. However, increasing air temperatures only account for about 3% of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases. The other 97% is absorbed by the oceans and the rising global warming experienced by the planet as a whole has remained unchecked for decades. Evidence of this is the inexorable rise of sea levels, caused by melting ice caps and the thermal expansion of sea water. The slowdown in rising air temperature between 1999 and 2014 resulted from a natural decadal cycle in Pacific, the Met Office scientists said. This led to the ocean circulation speeding up, enabling it to drag more heat down into the deep ocean and away from the atmosphere. But that cycle has now ended, returning temperature rises to their long-term gradually accelerating trend. The temporary slowdown does not mean the challenge to tackling climate change will be any easier, said Allen: “The slowdown has not helped us in any way.” This is because it merely reflects a natural variation superimposed on the strong warming trend driven by the carbon emissions from human activities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/21/larry-david-lisa-simpson-life-lessons-from-tv-top-role-models","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T14:05:10Z","webTitle":"Larry David to Lisa Simpson – life lessons from TV's top role models","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/21/larry-david-lisa-simpson-life-lessons-from-tv-top-role-models","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/21/larry-david-lisa-simpson-life-lessons-from-tv-top-role-models","fields":{"headline":"Larry David to Lisa Simpson – life lessons from TV's top role models","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Larry David, Curb Your Enthusiasm There aren’t many moments in Curb Your Enthusiasm when Larry David could be described as heroic. Two stand out though. There’s the time he conducts a Wagner-playing orchestra outside an enemy’s house who despises the German composer; the other is when he saves the blushes of a chef with Tourettes syndrome by leading a restaurant in a rousing swear-a-thon. It’s hardly Jon Snow taming the White Walkers, but Larry David isn’t your typical TV idol. He’s an anti-hero minus the hero. A selfish zealot who would happily ruin everyone’s day just to make a meaningless point. He’s also brilliant. The fact that he can get what will soon be nine seasons of television out of essentially the same setup – Larry makes a faux pas, half-heartedly tries to make up for it, hilarity ensues – is incredible. The idea of a misanthropic, anti-PC curmudgeon being a cult hero in 2017 is what some people might call “problematic”. As Malcolm Gladwell recently pointed out, Harry Enfield’s 80s character Loadsa Money quickly got co-opted by the aspirational braggarts he was lampooning. Could the same thing happen to Larry David? Probably not, but we can hope. The only person his over-exaggerated self-portrait is lampooning is himself. And in an age where there’s more bullshit to shovel than ever before, he’s the exact kind of hero we need. Lanre Bakare Hugo ‘Hurley’ Reyes, Lost What I’d give to be Hurley from Lost. Not Jack the square-jawed protagonist, not Sawyer the wisecracking antihero, not even the Man in Black who could transform into smoke and kill people. No, Hurley’s the guy you want around in a crisis; affable, moral, trustworthy and with a towering sense of perspective. Hurley’s key moment came just nine episodes in. While the rest of the plane crash survivors were whipping themselves up into a state of paranoid frenzy about the island, Hurley quietly went off and built a golf course. This simple gesture unified the whole group for one brief, beautiful moment. That’s who Hurley is. No wonder they made him a God.

She’s wired, quick-witted and a workaholic, but willing to let her hair down – and boy when she does, as when she lip-syncs The Jackal, it’s yet more proof that she’s a badass. Of course, CJ is also a massive dork, a six-foot klutz with the secret service codename Flamingo. She even turns up to work – and manages to be hilarious – after major dental surgery: “I had WOOT canal”, “there’s a secwet pwan to fight inwation”. Finally, she stands up for herself (against elitist jackasses), stands up for women (speaking out against the Saudi “partners in crime” after schoolgirls burned to death because they weren’t wearing the right clothing), and she always stands her ground – with everyone from world leaders to bolshie generals. Every day I firmly hope I become more like Flamingo. Kate Abbott Louis Theroux Most people’s TV heroes are fictional ones, but then Louis Theroux has always struck me as a kind of fictional character. I first encountered him onscreen in the 90s for his Weird Weekends series. There he was, sitting in hot tubs with swingers or hanging out with black nationalists in Harlem and somehow managing to be welcomed into their world despite sticking out like a sore thumb … surely this guy wasn’t real?! TV interviewers were never like Louis. They were bullish and tenacious and confrontational. But Louis barely seemed to be interviewing people at all, his questions conveyed with little more than a widening of the eyes or a nervous smile. And that was all it took for his subjects – be they Keith Harris or the bigots of the Westboro baptist church – to reveal their true selves. Louis represented a triumph for the quiet guy, the nerdy and the intrigued. And even when he messed up – meeting Jimmy Savile and failing to uncover the years of sexual abuse – he turned it into important, compelling TV with the mea culpa Louis Theroux: Savile. A few years into my own journalistic career, I remember pottering around the office one day when my phone rang with a familiar voice on the end of the line: “Hi Tim, it’s Louis!” “Louis?” I thought, “Louis who?!” Slowly it dawned on me that I’d arranged an interview with my hero then promptly forgotten about it. As I bluffed my way through, trying to buy time with stilted small talk as I rooted around for a recording device, I felt incredibly proud of myself. Years of marvelling at one of the master interviewers had led me to this career pinnacle – completely forgetting I was supposed to be doing an interview at all. Tim Jonze Lisa Simpson Lisa Marie Simpson is a peculiar girl. She’s yellow and has four fingers for a start, but that isn’t what I mean. Lisa is a cynical, smart, feminist eight-year-old, who’s also a vegetarian, a member of Mensa and a jazz virtuoso. And, having watched her avidly from an early age, I have long identified with her preternatural understanding that a) the world’s just a bit crap and b) sometimes you have to go against the grain. Lisa always felt slightly out of place – seemingly feeling her emotions deeper than everyone around her, wanting to protect the environment from hypercapitalist villains like Mr Burns and often coming across as a major buzzkill. But, like me, deep down Lisa just wanted everyone to like her, like the time when she put on a tie-dye top and a backwards cap, trying just a little too hard to be accepted by the cool kids. Ultimately, though, she stayed true to herself – suing the sexist manufacturers of the Malibu Stacey doll and telling the organisers of the Little Miss Springfield pageant that she wouldn’t be their “corporate shill”. In two very believable jumps into the future, we even saw her become US president and ditch her fiancee after finding out she thought the Simpsons were losers. The Simpsons has been appalling for ages now, and if I watched it today I’m not sure I would connect with Lisa in the same way. Even so, I appreciate everything she taught me about being a weird kid, and learning to embrace it. Hannah J Davies Dale Cooper, Twin Peaks In many ways Twin Peaks’s resident coffee-chugging FBI agent is the worst TV idol possible. For a start, he’s a man of such unwavering decency, fortitude, intelligence and optimism that trying to match him would only result in some sort of stomach ulcer. Second, all these noble qualities got him nowhere in the end: trapped in the purgatorial dream space of the Black Lodge at the finishing line of the original series, then left in an even more bizarre realm at the confounding conclusion of this year’s revival. Still, if there’s a reason to try and aspire to Coop’s possibly doomed way of thinking, it’s because he’s a tryer too. Despite being dealt a horrible hand by the fates – trapped in the form of a doughy Vegas insurance salesman for an interminable length of time, to cite one of many examples – he keeps plugging on in his pursuit of justice, truth and a dynamite slice of apple pie. Even if we don’t possess Coop’s other gifts, that notion of soldiering on in unpleasant, intractable or downright desperate situations is something all of us can manage. Wherever – or whenever – Dale Cooper is now, you can bet he’s doing the same. Gwilym Mumford Elaine Benes, Seinfeld Unusually for a comedy character, Elaine Benes is quite difficult to pin down. That’s because, unlike pretty much all her sitcom peers, she’s not a truncated collection of cartoonish traits. She’s outlandishly funny, but she’s not a “funny woman”. She’s frequently angry, but never a harridan. She’s phlegmatic and neurotic, moral and morally dubious – passionately defending abortion, and stopping off to buy herself sweets before visiting her recently hospitalised boyfriend. She’s both chronically flirtatious and sartorially Mormon-esque, swishing about in ankle-grazing coats and high-necked dresses. It’s not this blizzard of conflicting characteristics that makes Elaine aspirational – but it does make her seductively human. Elaine and I enjoy many of the same activities: having arguments with people we barely know, making absolutely everything into a joke, finding fun new ways to ridicule close friends. But Elaine never seems to feel any degree of guilt about her effect on others. She is untroubled by conscience, spending her life solely in pursuit of her own little kicks. I wouldn’t actually want to be Elaine – in keeping with Seinfeld’s “no hugging, no learning” ethos, she’s almost sociopathically unfeeling – but I’d love a fraction of her certainty that satisfying her own needs first and foremost is both necessary and worthwhile. In a nutshell, Elaine has made me strive to be more ruthless, selfish and cold-hearted. If that’s not a positive role model, I don’t know what is. Rachel Aroesti Dave Lister, Red Dwarf The simple truth is this: if people were a bit more like Dave Lister, Red Dwarf’s smeggiest of stellar slobs, the world would be a much better place. Sure, he’s lazy, whiling away his hours drinking lager, smoking rollies and eating curries, as opposed to actually doing anything tangible. But he’s kind. He’s a hopeless romantic. He’s noble, in his own way. And, most importantly, he’s the inventor of the triple-fried egg chilli-chutney sandwich. If Lister were in fact the last human being alive as he is in the show, humanity could do much worse. As a carefree boy flowering into a spotty, ripe-armpitted teenager, Lister was a paragon of what one could achieve without achieving anything. As that teenager became a scrawny student who got 80% of his calorific intake from Strongbow, Lister was still there, showing how marvellous life could be when boiled down to its simplest pleasures. Admittedly, as that student blobbed into the man I am today, I do wonder if the sedentary Lister was the wisest role model to choose. Then I remember how superb curries, cigarettes and lager are, and decide that yes. Yes he was. Other idols may be braver and more impressive. But does that make them more worthy of adoration than this man described by Arnold Rimmer as “a complete gimp”? Probably. But I don’t care. Luke Holland Lester Freamon, The Wire There’s so much to admire about Lester Freamon, this small-time detective in a run-down town. He’s good at his job but gets zero recognition; instead, when he angers his bosses, he’s demoted and shoved in a basement to work on the pawn shop unit – for 13 years and four months. That’s a long time to be ignored. But he keeps his cool – which, when set against fellow detective Jimmy McNulty’s spectacular self-absorption, only makes him shine brighter. Season three sees him calling McNulty out: “A life, Jimmy, you know what that is? It’s the shit that happens while you’re waiting for moments that never come.” Clarke Peters infused this old soul with such warmth, such quiet charisma, such dignity. Freamon knows who he is, and he isn’t his work. He doesn’t talk too much or too loud, and whenever he does speak up, people take note. When we meet him in season one, he’s making doll’s house furniture at his desk, a delicate sideline that stands in startling contrast to the perpetually-pissed-off police force he belongs to. He can smile wide and laugh long; he can still fall in love. He starts something up with vulnerable informant Shardene Innes in season one, which might seem dodgy until you reach season five and realise they’re still together: he wasn’t playing around; he wasn’t taking advantage. He can still get angry too, with that kind of rare, righteous anger that makes you pay attention. Because, despite the city of Baltimore – with its cronyism, its corruption, its violence, its ineptitude – doing its level best to disprove this notion, policing still matters to him. He is seasoned, but not jaded, clear-sighted but not cynical. He’s seen it all before, but he still cares. Freamon makes me aspire, quite simply, to be better. He’s an Aslan of a man. Dale Berning Sawa Gaius Baltar, Battlestar Galactica Ah, Gaius Baltar. The clue’s in the name. His initials were the opposite of the show that birthed him. Gaius, a common Roman name often borne by emperors; Baltar, probably referring back to the biblical Balthasar, last king of ancient Babylon, who saw the writing on the wall but could not read them without David. The words read “You have been weighed and found wanting.” And wanting Gaius was, in every sense. A narcissistic womaniser and self-serving coward, he only ever had one thing on his mind. Himself. A close second was sex, suavely pursued even when it led to poor decisions, which was all the time. Over the show’s run Baltar proves himself a problematic fave. A proto-Russell Brand character, skilfully portrayed by actor James Callis, he was handsome, funny, supremely intelligent, and adept at improvising. I’ve always had a soft spot for cheeky bullshitters who can sniff out an advantage. People who I sense are better at the game of life than me. I’m sure I’m not the only one, and Lord knows the world is currently in a terrible state because of this. It’s indefensible, but it’s a thing. Baltar is gifted a character arc to die for, a Shakespearian trajectory which sees him ultimately overtaken by a genuine religious conversion, and defining himself via self-sacrifice, love and courage, blah blah. To be honest, though, I preferred him at his worst. Far more than the moral heroes and upright military figures surrounding him, he looked like the most fun to be around. In a show concerned with what it is to be human, Baltar represents weakness of flesh and spirit. In other words, he’s it. Rhik Samadder Who is your TV idol and what have they taught you?

It’s a city that has no pity. It doesn’t stop for anyone or anything. It just keeps evolving.” Seidelman, a film director best known for her hit 1985 comedy Desperately Seeking Susan, which helped cement Madonna’s stardom, is right. Newness is what New York is built on; it’s a city that, of course, never stands still. But, in recent years, as rents relentlessly rise and its residents homogenise, New York is also a city beset by a romanticised yearning. Indeed, this is largely why I’m interviewing Seidelman: later this year, two of her early movies, Smithereens and Desperately Seeing Susan, are playing at the Barbican centre in London as part of a season called the Grime and the Glamour: NYC 1976-90, featuring films “about the wild days and nights of New York’s coolest era”. You couldn’t have a film season about New York in the 70s and 80s without including Seidelman’s work. Both Smithereens (1982) and Desperately Seeking Susan capture the zeitgeist of downtown punk-rock Manhattan through the eyes of young, independent women in ways that garnered them instant acclaim and gave them an enduring appeal. Seidelman directed Smithereens a few years after graduating from film school at NYU, and it became the first US-produced independent feature selected for the Cannes film festival. Desperately Seeking Susan was likewise released to critical commendation and has become a cult feminist classic. The film centres on Roberta (Rosanna Arquette), married to a Jacuzzi salesman, stuck at home, and bored with life. She becomes fascinated by a series of personal ads in the papers that are “desperately seeking Susan”. One day, she heads into New York to find out who this mysterious Susan (Madonna) is. A case of mistaken identity ensues after Roberta hits her head, suffers temporary amnesia and is thought to be Susan herself. Mistaken identity then becomes reclaimed identity. Roberta’s memory loss gives her a blank slate; it frees her from being a bored suburbanite and lets her explore the woman she wants to be. At its heart, the movie is about shaking off the social conventions that come with being a woman, and the city as a place for reinvention and female freedom. The eponymous Susan, by the way, isn’t Seidelman – the fact the script featured a “Susan” just happened to be a coincidence. However, a lot of Seidelman’s background is reflected in the film. She also grew up in the suburbs, always dreaming about the glamour of New York. After studying fashion at Drexel University in Philadelphia she acted on that dream, moving to the city to go to NYU Film School, one of only five or six women in a class of about 35 people, she recalls. As a student, Seidelman lived in a tiny East Village studio. It was the mid-70s, and New York was broke, having narrowly escaped bankruptcy in 1975. Today, the East Village is lined with luxury apartments and artisanal ice-cream shops; back then, it was desperately dilapidated. There was rubble everywhere, and boarded-up buildings. The streets were full of sex workers, addicts and artists. There was a seediness to the city, but also an electric creativity and a mix of cultures and socioeconomic groups. “That was what was so great about the nightlife in the 70s and 80s,” Seidelman says. “You’d go to Max’s Kansas City, the Mudd Club or even Studio 54 and you might find Jackie Onassis sitting with Andy Warhol and then [there were] some cute Puerto Rican boys from uptown who were there to dance and have fun.” Part of Desperately Seeking Susan’s appeal is that it feels authentic; it captures the energy of its era, and a large part of this is down to Madonna’s performance. It was Seidelman’s decision to cast Madonna, who happened to be her neighbour, despite the singer’s lack of acting experience. Seidelman felt that Madonna was perfectly fitted for the role: “She wasn’t acting Susan, she was Susan. The essence of the character felt authentic to me. She wasn’t just an actress in a cool costume.” As well as chronicling the New York of the 70s and 80s, Seidelman also helped capture the feel of the Manhattan of the late 90s when she directed the pilot of Sex and the City. It’s fascinating to watch Seidelman’s early movies and that first episode of Sex and the City side by side and see the extent to which New York changed in just a couple of decades. In her 1996 performance piece, New York Values, Penny Arcade writes: “There is a gentrification that happens to buildings and neighbourhoods and there is a gentrification that happens to ideas.” Sex and the City doesn’t just feature a different geographical landscape from Smithereens and Desperately Seeking Susan, it shows the gentrification of the city’s imagination and the corporatisation of feminism. “Quite honestly, if someone in the late 70s said they were dating an investment banker I’d probably gag,” Seidelman tells me. “But by the late 90s, NY had changed. For better or worse, it had become more monied. In Sex and the City, the leading man was an investment banker whom you never saw working but who lived in an amazing apartment.” And, while the leading women of Desperately Seeking Susan express their independence through creativity, in Sex and the City feminism is firmly equated with consumerism, as expressed in the ability to buy $400 Manolo Blahniks. And gentrification continues apace. New York may have no room for nostalgia, but that doesn’t stop nostalgia from creeping in. Chatting with Seidelman, it is hard not to contrast the bohemian bustle of her early years in Manhattan with the contrived cool of the lobby at the Ace hotel – mood-lit and crammed with millennials on MacBooks – and wonder, like Carrie, if it is a city desperately seeking its own soul. Desperately Seeking Susan is playing at the Barbican, London, on 1 October as part of the Grime and Glamour season"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/sep/18/a-stadium-called-wanda-opening-night-at-atletico-madrids-new-home","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T13:42:52Z","webTitle":"A stadium called Wanda: opening night at Atlético Madrid's new home | Sid Lowe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/sep/18/a-stadium-called-wanda-opening-night-at-atletico-madrids-new-home","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/sep/18/a-stadium-called-wanda-opening-night-at-atletico-madrids-new-home","fields":{"headline":"A stadium called Wanda: opening night at Atlético Madrid's new home","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"There was a glint in Diego Simeone’s eye as he pointed at his chest, mouthed “me” and turned. Right-footed, he struck the ball into the back of the net, not far from the near post. It was Friday evening north east of the capital, the final rehearsal before their grand opening night and one big question had been resolved already. Well, sort of. Some 68,000 seats sat empty, yet to be broken in, and the tap-tap of training was the only sound still, real noise put on hold for 24 hours, but the first goal at Atlético Madrid’s new home had been scored by the captain of their double-winning side and manager of the team moving in. “The most important thing is the three points,” Simeone said soon after, but that grin underlined that he knew better than anyone that really wasn’t true. “You try to focus on work but it’s not easy: we’re all human,” he admitted the following night. “When you get to the stadium, however much you tell yourself ‘don’t look, don’t feel, don’t watch, don’t gaze around’, you do it.” Everyone did – from the moment they arrived on Saturday morning. This, wrote Atlético-supporting Patricia Cazón, “was one of those days that’s historic just because the sun comes up.” After 50 years at the Vicente Calderón, Atlético had a new stadium. “Your dream home,” Marca called it. They were excited for sure, although the fear it wouldn’t be a home at all was as inescapable as it was natural. Twelve years after the idea was first proposed, Atlético were heading to the Wanda Metropolitano, a stadium their president Enrique Cerezo called “the best in Europe”. There was much to cheer and, almost finished at last, he was cheering all right: about the escalators in the new metro station alongside, the acoustics, the architecture, the colour, the comfort: “The seats, please! They’re lovely for people of great weight!” A huge concrete bowl near Barajas airport, with a waved roof and red seats, a little like Wembley, the Emirates or San Mamés, Cerezo insisted: “On the outside it’s pretty, on the inside it’s the business.” It is also, he hopes, going to be the scene of the 2019 Champions League final. Which could, for those of a mischievous mind, prove the most classically atlético thing of all: you build a stadium, take a decade doing it, missing deadlines along the way, spend €310m, ask for a Champions League final, get it, get there, and then lose. To Real Madrid. But, some asked, would it be truly Atlético? Could it be? The Calderón was crumbling, a mess, and 13,000 seats smaller, but it suited somehow and they would miss it. There was something loveable about that place, raucous and rough, something theirs, the area around it Atlético territory. Now here they are, right over the other side of the city, on an exposed plot of no man’s land 20km from home, in a stadium called Wanda. Not just Wanda, though. Atlético’s Chinese shareholders and investors provided half of the title; its history provided the other half. The Wanda Metropolitano is named after the stadium Atlético had before they moved to the Calderón in 1966. Aware of the sense of rootlessness the move could provoke, there has been a conscious attempt to embrace their history, to create continuity and recreate community. To make it fun, too. And fans have responded: 13,000 extra seats has not meant empty seats. Season-ticket sales have increased and the opening games have sold out. The desire to celebrate what they had and also what they will have was clear on Saturday’s opening day, from the moment they got off the metro, decorated with images from the club’s history and their former homes at the Retiro, the Metropolitano and the Calderón. It was clear too in the fight to keep their best players this summer: offers came for a dozen footballers, but none were accepted and players were renewed instead. It came at a cost, and a big one, but it was important. It’s no good moving into a new home and not taking everyone with you. Improve the stadium and weaken the team doesn’t work. Still less in the debut season, where there is anxiety as well as anticipation. Apart from the sense of being uprooted, there are concerns over the practicalities and the economic impact. What was originally presented as effectively a ‘free’ stadium, Atlético taking and rebuilding the arena earmarked for three failed Olympic bids in return for their old place, has in fact cost them €170m plus the €140m value of the Calderón site. Costs have grown since it started in 2008; they needed a loan in 2016 to keep going. And keeping the players has increased the demands on them to the extent that Champions League qualification is not an objective, it’s an obligation. But Cerezo says it will be paid for in seven or eight years, and that it is a necessary step into a new era. It was a big step, and an uncertain one. The stadium is still unfinished – inside and out cables hang unconnected, painting is not yet done, trees are unplanted, taped-up print-outs act as signs, and dust from the building work lingers, while the access from the M40 motorway that borders it to one side have not been built. But on Saturday, the Wanda was ready at last. Car parks were full – although at €300, season tickets there cost almost as much as they do in the stands, and most come by metro. The travel chaos feared did not happen, not least because fans arrived early, encouraged to do so by opening-day activities. There were bouncy castles and fan zones, music and two happy hours. And so, Saturday comes. On the concourse outside the stadium there are metallic plaques dedicated to every player who has made 100 appearances for the club. Fans seek out Luis Aragonés, and Simeone, Fernando Torres, Garate, Kiko. They seek out defector Hugo Sánchez too, scuffing at it and putting stickers over the top. Players’ pictures run along walls. Red and white, the biggest flag in Spain flies outside. It is not an especially pretty stadium outside, but the doors open at 7pm, an hour and 45 minutes before kick-off, and the inside impacts. It is genuinely spectacular: huge, high and steep. The King is in the directors’ box. The radios are in early and they’re getting emotional. There is an homage to their former homes pre-game. The play-list in the arena is the same as was at the Calderón: 80s rock, mostly. Thunderstruck booms out. Down in the tunnel, players head out to warm up. On the walls are the slogans that have been covered until the morning: It’s not just a league title. What these lads transmit to you is something much more important than that: if you believe and you work, you can do it” – Diego Pablo Simeone. You are Atlético Madrid and there are 50,000 people out there who will die for you. For them, for the shirt, for your pride, you have to go out there and express on the field that there is only one champion and he’s in red and white” – Luis Aragonés. When they go out, there is a roar. When they return for the game, the anthem is played. It is the same anthem as ever, with the same opening line: “I’m going to Manzanares”, and, although they’re not going there any more, the fans belt it out. They’re almost ready. The match ball has been brought in by parachute. An Atlético flag follows, as does the Spain flag. There is a minute’s applause for the club member No1, a socio since 1933, who sadly didn’t make it. The honorary kick off – kept a secret – is performed by Garate, Torres and a youth teamer called Hugo. Past, present and future. “I’ll never forget it: it’s an honour to be with José Eulogio and a kid who we hope has a great future,” Torres says. He’s not a starter but eight Atlético youth-team products are, three of them for Málaga. And then the game begins. It’s not always great: however impressive the stadium, however historic the day, it’s still Atlético versus Málaga in week four. On the eve of the game, Saúl had said: “I hope it’s a canterano who scores the first goal. It almost happens – just not the way they hoped. The first goal-kick is for Roberto, the first foul from Koke, and the first shot from Saúl, while the first shot on target is from Málaga’s Borja Bastón. All of them are Atlético canteranos, youth-team products. But Atlético don’t have a shot on target until the 44th minute and an hour in, it’s still 0-0. Not much is happening. “New stadium, same football,” El País writes the next day. “Leaden,” they call it, and it is a bit – certainly until Yannick Carrasco comes on. “We didn’t go to watch the football, we went to see the stadium,” Juan Tallón writes, but while the communion may not (yet) be complete, they still depend on each other. The noise drops, there’s a lull. A few of them, in fact. For all the legend, and for all that it is real, there were lulls at the Calderón too, times when it went quiet there as it does here. At the new place, the songs from one end don’t always catch on at the other. The noise doesn’t always reach them, some say after; it’s not so easy to sing along when you can’t make out the song. Maybe it’s not just the players; maybe the fans are looking around a bit too, taking it all in, not yet let loose, not yet at ease, as if trying to keep it pristine, tip-toeing about. It feels almost like a European final, like they’re visitors, although that sensation will surely subside. Perhaps there’s a little of the modern stadium thing, too: big, broad passageways, ample aisles, space between seats, a little too comfortable? Boundaries are not yet broken down, nor communities created. They miss the Calderón. It may take time; they may need to live in it a little longer. That’s when they see Torres by the touchline, ready. It is hard to do justice to just how much of an icon the Kid is for Atlético, and this seems set up, the perfect story. Simeone aside, if anyone should score the first goal here, just as Aragonés scored the first at the Calderón in 1966, it is him. But he is standing there waiting when Ángel Correa escapes and lays it to Antoine Griezmann to get the goal. The Wanda Metropolitano erupts for the first time, and Torres returns to the bench. The moment is Griezmann’s: the man who was about to leave but said it would be “dirty” to do so, scores. “It’s not just any goal, that’s for sure,” he says afterwards. Griezmann has played at the Stade de France, San Siro, the Camp Nou and the Bernabéu, Ipurua too. “This is the best stadium I have ever played in, and I don’t just say that because it’s mine,” he insists. “Luis Aragonés was a crack and Antoine is a crack,” Simeone says later. It is the first goal at the Wanda. It is also the last of the Wanda’s opening night. Victory is secured, which is a little unlike Atlético, and which is not reflected on the three giant scoreboards – they stop working soon after. At the end, gravelly-voiced folk singer Joaquín Sabina’s Atlético anthem is played, lauding: “What a way to suffer! What a way to win! What a way to lose!” It’s the same album they couldn’t play on their centenary, the night they were supposed to, because of a problem with the rights. The players go on a lap of honour, and fireworks race into the sky, round and round the roof. The stadium rocks. Fans head out, happy. Cautiously optimistic. It’s not the Calderón and the nostalgia lingers, maybe even a sense of loss, but, wow, it’s certainly impressive. The first night has mostly been good and others will, they hope, be better. Down the stairs, through the press room, which is not yet finished and has suffered a minor flood in one corner, Simeone appears. “Since I have been a player and a coach I have never seen anything like it. This memory will stay with me my whole life; it was emotional,” he says. “Fans will never lose the memories, the nostalgia, the love they had for Metropolitano before and the Calderón after and they’ll fall in love with the [new] Metropolitano as well because what really makes fans fall in love is the shirt.” Talking points • Poor Paulinho: he was about the only person that hadn’t yet done anything wrong, but he took it from all sides when he signed for Barcelona – seen as symbolic of everything that they were doing wrong. A 29-year-old from the Chinese Super League joining the club for €40m, instead of Marco Verratti. No one seemed to consider the possibility that he might not be totally awful. Maybe even quite good. Useful, at least. Maybe now they will. On Saturday, Barcelona were 1-0 down after a ridiculously good goal from Gaku and they really weren’t playing well, but then Suárez (Denis, not Luis) clipped in a lovely equaliser and then Paulinho burst through with six minutes left, shrugging off his man like a bumper car, and smacking in the winner. That’s four wins out of four. It’s also four months without Ousmane Dembélé, who has torn a ligament in his hamstring. • Gareth Bale reached 35kph and Real Madrid reached 73 consecutive games scoring with a 3-1 win at Real Sociedad, who had won three from three until then, and gone 10 unbeaten. Madrid did it without Ronaldo, Benzema, Marcelo and Kroos. Borja Mayoral was beaming afterwards, and refusing to swap shirts with anyone. This one was going straight home. Given his chance, he got the first and delivered the cross which deflected in for the second – at the end of a break that started with Sociedad hitting the bar at the other end. “I can’t control people whistling me,” Bale said afterwards.

And so it is perhaps inevitable this week that we are once again locked in the DC mortuary, staring at what might have been if Tim Burton and Darren Aronofsky had been allowed to pursue their respective superhero visions in what now seems like another era entirely. Few would argue that either the caped crusader or the man of steel is currently top of the DC tree, following the meat-headed, convoluted mess that was last year’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. But does that mean we are viewing Burton’s aborted mid-1990s pitch for Superman Lives, starring Nicolas Cage as the last son of Krypton, or Darren Aronofsky’s Batman: Year One, which would have cast Joaquin Phoenix as the dark knight in 2002, with rose-tinted x-ray vision? Aronofsky, who revealed his preference for Phoenix during press interviews for his new film Mother! last week, believes his version of the caped crusader would have fit nicely into DC’s current thinking. “I think we were basically – whatever it is – 15 years too early. Because I hear the way they’re talking about the Joker movie and that was my pitch. I was like: We’re going to shoot in east Detroit and East New York. We’re not building Gotham.” Like DC’s mooted Joker origins movie, which reportedly has Martin Scorsese himself on board as a producer, Batman: Year One would have taken its inspiration from hard-bitten 1970s crime cinema such as Mean Streets or Taxi Driver. “It was a hard R-rated Batman,” Aronofksy recently told First Showing. “What I pitched them was Travis Bickle meets The French Connection – a real guy running around fighting crime. No superpowers, no villains, just corruption.” Year One also shares another factor in common with the Joker movie, in that it sounds an awful lot like a “what if” take on an iconic comic-book figure. Dispensing with canon, Batman himself was to be wrenched from the luxury of his family’s fortune at a young age and forced to grow up in poverty on the mean streets of Gotham. Instead of kindly old Alfred the butler, his father figure would have been “Big” Al, an African American car mechanic, while Selina Kyle (aka Catwoman) would have been presented as a black prostitute. Year One, which would have been written by the author of the seminal 1987 graphic novel of the same name, Frank Miller, was put into development after 1997’s disastrous Batman &amp; Robin almost destroyed the caped crusader’s big screen legacy. In spirit, it doesn’t sound too far removed from the Christopher Nolan trilogy that eventually replaced it in cinemas – Aronofsky had even discussed using Christian Bale as the dark knight. But Warner Bros execs balked at the idea of a spiky R-rated take with limited opportunities for merchandising, and the movie was never made. If Aronofsky’s vision of a low-tech Batman might have upset certain purists, it sounds as if Tim Burton’s Superman Lives would have had hardcore fans of the Christopher Reeve-era weeping into their popcorn. Surviving footage of spindly, long-haired Nicolas Cage in his shiny, sculpted costume, combined with abandoned scripts, suggests we would have had to get our heads around an entirely new vision of Kal-El, one closer to hammy rock god than the taciturn blue-eyed titan of comic book lore. Cage told EW this week: “I would offer that the movie that Tim and I would have made, in your imagination, is more powerful than any of the Superman movies. I didn’t even have to make the movie and we all know what that movie would have been in your imagination. That is the Superman. That is the movie. Even though you never saw it – it is the Superman.” The Oscar-winning star of Leaving Las Vegas may well be right, but given Cage is best known for the kind of freewheeling melodrama that either supercharges the movies he appears in (see Werner Herzog’s Bad Detective: Port of Call New Orleans) or destroys them with pantomime overacting (the 2006 remake of The Wicker Man and other efforts), it is hard to guess which way Superman Lives might have gone. We should probably bear in mind that this version of Superman – certainly in early drafts during the period in which it was titled Superman Reborn – is probably the strangest one ever pitched. At one point, the man of steel is killed off (by Doomsday) and resurrected as a spirit, which then impregnates Lois Lane. The newspaper reporter soon gives birth to a son, who grows to man-size in just three weeks and subsequently takes on the mantle of his dear old dead Superdad. Kevin Smith loves to tell the story of how he was forced to include producer Jon Peters’ obsession with the idea of Superman fighting a giant spider in his own version of the script. In the pantheon of messed-up comic book movie concepts, Superman Lives sits below only the abortive JJ Abrams-scripted take on Superman, which featured a Lex Luthor who can fly and a Krypton that never blew up. There are two ways to look at these lost scripts for alternate versions of our greatest superheroes. In the cinematic universe era, which seems to be slowly getting picked apart due to the short-termism of many Hollywood studios, they would have made no sense whatsoever. But if Warner is on its way to abandoning the joined-up approach, as appears to be the case, for a “what if” template, then all options are suddenly on the table. What if Superman were a “psychologically traumatised” man of steel, and “what if” Batman grew up outside Wayne Manor and never had the greenbacks to buy all the hi-tech body armour and cool sonar gadgetry of the Nolan movies? In the comics and animated movies all these versions have walked the Earth – indeed there exists a critically-acclaimed, Mark Millar-penned take on the man of steel in which he is retooled as a Soviet totem, and versions of the caped crusader who are Nazis, vampires and even a cape and cowl-sporting toddler named Bat Baby. There is a scene in the excellent Lego Batman Movie in which Batman rifles through the many costumes worn by the different versions of the dark knight over the years. On current evidence, Bruce Wayne is going to need a much longer clothes rail by the time the movie’s sequel goes into production."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/23/older-brother-tormented-childhood-letter-always-wanted-write","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T05:44:08Z","webTitle":"A letter to … my older brother, who tormented me throughout our childhood","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/23/older-brother-tormented-childhood-letter-always-wanted-write","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/23/older-brother-tormented-childhood-letter-always-wanted-write","fields":{"headline":"A letter to … my older brother, who tormented me throughout our childhood","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Life, as we were growing up, was always a contest for you. You needed to win, no matter what. Cheating at every game. Changing the rules in your favour. Blaming me for your mistakes. Telling on me for any misdemeanour you deemed me guilty of. Everything was a competition – I was always the competition. You taunted me. Humiliated me. You kept me insecure. You resented me and I could never figure out how to please you. I was a sensitive child. Our parents were supportive and present, but they were never good at handling my sensitivity. Never understanding of, or open to emotions. My tears were a nuisance to them and I was treated like a crybaby. No one cared why I cried, but everyone demanded that I stop. You kept me in tears. Your jealousy got it into your head that our parents spoiled me. That I was getting special treatment behind your back, when in fact being the middle child I got the least attention from our parents and all my stuff consisted of your worn hand-me-downs. I remember when I got a brand-new pedal car for my birthday, I shouted joyfully for you to come and check it out. I simply couldn’t believe it was mine, because I never got new things. Being a couple of years older than me, you were always faster and stronger. We never came to blows, because you would in all likelihood have annihilated me. You took a strange pride in that. In your mind you were a kind person, who should be shown gratitude for not punching me in the face. As if not beating me was a sacrifice for you. The only time we came to a scuffle was when I was about 14 and you gave me a bag with some leftover crisps. I gladly accepted and ate a few, only to find you’d left a monumental gob in the bag. That time my tears turned into pure, concentrated rage and I couldn’t stop myself from attacking you physically – despite the low odds of me winning the fight. For years I resented you. For all of it. For the emotional scars and insecurities you’d successfully cultivated in me. I wanted nothing to do with you. I borderline hated you, and for a long time we only spoke occasionally, when family get-togethers required. Even though we got along pretty well, sooner or later you’d make it clear who was the bigger brother. I couldn’t relax in your company. I couldn’t trust you. My wife asked me why I never confronted you. I told her that when I’d needed the restitution, you’d never have given it. A confrontation would only have caused an irreparable rift between us. Now we’re older I understand that your behaviour was a symptom of your self-doubt and that pushing me down kept you afloat. We were brought up in an emotionally inhibited family. We did not have bad parents, but lacked emotional guidance. However, when I became ill, mentally worn out after years of insecurity, lack of self-worth and performance anxiety you were the first family member calling to ask how things were. You have changed. You have grown, become the big brother, genuinely interested in my wellbeing. This gives us hope. While we can never have that perfect childhood, we can still have a future friendship. Risking that by bringing up past quarrels, that we probably remember differently, would be a bitter, stupid move. I’d rather let bygones be bygones. I am in greater need of a friend than an estranged brother.

For West Indies’ Chris Gayle is about to play his first one-day international since the World Cup of 2015. His fellow Jamaican, Marlon Samuels, the expert Ben Stokes provocateur, also returns to add some spice to the five ODIs that commence at Old Trafford on Tuesday. And for England prepare for a rare sighting of the captain, Eoin Morgan. Recently one has had to be pretty sharp to glimpse Morgan at the crease. Since England lost against Pakistan at Cardiff on 14 June in the Champions Trophy semi‑final Morgan has played some cricket but not in any match that has lasted longer than 40 overs. He captained Middlesex in their Twenty20 campaign – they finished seventh in the South Group – then he popped off to the Caribbean, where he had four innings for the Tridents (the team based in Barbados, since you ask) and then he appeared in the frozen north at Chester-le-Street for Saturday’s T20 match, which was won by West Indies by 21 runs. We would be alarmed by Morgan’s recent form if it applied to anyone else. In his past seven innings his output does not even resemble a mobile phone number since he has never reached a score as lofty as seven. For the record those innings have produced 12 runs: two for England last Saturday; two, two, five and a duck for the Tridents while his efforts with Middlesex were one and another duck. If anyone can cope with this little drought Morgan can. He has fashioned a unique career path among England cricketers – even Jos Buttler turns out for Lancashire in red-ball cricket when he can – and so far it has worked. He plays for various T20 teams and captains England in white-ball cricket. Fifty overs in the field may seem like an eternity to him over the next 10 days. Morgan played well in the Champions Trophy and the ODIs against South Africa when his preparation was a few outings in the Indian Premier League. For him time in the middle, the old mantra of every batsman in history, does not seem to be essential. He has scored runs without what most would view as adequate preparation before and he is unassailable as England’s ODI captain. However such a schedule makes him vulnerable if the magic disappears. As so many of England’s ODI captains have discovered it is a tough job without runs; moreover it is tough to drop anyone if your own contribution is minimal. As ever Morgan adopts a positive outlook. “There’s five opportunities to turn that [bad form] around”, he said. “I’m desperate to do it.” It feels as if England have dropped Jason Roy for the first match of the series in Manchester, though technically this is not the case. In June Roy was omitted from that semi-final against Pakistan and was replaced by Jonny Bairstow and that remains the case for Tuesday’s game. “He [Roy] is certainly in our plans for the future,” said Morgan, who has always advocated consistency in selection and the virtues of giving players the security of a long run. Hence the suggestion is that Bairstow will now be given plenty of chances to demonstrate that he has successfully converted into an ODI opener. “We feel Jonny deserves a chance. He’s been waiting in the wings for quite a while,” Morgan said. “He will open with Alex Hales. This is an opportunity to make the opening position his. We feel it is the right time to make a change. Jonny has been in fantastic form for some time and has never let us down regardless of the role we have asked him to play”. Bairstow has never hidden his eagerness to be involved in every format and this is mirrored by other members of the squad, which is a healthy reflection of the mood of England’s best players. There may have been a temptation for Joe Root, the Test captain, and Stokes, his vice‑captain, to have a pre-Ashes break. But both of them want to keep playing, whatever the format. Morgan is conscious that with their senior reinforcements on board West Indies are “a strong team and we don’t take them lightly. It is going to be a tough test”. But in recent years the longer the game, the more fragile West Indies become. Even in 50-over cricket they are ranked No9 in the world and they probably need to win all five matches to qualify automatically for the 2019 World Cup. If they manage that then Morgan will be confronted with some awkward questions on what we hope (rather than expect) will be a balmy night at the Ageas Bowl on 29 September. It is more likely that England with their experienced squad – Tom Curran is the solitary novice – will prevail more often than not."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/18/boris-johnson-350-million-claim-bogus-foreign-secretary","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T12:27:51Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson’s £350m claim is devious and bogus.

Here’s why","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"There are lies, damned lies and Boris Johnson’s weasel sums. By no honest calculation can Britain’s net payment to the European Union be estimated as £350m a week. Nigel Farage admits it. So does the Daily Mail. Even Johnson admits it. In his “glorious Brexit” essay in the Daily Telegraph last Friday the foreign secretary said that we would “take back control” of roughly £350m a week when we leave the EU. A reasonable person might assume that Johnson meant that the country would have that amount of extra money to spend post-Brexit. What a “fine thing”, Johnson wrote, “if a lot of that money went to the NHS”. In his spat with the UK Statistics Authority Johnson now says he is shocked, SHOCKED that his words should be understood in this crassly simplistic way. To suggest that he was claiming that £350m might be “available for extra public spending” is a “wilful distortion” etc. In other words, the foreign secretary’s defence amounts to an admission that the slogan on his famous Brexit campaign bus – “We send the EU £350m a week: let’s fund our NHS instead” – was bogus all along. I will leave the politics to others. Let’s just look at the £350m figure – and the foggy reality of the EU budget. Some Brexiteers now cheerfully admit that the figure was fake. To others, perhaps even Michael Gove, it has achieved a kind of mystical importance. The arch-Brexiteer Tim Martin, the founder of the Wetherspoons pub chain, announced on the BBC that the net payment figure was indeed £350m if you include the tariffs on goods imported to the UK from outside the EU. Martin’s back-of-a beer-mat calculation is incorrect. Three-quarters of those trade tariffs do go to Brussels. They are, however, already included in Her Majesty’s government’s official calculation of Britain’s net and gross payments to the EU. The European Union is broadly funded in three ways. It takes most of the tariffs charged on imports from the rest of the EU; it takes a small sliver of VAT receipts; and it takes contributions from member states based on their gross national income (GNI). The sums involved are large – but tiny compared with national government budgets. The EU spends roughly 1% of the GDP of the 28 member states – compared with between 35 and 58% spent by their governments. About 40% of EU spending goes to farm and rural subsidies, about 40% to aid to poorer regions and member states. The system, already complex, has become cosmically unfathomable since Margaret Thatcher won an (entirely justified) rebate for Britain in the 1980s. There is now a rebate on the British rebate and varying forms of mini-rebate for five other EU states. Such complexity is an invitation to distortion, as Johnson well knows. The foreign secretary has been misrepresenting the EU since he was reporter in Brussels for the Telegraph in the late 1980s. (Full disclosure: I was a reporter for the Telegraph in Brussels just before he was. We have never met.) Thus Johnson now says that he is not suggesting that the UK net contribution is £350m a week. How could anyone think such a thing? He is making the extremely subtle claim that, post-Brexit, Britain will have full “control” over how it spends the roughly £350m (actually £342m in 2015-6) which Britain “sends” to Brussels. In other words, we might decide to spend the money which Brussels now spends in the UK in other ways. This is not a subtle claim. It is a misleading statement wrapped in a lie. First, the lie. Britain, as Johnson knows, does not “send” £350m a week to Brussels. The rebate won by Thatcher in 1984 is deducted first. This reduces our net weekly payment to around £250m (some say £275m). When EU spending in Britain is included – on agriculture subsidies, research and grants to poorer regions – the UK net payment comes down to about £160m a week. Post-Brexit, Johnson suggests, “a lot of that money” could go elsewhere, and specifically to the NHS. This is misleading. The government has promised to keep farm subsidies at present levels until 2020 and probably beyond (although maybe in a different form). EU regional grants, for transport and other infrastructure projects, do not go on pet schemes drawn up by Eurocrats. The EU money helps pay for projects that have long been planned at local and national level (which are then accepted by Brussels as suitable for EU support). Presumably many of those projects would continue. That leaves a notional Brexit “bonus” of around £160m a week. It is uncertain how much of this could “go to the NHS”. The government has proposed a labyrinth of post-Brexit customs and legal institutions which would swallow up some of the savings. Presumably Johnson fears that reasonable people would regard £160m a week as an acceptable price to pay for the benefits of EU membership. Why, otherwise, would he persist in outright lies and weaselly distortion of the figures? • John Lichfield is a journalist based in France since 1997.

In a speech to the conference of the National Housing Federation, David Orr will say it is “absurd” that the government is spending less on social housing now than in the 1990s while paying increasing sums to private landlords via housing benefit. The tragedy at Grenfell Tower in west London, in which at least 80 people died, highlighted the long neglect of social housing, Orr will say. “The prime minister is right that we’ve not paid social housing enough attention. After the tragic fire at Grenfell, this crisis can no longer be ignored. The government must be bold and make a break with the past by making money available to build genuinely affordable homes. “There’s more than a billion pounds that remains unspent on Starter Homes. Let’s put this money to use and let housing associations build 20,000 of the genuinely affordable homes the nation needs.” Orr, who is chief executive of the federation, is expected to argue for a complete shift in government policy. Since 2010 the government has overseen a massive reduction in the provision of homes for social rent, instead focusing on “affordable” rents, which can be as much as 80% of the market value. A report by the federation, produced to coincide with the conference, says the amount of capital committed by the government to homebuilding has fallen from £11.4bn in 2009 to £5.3bn in 2015. In combination with this, the decision to stop public funding for social rented homes led to a decline in construction of these from 36,000 starts in 2010/11 to slightly over 3,000 the next year. The report says the only new social rent homes now are coming either from previous funding commitments or through cross-subsidies within housing associations projects, amounting to just under 1,000 starts in 2016/17. It says the increase in rented housing stock has instead come from the private sector, with a 57% rise in real terms over the past two decades. The federation says private rents are on average £21 per week more expensive than their social let equivalents, meaning that over the last 20 years the annual spend on housing benefit has risen from £16.6bn to £25.1bn. There is another cost, the report says. “Not only is it 23% more expensive to house someone in the private rented sector than social housing, but none of that money increases the supply of new homes. “Social landlords do reinvest in new homes, building a third of all new homes last year including for social rent from their own funds, but the same does not happen in the private rented sector.” In his speech, Orr will argue that this is an unsustainable situation. “It is absurd that we’re spending less on building social housing than we did in the 90s – there are even more people today on housing waiting lists than then, despite increasingly stringent criteria. “We know we need more, better quality social housing. And yet, rather than putting public money into building the homes we need, we are propping up rents in a failing market. Ultimately, this is poor value for the taxpayer and has a knock-on effect on everyone struggling to rent or buy.” John Healey, the shadow housing secretary, said: “Conservative ministers have washed their hands of any responsibility to build the homes families on ordinary incomes need. Ministers try to hide their failure to build more affordable homes by branding more homes ‘affordable’. The Conservative definition of affordable housing now includes homes close to full market rent and on sale for up to £450,000. “Public concern about housing is around the highest level for 40 years. Millions of families are struggling with high housing costs. Faced with this, ministers have turned their back on the way they can help most – by building low-cost homes to rent and buy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/24/seoul-kimchi-manchester-the-soupd-should-be-offered-on-prescription-restaurant-review","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T05:00:36Z","webTitle":"Seoul Kimchi: ‘The soup should be offered on prescription’ – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/24/seoul-kimchi-manchester-the-soupd-should-be-offered-on-prescription-restaurant-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/24/seoul-kimchi-manchester-the-soupd-should-be-offered-on-prescription-restaurant-review","fields":{"headline":"Seoul Kimchi, Manchester: ‘The soup should be offered on prescription’ – restaurant review","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Seoul Kimchi, 275 Upper Brook Street, Manchester M13 0HR (0161 273 5556). Meal for two, excluding wine: £30-£45 The cab rumbles down a broad street just to the south of Manchester city centre, of the sort even its planner would struggle to love. To one side is the hefty sprawl of the Royal Infirmary. To the other is the blood centre. If you’re leaking, or bits of you are falling off, this is clearly the place to be. It is not the kind of drag you would necessarily go down in search of dinner. But then sometimes worthwhile restaurants are the product of happenstance rather than design. Seoul Kimchi is one of those. It was first opened in 2008 by Byunghee Kwon, though back then it was just a shop. She arrived in the city to study in 1997 and became aware of the lack of ingredients for her fellow Koreans. This included kimchi, the ubiquitous, fermented cabbage which she says she makes to a secret recipe taught to her at Seoul’s Kimchikan museum. Apparently South Korean kimchi is fiery and the northern variety is watery. That from Seoul is a gentle affair. All of this chatter about secret recipes and regional variations is great for marketing. What matters is that, over the years, Kwon decided to add a couple of tables to her shop, allowing for some food to be eaten on site. Finally, last year, she reversed the business. There are a few shelves stacked with shrink-wrapped disposable bowls of instant noodles and bottles of obvious condiments. The rest of this tiny end-of-terrace corner shop is filled with tables, including the one I manage to bag just before 7pm on a Tuesday night. It is by far the worst table for two I have ever had the pleasure of lunging for. It is right by the door; every time it opens the person sitting next to it has to lean in to provide clearance, and then, of course, they get a burst of cold air. It is flat on to the window, so the two of you have to sit side by side. You look out on to a quasi-industrial cul de sac. It is literally a view of a road to nowhere. If you are not a tiny person it is uncomfortable. I am not a tiny person. This sort of restaurant has a noble place in the heart of a certain kind of menu chaser. The more uncomfortable the experience, the better it is deemed to be. Of course, darling, you’re crammed in so close together you can identify your neighbour’s brand of deodorant, but the dumplings are delicious. Yes, you have to stand all the way through, but the bone marrow pie is sublime. Naturally, they lock you in a dungeon and feed you gazpacho down a straw dangled through an iron grate, but trust me, it’s worth it. I try not to buy into all this, but in the face of the food at Seoul Kimchi I am helpless. Yes, it’s uncomfortable, but it’s worth it. This is cheap, gutsy Korean soul food, which will curl your hair with a faint sheen of sweat if you order properly and help the world to settle firmly on its axis. There are, naturally enough, bowls of kimchi and shredded, vinegared cucumber to pick at while you study a menu of pure laminate. Half that menu is Japanese dishes, a frenetic list of katsus and teriyakis alongside sushis and sashimis. I am a demanding soul. I only order raw fish dishes from people who mean it. We ignore the entire Japanese offering. Instead we start with jeon, a thick savoury Korean pancake, as crisp and lacy as a deep-fried doily, but soft and dense inside. Our version is filled with strands of squid and prawn, but like so much here can be made with chicken, beef, pork or vegetables. It’s one of those items that demands to be eaten within seconds of coming off the griddle. Rip off pieces with your fingers then pull them through the dish of sweetened soy. All you need now is beer. Slight problem. Seoul Kimchi is unlicensed. No matter: there’s a Tesco Express next door, doing a tidy line in Estrella beer. The corkage cost is minimal. Ask the waitress nicely and she’ll find you a bottle opener. The increasingly popular Korean fried chicken comes here in round, boneless pieces. It lacks the echoing crunch of that made from whole bird, but makes up for it in dollops of a sweet and salty, hot and fiery sauce full of the fermented red chilli paste gochujang, the addictive culinary opioid at the heart of Korean food. We have a cast iron plate of galbi, Korean beef ribs sawn in thin strips through the bone. The meat is soy-marinated and deeply savoury, and rips pleasingly from the hard oval of rib in the middle. Another superheated cast iron dish brings curls of pork and squid, blackened in places, rust brown in others, as more of the gochujang starts to crisp up. Underneath, caramelising in the extreme heat, are tangles of sweet, golden onion. All of these dishes cost around £8. The enduring heat-transfer powers of a cast-iron cauldron play their part in a bibimbap – a rice bowl – of ground beef, the bed of rice starting to crisp up at the bottom. I mix in the raw egg, which starts to cook, and the beef, the chilli sauce and the spring onions. It is one of the single most satisfying items of comfort food available. It soothes you. It jolts you awake. Then it soothes again. Most of the main dishes come with portions of sticky, fluffy rice. If you choose a bibimbap you should ask them to hold a couple of those back or your table will quickly overfill with sad, unwanted side dishes. Against all this a slightly terrifying looking bowl of spicy seafood soup, bubbling orange and red, slicks of chilli oil shimmering on the surface, doesn’t quite hold its own. But it is, I think, a matter of context. On the right sort of cold, damp day of the type Manchester excels in, the soup would feel like something that should be offered on prescription. We finish our beers and pay our modest bill, for there is no dessert on offer here; Tesco will probably flog you an emergency eclair if you’re desperate. In the current political climate I imagine I’m meant to make some wisecrack about Kim Jong-un and nuclear war. But I don’t want to. Instead when I now think of Korea, I’m going to think of Seoul Kimchi. Jay’s news bites Like Seoul Kimchi, Little Korea at the western end of London’s Lisle Street, in Chinatown, has a Japanese menu. Ignore it. Come instead for all the Korean staples. The range of bibimbaps are particularly good, but I go for their exemplary Korean fried chicken, a cacophony of crunch and sweet and fire.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said this was the second time in two-and-a-half years that it had taken enforcement action against estate agents, and this latest case raised concerns that the sector “does not properly understand the seriousness of anti-competitive conduct and the consequences of breaking competition law”. The six estate agents, all based in the Burnham-on-Sea area of Somerset, had a meeting and agreed to fix their minimum commission rates at 1.5%, thereby denying local homeowners the chance of getting a better deal when selling their homes. Between them the agents dominated the local area: their market share was said to be potentially as high as 95%. The CMA said it was publishing full details of the case to remind other agents to comply with the law and avoid being fined. Penalties totalling £370,084 were imposed on five firms: Abbott and Frost Estate Agents Limited, Gary Berryman Estate Agents Ltd (and its ultimate parent company Warne Investments Limited), Greenslade Taylor Hunt, Saxons PS Limited, and West Coast Property Services (UK) Limited. The sixth, Annagram Estates Limited, trading as CJ Hole, has not been fined as it was the first to confess its involvement in the arrangement and cooperated with the investigation. The price-fixing cartel was formed in early 2014 when the estate agents met with each other to “have a chat about fees”. Email evidence showed that the agents’ rationale was “With a bit of talking and cooperation between us, we all win!”. The correspondence also explained how “the aim of the meeting … will be to drive the fee level up to 1.5%” and “… it’s really important we all give it the priority it deserves (making as much as profit as possible!)”. The estate agents took steps to ensure the minimum fee agreement was kept to by emailing each other when a specific issue arose, such as accusations of “cheating” on their agreement. Each business also took it in turn to “police” the cartel to make sure everyone was sticking to the agreement. However, in December 2015 the CMA carried out searches of the estate agent offices and seized documents and digital material. Stephen Blake, senior director of cartel enforcement, said: “Cartels are a form of cheating. They are typically carried out in secret to make you think you are getting a fair deal, even though the businesses involved are conspiring to keep prices high.” He added: “We have taken action against estate agents before and remain committed to tackling competition law issues in the sector.” In May 2015 the CMA ruled that three members of an association of estate and letting agents, the association itself, and a newspaper publisher infringed competition law. That case involved the advertising of fees in the area around Fleet in Hampshire, and resulted in penalties totalling more than £735,000 being imposed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/18/man-tried-murder-girl-deliberately-crashing-car-wiltshire-jury-told","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T14:07:11Z","webTitle":"Man tried to murder girl by deliberately crashing car in Wiltshire, jury told","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/18/man-tried-murder-girl-deliberately-crashing-car-wiltshire-jury-told","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/18/man-tried-murder-girl-deliberately-crashing-car-wiltshire-jury-told","fields":{"headline":"Man tried to murder girl by deliberately crashing car in Wiltshire, jury told","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A man attempted to murder a schoolgirl who was a passenger in his car by removing her seatbelt and deliberately crashing after discovering his wife had killed herself, a jury has heard. Lukasz Jarosz is accused of crashing his Skoda Superb hours after he had found the body of his wife, Aneta Jarosz, in their bathroom, Bournemouth crown court was told. The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was trapped in the car and had to be freed by firefighters. She sustained a broken leg in the crash at Wilton, near Salisbury in Wiltshire. Jarosz, 35, a restaurant worker, denies attempted murder but has admitted causing serious injury through dangerous driving. Kerry Maylin, prosecuting, said the defendant became “hysterical” after discovering his wife’s body. She said the couple had previously argued over a possible affair by the defendant with a colleague. Maylin said: “Lukasz Jarosz’s wife, Aneta Jarosz, had decided to end her own life. Jarosz found her body in the bathroom of their home in Wilton. Lukasz Jarosz had found her some time in the early afternoon on that Friday ... he laid her on the bed, attempted to perform CPR.” She said that later that afternoon he was driving with the girl who said he was “upset, crying and at times screaming”. Maylin told the court he would not allow the girl to leave the car and drove them “around in circles” for one hour and 25 minutes before the crash. The defendant talked of suicide and at one stage he took hold of the girl’s hands and locked the doors of the car, which also had his dog Daisy in it, the jury heard. Maylin told the court Jarosz was driving on the A36 in the direction of Salisbury when he came off at a junction for an industrial estate and drove at a railway bridge at an estimated speed of “no less than 40mph” in a zone with a 30mph speed limit. She said: “It was at that stage Mr Jarosz undid the seat belts of himself and (the schoolgirl).” The Skoda crashed into a van being driven by a man, Peter May, before striking the bridge and spinning to a stop causing severe damage to both vehicles, the court heard. She said witnesses saw Jarosz get out of the car and say: “My wife killed, my wife killed.” The prosecutor said the schoolgirl was trapped in the front passenger seat and had to be freed by rescuers after the incident on 6 January. Maylin told the jury: “However sad and tragic it may be, the prosecution will invite you in due course to consider that when he undid the seat belts of himself and [the girl], when he deliberately drove towards the railway bridge and struck Mr May’s van, that he intended to kill [her].” The trial continues.

Women’s Super League prepares for 2017-18 kick-off","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Women’s Super League starts a new chapter this weekend. Since its launch in 2011 the league has been played during the summer months, now it embarks on its maiden winter season. The gap created by the switch was filled by the Spring Series, a one-off mini-league that helped give game time to players before the summer’s European Championship finals. The WSL now has 20 teams competing across two leagues. BBC Online and BT Sport are broadcasting more games than ever before. Some of the best players in the world play in the English leagues. It’s an exciting time for women’s football. The WSL isn’t like the men’s top two tiers. The disparity between the top of WSL1 and bottom of WSL2 is a story of professionalism versus amateurism. It’s like the Premier League all the way down to below the National Leagues condensed. The concentration of resources at the top of the women’s game is a result of the uneven backing for women’s football by clubs. How this uneven development is combated, while still encouraging investment which grows the game, is a question nobody appears to have an answer to yet. What this situation has created is a set of tough leagues that teams fail to establish themselves in once promoted. Just look at Yeovil Town and Bristol City – first and second in WSL2 respectively, in the WSL1 Spring Series they struggled massively. Yeovil failed to win a game, Bristol City won once. Yeovil’s Kayleigh Green, speaking at the FA’s WSL launch, described their Spring Series outing as a “reality check”. Yet Yeovil and Bristol City are actually lucky. There are many arguments for and against the switch to a winter league, but one almost accidental upside to the move is that the placeholder Spring Series, which didn’t allow for relegation or promotion, gave these clubs a chance to experience their new league opponents before the real competition gets under way. It’s something the Bristol City captain, Millie Turner – recruited from Everton – was quick to praise: “Luckily, we were in the Spring Series. That was really good experience for us and we learned a lot of valuable lessons. Without it we would have gone into this new season very unprepared. “We did notice the jump between the leagues in our first Spring Series game. We didn’t have WSL1 experience and it was quite difficult for us to adapt to, the Spring Series was perfect for helping us test the waters having come up from WSL2.” The jump between WSL2 and WSL1 is marked by the obvious qualities gained from full-time professionalism. “It’s sharper, faster and a lot more physical,” says Turner. Green, who won WSL2 with Yeovil before heading for a loan spell in Italy as she made the unconventional switch from centre-back to centre-forward, agrees. “It was great we had the mini-league to test out the league’s quality. It helped us work out what we needed to work on as a squad, what the back-room staff needed to do and what needed to change. The standard is massive, you’re looking at full-time athletes against part-time athletes.” Highlighting just how far she is from the England and Manchester City captain, Steph Houghton, who she will be attempting to get past in their first game of the season, Green is back at college balancing her playing with a plumbing course. “When football ends, I’ll be a tradesperson,” she says. Yeovil and Bristol City are being joined in the top flight by Everton, who were handed a WSL1 berth after Notts County collapsed on the eve of the Spring Series. Everton won the WSL2 Spring Series and have embarked on a summer of bold recruitment, professionalisation and tough friendlies against teams such as Arsenal and Chelsea in order to strengthen their chances of staying up. The Everton defender Danielle Turner believes making the leap to professional status is crucial to their aim of competing at the top. “Going full-time was massive. It was the next step we needed to take having been a bit left behind in the past when other teams were going full-time. Now we’re training five or six days a week and you can see the benefits already.” The reality is all three sides will be relegation favourites and they will be trying to avoid the fate of Doncaster Rovers Belles who were relegated from WSL1 in the 2016 season with only three points from 16 games. The Wales and Doncaster defender Rhiannon Roberts is brutally honest about just how tough it is. “The difference between the two leagues is really big, it’s a big step up,” she says. “You’re playing against international players week in, week out in WSL1. It was disappointing for us when we got relegated last season but we’ve kept the core of our squad together, we’ve still got the majority of players full-time and we’re running it as a Super League 1 club. So everything off the pitch is built to help us get back up.” It’s not just moving to WSL1 from WSL2 that is challenging. Getting into the second tier and staying there is also hugely difficult for those coming up from the tier below, the Women’s Premier League. Promotion from the WPL to WSL2 was introduced only in 2015 and with Brighton and Tottenham making their first forays into the WSL second tier this time it is hoped their clubs’ long-term ambitions will see them survive. For Tottenham’s captain, Jenna Schillaci, the club is transformed from the one she joined 10 years ago. “When I first started we were training once-a-week down the local artificial pitch. Now, we’re at the men’s training ground three nights a week and have the full backing of the men’s club. It’s moved so quickly. We’re attractive now and attracting players that can compete in WSL2.” While they have dreams of reaching the top flight, they felt just how much further they have to go when brutally beaten 10-0 by Arsenal in the FA Cup last season. “When playing against Arsenal in the FA Cup we noticed just how massive the gap is. You have a team like Arsenal who are training five days a week and while we’re training three nights a week the gap will just get bigger,” says Schillaci, who has a full-time job for the London Playing Fields Foundation and says the Spurs side include teachers, students and a paramedic who “comes off a nightshift on Saturday and then comes to play on Sunday.” Brighton’s Vicky Ashton-Jones, who balances captaining the Seagulls with her job as a police officer in Kent, expected to find a gulf in class in the WSL2 Spring Series having won the WPL in 2015-16. “I was expecting a massive leap between the two leagues,” she admits. “It was big, but not as big a leap as I had thought, instead it’s a very consistent league. Every single team is very consistent.” Like Tottenham in WSL2 and Everton in WSL1, Brighton have been bold in their quest for WSL safety. The former England manager Hope Powell has been drafted in to lead the team in their maiden WSL2 season and the commitment from the club means Ashton-Jones can’t wait to get started. “Personally I’m very excited to have Hope Powell coming in and I know the girls are too. When the news came in the atmosphere, on the WhatsApp group for example, was buzzing. I was blown away, it is such a massive accomplishment for the club and gives us the best platform possible to succeed in WSL2. “I wouldn’t put us too far away from the likes of Man City in terms of the access we have to the men’s team facilities. Not many clubs can say that.” The acquisition of Powell alongside the impressive facilities the women have access to leaves Brighton in a strong position. How these teams will fair, whether they will buck the trend of promoted sides immediately getting relegated, remains to be seen. What we can be sure of is that the Spring Series gave many of them an invaluable practice run. Following their progress may be more exciting than the battles at the top.

They’re not the first football association to find themselves locked in battle with their national team over pay and conditions; the Republic of Ireland, Nigeria, Australia, Scotland and the United States have all found themselves forced to at least threaten action. High-profile solidarity for the team has come from US superstars Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan (two players that have joined Juan Mata’s Common Goal, pledging 1% of their salaries to charity). With the DBU refusing to budge, Tuesday’s World Cup 2019 qualifier was thrown into doubt, a last minute “partial agreement” was announced on Monday afternoon that will allow the match to go ahead. • In the US, the NWSL play-off finals have been scheduled following the confirmation that Portland Thorns and North Carolina Courage have secured the advantage of home semi-final slots. The semi-finals will be hosted by Portland Thorns FC on Saturday 7 October at Providence Park and by North Carolina Courage on Sunday 8 October at Sahlen’s Stadium with both matches kicking off at 3.30pm (ET). Orlando Pride, Chicago Red Stars and Seattle Reign are in the race to join them. Pride need one point and Chicago need two to secure their playoff berths. If either team fails to do so, Reign can leapfrog them with wins in their last two matches. • Fifa has announced the dates of the 2019 Women’s World Cup and 2018 Under-20 Women’s World Cup. The youth tournament will take place between 5 and 24 August next year, while the senior sides will battle it out in France between 7 June and 7 July in 2019. French double winners Lyon will host France’s opener and the final at their Parc Olympique Lyonnais stadium. Other games will be held in Paris, Nice, Montpellier, Rennes, Le Havre, Valenciennes, Reims, and Grenoble. • With the WSL transfer window now closed a number of players made moves before the new season. Most notable among the moves were Bethany England joining Liverpool on loan from Chelsea, where competition for places would have been tough. Another sees Lorca van de Putte switching to Bristol from the Danish league while Birmingham have signed Maddy Cusack from Aston Villa. The striker Courtney Sweetman-Kirk has joined Everton from Doncaster Rovers Belles, while the midfielder Georgia Evans has made the short hop to Yeovil from Bristol, and Chloe Melton has also joined having impressed in pre-season after a stint in the US at Minot State University. Watford have signed Bianca Bragg from the sadly collapsed Notts County.

The airline said on Twitter that “Between today and tomorrow all flight cancellations up and until OCT31 will be communicated.” Furious passengers had been swamping the airline with demands to know if their flight was among the 40 to 55 the airline said it would cancel every day over the next six weeks. Initially, Ryanair was making available only lists of cancelled flights up to this Wednesday, 20 September. Ryanair blamed rostering problems for the delays. “We have messed up in the planning of pilot holidays and we’re working hard to fix that,” it said on Facebook. There have been claims that Ryanair has been haemorrhaging pilots to rival airlines. Norwegian, which is building a new hub in Ryanair’s home airport, Dublin, said: “We can confirm that 140 pilots have joined Norwegian from Ryanair this year. Pilot recruitment is also under way for more pilots for our new Dublin base opening later this year.” Reports in the Irish media suggest Ryanair has begun offering pilots a €10,000 (£8,800) “signing-on bonus” to join. Shares in the airline fell by 3% in early trading, knocking more than £500m off its £18bn stock market valuation, although losses were pared back in later trading. The airline said it expected to face a compensation claims of up to €20m, while analysts at Dublin-based Goodbody Stockbrokers said the final bill was likely to be €34.5m (£30.4m) as they marked down Ryanair’s full-year profit forecast by 2.3%. The threat of cancellations sparked fury among passengers as millions were left in limbo, unsure whether their holidays would go ahead. Many expressed their disgust on Twitter over how Ryanair was handling the issue. One user said she feared for her wedding, with 30 Ryanair flights booked for her party, while others said that even if their outbound flight was not cancelled, they could not be sure if their inbound flight would be. Ryanair’s usually combative boss, Michael O’Leary, was widely mocked on social media for failing to speak, although the airline hurriedly arranged a press conference for later in the day. Investor groups said that while Ryanair usually brushes off poor publicity, in this case it could damage the airline. “Ryanair is notorious for not caring about what sort of headlines they get, working on the basis that all publicity is good publicity – but not this time,” said Rebecca O’Keefe of Interactive Investor. “Previously, the carrier was happy to suggest that you get what you pay for and despite negative press lots of flyers embraced the fact that they knew the score and were happy to fly without the frills. “However, the current situation is truly damaging, with flyers left high and dry with last-minute cancellations or apprehensive that they might be affected.” O’Keefe said it was unclear whether the delays were caused by poor planning or a shortage of pilots. “If the former, then it suggests some truly poor processes. If the latter, then we may see wages rise to fill the gaps. Either way, it’s not good news for Ryanair.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/18/liars-boris-johnson-sean-spicer-emmys","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T14:25:08Z","webTitle":"Don’t laugh at liars like Boris Johnson and Sean Spicer.

Trump lies as he breathes, bombarding us with untruth upon untruth until we stumble in disbelief. This is all part of what we call fake news, but fake news is enabled by two things: individuals who lie and an equivocating media culture that is cautious about calling certain people liars. Thus we have Boris Johnson – a known liar, somehow still considered a possible prime minister – doing what exactly? “Misleading” us? Though the evidence is presented to show that his figure of £350m a week that will come back to us once we leave the EU is false, no one wants to quite say that his claims are a deliberate lie. That this sum would go to the NHS was the leavers’ magic promise, emblazoned on the side of a campaign bus. It was, we are required to say, not a downright lie but a distortion. David Norgrove, head of the UK Statistics Authority, said it was “a clear misuse of official statisitics”. So this figure is in dispute. Maybe we can call it “an inverted pyramid of piffle”, as Johnson once said when lying about a four-year affair that he denied. Johnson was sacked by Michael Howard for lying. As a journalist he was known for “embroidering” stories. He was sacked from the Times for lying. Making up quotes. Or, as he explained it to Eddie Mair: “I mildly sandpapered something somebody said.” Still, he has risen to the top because this lying (he backs Theresa May, and I am a straight banana) is all part of his chaotic and colourful life. The media stand by, seemingly afraid to confront his lies with evidence. The £350m claim is a lie and even if he is half as clever as his mates say he is, he knows it. But why wouldn’t he lie? So far he has reaped significant rewards for it. His appalling behaviour is consequence-free. Indeed, he can now look across the Atlantic and see that lying is not a bar to power but an attribute of it. The hapless Sean Spicer, Trump’s former spokesman, who lied not just about the crowds at his boss’s inauguration, but about the Holocaust, turned up at the Emmys. Hilarious, right? At least he can laugh at himself! He lied for money and those who encourage others to laugh at him invite him right back into the inner circle. Satire is not dead, it is merely comatose because it no longer has anything to tell other than a vague truth (that Trump is stupid). Nor does it have any idea who it is telling it to – people who already think Trump is an idiot? To watch the rehabilitation of these liars is galling, but it happens with media consent. It is a disgusting spectacle. If we stop demanding truth or even the semblance of it, we bypass any possibility of integrity in the name of entertainment. We shrug off the very notion that there can be anything other than fake news. Boris Johnson is in the business of creating fake news. It is his modus operandi, as it was Sean Spicer’s. One of these men will do a round of chat shows and write some god-awful memoir signifying nothing. The other is spoken of still as a possible prime minister. This is frankly unbelievable. The lies that we know these men have told are not funny, or bombast, or “sand-papering” or “truth–stretching”, or mere quirks of character or ego. They cannot be normalised by showbiz or fellow politicians. Their lies are a violation of decency. Call them out every time. • Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/26/richard-florida-new-urban-crisis-review-flawed-elitist-ideas","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T08:00:37Z","webTitle":"The New Urban Crisis by Richard Florida review – ‘flawed and elitist ideas’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/26/richard-florida-new-urban-crisis-review-flawed-elitist-ideas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/26/richard-florida-new-urban-crisis-review-flawed-elitist-ideas","fields":{"headline":"The New Urban Crisis by Richard Florida review – ‘flawed and elitist ideas’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"There is something quite shocking about seeing a new contemporary map of London in which the rich areas are labelled “primarily creative class” and the poorer parts “primarily service class”. But this is how the American writer and Toronto University professor Richard Florida portrays cities and sees people. There are those who create and those who serve them. The book opens with its author recounting what his taxi driver told him on the way in from the airport about all the empty luxury flats in London. This feeds into his theory that the “new urban crisis” is about inequality and house prices, and would apparently be solved if only they could both be reduced a little. However, ending the real crisis might not be that simple. Presumably the taxi driver was “service class” and Florida, who describes himself as “one of the world’s leading urbanists”, is a “creative”, but is what he is creating useful or harmful? Just above his map of London in the book, he claims that “surprisingly, there is not a single tract in London where the working class makes up a plurality of residents…” That claim is wrong, of course, but so are many of the ideas in this flawed book. People can be divided into social classes: we have been doing it with census data since 1911. But they cannot be easily divided into those who are creative and those who are not. Surely, we are all creative to some extent. Similarly, while it’s true that whole neighbourhoods are no longer saturated by one social group or another, working class people still predominate almost everywhere – especially in London where the large majority of people are struggling in some way to get by, pay the rent, the mortgage, maintain their jobs and bring up their children. Whether they work in the creative or service sector is beside the point. Yes, inequality and housing prices have risen; but this is partly because people in the US and, to a lesser extent, in the UK were fooled into believing that some people were worth far more than others and that housing in some cities was worth more than it really is. This has led in the last few decades to pay in the US and UK rising faster at the top than at the bottom. The New Urban Crisis doesn’t look far beyond the US and UK. If it did, Florida would see that cities are more affordable and function better in countries where people respect each other more. Japan, for example, which is hardly mentioned, or the more equitable countries of northern Europe, or Canada. So what does Florida suggest we do about rising inequality and rising house prices? The answer is very little, apparently. After concentrating on the travails of London, Florida ends the preface to the UK edition of his book by claiming: “Our great urban centres can no longer look to national governments for top-down solutions.” His claim is that city mayors are the solution. However, he fails to understand how limited the power of the London mayor is and how unfeasible it is to take ideas from the US infrastructure and try to impose them on the UK. The US has many massive cities. We only have one. Later, he claims not only that no prime minister, president, or national politician in all of the US, the UK or Europe has ever talked “thoughtfully” about cities and urban policy but that none has the will or the power to do anything about it. That is quite some claim, and like many in the book it is both unsubstantiated and unbelievable. Bernie Sanders, for one, made urban planning a central plank of his campaign last year, criticising the “ugliness , the greed and the recklessness we have seen [in American cities] from Donald Trump and Carl Icahn”. And the idea that the British government could not help solve London’s problems is laughable. No other body has the power to introduce rent regulation, to ensure that private landlords pay their taxes (huge numbers avoid it), to ensure that schools and hospitals are properly funded, that walking, cycling and public transport are encouraged, that the air is made cleaner, and so on and on. Florida says very little about public services. Neither schools nor hospitals appear in the index and public investment is covered in just five pages out of the 320. Florida repeats many old myths, for instance suggesting that New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Boston – although all being highly segregated and unequal – offer greater avenues for upward mobility for the poor. They don’t. By some measures, social mobility is lower in the US than in any other affluent country in the world. The words at the top of the book’s front cover read: “deserves to stand alongside Piketty’s Capital … Essential”. In a way this is true. Florida’s book is an example of the kind of thinking that got us into this mess in the first place. Understanding that thinking is an important part of starting to realise that we cannot go on like this. Danny Dorling is Halford Mackinder professor of human geography at Oxford University.

The audience may think the same of Sam Holcroft’s knowing comedy as it layers on family dysfunction like icing on a Christmas cake. The evening begins in Ayckbourn mode, turns into something more vicious and becomes an all-out farce where the food flies and it is not only the turkey that gets stuffed. Holcroft’s play, which was first seen at the National in 2015 and is getting its regional premiere under the guiding hand of director Simon Godwin, is an odd beast. It revels in the conventions of traditional domestic comedy, but then ups the ante ingeniously by playfully showing us the rules by which each of the characters live and their destructive patterns of behaviour. So, when Matthew tells a lie, he must sit down. When Adam wants to mock (which he does, all the time), he must affect a silly accent. Edith must clean to stay calm and Matthew’s girlfriend, Carrie, must make a spectacle of herself until she gets a laugh. The device certainly ensures some laughs, but it becomes wearying and the rules the writer has imposed upon herself sometimes look in danger of sinking the play. The characters and their quirks too often seem set up to deliver comedy, rather than reveal any truths. They are stock characters: the emotionally blackmailing matriarch; the sons who could not live up to their bullying father’s expectations; the girlfriend who wants a wedding ring; the wife who despises her husband and has become obsessed with her teenage daughter’s health. It is hard to like them and even harder to feel for them or see them as mirroring our own neurotic behaviours. There are implausibilities, too – trains running on Christmas Day? – and Holcroft withholds information to suit herself, rather than the audience. But there are a few comic moments that are such crackers that it doesn’t feel too odd to be celebrating Christmas in September. At Royal &amp; Derngate, Northampton, until 30 September.

By that point, the Köln sporting director had already been on the Signal Iduna Park pitch, shoulder to shoulder with the coach, Peter Stöger, protesting to the referee, Patrick Ittrich, over the award by VAR of Borussia Dortmund’s second goal. Before any more fingers start pointing at Effzee about an anarchic end to a chaotic week, we should add that this was a reasonable moment for both men to approach Ittrich. Sokratis Papastathopoulos’s belatedly given strike, which made it 2-0, was the last act of the first half before the players made their way off and Köln’s officials made the most of the moment to get their point across. From the moment Ittrich originally whistled to rule out Sokratis’ effort, much to the Greek defender’s incredulity, the incident had VAR written all over it. Sokratis had been penalised for pushing the goalkeeper Timo Horn before pushing the ball into the empty net but it had been quite clear this was just Horn dropping a clanger – or being put off by a gentle nudge of the shoulder from his own defender, Dominique Heintz, if we’re being generous. An open and shut case? It certainly seemed so, with Ittrich awarding the goal quickly enough after the video assistant referee Felix Brych saw the images. There was just one problem. Ittrich had blown his whistle just before Sokratis’ shot crossed the line. The Cologne newspaper Express, which suggested Brych had been overzealous, wrote on Monday that the DFB “has only one option”. To play the game again, in other words, which is exactly what Schmadtke has demanded. There have been parallels elsewhere in Europe. Last month, Genoa were awarded a penalty against Juventus, even though their striker Andrej Galabinov was offside before he was fouled by the Juve defender Daniele Rugani. That led to Juve going 2-0 down, although they eventually came back to win 4-2. This, according to Express, had “a direct influence on the outcome of the game”. Schmadtke told reporters after that he felt Köln had “good chances” of their appeal being granted, although they were getting short shrift from their hosts. “If they want to protest,” said Dortmund’s sporting director Michael Zorc, “they should. But that’s almost ridiculous.” The Dortmund CEO, Hans-Joachim Watzke, told Sky the decision was “completely correct. Whether or not the ball was 20cm in front of the line … that’s totally ridiculous.” Stöger, who had been a candidate for the Dortmund job in the summer after Thomas Tuchel was fired, was a little less forceful. “I’m an advocate of video,” he said, “but here it was misinterpreted and I’d like it to be clarified for the future.” He makes a good point; the system is still experimental and perhaps the video referee has their hands tied in only being able to adjudicate on a single aspect of the play for which the decision was referred. At least Stöger had the decency to be a little contrite in light of the reality his team were terrible – and a technicality over a goal being allowed or not doesn’t change that. “After a 5-0, you wash your mouth out and try to do better next time,” Watzke added and the Köln coach will be under no illusions. Much has been made of the void left by Anthony Modeste’s departure, and that spectacular strike by his de facto replacement Jhon Córdoba in London will do nothing to change that. Köln were toothless again – they didn’t get a shot on target until the 75th minute and have scored only once this season in a worst-ever start – but it was their defence who must cause the most concern. No other Bundesliga team has come close to conceding as many as their 12 goals from the first four games. Stöger’s team only conceded 42 in the whole of last season, the league’s sixth-best defensive record. Whether Frederik Sörensen, well below his best form this season, was rested after Europe or dropped is one thing, but giving the 20-year-old Jorge Meré a debut always seemed like a hospital pass. Even with the habitual list of injuries and Christian Pulisic left on the bench, Dortmund were rampant, with the excellent Andriy Yarmolenko making the opener for Maximilian Philipp – his first goal for the club – in the second minute. Had the leaders not wound down considerably in the last 20 minutes, it could have been much worse. After last season’s achievements, Stöger deserves time – but as the level of support in London indicated, this is a club whose size should not be overlooked and difficult situations have spun out of control in the past, most notably during Ståle Solbakken’s spell in charge. Overachieving teams are often knocked off kilter by a surprise European qualification and Bundesliga points are needed quickly to avoid the trap. This week’s game against fellow strugglers Eintracht Frankfurt – who have only scored twice themselves this season – is already crucial. Talking points • Good vibes, at last, at the Allianz Arena, where Bayern Munich swept aside Mainz 4-0. Just as with the damp squib of the Champions League win over Anderlecht, though, it was about the journey, rather than the destination. The two results may have been similar but the performances – and henceforth the atmospheres – were night and day. Maybe that Franck Ribéry shirt-throwing strop did set the tone for a greater intensity. It was notable that after Arjen Robben’s goal the Dutchman took a detour to the touchline for a hug with Ribéry. “I’m proud to have played for eight years with Franck at Bayern,” Robben said afterwards. “There was a lot of trouble after [the shirt-throwing] but we need a Ribéry to win titles.” They need Robert Lewandowski, too, who celebrated a century of Bundesliga games for the club by scoring goals 81 and 82 in that time – hours after the Spanish newspaper AS wrote he had instructed his agent to broker a move to Real Madrid for the summer of 2018. • Chadrac Akolo’s second goal in a week gave Stuttgart victory against Wolfsburg, but the game was totally overshadowed by a horrendous late injury to the captain, Christian Gentner, who was hit in the face by the knee of the visiting goalkeeper Koen Casteels as he flew out to clear the ball. Casteels was quick to signal for help in an alarming scene, which ended with Gentner requiring surgery on a broken nose, eye socket and jaw. The Stuttgart coach, Hannes Wolf, said he had been “very afraid that there would be lasting damage” and it would be a surprise to see Gentner playing again this side of Christmas. On the football side, Wolfsburg again looked awful – and fired their coach, Andries Jonker, on Monday morning after only 19 games in charge. They are back to their normal selves, then, pre-the stability of the Hecking-Allofs era, and face Werder Bremen on Tuesday before going to Bayern on Friday. Jonker’s replacement is the former Mainz coach Martin Schmidt. • There was also a nasty injury – although not quite on the same level – at the Weserstadion, where Werder Bremen continued winless, against Schalke, as their striker Max Kruse landed awkwardly after a bad foul by Thilo Kehrer and will be kept out for a number of weeks by the resulting dislocated collarbone. On the other side, Amine Harit was lucky to escape with a scrape from a dreadful, above-the-knee challenge by Florian Kainz, for which the latter escaped sanction. Perhaps equally painful was Alexander Nouri’s side shooting themselves in the foot, with Milos Veljkovic’s ludicrous own goal gifting the visitors an equaliser before Leon Goretzka – who Die Königsblauen are ready to offer a new deal on a whopping €10m per year, according to Monday’s Kicker – poked in a late winner. Schalke, who welcomed back Breel Embolo as a late substitute after 11 months out, host Bayern in the Englische Woche’s standout. • Welcome back Bayer Leverkusen, we’ve missed you. After a flat start to the season put pressure on their newly appointed coach, Heiko Herrlich, this was more like it against Freiburg – a 4-0 win, with an especially stylish first-half display yielding three of those goals and a mini-goal of the week competition between Kevin Volland and Charles Aránguiz, who both scored belters from range. “They were just too strong for us,” the Freiburg manager, Christian Streich, said.. The swagger with which Leverkusen played was not unconnected to the sense of leadership in the team, with the twins Sven and Lars Bender starting on the same side for the first time since they did so with 1860, back in 2009. • Leipzig discovered the difficulty of getting up again after a Champions League fixture for the first time as they welcomed a highly motivated Borussia Mönchengladbach on the back of their competition debut against Monaco. Ralph Hasenhüttl was back in his familiar tracksuit but less characteristically, Die Roten Bullen let a lead slip twice in a 2-2 draw. One wondered if an alternative to the habitual aggressive press might have been an idea as they tired, with Naby Keïta also shown a red card in the latter stages for a very high boot into the face of Christoph Kramer. • There was some history in Hoffenheim, where Sandro Wagner’s opener, scored at 1.36pm local time, was the earliest goal in Bundesliga history, a by-product of the all-new Sunday 1.30pm kick-offs. They are now unbeaten in 20 home Bundesliga games, despite Alexander Esswein’s deft header earning Hertha a point. • Elsewhere, Augsburg netted a second straight win, with Caiuby’s cracker making the difference at Eintracht, and Hannover continue to defy both logic and the anti-Martin Kind protesters – who were out in force again at the HDI Arena as they beat Hamburg 2-0 on Friday, with Martin Harnik scoring another. Results: Hannover 2-0 Hamburg, Eintracht Frankfurt 1-2 Augsburg, Bayern Munich 4-0 Mainz, Werder Bremen 1-2 Schalke, Stuttgart 1-0 Wolfsburg, RB Leipzig 2-2 Borussia Mönchengladbach, Hoffenheim 1-1 Hertha Berlin, Bayer Leverkusen 4-0 Freiburg, Borussia Dortmund 5-0 Köln."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"science/2017/sep/18/margaret-turner-warwick-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T11:50:23Z","webTitle":"Dame Margaret Turner-Warwick obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/sep/18/margaret-turner-warwick-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/sep/18/margaret-turner-warwick-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Dame Margaret Turner-Warwick obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When Margaret Turner-Warwick, who has died aged 92, entered the field of respiratory medicine in the 1950s, it was a time of great change. Effective treatment for tuberculosis had recently been introduced, and the adverse effects of cigarette smoking on the lung were beginning to be appreciated. The focus of academic research had been limited to understanding and measuring lung function, but with her colleagues Jack Pepys and Deborah Doniach, Margaret expanded it to include the immunology of the lung, and particularly of the fibrosing lung diseases. She showed that they were associated with autoimmune diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis and the severe form of lupus known as systemic lupus erythematosus, and she demonstrated the presence of relevant auto-antibodies in the blood. Anticipating modern “personalised medicine”, she distinguished between different patterns of fibrosing lung disease, to identify the minority of patients who would respond well to steroids and the majority who would not, and for whom modern biological treatments are now being introduced. Similarly, in her other major area of interest, asthma, she recognised different clinical patterns, based on differences in the patterns of peak flow records – rates of forceful exhalation – requiring different treatments. She was also responsible for several early clinical trials, most notably with inhaled corticosteroids, that have formed the mainstay of modern treatment. Her recognition of the importance of immunological mechanisms in lung disease led to the publication of many research papers and of her book Immunology of the Lung (1978). Margaret combined a formidable scientific intellect with the humanity of an exceptional physician, and played a fundamental role in the development of modern respiratory medicine. Born in London, she was the daughter of William Harvey Moore, QC, and his wife, Maud (nee Baden-Powell). She decided on a career in medicine from an early age, and in 1943 went from St Paul’s girls’ school, west London, on an open scholarship to Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, one of a quota of 7% of female medical students admitted to the university in her year. After completing her clinical training and early posts at University College and Brompton hospitals in London, in 1961 she was appointed a consultant physician at Elizabeth Garrett Anderson hospital, and six years later to a part-time consultant post at Brompton and London Chest hospitals and a senior lecturership at the Institute of Diseases of the Chest. When, in 1972, she became professor of medicine (thoracic medicine) at what had now become the Cardiothoracic Institute, University of London, she was, with Sheila Sherlock at the Royal Free hospital, one of only two female professors of medicine in London. She served as dean of the institute (1984-87), which is now part of the faculty of medicine of Imperial College London, and in 1991 was made a dame. Margaret’s understanding of patients’ concerns was informed by her own time as a patient. During her final year at Oxford in 1946, before the advent of effective antibiotic treatment, she was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis and treated for a year in a TB sanatorium. The year she spent there brought her into close contact with fellow patients, whose hopes and fears she came to understand. Her growing reputation as a physician led to patients with uncommon and, on occasion, unrecognised respiratory diseases being referred to her from throughout the UK. Physicians from around the world visited Brompton hospital to learn from her clinical insights and experience and she was invited to lecture widely in the UK and abroad, particularly in the US and Australia. She recognised that the future sustainability of respiratory medicine, which she described as a “Cinderella subject” when she started, depended on attracting academic clinicians into the speciality who would develop the sub-specialities to which she had contributed, such as asthma, fibrosing lung disease, cancer and occupational lung disease. From the mid-70s she recruited a number of talented clinicians to the Brompton hospital and scientists to the institute, insisting that communication between clinicians and scientists should flow in both directions – from “bed to bench” as well as from “bench to bed”. She believed strongly in partnership and collaboration, in academic work, between universities and hospitals, between academics and clinicians and between clinicians and hospital managers. During her period as professor she ensured a close and synergetic working relationship between the institute and the Brompton hospital, succeeding in persuading a reluctant University of London to appoint a joint chair, to reflect their shared mission. Margaret was notable for her great generosity, intellectually and personally. She gave many of her junior clinical staff ideas which formed the basis of publications, which provided a foundation for their future careers. She lent her home on the Dorset coast to colleagues and their families. Margaret combined her career with a very happy family life. In 1950 she married Richard Turner-Warwick, a surgeon who specialised in the reconstruction and functional restoration of the urinary tract, and they had two daughters, Lynne and Gillian. She took particular pride in Lynne and her granddaughter Tabitha following her into medicine. A keen artist, she painted watercolours, often of the Dorset coast, for her Christmas cards. Her period as the first female president of the Royal College of Physicians (RCP), from 1989 to 1992, coincided with the introduction by Kenneth Clarke as health secretary of the internal market into the NHS. Margaret was typically constructive. While not opposing the proposed reforms, she pointed out to the government her concerns about the implications for research and education and for continuity of clinical care. She persuaded her colleagues in other royal colleges that to be effective they had to present their views as a single voice: in 1996 the existing conference organisation was renamed the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges. After leaving the RCP Margaret served as chairman of the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital Trust (1992-95). She continued to play an active role in the life of Lady Margaret Hall and as a trustee of the Rayne Foundation, focusing on young people’s mental health, the arts as a tool for social change and improving the quality of life for carers and older people. Asked about how she had coped with a professional world dominated by men, Margaret said that being in a small minority at Oxford had taught her to take no notice. She nonetheless became a role model for the many women who entered medicine in the subsequent generation. She is survived by Richard, her daughters, four granddaughters and two grandsons, and four great-grandchildren. • Margaret Elizabeth Harvey Turner-Warwick, thoracic physician, born 19 November 1924; died 21 August 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/18/rellik-recap-episode-two-tv-that-will-only-get-more-warped-by-the-week","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T21:00:15Z","webTitle":"Rellik recap: episode two – TV that will only get more warped by the week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/18/rellik-recap-episode-two-tv-that-will-only-get-more-warped-by-the-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/18/rellik-recap-episode-two-tv-that-will-only-get-more-warped-by-the-week","fields":{"headline":"Rellik recap: episode two – TV that will only get more warped by the week","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"One side effect of telling a serial killer story backwards is that it can seem like things are getting better, at least in terms of crime statistics. In Rellik’s some-assembly-required opener, disfigured detective Gabriel (Richard Dormer) and his partner Shepard (Jodi Balfour) had seven bodies piled up. Episode two kicks off a whole 16 days earlier, so now – or, more accurately, then – there are only five horrific murders outstanding. That 16 days might seem rather a large leap, but it does land on another notably tumultuous 24-hour period for poor Gabriel as he crashes around chasing rickety leads while his personal life implodes. Shepard tries a different approach, pulling a sickie to smoke joints, listen to the Style Council and deal with some cryptic family business. Who wore it best? Let’s piece it together. Rewind Nightfall on an anonymous London highway, and Christine (Rosalind Eleazar) – the scarred suspect who last time seemed to enjoy telling Gabriel she had been diagnosed as a narcissist with “unfulfilled psychopathic ideation” – staggers along in thin clothes and bare feet. The juxtaposition of soothing tiki music with visuals that could come from a post-apocalyptic zombie movie seems like a brisk way to reacclimatise viewers to Rellik’s warped, funhouse-mirror worldview. After a frustrating time at work, Gabriel is surveilling his own house, where wife Lisa (Lark Winther) waits up. Rather than going home, he decides to call on Shepard, who is wearing a spectacular red dress that seems rather unsuited for slobbing round the house. After a brief heart-to-heart, the lovers tentatively reconnect. That’s when we reset to three hours and 45 minutes earlier. Gabriel barges into Christine’s housing estate flat and aggressively bundles her into his car. Is this really an arrest? As they drive around, Christine seems uniquely capable of pushing Gabriel’s buttons, taunting “waffle face” about his injuries until he purposefully veers into oncoming traffic for a frighteningly long time. Gabriel wants to know what was on psychiatrist Isaac Taylor’s laptop and, seemingly chastened, Christine opens up about her abusive father, how her mother decisively dealt with him and how Taylor had recorded all these revelations in their therapy sessions. It is a raw and upsetting performance from Eleazar – the sort of intense, extended scene you might expect near the climax of an episode rather than served up early, another side effect of Rellik’s unmoored timeline. If Gabriel is touched by Christine’s story, he hides it well, kicking her out to walk home in the twilight. Rewind almost eight hours earlier and Shepard, in that striking red outfit, is the only person at a cremation. Then she sells a gorgeous classic E-Type Jaguar to a baffled geezer for five grand. Elsewhere, Gabriel and the rest of the team pay a rather more official visit to Christine, recovering what seems to be Taylor’s laptop. Back at the station, Gabriel questions her about the theft but is constantly deflected by Christine, who implies he is persecuting her because of their shared scarring. With the interrogation a bust, Gabriel is summoned by Lisa for a discreet meeting where she shows him her morning post: blurry, black-and-white snaps of Gabriel and Shepard having sex in a park. “You can see your scorpion tattoo,” notes Lisa dryly. Is it blackmail? Intimidation? A prank? If you have a scorpion tattoo perhaps you’re always braced for a sting in the tail but when Gabriel returns to the station, there are fire engines outside. The camera tails him as he stomps up stairs and back to his desk through smoke and coughing co-workers to find that the evidence room – and Taylor’s laptop – has been barbecued. As the camera zooms in on keyboard letters shrivelling up under the intense heat we rewind to … … six-and-a-half hours earlier. Gabriel is talking to a therapist: under duress, it seems, although he does talk about how since he was attacked with acid he feels uncomfortable in his own skin. It is the most vulnerable we have seen the growly sleuth to date, and Dormer sells it to the hilt despite the prosthetics. Then we cut to Shepard, who has apparently called in sick but is just lounging on her bed smoking a joint with a friend. Her father, with whom she had a difficult relationship, has died and she seems to be looking forward to selling his beloved Jag for buttons. She also toys with her friend’s lighter just a little too long. Could she be a secret firebug? Spool back 11 hours and it’s the middle of the night, around 1.30am. Gabriel, in bed with Lisa, wakes up from a muddled nightmare and slips off to see Shepard. We learn their relationship has been on hold since he was attacked. “We can’t start this again, not after Hannah,” says Gabriel, ominously mentioning his teenage daughter, who we haven’t seen all episode. After Gabriel scurries away, Shepard calmly flips through those fateful al fresco sex pics and slides them into an envelope pre-addressed to Lisa. She obviously wants to destabilise Gabriel’s marriage, but is there a motive beyond reigniting their relationship? Meanwhile, Christine brazenly breaks into Taylor’s office and lifts his laptop while the alarm blares. Reviewing their sessions, she stops on one of her juicier segments: “I killed them, I burned them, their families will have to live with that uncertainty for the rest of the lives.” It seems like an explosive confession, although a final closeup on Christine’s unreadable face suggests there must be more to it than that. Press play So how does that all look forwards? Gabriel visits Shepard in the dead of night to end their affair, while Christine breaks into Taylor’s office to steal a laptop. The next day, Shepard pulls a sickie to bury her dad while Gabriel, on a CCTV tip-off, latches on to Christine as a suspect in the laptop theft and perhaps more. The cops recover the laptop, but then someone torches the evidence room. Gabriel, reeling from an intense therapy session and enraged by what seem like blackmail photos sent to his wife, essentially abducts Christine to try and force her to confess. She successfully misdirects him and, angry and drained, he seeks out Shepard for solace. Notes and observations • This week’s cop shop B-plot was an office romance between detective Jenny and receptionist Alex that – played forwards – began with him preparing to break it off and her revealing she was pregnant and somehow ended up with them being engaged. Are these asides welcome palate cleansers, or just a distraction? • So far Rellik has seemed relatively blooper-free, although a sharp-eyed commentator did point out that after seeing the cops enthusiastically bash in the door of last week’s head red herring Steven Mills his poor wife still seemed to have to unlock it when she returned later that night. Any glaring continuity clangers in episode two? • Christine doesn’t want to go back to the police station because “it smells of budget cuts”. Eleazar’s taunting performance is one of the most delicious in the show. • Who even gets a scorpion tattoo? Has Rellik found a groove to go with its gimmick? Is Christine too obvious a suspect to be the killer? What happened to the city boy with the Kingsman glasses?

Every time we wanted a meal, it involved pushing piles of paper and heaps of pencils out of the way so we could fit a plate on the table. With Lily and Megan now in their mid-20s, those days are long gone. Yet still I can’t find a space on the kitchen table. Whereas it used to be art work cluttering the surface, now it’s the essentials needed for Megan’s new vegan catering business. At the moment, she’s at the stage where she’s cooking for friends and family, experimenting with recipes, scribbling down measurements and timings in a book. The table is the repository for bulk-size packets of ingredients and bowls of finished products waiting to be tasted. She’s taking health and safety exams too, so there are also piles of paperwork. Orders of fold-up cardboard food boxes and wooden forks are packed up in bigger cardboard boxes, stacked high, ready for the day she’ll need them at her market stall. She’s going to rent a kitchen space when she gets going properly, but at the moment the hub of this nascent business is our kitchen. The oven hums all day. The dogs are banished. The other morning I came downstairs to find her excavating our fridge. She was hacking away at the overgrown ice, peeling away parsley fronds stuck to the back, washing and scrubbing, and shaking her head at the five pots of opened pesto jars. “This is so unhygienic,” she complained. “You’d never pass the food-hygiene test.” This from the girl who used to be perfectly happy to let the cat prowl around her plate at supper. My mother was a great cook, too, although she had an offputting way of saying, “Have some of this, it’s going off.” My standards of hygiene probably come from her. She believed we needed a healthy dose of germs to get our immune systems working properly. “Luckily, I’m not the one starting up a food business,” I retort. “Anyway, I like not knowing what’s lurking in the depths. It’s like a lucky dip every time I reach a hand inside.” A couple of hours later, the fridge is unrecognisable: gleaming, white, pristine. Of course, I am grateful. Until I realise that I can’t fit any of the household food in it, because Megan has crammed it full of spiralised salads and raw tarts. Megan has taken over cooking family suppers, and if I’m working from home, I get a salad delivered to my desk. I’m very lucky. She even does the clearing up. It feels a bit like being some starry, privileged person with a specialist chef on hand to cater for me. But there’s a lurking sense of loss – a bit like the limp carrots that used to gather at the back of the fridge – something sad and pale loitering in my soul. With Megan taking over my role at supper, I’m at a loose end just when I’m usually at my busiest. Much of my identity as a mother is bound up with being the nurturer, the person at the centre of the kitchen, bossing everyone around and giving out sustenance in the form of meals – symbols of love. It used to be my kitchen. Now it belongs to Megan; she’s the one in the apron with a wooden spoon in her hand glaring at interlopers and slapping away greedy fingers from dipping. As the cook, she’s also the one who gets the praise and compliments, while I’m demoted to stacking the dishwasher. I ask myself if I’m jealous. Not really, I decide with relief, just a little disoriented that I’m no longer at the centre of my own kitchen. I’m proud of her for organising herself and setting out to make a success of something she’s passionate about. Word is spreading and a couple of friends have ordered vegan birthday cakes from her. Delicious concoctions appear. I lean in for a closer look. “No touching!” she orders, batting my fingers away. “Fine.” I tell her. “I’m not eating anyway. I’m off to an exercise class. You’re cooking supper, aren’t you?” It’s a rhetorical question. I’m finding new benefits to giving up my kitchen to my daughter.

Genoa’s team administrator had warned us that he might not, telling reporters: “The day [my son] Pietro steps out at Marassi wearing a Genoa shirt I can go ahead and die, because it will mean that I have seen everything.” Nope, not even close. Pietro Pellegri would make his home debut in April, a three-minute cameo at the end of a defeat to Chievo. It was a beautiful moment: father and son stood side by side on the touchline at Marassi as the board went up announcing the latter’s introduction from the bench. They had worked together to make it possible. A lifelong fan of the Grifone, Marco shared his passion with Pietro from the start. The younger Pellegri likes to joke that he “grew up on bread and Genoa”. But at 16 years old he knew even then he still had more growing to do. And plenty more to show his dad yet. His first appearance for Genoa’s senior team had arrived months earlier, away at Torino in December 2016. At 15 years and 280 days, Pellegri was the joint-youngest player ever to feature in Serie A. It was on the final day of the season, though, that he truly captured the nation’s attention, threatening to ruin Francesco Totti’s retirement party with a first senior goal. As the new season rolled around, it was clear further opportunities lay ahead for Pellegri. Genoa had signed Gianluca Lapadula to lead their attack, but with Giovanni Simeone departing there was still a distinct lack of depth. This truth was quickly exposed after the new arrival picked up an injury in the club’s third game. With Lazio coming to Marassi on Sunday night, Ivan Juric attempted to redesign his team into a strikerless formation – deploying Adel Taarabt as a false nine. It was an experiment that lasted only 33 minutes. Already a goal down, and playing poorly enough to believe another would soon follow, Genoa needed a change. Juric sent Pellegri into the fray. You could hardly say this substitution turned the tide of the match, as Lazio continued to dominate. But it certainly made things a lot more interesting. In the 57th minute Pellegri raced into the box, seeking to get on the end of Taarabt’s through-ball. Instead he wound up profiting from some calamitous defending. Stefan De Vrij slid in to intercept but the ball pinged up from his boot on to the chest of team-mate Stefan Radu and then back into Pellegri’s path. Radu, tracking back desperately, then deflected the striker’s shot beyond Thomas Strakosha in goal. If that was a fortuitous first at the Marassi for Pellegri, then better was soon to follow. Lazio retook the lead through Ciro Immobile, only for the teenager to equalise a second time. Ervin Zukanovic’s cross from a deep position on the left was well placed, but not every player would have had the instincts, acceleration and decisiveness to sprint in behind De Vrij and slide home. That was still not enough to save Genoa from themselves. With a little less than 10 minutes to go, Santiago Gentiletti gave possession away cheaply in the middle of the park, allowing Immobile to race through and chip home Lazio’s third. The Italy striker has made quite some start to the season. This was his sixth goal in eight days. Pellegri still has a way to go to match that output. There are many, though, who believe he can get there yet. Already 6ft 3in tall and still growing, he names Zlatan Ibrahimovic as his idol, and there are surface-level similarities. Both are deceptively technical players, comfortable with their backs to goal as well as attacking the penalty box. Nobody is suggesting Pellegri is in Ibrahimovic’s class yet, but he was sought by the Swede’s current employers. Manchester United were reported to have made an approach to sign Pellegri in 2015 after seeing him lead Genoa to the final of a youth tournament the English club hosted. Even then, he was competing with kids from above his age group. United are said to have offered Pellegri’s father a well-paid job in England to make the move possible. Marco rejected. How could he ever agree to such a move without seeing his son play at the Marassi at least once? The big clubs, though, have not relented. Both Inter and Juventus made enquiries over the summer, and Milan now appear to be in pole position to sign him this January. Should we worry about this young talent getting ahead of himself, made into a star before he has truly even begun? Genoa’s president, Enrico Preziosi, was already billing Pellegri in January as the “next Messi”. Against such predictable and preposterous hyperbole, perhaps we can trust in the player’s own humility. “I’m realising a dream right now,” Pellegri said at full-time. “But I just go to training, work hard and keep my mouth shut.” The one moment that seemed to catch him out was being shown footage of his father in the dugout during the game. Marco Pellegri was wiping a tear from his eye, having just watched his son become the youngest player to score two goals in a Serie A match. Perhaps he hadn’t seen everything quite yet, after all. Talking points • After collecting a single point between them in the midweek Champions League round, last season’s top three won their matches this weekend by a combined 12-1 scoreline. The disparity has not gone unnoticed in Italy, where more than one Monday morning columnist has posed the question of why Juventus, Napoli and Roma only “look big in our own back garden”. Given that we’ve only had one round of group stage games so far, and given that the Bianconeri were in the final last year, it’s probably a little premature to get deep into that question. But it does feel as if the disparity between Serie A’s strongest clubs and the weakest is especially wide just now. We are four games into the season and Napoli already have a +13 goal difference, Juventus a +10 and Inter a +9. • Those three are the only teams left with a perfect record, by the way, after Sampdoria drew away to Torino. This was not a weekend short on special goals but I did enjoy Daniele Baselli’s across-the-box finish for the Granata’s first. • Speaking of goals, Paulo Dybala now has eight on his own in four league games. Oh, and he only played the last 36 minutes of one of those. His hat-trick against Sassuolo was wonderful from top to bottom but for me the first was the pick of the bunch: just casually swiped across his body first-time from the edge of the D. • There was a hat-trick for Dries Mertens, too, in Napoli’s 6-0 rout of Benevento. Admittedly, two of his came from the penalty spot – and if Maurizio Sarri had got his way then the second of those might have been taken by Marek Hamsik, a man who has looked in need of a confidence boost during the early part of the season. “I was wrong, though,” Sarri said afterwards. “I thought Hamsik was only one goal shy of Maradona’s record [of goals scored for the club]. They told me it’s still two or three, so it was right to feed the animal, Mertens, who always wants to score.” • One man denied a hat-trick this weekend, however, was Nikola Kalinic – who hit the post early, scored twice and then had a third goal wiped out by VAR in Milan’s 2-1 win over Udinese. He was ruled to have been offside for the latter, although the decision was so tight that it was surprising to see it overturned even with the help of multiple replays. Either way, it was positive for Milan to have him off the mark. André Silva had already grabbed a hat-trick in midweek against Austria Vienna, with the Rossoneri in both cases playing out of a 3-5-2. Any change that allows for a little less Fabio Borini is probably a good thing. • Last goal not to be missed from the weekend: João Pedro against Spal. Results: Crotone 0-2 Inter, Fiorentina 2-1 Bologna, Roma 3-0 Verona, Sassuolo 1-3 Juventus, Milan 2-1 Udinese, Napoli 6-0 Benevento, Spal 0-2 Cagliari, Torino 2-2 Sampdoria, Chievo 1-1 Atalanta, Genoa 2-3 Lazio."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2017/sep/18/oslo-review-1993-peace-talks-national-theatre","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T22:59:01Z","webTitle":"Oslo review – the political gets personal as tense peace talks are given epic sweep","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/18/oslo-review-1993-peace-talks-national-theatre","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/sep/18/oslo-review-1993-peace-talks-national-theatre","fields":{"headline":"Oslo review – the political gets personal as tense peace talks are given epic sweep","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"JT Rogers is an American dramatist fascinated by global issues. In The Overwhelming (2006), he dealt with the Rwandan genocide and in Blood and Gifts (2010) with western attitudes to Afghanistan. Now in this new Tony award-winning play, which shortly moves into the West End, he tackles a historic moment in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Even if, as Jonathan Freedland has pointed out, the play is a period piece, it is an engrossing reminder of a time when a negotiated settlement seemed a practical possibility. Like our own David Edgar, Rogers is a dramatist who delights in process: in showing how things happened as well as why. In this case he follows the success of a Norwegian sociologist, Terje Rød-Larsen, and his foreign ministry wife, Mona Juul, in creating back-channel meetings in 1993 between Israeli and Palestinian representatives. The meetings are clandestine, danger-fraught but cautiously productive. Eventually, however, Ahmed Qurei, finance minister for the PLO, demands to meet an opposite number of equal status and it is only when he is confronted by Uri Savir, deputy general of the Israeli foreign ministry, that the talks really take off. The result is a historic handshake between Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat in a ceremony at the White House. It may all have happened long ago, but Rogers successfully immerses us in the crises of the particular moment. Above all, he reminds of the validity of Larsen’s belief that the key to fruitful diplomacy lies in establishing human connections. Much of the action takes place in the drawing-room beyond the negotiating chamber, where official attitudes are relaxed, tempers occasionally fly but a Palestinian communist and an Israeli economist can join forces in rhapsodising over a Norwegian cook’s waffles. But Rogers also makes brutally clear the duplicity needed to bring the two sides together. At one point, Larsen lies through his teeth, and risks his wife’s future, by swearing to the Palestinians that he has an assurance that the Israelis will upgrade their delegation. This is a play where the drama lies in the detail. However there came a point, especially when the Israelis raised 200 questions as to what would happen if they ceded control of Jericho, when my head started to spin with information overload. Juul’s final query about whether she and her husband were right to act as they did also raises big issues I’d like to have heard fully debated. But, by re-creating the day-to-day toil and trauma of the Israeli-Palestinian meetings, Rogers asks whether gradualism achieves more in diplomacy than an unyielding totalism. Although Bartlett Sher’s production has an epic sweep, it rightly puts the emphasis on the individuals involved. Toby Stephens brings out the vanity and self-regard behind Larsen’s idealism, while Lydia Leonard as Juul seems a model of practical wisdom. Peter Polycarpou as Ahmed Qurei and Philip Arditti as Uri Savir brilliantly suggest men of sizeable ego and seeming intransigence who yet manage to achieve a genuine human connection and there is good support from Howard Ward as a raging Norwegian politician and Geraldine Alexander as a coveted cook. Time may have exposed the fragility of the 1993 accord but the play emerges as an instructive lesson about the primacy of the personal in global affairs. • At the National’s Lyttelton theatre, London, until 23 September.
